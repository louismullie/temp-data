## Question

A woman was employed as a sales clerk at a department store. She worked in the women's lingerie section. One evening around closing time, the woman took a diamond necklace from a cabinetin the jewelry section of the department store and wrapped it in tissue paper. The woman then surreptitiously stuffed the necklace in a shopping bag, intending to remove it when she left the store. Moments later, the store owner approached the woman and told her she needed to stay late in order to do inventory. While the woman was completing inventory, the owner discovered the necklace and called the police. The woman is most likely guilty of

Answer Choices:
A. attempted larceny.
B. larceny.
C. false pretenses.
D. embezzlement.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which criminal charge best fits the scenario where a sales clerk takes a necklace from the jewelry section, conceals it in a shopping bag with intent to leave the store, but is caught before she exits. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the elements of larceny and whether they are satisfied. Then, I should verify whether the act was completed or merely attempted. Next, I will consider whether embezzlement applies given her employee status. After that, I need to check whether false pretenses is relevant. Finally, I will reconcile any conflicting interpretations and select the most accurate charge with a clear rationale.

> Let me first confirm the elements of larceny. Larceny generally requires the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to permanently deprive the owner thereof. Here, the clerk took the necklace from the jewelry section, moved it into a shopping bag, and intended to keep it, which satisfies taking, asportation, and intent to deprive, so larceny is prima facie satisfied unless something interrupts the completion of the offense.

> Wait, let me verify whether the offense was completed or merely attempted. The key issue is whether the taking was complete before detection. Most jurisdictions treat the taking as complete when the defendant has gained dominion and control over the property with the intent to steal, even if the person has not yet left the premises; concealment in a bag with intent to remove it typically constitutes a completed taking, so this is larceny rather than attempted larceny, even though she was caught before exiting the store.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about embezzlement. Embezzlement applies when a person lawfully possesses property by virtue of a fiduciary relationship and then fraudulently converts it. Here, the clerk did not have lawful possession of the necklace; she had mere custody or access as an employee, and her taking was trespassory from the outset, so embezzlement does not fit the facts.

> I should confirm whether false pretenses is relevant. False pretenses requires obtaining title to property by means of a material misrepresentation with intent to defraud. The clerk did not obtain title to the necklace through any misrepresentation; she simply took it secretly, so false pretenses is not applicable here.

> Let me reconsider any ambiguity about attempt versus completion. Some might argue that because she had not left the store, the taking was incomplete; however, the better view — and the one adopted by most modern courts — is that the offense is complete once the actor exercises unauthorized control with the requisite intent, even if the item has not been removed from the premises, so this remains completed larceny rather than attempted larceny.

> Putting this together, the most accurate charge is larceny, because the clerk completed the trespassory taking and carrying away of the necklace with intent to permanently deprive, and neither embezzlement nor false pretenses matches the facts. Attempted larceny would only apply if the taking had not been completed, which is not the case here.

---

The woman is most likely guilty of **larceny** because she took possession of the necklace with intent to permanently deprive the store of it, and the crime was complete when she concealed it in her bag — even though she did not leave the store. This is not attempted larceny because the taking was complete, not embezzlement because she did not have lawful possession of the necklace, and not false pretenses because there was no deception involved.

---

## Analysis of the crime

### Elements of larceny

Larceny requires the following elements:

- **Taking and carrying away**: The defendant must take and carry away the personal property of another.
- **Intent to permanently deprive**: The defendant must intend to permanently deprive the owner of the property.
- **Without consent**: The taking must be without the owner's consent.

---

### Application to the facts

- **Taking and carrying away**: The woman took the necklace from the jewelry section and concealed it in her shopping bag, which constitutes taking and carrying away.
- **Intent to permanently deprive**: Her actions of concealing the necklace and intending to remove it from the store demonstrate intent to permanently deprive the store of the property.
- **Without consent**: There is no indication that the store owner consented to her taking the necklace.

---

### Completion of larceny

Larceny is complete when the defendant takes possession of the property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner, even if the defendant does not leave the premises. The woman completed the crime of larceny when she concealed the necklace in her bag with the intent to steal it, even though she was caught before leaving the store.

---

## Why other options are incorrect

- **Attempted larceny**: This would apply if the woman had not completed the act of taking possession with intent to steal. Here, she completed the taking, so attempted larceny is not applicable.
- **False pretenses**: This requires obtaining property through deception or false representation. There was no deception involved in this case.
- **Embezzlement**: This applies when a person entrusted with property fraudulently converts it to their own use. The woman was not entrusted with the necklace; she simply took it.

---

## Conclusion

The woman is most likely guilty of **larceny** because she took possession of the necklace with intent to permanently deprive the store of it, and the crime was complete when she concealed it in her bag.

### Committee opinion No 672: clinical challenges of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods [^eca1cd5a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists — recommendations for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) management specify that routine misoprostol before intrauterine device (IUD) insertion in nulliparous women is not recommended, although it may be considered with difficult insertions. When IUD strings are not visualized, pregnancy should be excluded and a backup method of contraception and emergency oral contraceptives (if appropriate) should be recommended until the IUD is confirmed to be properly located in the endometrial cavity. Management of the nonfundal IUD varies; an IUD located within the cervix is partially expelled and should be removed (and replaced if the patient desires), whereas if the woman is asymptomatic and the IUD is above the internal os, removal of the IUD is more likely to lead to pregnancy than IUD retention. If a woman becomes pregnant with an IUD in place, the IUD should be removed if strings are visible or if the IUD is within the cervix. Whenever an implant is not palpable, pregnancy should be excluded and the woman should be counseled to use a backup method of contraception until the presence of the implant is confirmed; emergency oral contraceptives, if appropriate, should be recommended. When the implant is not palpable, removal should not be attempted until implant location is determined.

### Perceptions of access to long-acting reversible contraception removal among women in Burkina Faso [^248997b6]. Contraception (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) initiation has been well-studied and intervened upon. Because LARC requires provider intervention for initiation and removal, it is critical to measure informed choice at the time of desired discontinuation as well. We examined perceptions of access to LARC discontinuation among women at two sites in Burkina Faso, where LARC is the dominant method in the contraceptive mix.

Study Design

We analyzed data from a 2017–2018 population-based, cross-sectional survey of 281 implant users and 55 intrauterine device users at two sites in Burkina Faso. We measured perceptions of access to LARC discontinuation through survey items assessing whether participants (1) were informed on how to discontinue the method, (2) believed they could have LARC removed without a lot of difficulty, (3) believed cost would be a barrier to discontinuation, (4) had ever attempted to have a provider remove LARC, and (5) successfully had LARC removed. The distribution of these measures was examined in the population and for differences by gravida, parity, domestic partnership, fertility desires, and recency of last childbirth.

Results

Thirty-eight (11%) of current LARC users reported that they were not informed on how to discontinue, 56 (17%) believed having their device removed would be difficult, and 54 (16%) believed cost would be a barrier to removal. Of women who attempted removal, providers did not immediately remove LARC on request for 10 (28%).

Conclusions

Findings indicate that LARC uptake is an insufficient measure of reproductive access or choice. Future studies should include patient-centered measures that span the full duration of contraceptive use.

Implications

This paper finds that a sizable proportion of LARC users lack information about method discontinuation and perceive or experience barriers to method removal. These findings call for a reconsideration of free and informed contraceptive choice to include the entire duration of contraceptive use, not only the time of method provision.

### Access to postabortion contraception: ACOG committee opinion, number 833 [^10d5bb9e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Postabortion contraception counseling and access — evidence and guidance include the following: In one study of 1,662 women provided with no-cost contraceptives immediately after abortion, 64.5% chose a long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) method and 35.5% chose short-acting methods; women who chose LARC were younger, more likely to live more than 70 miles from the clinic, and more likely to have a nonurban address, and even when cost and accessibility barriers were removed, 18.8% of patients declined any method of contraception. Contraceptive care can be improved by providing a full year's prescription for the pill, patch, or ring in advance when these methods are chosen, and by advance provision of emergency contraception; if available, providing free condoms is good practice. Clinicians should use shared decision-making to ascertain the patient's reproductive and contraceptive desires, and it is important to recognize that a patient's preference to delay conversations about contraception does not mean that contraception is not desired; some patients experience repeated attempts at contraceptive counseling as "implicit pressure" to accept a method and rates of discontinuation are higher in patients who feel pressured into accepting a method. This highlights the importance of immediate provision of contraceptive methods; referrals for other desired services; and, streamlined pathways to follow-up. In a survey of abortion care clinics, 98% of clinics offer at least one nonLARC method and 76% offer any LARC method. Ultimately, clinicians should focus on providing access to counseling and, ideally, providing all methods of contraception, while recognizing that each patient is unique; in addition, patient-centered counseling requires time and is often undercompensated — it should be paid at an adequate rate. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other clinicians should remain current in their knowledge of all methods of contraception, and logistical barriers should be minimized to improve patient access to chosen contraceptive methods after induced and spontaneous abortion.

### Long-acting reversible contraception in gender-diverse adolescents and young adults: outcomes from a multisite collaborative [^aee53ae1]. Contraception (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to describe the clinical experience of gender-diverse adolescents and young adults receiving long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).

Study Design

This was a secondary analysis of prospectively collected quality improvement data among gender-diverse adolescents and young adults receiving LARC in four adolescent medicine clinics.

Results

Most attempted insertions (59/63) were successful. A majority (54%) chose LARC for both contraception and menstrual management. Pelvic pain/cramping and unsatisfactory bleeding were reported side effects. One known expulsion and six known LARC removals occurred.

Conclusions

Gender-diverse adolescents and young adults had high rates of successful LARC insertion and demonstrated a side effect profile similar to a broader adolescent and young adult population seeking LARC care.

Implications

LARC is an important and well-tolerated method of menstrual management and contracention in gender-diverse adolescents and young adults, although more investigation is needed to understand how gender-affirming testosterone therapy may impact the LARC experience in this population.

### Committee opinion No 672: clinical challenges of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods [^83429832]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods — summary and recommendation: Long-acting reversible contraceptive methods are the most effective reversible contraceptives and have an excellent safety record, and although uncommon, possible LARC complications should be included in the informed consent process. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other gynecologic care providers should understand the diagnosis and management of common clinical challenges, and The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends the algorithms included in this document for management of the most common clinical challenges.

### Long-acting reversible contraception: specific issues for adolescents [^a1b9fadd]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) procedures and training in adolescents — The first attempt of IUD placement in nulliparous adolescents reveals success rates (96%) similar to their parous counterparts. Methods to improve pain and ease of insertion include preprocedure administration of misoprostol, NSAIDs, paracervical block by using lidocaine, and anxiolytic medication including nitrous oxide, but general review of current data do not support the routine use of these strategies during IUD placement. In special circumstances, IUD placement under sedation is appropriate, most commonly in adolescents with physical limitations or cognitive challenges, and can be combined with other procedures requiring sedation, such as dental care. Placement and removal of the subdermal implant requires a free in-person training session sponsored by the manufacturer of the product, and the contraceptive subdermal implant may only be ordered by a licensed physician after completion of the manufacturer-sponsored training, whereas IUD training is less formalized and insertion and removal of IUDs does not require the completion of a specific training program.

### Contraceptive procedures in internal medicine clinics and resident education: a qualitative study of implementation methods, barriers, and facilitators [^221da63f]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) such as intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants are highly effective and increasingly popular. Internal Medicine (IM) clinics and residency curricula do not routinely include LARCs, which can limit patient access to these methods. In response, internists are integrating LARCs into IM practices and residency training.

Objective

This study examines the approaches, facilitators, and barriers reported by IM faculty to incorporating LARCs into IM clinics and resident education.

Design

We interviewed faculty who were prior or current LARC providers and/or teachers in 15 IM departments nationally. Each had implemented or attempted to implement LARC training for residents in their IM practice. Semi-structured interviews were used.

Participants

Eligible participants were a convenience sample of clinicians identified as key informants at each institution.

Approach

We used inductive thematic coding analysis to identify themes in the transcribed interviews.

Key Results

Fourteen respondents currently offered LARCs in their clinic and 12 were teaching these procedures to residents. LARC integration into IM clinics occurred in 3 models: (1) a dedicated procedure or women's health clinic, (2) integration into existing IM clinical sessions, or (3) an interdisciplinary IM and family medicine or gynecology clinic. Balancing clinical and educational priorities was a common theme, with chosen LARC model(s) reflecting the desired priority balance at a given institution. Most programs incorporated a mix of educational modalities, with opportunities based upon resident interest and desired educational goals. Facilitators and barriers related to clinical (equipment, workflow), educational (curriculum, outcomes), or process considerations (procedural volume, credentialing). Participants reported that support from multiple stakeholders including patients, residents, leadership, and other departments was necessary for success.

Conclusion

The model for integration of LARCs into IM clinics and resident education depends upon the clinical resources, patient needs, stakeholder support, and educational goals of the program.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive care in the context of pandemic response [^5cd9124e]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

In-person contraceptive services during the pandemic — visits requiring in-person care: Telemedicine is not suitable for all contraceptive services. Schedule patients who desire an intrauterine device (IUD) or contraceptive implant for an in-person visit without delay, including in the context of high community transmission rates if another method is not available or acceptable; expedite appointments for IUD insertion for emergency contraception, and offer IUD or implant placement immediately after abortion, management of early pregnancy loss, or vaginal or cesarean delivery to reduce the need for additional in-person visits. For most patients, LARC removal requires an in-person visit; some patients with IUDs can be counseled about attempts at self-removal but this is not always successful, and we do not recommend self-removal of contraceptive implants, noting only case reports with no data on safety or efficacy and a possible lack of aseptic technique leading to infection. Patients who report a positive pregnancy test and vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain should have an immediate in-person visit with pelvic exam and serum labs with pelvic ultrasound if indicated, and this also applies to any patient who is pregnant with an IUD in situ. For suspected IUD expulsion or non-palpable implant, for asymptomatic patients prescribe EC if indicated and counsel on a different contraceptive method until an in-person visit is possible; severe symptoms require an immediate visit, while mild symptoms that are not bothersome can be delayed if there is no concern for pregnancy and if a patient is willing to use an alternate method or accepts the risk of contraceptive failure. For DMPA-IM, counsel patients about the subcutaneous (SC) formulation; for those continuing DMPA-IM, injections can be delayed up to 15 weeks. For patients needing these services, consider hybrid visits in which counseling and informed consent occur virtually and only the procedure occurs in the clinic; this decreases face-to-face time and thus viral exposure.

### Practice bulletin no. 186: long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^201891ed]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants, also called long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), are the most effective reversible contraceptive methods. The major advantage of LARC compared with other reversible contraceptive methods is that they do not require ongoing effort on the part of the patient for long-term and effective use. In addition, after the device is removed, the return of fertility is rapid (1, 2). The purpose of this Practice Bulletin is to provide information for appropriate patient selection and evidence-based recommendations for LARC initiation and management. The management of clinical challenges associated with LARC use is beyond the scope of this document and is addressed in Committee Opinion No. 672, Clinical Challenges of Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptive Methods (3).

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: extended use of long-acting reversible contraception [^c0cf8a3f]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Patient preference and counseling for extended LARC use — providers should discuss and review extended use of LARC devices with all patients. In certain situations, such as a global pandemic, national disasters, violence/war, or other type of public health crisis, in-person visits may be minimized or temporarily stopped, and the benefits of extending use of their LARC method may outweigh the risk of an in-person visit and/or may be preferable to patients in these situations; patient education on safe self-removal can also be discussed with patients. Patient autonomy and preference are important and valid reasons for offering extended LARC use (GRADE 1C).

### Three-year continuation of reversible contraception [^ce8cf1c5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this analysis was to estimate the 3-year continuation rates of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods and to compare these rates to non-LARC methods.

Study Design

The Contraceptive CHOICE Project (CHOICE) was a prospective cohort study that followed 9256 participants with telephone surveys at 3 and 6 months, then every 6 months for 2–3 years. We estimated 3-year continuation rates of baseline methods that were chosen at enrollment. The LARC methods include the 52-mg levonorgestrel intrauterine device; the copper intrauterine device, and the subdermal implant). These were then compared to rates to non-LARC hormonal methods (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, and vaginal ring). Eligibility criteria for this analysis included participants who started their baseline chosen method by the 3-month survey. Participants who discontinued their method to attempt conception were censored. We used a Cox proportional hazard model to adjust for confounding and to estimate the hazard ratio for risk of discontinuation.

Results

Our analytic sample consisted of 4708 CHOICE participants who met inclusion criteria. Three-year continuation rates were 69.8% for users of the levonorgestrel intrauterine device, 69.7% for copper intrauterine device users, and 56.2% for implant users. At 3 years, continuation was 67.2% among LARC users and 31.0% among non-LARC users (P < .001). After adjustment for age, race, education, socioeconomic status, parity, and history of sexually transmitted infection, the hazard ratio for risk of discontinuation was 3-fold higher among non-LARC method users than LARC users (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval, 2.80–3.39).

Conclusion

Three-year continuation of the 2 intrauterine devices approached 70%. Continuation of LARC methods was significantly higher than non-LARC methods.

### GRECCAR 14-a multicentric, randomized, phase II-III study evaluating the tailored management of locally advanced rectal carcinoma after a favourable response to induction chemotherapy: study protocol [^62ba378d]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) is becoming standard in patients with locally advanced rectal carcinoma (LARC). Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has proven side effects on bowel and genitourinary function. An early tumoral response to induction chemotherapy demonstrates its high prognostic value. Tailored management could be used as an alternative to systematic CRT. The GRECCAR 14 trial will attempt to personalize treatment strategy according to the patient's early tumour response to intensive chemotherapy with the aim of achieving the best toxicity-efficiency ratio.

Method

GRECCAR 14 is a multicentric, randomized, two-arm, phase II-III noninferiority trial. Patients with mid or low LARC with a predictive circumferential resection margin ≤ 2mm or T3c-d stage with extramural venous invasion will be included. Evaluation of the tumoral response will be performed after six courses of high-dose FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy. Good responders (GRs) will be defined by a 60% decrease in tumoral volume on magnetic resonance imaging. Patients will be randomized to CRT before surgery. The primary endpoints will be R0 resection for phase II and the 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) for phase III.

Results

Tailored management of LARC is becoming an exciting challenge for the modality of neoadjuvant treatment and for the type of surgery or its omission. Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX has established efficacy, with a significant increase in the 3-year DFS. Better control of systemic disease must be accompanied by the same locoregional control, with the lowest morbidity. Our previous GRECCAR 4 trial demonstrated the high value of the early tumoral response after induction chemotherapy and the long-term safety of tailored management for GRs.

Conclusion

If GRECCAR 14 demonstrates the ability to tailor TNT for LARC, this could lead to changes in clinical practice.

### Prognostic value of residual lymph node status in patients with pathological T0 rectal cancer after neoadjuvant therapy [^22bff1fe]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision is recommended as the standard therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The combination of radio- and immunotherapy has recently shown promise in its treatment.

After neoadjuvant therapy, approximately 20%–40% of patients with LARC achieve a pathologically complete response (pCR). The long-term oncological outcomes in patients with LARC who achieve a pCR after neoadjuvant CRT are excellent. Local excision has been attempted for the management of select patients with LARC who have achieved a good response to neoadjuvant CRT. If a pCR is achieved after neoadjuvant CRT and trans-anal excision, a "watch and wait" treatment strategy is adopted. There is a concern that the mesorectal lymph nodes remain unresected. Despite complete regression of the primary rectal wall tumor (yield pathologic T0, ypT0), residual lymph node metastasis has been reported in a few cases and is a possible cause of tumor relapse. Evidence indicates that remnant lymph node metastases after neoadjuvant CRT and surgery in patients with ypT0 rectal cancer indicate poor survival and are an important prognostic factor. – Previous studies have been hampered by two major limitations: (1) a small sample size, which may have undermined the statistical power and generalizability of the findings and (2) the focus on CRT, which potentially overlooks other neoadjuvant therapy regimens. The present study focuses on the incidence and long-term outcomes of lymph node metastasis in patients with ypT0 rectal cancer who had received different neoadjuvant treatments through a large-scale retrospective analysis.

### Abortion patients' perspectives on enhancing a telemedicine model of post-abortion contraception: a qualitative study [^75888894]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2025). High credibility.

Navigating access to post-abortion contraception

The reduced availability of contraceptive consultations, both within primary care and specialist SRH services, was emphasised by participants, widely attributed to the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK health services. Barriers to accessing contraception were particularly evident in the accounts of those attempting to access LARC methods, such as intrauterine devices (IUDs), prior to the current pregnancy (Quote #14). In contrast, some participants reported finding it 'easier' or being 'fast-tracked' for an appointment to fit LARC following abortion (Quote #15).

Participants who accepted the offer of receiving text messages offering a contraceptive consultation with a nurse, as part of the pilot programme for enhanced PAC consultations, emphasised the benefits. These messages served as reminders to further consider and access contraception (Quote #16). Continuity of care for contraception from the abortion service was highly valued and identified as a facilitator for contraceptive initiation. Maintaining a relationship with the same HCP was seen as offering benefits, including knowledge of their abortion, contributing to a sense of provider trust and personalised support (Quote #17). In addition, some preferred to remain under the care of community-based SRH services because they were viewed as 'experts' in contraception and adept at discussing sensitive issues around reproductive health. General practitioners were widely perceived as less experienced in contraceptive counselling and LARC fitting (Quote #18).

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendations: contraceptive care in the context of pandemic response [^623c5b60]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Requests for LARC removal and/or replacement — visit approach during the pandemic: Offer patients who desire LARC removal an in-person visit without delay. If COVID-19 community transmission rates are medium or high, counsel patients about the risk of exposure associated with an in-person visit but allow them to schedule such visits if they desire prompt LARC removal, while telemedicine is an option for other patients who desire LARC removal.

### From awareness to usage of long-acting reversible contraceptives: results of a large European survey [^6eb7c2d4]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Long‐acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) include the hormonal and copper intrauterine devices and the contraceptive implant. These methods are highly effective, with annual pregnancy rates of less than 1% for women using LARCs, compared with 9% for oral contraceptives and 18% for condoms. 1 This is mainly due to the fact that these methods are independent of user compliance. LARCs are recommended by multiple guidelines 2, 3, 4, 5; however, oral contraceptives and condoms remain the most popular methods of contraception in many countries. 6, 7 Worldwide, the percentage of women of reproductive age using LARCs is estimated to be less than 14%. 8 The prevalence of LARC usage in Europe, as for the rest of the world, varies by country, with estimates in 2019 ranging between 2.9% for Poland and 16.0% for France. 8 The relatively low prevalence of LARC use may contribute to the high global rate of unplanned pregnancies, which has been estimated at 85 million per year, or approximately 40% of all pregnancies. 9 A US study showed that half of unplanned pregnancies were attributed to imperfect contraceptive adherence. 10 Unplanned pregnancy rates are generally highest among women younger than 25 years, who are more likely to be nulliparous and use user‐dependent contraception. 11 As well as the potential negative psychological impact on mother and child, 12, 13, 14, 15 the economic consequences of unplanned pregnancy are considerable. In the USA in 2012, approximately 3.6 million pregnancies were unplanned, 9 and economic models estimated the associated annual medical costs at $4.5 billion. 10

Choosing a contraceptive method is a multi‐stage process. To consider using a contraceptive method, women first need to be aware of its existence, and indeed familiarity with a method has been linked to its subsequent use. 16 After gathering information regarding different methods of contraception, women consider which option could be most suitable for them based on factors such as contraceptive efficacy, hormone dose, and ease and duration of use, as well as suitability for individual lifestyle. 17 Following this, consultation with healthcare professionals (HCPs), friends, and family, ultimately leads to a contraceptive decision, with these external information and opinion sources often playing a key role in decision making. 11, 18 The large international online PULSE survey was therefore designed to investigate the four main stages of contraceptive decision making (awareness, consideration, consultation, and adoption) with a focus on the use of LARCs to determine potential reasons for their low adoption rates.

### Committee opinion no. 539: adolescents and long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^1eba1e7a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) — intrauterine devices and the contraceptive implant — are safe and appropriate contraceptive methods for most women and adolescents. The LARC methods are top-tier contraceptives based on effectiveness, with pregnancy rates of less than 1% per year for perfect use and typical use. These contraceptives have the highest rates of satisfaction and continuation of all reversible contraceptives. Adolescents are at high risk of unintended pregnancy and may benefit from increased access to LARC methods.

### Increasing access to intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants: ACOG committee statement no. 5 [^23e2ba47]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) background — long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and contraceptive implants, have few contraindications and almost all patients are appropriate candidates for a LARC method; as of October 2022, there were six U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved LARC devices in the United States (the etonogestrel contraceptive implant, the copper IUD, and four IUDs containing levonorgestrel), and these methods provide high contraceptive efficacy, convenience, and method-specific noncontraceptive benefits. When multiple methods are medically appropriate, patient preferences should always take precedence over any health care professional preferences. Removing certain barriers by offering same-day insertion and eliminating cost sharing allows for individuals to access desired LARC methods at higher rates, and programs and public health metrics that work to improve the availability of LARC should also prioritize improved access to all non-LARC contraceptive methods and should center patient method preference over uptake of particular types. Of note, patients may face difficulties with insurance coverage for a replacement device should expulsion occur, particularly when placed during the postpartum period.

### The acceptability of asking women to delay removal of a long-acting reversible contraceptive to take part in a preconception weight loss programme: a mixed methods study using qualitative and routine data (plan-it) [^8b1d2d28]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

To determine whether the LARC removal was for the purpose of conception, events following a removal were examined to either confirm or refute that a pregnancy was planned (pre-defined Read code list, see Additional File 2). Refuting a planned pregnancy included codes for alternative prescribed contraception, the menopause, or an unplanned pregnancy. Confirmation of a planned pregnancy included codes indicating pregnancy attempts or a planned pregnancy (e.g. a prescription of folic acid (see Channon et al. for full details)). For the LARC removal to be considered associated with a pregnancy-planning event, the study team determined that the pregnancy should be within 456 days of the LARC event (based on an estimation of maximum 12-month conception period and 12 weeks to confirmatory scan, see full list of rules/assumptions in Additional File 3). The quality of BMI recording in the CPRD was explored. Only BMIs that were recorded within three years of either a pregnancy start date or the last LARC event for those with no associated pregnancy were included. Since the analysis for this study is descriptive in nature, appropriate statistics including frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation, median and interquartile range were used to describe the characteristics of the data. No formal regression analysis was performed. Data analysis was done in SPSS version 25.

WP2 consisted of three components:
i) Understanding the policy context: UK policy and clinical guidelines pertaining to use (and in particular, removal) of LARCs were reviewed and collated.
ii) Understanding stakeholders experiences and views: qualitative surveys, using closed and open text questions, were designed for the different groups of stakeholders to develop an understanding of typical preconception pathways related to LARC/LARC removal and the inter-relationship between discussions about overweight/obesity and family planning from the perspectives of LARC users and service providers (See Table 1 for topics in each survey). The surveys were developed by the research team with feedback from practitioners and service users via the study management group.
iii) Stakeholder Advisory Groups (SAGs); Two SAGs, a LARC user SAG and a healthcare practitioner SAG, were created with participants recruited via the surveys. The role of the SAGs was to work with the research team to refine potential preconception WLI design options based on the surveys and policy and guideline findings.

### Continuous quality improvement strategy for increasing immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptive use at jimma university medical center, jimma, Ethiopia [^55900521]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Based on the mini 2019 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey analysis, the use of modern family planning is low. Overall, 41% of currently married women are using a modern method of family planning, and 1% are using a traditional method. Among the currently married women, the most commonly used methods are injectables (27%), implants (9%), intrauterine devices (IUD) (2%) and pills (2%). When we come to immediate postpartum family planning (IPPFP), it is even worse and out of a quarter of postpartum women who were counselled on contraception, only 13.6% received the contraceptive methods. As a result, the immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) use in sub-Sharan Africa (SSA) varies from 2% to 14%in general, and its use in Ethiopia varies from 11% to 17%in particular.

The unintended pregnancy rate remains higher, ranging from 64 to 91 pregnancies per 1000 women in developing regions compared with 35 pregnancies per 1000 women in developed regions. Waiting at least 24 months before attempting the next pregnancy was recommended as it is found to be a healthy time for pregnancy and as a result reduce the risk of adverse maternal, perinatal and infant outcomes. To decrease these risks, access to immediate LARCs is essential.LARCs are the ideal contraceptive methods for the prevention of the harmful consequences of unintended pregnancies in most women and adolescents as they are safe, effective and reversible. About 190 million women of reproductive age worldwide who want to avoid pregnancy do not use any contraceptive method and the unmet need for family planning in SSA is one of the highest, ranging from 20% to 26%.LARCs, which consist of implants and IUD, are the most effective modern family planning methods in tier one in addition to vasectomy and tubal ligation. Almost all postpartum women are medically eligible for LARCs. These methods have multiple advantages over other reversible methods as they do not require maintenance and their duration of action is long, ranging from 3 to 10 years once in place.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: extended use of long-acting reversible contraception [^d81ca9e0]. Contraception (2022). High credibility.

Age and adolescents — offering extended LARC use: Effectiveness of long‑acting reversible contraception (LARC) is not altered in adolescents and young women, and among adolescents method continuation and satisfaction are higher with LARC than with other methods; although specific evidence on extended use in adolescents does not exist, extended use can still be offered with shared decision-making, and adolescents may be counseled regarding extended use of LARC (GRADE 1C).

### Committee opinion no. 710: counseling adolescents about contraception [^3f038e00]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Adolescent contraception — background rates and LARC use: In the United States, adolescent pregnancy had a peak incidence of 117 per 1,000 women in 1990 and, according to available data, a rate in 2010 of 57 per 1,000 girls aged 15–19 years, with three-quarters of adolescent pregnancies unintended. When comparing the United States with Europe, adolescents have similar rates of sexual activity, but European adolescents are more likely to have access to sexuality education and contraception and to use the most effective methods, resulting in lower pregnancy rates. In the United States, approximately 4.3% of women aged 15–19 years who are currently using a method of contraception use a highly-effective long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) method (eg, intrauterine devices and the implant), and long-acting reversible contraceptive methods have higher efficacy, higher continuation rates, and higher satisfaction rates compared with short-acting contraceptives.

### Adherence to Swedish national recommendations for long acting reversible contraceptive provision at the time of medical abortion [^6837968d]. Contraception (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate if abortion clinics follow Swedish national guidelines regarding early insertion of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) after medical abortions up to 9 weeks of gestation and, if not, the reasons for not doing so.

Study Design

We attempted to survey representatives of all 60 known Swedish abortion clinics by telephone in November 2019, including public hospitals and private clinics. We asked questions about clinic characteristics, clinic routines concerning early insertion of IUDs and implants, adherence to guidelines and, when applicable, perceived reasons for nonadherence. Current guidelines include offering implant placement at the time of mifepristone administration and intrauterine device (IUD) insertion within 7 days of misoprostol treatment.

Results

We obtained responses from 57 (95%) clinics of which 22 (40%) followed guidelines for both implants and IUDs. Slightly more than half (n = 33, 58%) follow implant guidelines and fewer (n = 25, 44%) follow IUD guidelines. Respondents most commonly cited lack of updated local guidelines at the clinic (7/24, 29%) and a perceived lack of time (6/25, 24%) as the most common reasons for nonadherence to guidelines for insertion of implants and insufficient number of nurse midwives for insertion of IUDs 8/32, 25%).

Conclusions

Less than half of Swedish abortion clinics fully adhere to national evidence-based guidelines regarding early LARC insertion at the time of abortion.

Implications

National guidelines alone are not always sufficient to effect change in practice; awareness of existing guidelines is needed in Swedish abortion clinics and work is needed to address barriers that limit LARC access after abortion.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 735: adolescents and long-acting reversible contraception: implants and intrauterine devices [^5ad6ea51]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 735 — recommendations for adolescents and long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) state that patient choice should be the principal factor driving the use of one method of contraception over another, and respect for the adolescent's right to choose or decline any method of reversible contraception is critical, and obstetrician–gynecologists should use a reproductive justice framework for contraceptive counseling and offer LARC alongside all other reversible methods to adolescents who wish to prevent pregnancy. New-onset abnormal uterine bleeding unrelated to initial placement of a LARC should be evaluated similarly to abnormal bleeding in non-LARC users. Because adolescents are at higher risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), obstetrician–gynecologists should continue to follow standard guidelines for STI screening and should advise adolescents who choose LARC methods to use male or female condoms consistently (dual method use) to decrease the risk of STIs, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and obstetrician–gynecologists should counsel all sexually active adolescents who do not seek pregnancy on the range of reversible contraceptive methods, including LARC, and should help make these contraceptives readily accessible to them.

### Dedicated providers of long-acting reversible contraception: new approach in Zambia [^3171585a]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is underused in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Many previous attempts to increase uptake of this important class of contraception have not been successful.

Study Design

This program in Zambia employed 18 dedicated providers of LARC, placed them in high volume public sector facilities and collected routine, anonymous information over a 14-month period. We tallied uptake of LARC, analyzed user characteristics to see what populations were reached by the program and compared this to nationally representative data. We also estimated costs per couple-year of protection of the program.

Results

In a 14-month period, 33,609 clients chose either a subdermal implant (66%) or an intrauterine device (34%). The program reached a younger and lower parity population compared to nationally representative surveys of Zambian women using contraception. The estimated program costs, including the value of donated commodities, averaged $13.0 per couple-year of protection.

Conclusion

By having the necessary time, skills and materials - as well as a mandate to both generate informed demand and provide quality services - dedicated providers of LARC can expand contraceptive choice. This new approach shows what can be achieved in a short period and in a region of the world where uptake of LARC is limited.

### A systematic review of the effectiveness of counselling strategies for modern contraceptive methods: what works and what doesn' t? [^2883febb]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2020). High credibility.

Methods

The protocol for this systematic review is included in online supplementary appendix 1. We defined contraceptive counselling as the provision of contraceptive information and support for decision-making regarding contraceptive method selection (new or switching clients) or for continued use of contraceptive method (continuing clients).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

We included studies comparing two or more counselling interventions and reporting quantitative findings on contraceptive behaviour (uptake, use, or continuation of a modern method, or switching modern methods at the time of counselling), or on client satisfaction with method or services. We used the WHO definition of modern methods; interventions or outcomes focused solely on barrier methods were excluded. Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) includes contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs).

Only studies where the comparison group received contraceptive counselling were included. We included studies of women or couples, including postabortion, postpartum and breastfeeding women, but excluded studies of women with medical conditions affecting contraceptive eligibility (such as breast cancer). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomised studies, as well as peer-reviewed and grey literature publications, were considered.

We considered evidence from all countries, published in English since the publication of the Bruce frameworkin 1990.

Search strategy

We manually searched the key journal Contraception between January 2010 and October 2018 to identify keywords. Six databases (Medline, Embase, Global Health, Popline, CINAHL Plus, and Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews) were searched for eligible studies published from 1 January 1990 to 31 October 2018, using keywords related to contraception, counselling and outcomes of interest (full search strategy in online supplementary appendix 1). Manual searches of reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews identified in the search were additionally conducted.

Article selection

All unique identified publications were screened by one author (FC) based on title and abstract. A random 20% of excluded records were double-screened by a second reviewer (LB or OO) to ensure no relevant studies were missed; any differences in decisions between reviewers were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (MA). All retrieved full texts were screened by one author (FC), and reason for exclusion was documented based on a hierarchical list (figure 1). Data were extracted from included studies by one author (FC) in an Excel data extraction sheet. Four included full-text articles (7%) were extracted in duplicate by a second reviewer (LB or OO), and any differences reconciled by consultation with MA.

### Contraceptive counseling and methods for adolescents: clinical report [^629a70bf]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

LARC effectiveness and continuation — In the CHOICE study, the 12-month continuation rate of LARCs was 81%, compared with 44% for non-LARC methods, and the contraceptive failure rate was 20 times higher in women 14 to 45 years of age who used combined hormonal pills, patches, or rings than in those using LARC methods, with failure rates in women younger than 21 years twice as high as in women 21 years or older. Shorter-acting hormonal contraceptives (pills, patches, rings) are highly effective but are often discontinued after less than 6 months of use, and all progestin-only methods, including levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (IUDs), implants, injections, and pills, are safer for health conditions in which estrogen use is contraindicated; emergency contraception (EC) methods are important tools and account for a significant part of the decrease in adolescent pregnancy rates.

### Factors associated with long-acting reversible contraception usage: results from the national survey of family growth [^1100c387]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors aimed to identify factors associated with long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) usage.

Methods

The current cross-sectional study used data from the National Survey of Family Growth from 2011 to 2019. Respondents aged 15 to 44years were included. Those with previous sterilization, infertility, or pregnant were excluded. The outcome evaluated was use of a LARC.

Results

Of 61543814 women, 44287911 (72.0%) met inclusion criteria. The rate of LARC use was 13.4%. Factors associated with an increased likelihood of LARC usage were married/living with a partner (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.18 [95% CI, 1.02–1.37]), perceived good health (aRR, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.13–1.84]), year of survey 2017 to 2019 (aRR, 1.53, [95% CI, 1.28–1.83]), one or two past pregnancies (aRR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.24–2.12]) or three or more past pregnancies (aRR, 1.67 [95% CI, 1.22–2.28]), age at first live birth < 20years (aRR, 1.58 [95% CI, 1.20–2.08]) or 20 to 24years (aRR, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.13–1.87]), age at onset of sexual activity 13-19years (aRR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.26–1.78]), and a 0- to 5-month period of nonintercourse in the past year (aRR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.40–1.90]). Factors associated with decreased LARC usage were age ≥ 35years (aRR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.65–0.85]), being non-Hispanic Black (aRR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.62–0.89]) or non-Hispanic other (aRR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.59–0.88]), intending to have children (aRR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.57–0.74]), and never being sexually active (aRR, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.06–0.16]).

Conclusions

Using a nationally representative sample of women in the United States, the authors identified modifiable factors associated with LARC use. Results may be used to plan interventional trials to increase LARC usage.

### ASO author reflections: radiopathomics strategy of combing multi-scale tumor information on pretreatment to predict the pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy [^888c1b02]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Past

The standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) includes neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) and adjuvant chemotherapy. After nCRT, 15–27% of patients with LARC achieve a pathologic complete response (pCR) and usually have perfect long-term outcomes. These patients prefer to avoid surgery and preserve organs with a strategy such as "watch and wait" management. Additionally, for more than 50% of patients who cannot reach a good response (GR), treatment optimization according to different pathologic responses is essential to balance the benefits of nCRT against toxicity. Due to the advantages of radiomics for quantitative analysis of tumors, radiomics has demonstrated the potential of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in preoperative accurate evaluation of pCRor no responsein previous studies. Furthermore, pretreatment multi-parameter magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI)-based radiomics was attempted to predict non-response to nCRT. However, to date, no nomogram has been established or acknowledged for predicting discrepancies in the response before nCRT.

### From awareness to usage of long-acting reversible contraceptives: results of a large European survey [^d5467105]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

3.5 Adoption

After consultation with their HCP, approximately 47% of younger participants and 63% of older participants went on to use a LARC method. Adoption of LARC methods was generally higher among women who were considered to be knowledgeable about LARCs (data not shown).

Among women who switched to LARCs, most previous users of the condom, combined pill, and mini‐pill chose the hormonal coil, whereas women who previously used the contraceptive ring mostly switched to the copper coil (data not shown).

On average, respondents switched to LARCs at approximately 29 years of age. The most common reason for doing so was to avoid pregnancy in the near‐term (Fig. S1). Nearly half of women who chose to use LARCs had not considered any other birth‐control methods.

### Long-acting reversible contraception [^0a4990b4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods are effective options for pregnancy prevention. Currently available products in the United States include an etonogestrel implant, a copper intrauterine device (IUD), and several levonorgestrel IUDs. With increasing prevalence and duration of use, our understanding of efficacy, risks, and benefits has evolved. In addition to a brief discussion on nomenclature and LARC use within a framework of bodily autonomy and reproductive justice, this review covers clinical challenges with placement and removal, evidence-based duration of use, and how to mitigate side effects. Although all obstetrician-gynecologists as well as primary care clinicians can safely provide LARCs, complex family planning specialists are an expert referral source for challenging cases and evidence-based care as contraceptive technology continues to develop.

### Moms in the NICU: developing a pilot to engage and empower women who have delivered a prematurely born infant [^0df55181]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Co-designing the health plan

A personalized handout was created for each participant, which included both key elements of the birth story as well as all of the health improvement "recommendations" that had been discussed during the one-on-one consultation with the medical expert (Appendix 1). In co-designing a mother's health plan, the health care facilitator first reviewed with the mother her understanding of the rationale and intended benefits of each recommendation. The health care facilitator then helped the mother to identify which current health problems were most relevant to her and assisted her in developing a personal health plan. An essential aspect of the health plan was that it contained an important objective (such as making an appointment for high blood pressure) that could be achieved by the six week follow-up. The initial handout approach was a listing of the health plan items on the handout. This was rejected by the first pilot mothers as being "too medical" resulting in their co-designing the format shown in Appendix 1.

At follow-up, mothers felt that co-designing their health plan helped improve their ability to care for their own health. This reaction suggested that the maternal engagement and empowerment we hoped to achieve during their one-on-one consultation was successful and had allowed mothers to recognize and specify actionable items on their Health Plan. Of the eleven mothers who were contacted at the six week follow up, eight had achieved their six week goals and two had attempted but encountered barriers to access specialized care.

An important goal of the pilot was to encourage a longer interpregnancy interval. However, not all mothers were receptive to our pilot's approach to contraceptive counseling with respect to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), claiming that they wanted something more natural or had insurance issues with obtaining LARC. In moving forward from the pilot, further work on how to best perform contraceptive counseling with respect to addressing cultural social differences and personal preferences, could strengthen this goal.

### Preference-aligned fertility management among married adolescent girls in Northern Nigeria: assessing a new measure of contraceptive autonomy [^5da70e63]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

The primary reasons for discordance between contraceptive behaviours and desires in this cohort are unclear. Between-group differences in sociodemographic characteristics, such as State and respondent religion, should be interpreted with caution, as the facility-based sampling approach does not allow for representativeness within these groups. While we observed that a higher proportion of current contraceptive users not practising PFM were LARC users, relative to current contraceptive users practising PFM, discordance between contraceptive use and desire in this group does not appear to be driven by failed attempts at LARC removal. However, it is possible that barriers to LARC removal such as high price or resistant providers (well documented in other studies) may have discouraged current implant users with no desire to use contraception from even attempting removal. We did not have the opportunity to conduct cognitive interviews to understand women's understanding and interpretation of these questions. In future research, it will be important to conduct cognitive interviewing to clarify question wording and to layer qualitative and quantitative follow-up questions to better understand the reasons for discordance between preferences and use in both directions. This is critical for elucidating programmatically actionable information to address barriers to perceived contraceptive autonomy. We did not have the opportunity to conduct cognitive interviewing to assess comprehension of the questions.

PFM is a measure of self-perceived contraceptive autonomy that captures whether an individual's stated preferences align with their current behaviours. Part of the PFM measure's appeal is its relative simplicity and parsimony — ascertainment requires very few additional questions to standard FP survey instruments. This greatly increases the likelihood of its scalability across diverse contexts and within multicountry survey instruments. The measure also has the advantage of capturing women's self-perceived contraceptive autonomy, rather than prescribing factors that must be in place for autonomous contraceptive practice to occur. On the other hand, the PFM measure does not provide detailed information on whether enabling conditions (or perhaps even requirements) for 'full, free and informed'contraceptive choices are in place, such as comprehensive and accurate knowledge of contraception within an affordable, acceptable and non-coercive enabling contraceptive environment. Bullington et al have discussed the relative advantages of 'self-perceived' versus 'researcher-ascribed' measures in assessing constructs such as informed contraceptive choice, noting that these differing measurement approaches each capture important but distinct information. As a result, we envision the PFM measure as complementary to Senderowicz' Contraceptive Autonomy Scaleand other rights-based FP measures.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) consult series # 48: immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception for women at high risk for medical complications [^5ebdb4b5]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Reproductive planning is essential for all women and most important for those with complex health conditions or at high risk for complications. Pregnancy planning can allow these high-risk women the opportunity to receive preconception counseling, medication adjustment, and risk assessment related to health conditions that have a direct impact on maternal morbidity and mortality risk. Despite the need for pregnancy planning, medically complex women face barriers to contraceptive use, including systemic barriers, such as underinsurance for women at increased risk for complex medical conditions as well as low uptake of effective postpartum contraception. Providing contraceptive counseling and a full range of contraceptive options, including immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraception (LARC), is a means of overcoming these barriers. The purpose of this document is to educate all providers, including maternal-fetal medicine subspecialists, about the benefits of postpartum contraception, and to advocate for widespread implementation of immediate postpartum LARC placement programs. The following are Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: we recommend that LARC be offered to women at highest risk for adverse health events as a result of a future pregnancy (GRADE 1B); we recommend that obstetric care providers discuss the availability of immediate postpartum LARC with all pregnant women during prenatal care and consult the U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use guidelines to determine methods most appropriate for specific medical conditions (GRADE 1C); we recommend that women considering immediate postpartum intrauterine device insertion be counseled that although expulsion rates are higher than with delayed insertion, the benefits appear to outweigh the risk of expulsion, as the long-term continuation rates are higher (GRADE 1C); we recommend that obstetric care providers wishing to utilize immediate postpartum LARC obtain training specific to the immediate postpartum period (BEST PRACTICE); for women who desire and are eligible for LARC, we recommend immediate postpartum placement after a high-risk pregnancy over delayed placement due to overall superior efficacy and cost-effectiveness (GRADE 1B); we recommend that women considering immediate postpartum LARC be encouraged to breastfeed, as current evidence suggests that these methods do not negatively influence lactation (GRADE 1B); for women who desire and are eligible for LARC, we suggest that early postpartum LARC placement be considered when immediate postpartum LARC placement is not feasible (GRADE 2C); and we recommend that contraceptive counseling programs be patient-centered and provided in a shared decision-making framework to avoid coercion (BEST PRACTICE).

### Increasing access to intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants: ACOG committee statement no. 5 [^a5a5d394]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Implementation to improve access — obstetrician–gynecologists and other reproductive health care clinicians can improve access to LARC methods by adopting evidence-based practices, offering LARCs to all medically eligible individuals, and facilitating the availability of same-day insertion of LARC. Clinicians should work to overcome barriers to provision of all contraceptive methods, including those unique to LARC. Multiple barriers impede access to IUDs after procedural abortion, surgical management of miscarriage, and childbirth, including clinician knowledge and skills gaps, inadequate insurance coverage, and challenges for payment and reimbursement.

### MRI radiomics independent of clinical baseline characteristics and neoadjuvant treatment modalities predicts response to neoadjuvant therapy in rectal cancer [^a10236d7]. British Journal of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Various factors seem to affect the pathologic response to neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in LARC. Clinical baseline characteristics including CEA levels, histologic and differentiation grade, and clinical stages showed close association with the degree of tumour regression. Our data revealed that pre-treatment CEA levels, MRI-T stage, and tumour histologic grade were associated with CR, which was in accordance with the results of previous studies. Moreover, treatment modalities, such as concurrent chemoradiotherapy, the total radiation dose, and the total neoadjuvant therapy played an important role in this process. However, there had been almost no consideration of treatment modalities in the prediction models of previous studies. Our real-world multicentre study explored the performance of the pre-treatment MBR signatures as well as the clinical baseline characteristics and neoadjuvant treatment modalities for tumour response prediction in patients with LARC. The performance of the radiomics based models were superior to the non-imaging models. Additionally, the performance of the clinical individualised models (CMBR and CTMBR) integrating the radiomics signatures, clinical baseline characteristics, and neoadjuvant treatment modalities could be improved to some extent, but it did not show significantly better discrimination than radiomics signatures alone. Meanwhile, features with the highest contribution to the model were mainly from MBR. Our results provided evidence that pre-treatment MBR signatures could be independent predictors of CR and seemed to reflect the true nature and extent of the tumour heterogeneity in LARC more accurately than clinical parameters.

Recently established MBR models for predicting tumour response were mainly from studies on relatively small or single-centre cohorts. Because a wide variety of MR imagers exists not only among different facilities but also within the same institution, multicentre MRI-based and large-scale radiomics studies were previously difficult to conduct. With advancements in technology to minimise variability in acquisition parameters, multicentre radiomics has been attempted in rectal cancer. Liu et al. successfully developed and validated MBR signatures to predict distant metastasis within a multicentre and large-scale dataset. The present study is in general accord with a previous study in that research based on high-quality MRI-based multicentre radiomics is practicable as we have shown a model with high accuracy in predicting treatment response using multicentre real-world data from a considerably large sample of patients.

U.S. medical eligibility criteria (US MEC) and adolescent LARC safety — The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies the contraceptive subdermal implant as category 1 regardless of age group or parity status, while IUD use in younger and nulliparous women requires more caution (category 2) than in adult counterparts (category 1); all LARC methods may be safely used at any point in the postpartum period, though IUD expulsion rates vary by timing of placement, and observational studies suggest LARC does not interfere with lactation although long‑term data are limited; ACOG recommends patients be counseled that hormonal LARC products may theoretically affect breastfeeding given a lack of supporting data; for breastfeeding, the Cu‑IUD, LNG‑IUD, and subdermal implant are all safe for immediate placement, with the Cu‑IUD as US MEC category 1 and the latter two as US MEC category 2; absolute contraindications to LARC use are uncommonly encountered in adolescents.

### From awareness to usage of long-acting reversible contraceptives: results of a large European survey [^647bd01c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

3.3 Consideration

Overall, despite relatively high levels of LARC awareness among the respondents, only 24% of individuals who knew about them would go on to consider them (Fig. 2). Consideration of LARCs was highest among women who were knowledgeable about these methods; for example, those who were aware that hormones contained in LARCs were similar to natural hormones, knew that ovulation still occurs with LARC methods, or believed that LARCs were a suitable choice for women of different ages (data not shown).

When asked which birth‐control method they might switch to in the future, respondents in the younger group mostly considered condoms (49.6%) or the combined pill (36.7%; Fig. 4). LARC usage was considered by similar proportions of older and younger respondents. Hormonal coils were considered slightly more often among older than younger respondents (21.3% versus 19.9%), copper coils slightly less often (15.8% versus 18.3%), and 14.7% of respondents in both groups had considered implants. Among those who had considered using a hormonal coil, the main reasons were convenience, longevity of action, local rather than systemic hormone exposure, and reduction in menstrual bleeding.

Figure 4
Birth‐control methods considered by respondents thinking of changing their contraception.

After effectiveness, convenience and a favorable side‐effect profile were regarded as the most important factors when selecting a birth‐control method, both overall and by LARC users (Fig. 5A). Lack of influence on the menstrual cycle was ranked fourth both overall and by LARC users, whereas low or no hormone exposure was ranked sixth overall and fifth among LARC users.

Our review has some limitations. Keywords for counselling interventions are not well defined; we maximised identification of relevant studies through a wide range of search synonyms and extensive manual searches. Advantages and disadvantages of different intervention types were assessed based on information reported by authors and a subjective assessment by reviewers, to facilitate assessment of intervention suitability to individual contexts.

There are also limitations to the evidence base. First, study quality was variable, particularly among non-randomised studies (almost half of the included studies). We did not assess risk of bias systematically, however, there was no or weak evidence for most intervention types in non-randomised studies. Selection bias is likely to overestimate the strength of association, with women opting into the intervention being more likely to use contraception, and a lack of effect is unlikely to hide a 'true' population effect. Non-randomised studies finding evidence of intervention effect – including structured counselling on side effects for women initiating a method – should be assessed in RCTs before recommendations can be made. We were unable to build forest plots because most studies reported percentages rather than effect estimates with confidence intervals, and we acknowledge the limitations of conclusions based on dichotomised p values.

Second, substantial heterogeneity in study settings, interventions and outcomes limits the comparability of studies. Similar interventions were effective in some – but not all – settings, highlighting the importance of context as well as implementation intensity and fidelity. Effectiveness on contraceptive behaviour may be limited by contraceptive provision at the time of counselling (restricted in some abortion and postpartum clinics), cost of methods (particularly LARC as mentioned in the USAand Thailand), availability of providers and resources, and quality of care. Findings are therefore unlikely to be generalisable to all settings, with a particularly limited evidence base outside of high-income countries (26 of 61 studies were conducted in the USA or UK).

Third, many included studies did not clearly state whether the intervention targeted women initiating, switching and/or continuing contraception, and women switching methods were often grouped with initiators. Furthermore, multiple studies referred to 'continuation' among all clients (not all of whom had initiated a method at the time of intervention), and most studies reported contraceptive use at follow-up among all women (including those no longer in need of contraception).

### From awareness to usage of long-acting reversible contraceptives: results of a large European survey [^2441c41a]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Our findings show that a high percentage (73%) of women are aware of LARC methods, yet only 17%–18% of women would actually consider using them. Aided awareness of hormonal coils was slightly greater than that of either the combined or mini‐pill. Despite the high awareness, only one‐quarter of women would give LARCs further consideration as a form of birth control. Most women in the survey relied on condoms or oral contraceptives and it was notable how few women considered LARCs when switching to a different birth‐control method. It seems likely that this is a result of misconceptions, myths, and knowledge gaps regarding LARC methods. Our finding that only 18% of women could be considered knowledgeable about coils would seem to support this. Indeed, in the contraceptive CHOICE study, where all options were available at no cost and women were provided with comprehensive information regarding different long‐acting and short‐acting contraceptive methods and given the opportunity to address any knowledge gaps or misperceptions, the majority of women opted for a LARC. This shows the importance of ensuring women are able to access accurate and balanced information about a variety of contraceptive methods. 20

### Contraceptive care at the time of medical abortion: experiences of women and health professionals in a hospital or community sexual and reproductive health context [^6a182a23]. Contraception (2016). Low credibility.

'Some people just won't listen and you kind of think "well, we will see you back here, I'm sure". And you do. It's just frustrating because you've tried your best to make them realise that… of course they can have a termination, but you want to try and work with them to… kind of take responsibility for their own contraception'. (SRHC nurse)

As the above quote illustrates, there was a sense in which providers perceived the fact that some women return for subsequent abortions as evidence of individual or service-level failure. They also felt that women's decision not to use contraception (or the most effective method) despite its availability was a missed opportunity to 'take charge of it, take control of your fertility and your contraception and look after number one' (hospital nurse).

These examples highlight the challenges for health professionals of facilitating 'choice' in the face of some resistance to contraceptive uptake whilst also trying to practise what they believe is best for women, both medically and otherwise.

3.3 Choosing LARC at medical abortion

Women commonly framed their accounts of contraceptive decision making in relation to the experiences of friends and relatives, particularly regarding LARC:

'They'd spoken to me about getting the coil fitted, but I know quite a few people who've had bad experiences with them and I just thought "actually, no, that's not an option for me"' (SRHC, oral contraceptive)

The space given by women to their own prior experiences and familiarity with different methods in their accounts of decision making was also substantial, with several citing as a deterrent to LARC uptake previous problems with and perceived side effects of hormonal methods.

LARC was generally framed by health professionals as the most appropriate contraceptive method for most women following an abortion and thus as something that should be promoted. However, encouraging LARC uptake was presented as a challenge given the knowledge sources that women drew on in making decisions. Some — particularly SRHC — health professionals described working with this knowledge, taking women's 'preconceived ideas' as a starting point for a more in-depth conversation about her needs and preferences. Many health professionals, however, reported finding the significance women give to this information perplexing and frustrating:

### Long-acting reversible contraception: specific issues for adolescents [^c457a2fa]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Timing of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) placement and STI considerations in adolescents — screening tests for STIs "are not required before placement of an IUD in a woman without risk factors", and testing "can be performed at the time of placement for adolescents requiring screening". Delaying IUD placement is "only recommended if purulent cervicitis is noted on examination or if a known gonorrhea or Chlamydia infection has not been treated (US MEC category 4)", and "If an STI is diagnosed after placement, the IUD may be left in place while initiating antibiotic treatment". Using Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System data, condom use was "significantly lower in adolescents using a LARC method (16.4%) compared with those using combination oral contraceptive pills (37.3%)". Offering "same-day LARC placement to adolescents has been shown to increase the use of these contraceptives". "The 2 major considerations determining if LARC placement can be performed safely are pregnancy and infection", and "delaying IUD placement is recommended if there is an active, untreated infection", with LARC placement also "recommended" to be delayed "if pregnancy cannot be excluded with reasonable certainty (Table 4)".

### Long-acting reversible contraception: specific issues for adolescents [^f5dcf5e4]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in adolescents — directives for care include the following. Seek and obtain the required training for placement and removal of LARCs. Understand that LARC placement does not need to be delayed for STI screening. IUD placement should be delayed if purulent cervicitis is noted or if an untreated gonorrhea or Chlamydia infection is present. Emphasize dual therapy with condoms in LARC users to prevent STIs. Be aware that confidentiality can be compromised when delivering LARC services during the consent process and inadvertently by insurance billing and various automated features of the electronic health record. Understand state laws surrounding reproductive health and the financial options available to cover LARC services. When providing same-day LARC services, care must be taken to ensure all available contraceptive methods are reviewed, medical eligibility is considered, side effects are discussed, and personal safety related to intimate partner violence and coerced sexual activity is assessed. Provide LARC counseling within the reproductive justice framework to prevent directive and potentially coercive counseling. Focus on an end goal of improving the availability of LARC services to adolescents and not on increasing adolescent use of LARC methods. Abbreviations on this page define LARC as long-acting reversible contraception, IUD as intrauterine device, and STI as sexually transmitted infection.

### Intervention now to eliminate repeat unintended pregnancy in teenagers (INTERUPT): a systematic review of intervention effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and qualitative and realist synthesis of implementation factors and user engagement [^ebda3917]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Risk factors for repeat pregnancy

Of the 53 quantitative studies which examined risk factors, most tended to be of poor quality, and their findings were relatively inconclusive. They examined and demonstrated no empirical evidence for the association between repeat unintended pregnancy and factors, such as age, education, history of abuse, smoking, living with the father of the children or the use of oral contraceptives or LARCs, beyond the risk factors present for first conception. However, we deduced from the qualitative evidence that risk factors and reasons for repeat unintended pregnancy appeared diverse and included:

Contextual factors, such as lack of family or peer support, educational or vocational opportunities, and chaotic lifestyles,

"… we just went and did it"… "it was a spur of the moment thing… we were partying". (Herrman 2006, USA, teen mothers recruited from social service agencies)

Emotional factors, particularly to fill an emotional void after an abortion or adoption,

" I was just devastated carrying a baby for nine months and feeling it move, going through labour and everything and seeing him for the first time and him just going. It was horrible. He went to foster carers within days after birth". (Clarke 2010, UK and Caribbean, adolescents with two or more pregnancies in London)

Practical factors, such as the desire to complete one's family whilst still young,

For example, one teen said, "My baby needs a brother or sister — it is too sad to see him growing up without someone to play with". Another mother stated, "Now that I've had one, I should just finish it, you know, before going back to school and dropping out all over again". (Bull 1998, USA, teen mothers who received state food aid, and their mothers/guardians)

Motivational factors, such as personal goals and aspirations prompted young women to attempt to avoid a repeat pregnancy, but they were often not given the appropriate support to achieve their goals.

"Creche facilities to allow you to go and finish your education and go out and get a job, then you are off the social. Why don't they do things like that?" (Clarke 2010, UK and Caribbean, adolescents with two or more pregnancies in London)

### Vital signs: repeat births among teens-United States, 2007–2010 [^020089ac]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions and Comment

This report documents that nearly one in five teen births in 2010 was a repeat birth. The percentage of teen births that were repeat births has decreased 6.2%, from 19.5% in 2007 to 18.3% in 2010. The prevalence of repeat teen births varied by race/ethnicity, and mirrored racial/ethnic disparities in the overall teen birth rates with Hispanics, non-Hispanic blacks, and American Indian/Alaska Natives experiencing the highest rates.

This report also examined postpartum contraceptive use, a proximal determinant of the risk for a repeat teen birth. Overall, 91% of teens with a recent live birth reported using contraception postpartum; this represents a substantial increase from the 45%–50% of teens with a recent live birth who reported using contraception in the prepregnancy period. This percentage also is similar to the percentage of all sexually active female teens (85.6%) who reported use of a method of birth control at last sex. More than three quarters of sexually active teen mothers used one of the most or moderately effective contraceptive methods postpartum, and teen mothers were more likely to use LARC than all sexually active teens (21.5% versus 4.5%). Of note, a previous report of PRAMS data from seven states in 2006–2008 showed only 12% of teen mothers were using LARC. The more recent data from 16 PRAMS reporting areas suggest that an increasing percentage of teen mothers are actively attempting to prevent another pregnancy in the postpartum period through use of the most effective methods of contraception.

LARC training and access expansion — residency and fellowship integration is emphasized to increase referrals and placement, with available institutional support programs. The page states that "The most important means of increasing LARC referrals and the number of physicians trained and willing to provide LARC placement is to ensure that such training is routinely integrated into residency education", and that "Provision of this training will increase access to LARC for all women by contributing to an increase in referrals and placement by obstetrician-gynecologists and for high-risk women by ensuring a foundation in LARC for residents who ultimately pursue subspecialty training". It further notes that "LARC training should also be emphasized during MFM fellowship training as an important aspect of continuing medical education", and identifies an implementation resource: "Comprehensive and evidence-based training is available to institutions through the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' LARC Program's Postpartum Contraceptive Access Initiative, which provides clinical and operational support training for immediate postpartum LARC implementation", which "incorporates evidence-based research and current best practices into a three-pronged implementation model to support successful immediate postpartum LARC provision at participating hospitals".

### Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) provision by family physicians: low but on the rise [^58bd17d6]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Although the fraction of family physicians (FPs) providing Long Acting Reversible Contraceptive (LARC) services increased between 2014 and 2017, the most recent estimates show that less than a quarter of family physicians include provision of LARC in their practice. Increasing the number of FPs providing LARC will help increase patients' access to the most effective forms of birth control currently available.

### Long-acting reversible contraception: specific issues for adolescents [^8e28c400]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical report on long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in adolescents — available methods, mechanisms, effectiveness, and use are described as follows: Available LARC methods include 1 progestin subdermal implant and 5 intrauterine devices (IUDs) and are all appropriate for use in the adolescent population. The progestin subdermal implant works by suppressing ovulation, whereas the copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) and the progestin-releasing levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs) prevent fertilization. LARC methods are the most effective forms of contraception, with less than 1% of users becoming pregnant during the first year of use. Despite availability, rates of LARC use among sexually active adolescents remain low at 2% to 3%, and limitations in patient knowledge, availability from trained providers, and concerns over cost and confidentiality have been recognized as barriers. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) previously published a policy statement and technical report on contraception for adolescents summarizing the full range of available methods.

Increasing access to intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants — obstetrician–gynecologists and other reproductive health care clinicians play a critical role in improving access to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and can adopt best practices for providing equitable, patient-centered contraceptive care, including patient-centered counseling, same-day LARC insertion, and LARC removal on patient request. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports policies at the institutional, local, state, and federal levels that improve access to all contraceptive methods, including LARCs.

### Use of effective contraception following provision of the progestogen-only pill for women presenting to community pharmacies for emergency contraception (bridge-It): a pragmatic cluster-randomised crossover trial [^2fe1ad98]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

In addition to increasing uptake of effective contraception, it is hoped that implementing bridging widely could reduce the rates of repeat use of emergency contraception, particularly among those who are most at risk of an unintended pregnancy. This point is particularly important, as findings from the British National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (NATSAL-3), done between 2010 and 2012, highlight that emergency contraception users represent a group of women at greater risk of unintended pregnancy, and that use of emergency contraception has risen in this group. Thus, it is unsurprising that the pregnancy rate at 4.7% shown in the Bridge-it study in the first 4 months of follow-up seems considerable. NATSAL-3 also found that use of emergency contraception had increased among single women, those living in less affluent areas, and those obtaining emergency contraception from retail rather than health-care sources. This finding highlights the potential for providing bridging contraception within retail settings, such as community pharmacies, to reduce repeat emergency contraception use and unintended pregnancies in this group. Importantly, the mean age of women participating in the Bridge-it study was 22 years, highlighting that the intervention reached key age groups; abortion rates in the UK are highest among women aged 20–24 years, and use of emergency contraception highest among women aged 16–24 years. Thus, if the Bridge-it intervention were implemented widely as a service, the use of effective contraception might increase in the relevant age group and among those at greater risk of unintended pregnancy.

Some might argue that our intervention could undermine attempts to encourage use of LARC. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in this study in the uptake of LARC after emergency contraception use. It was disappointing that few women in the intervention group used the rapid access card which gave priority access to sexual and reproductive health services offering LARC. Data from interviews with participants, pharmacists, and sexual and reproductive health clinic staff, done as part of the evaluation (to be published separately), will provide more understanding. However, there are many women who do not want to use LARC, and they might be more likely to present for emergency contraception. Modelling from the USAhas shown that a greater proportion of unintended pregnancies at population level could be prevented if efforts focused on encouraging sexually active women who are not using an effective contraceptive method (eg, progestogen-only pill) rather than switching those already using an effective method to a more effective LARC method.

### Contextualizing barriers to long-acting reversible contraception in Delaware [^cb3469f6]. Contraception (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

We conducted this study to examine barriers to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) that persist in the context of a large-scale LARC program, Delaware Contraceptive Access Now (Del-CAN), that has actively endeavored to remove such barriers.

Study Design

In 2016–2017, we conducted in-depth interviews with 86 self-identified women of reproductive age, diverse along the lines of age, race, and class, in the state of Delaware on their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors regarding contraception. We analyzed the interviews using an inductive coding process.

Results

We found that, even in the midst of Del-CAN's efforts, meso and macro-level contexts, including provider-patient communication and clinic/practice structures, reinforced LARC barriers related to knowledge, access, and side effects.

Conclusions

The multi-level contexts and nuances we illuminate in our study currently fall outside the purview of well-intentioned, large-scale initiatives such as Del-CAN, that attempt to address and ameliorate oft-researched barriers. Thus, these barriers persist within provider-patient interactions and clinic/practice policies and structures.

Implications

The evaluated LARC-based intervention, Del-CAN, cannot fully address issues around provider autonomy, inadequate provider-patient communication, or practice-specific policies and criteria. In order for this intervention, and others like it, to be successful, they must be aware of and prepared to address such dimensions in their efforts.

### Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) versus standard neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^fb3ed580]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is a novel approach for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), which attempts to deliver both systemic chemotherapy and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy prior to surgery. However, its efficacy and safety remain controversial in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We conducted this meta-analysis to assess such concerns.

Materials and Methods

Head-to-head phase II/III RCTs were searched in Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, as well as other sources. The primary endpoint was pathologic complete response (pCR). Secondary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), local recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, and the R0 resection rate.

Results

Eight phase II/III RCTs involving 2,196 patients with LARC were assessed. The primary analysis demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in the pCR rate for TNT treatment (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.28–2.45; p = .0005). TNT treatment also showed improvements in DFS and OS outcomes compared with standard chemoradiotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72–0.96; p = .03 and HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.74–1.05; p = .15). In addition, TNT treatment showed significant efficacy in reducing the risk of distant metastasis (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68–0.95; p = .012).

Conclusion

The overall pCR rate may be improved with TNT compared with standard treatment. The TNT strategy may also improve DFS and OS and reduce the risk of distant metastasis.

Implications For Practice

Locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is a relatively common disease, with a poor prognosis because of its high metastatic potential. The role of total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) has always been controversial. This meta-analysis found that TNT in LARC is associated with a significant improvement in overall pathologic complete response rate, disease-free survival, overall survival, and distant metastasis-free survival compared with standard treatment. TNT is a promising strategy for LARC, especially for patients who have little desire for surgery.

### T2 relaxation time for the early prediction of treatment response to chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer [^f0ee8a5b]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard treatment modality for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The outcomes of CRT are a crucial endpoint in LARC management, with 14–36% achieving a pathological complete response (pCR). A wait-and-watch policy has been proposed for these patients because it may have similar disease-free survival and overall survival benefit to surgery. However, a small proportion of patients fail to benefit from CRT and develop toxicity and tumor progression during treatment. These poor responders may obtain an improved prognosis if the treatment strategy changes in time to begin intensive chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or heavy particle therapy. Thus, early prediction of the treatment outcomes is crucial. However, no reliable predictor for such purpose has been identified; thus, there is an urgent need for reliable imaging markers to distinguish responders from non-responders in the early stages of CRT.

Several studies have attempted to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict early CRT response in LARC. Tumor size reduction on early MRI during CRT for LARCs can distinguish complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and non-response (NR) with high accuracy. A clinical trial also supported the predictive value of tumor volume regression during CRT. In addition to reducing tumor volumetry, functional changes have also been detected in the early stages of CRT. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is the most commonly used method for evaluating the CRT response. It has been proven useful for selecting good treatment responders during preoperative CRT for LARCs. However, conventional DWI sequences have essential limitations and presence of artifacts that lead to a lower resolution than high-resolution T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), the basic sequence for preoperative evaluation of rectal cancer. In recent years, texture and radiomics features based on T2WI are increasingly applied to predict pCR in LARC due to their better classification performance, ultimately proving the importance of T2WI in MRI.

### Placement of long-acting reversible contraception for minors who are mothers should not require parental consent [^f40b5e43]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2022). Medium credibility.

Decreasing unintended teenage pregnancy, especially repeat teenage pregnancy, is an important public health goal. Unfortunately, legal barriers in the USA impede this goal as all minors are unable to consent for birth control in 24 states, and only 10 of those states allow consent after the minor has given birth according to state statutory law. Placement of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is one of the most effective methods of preventing rapid repeat pregnancies. However, restrictions are placed on adolescents who may not have the option of parental consent if the parents are unwilling, or not present, to give consent. A predicament arises when healthcare professionals are willing to place the contraceptive for the patient, but cannot due to the restrictions and guidelines outlined by each state. Even though these adolescents are legally viewed as minors, adolescent mothers should be able to consent to the placement of LARC. Notably, adolescents have the legal ability to give consent for the healthcare of their child starting in the prenatal period. I argue that this ability should be extended to include adolescent consent for their own healthcare. Additionally, the procedure to place LARC is relatively low risk and highly effective, which is an opportune situation to allow minors to consent. Allowing adolescents to consent to LARC after delivery is a simple and effective way to decrease rapid repeat pregnancy rates in the USA.

### T2 relaxation time for the early prediction of treatment response to chemoradiation in locally advanced rectal cancer [^2fba9f89]. Insights Into Imaging (2022). Medium credibility.

Several approaches have been attempted for the early evaluation of tumor response using quantitative MRI parameters, including tumor shrinkage-based T2WI, radiomics based on pre and early-treatment MRI, and the ADC values obtained mid-MRI. In line with previous data, we found that relatively increased ADC and decreased tumor volume during CRT were potential predictors of postoperative pathological response to CRT, with a moderate correlation coefficient with the pathological TRG. Compared with relatively increased ADC and decreased tumor volume during CRT, the relative T2 decrease offered may provide more helpful information about the tumor microstructural changes, such as fibrous and residual tumor changes due to the higher correlation coefficient with the pathological TRG. The T2 relaxation time indicated the tissue's water content, especially free water molecules; thus, they decrease in a fibrotic myocardium and increase in an edematous myocardium.

Different collagen fibers may appear during CRT in the tumor, especially in GRs. This development reduces the water content of the tumor and results in a more noticeable decrease in the T2 value of the GRs. The decline in T2 relaxation time was first identified in patients with breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Similarly, in rectal cancer patients, T2 relaxation time had varying degrees of decrease during the CRT, while those with less residual tumor had a higher T2 decreased rate. It was reported that the split scar with hypointensity on T2-weighted image was characteristic of CRs, while intermediate signals may represent residual tumor after CRT for LARC. Consistent with the morphologic patterns visible on T2-weighted images, we found a high correlation between T2 relaxation time and the proportion of residual tumor cells and fibrous components in the tumor after CRT.

Some prospective exploratory studies reported that MRI during neoadjuvant RCT may predict early pCR in rectal cancer patients. A radiomics model that included MRI values before and during radiotherapy showed excellent predictive capability for identifying pCR in LARC patients, with an AUC of 0.93. Early reduction rates in the tumor volume (ΔV T2WI) showed an AUC of 0.899 for predicting CR after CRT. Our study's early T2 decrease had an AUC of 0.91 for predicting tumor response. T2 relaxation times offer a simpler quantitative measurement, which can be implemented at the MRI workstation, as they are strictly based on the visual morphology of T2WI. Our analyses before, during, and after CRT for LARC showed that T2 relaxation time has high reproducibility. Further, it eliminates the need for laborious image segmentation in radiomics analysis.

### Adolescent / young adult long-acting reversible contraception: experience from a multisite adolescent medicine collaborative [^f8b87eba]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To report on long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) experience and continuation rates in the Adolescent Medicine LARC Collaborative.

Study Design

LARC insertion data (682 implants and 681 intrauterine devices [IUDs]) were prospectively collected from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2019, across 3 Adolescent Medicine practices. Follow-up data through December 31, 2020, were included to ensure at least 1 year of follow-up of this cohort. Continuation rates were calculated at 1, 2, and 3 years, overall and by Adolescent Medicine site, as were descriptive statistics for LARC procedural complications and patient experience.

Results

Implant and IUD insertion complications were uncommon and largely self-limited, with no IUD-related uterine perforations. Uterine bleeding was the most frequently reported concern at follow-up (35% implant, 25% IUD), and a common reason for early device removal (45% of implant removals, 32% of IUD removals). IUD malposition or expulsion occurred following 6% of all insertions. The pooled implant continuation rate at 1 year was 87% (range, 86%-91% across sites; P = 0.63), 66% at 2 years (range, 62%-84%; P = 0.01), and 42% at 3 years (range, 36%-60%; P = 0.004). The pooled IUD continuation rate at 1 year was 88% (range, 87%-90% across sites; P = 0.82), 77% at 2 years (range, 76%-78%; P = 0.94), and 60% at 3 years (range, 57%-62%; P = 0.88).

Conclusions

LARC is successfully provided in Adolescent Medicine clinical settings, with continuation rates analogous to those of well-resourced clinical trials. Uterine bleeding after LARC insertion is common, making counselling imperative. Future analyses will assess whether the medical management of LARC-related nuisance bleeding improves continuation rates in our Adolescent Medicine patient population.

### Factors associated with initiating long-acting reversible contraception immediately after first-trimester abortion [^09330cb3]. Contraception (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective was to identify predictors of postabortion long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) initiation to increase providers' understanding of motivators of contraceptive choices.

Study Design

We prospectively enrolled a cohort of women having abortions at < 13 weeks' gestational age who were eligible to receive no-cost contraceptive methods immediately postprocedure (N = 1662) to evaluate the demographic and reproductive factors associated with choosing and receiving a long-acting contraceptive versus a short-acting method. We used stepwise logistic regression to identify independent predictors of LARC initiation.

Results

During the study period, 1072 (64.5%) chose an immediate postabortion LARC method and 590 (35.5%) chose another method. Compared to the group of women who chose a non-LARC method, women who chose a LARC method were more likely to have a surgical abortion and were younger, more likely to be Hispanic, more likely to live greater than 70 miles from the clinic, more likely to have a nonurban address and less likely to have had a prior abortion.

Conclusions

We found that the differences in the demographic and reproductive factors of women choosing and receiving postabortion LARC were those which have been shown to be associated with difficulty in accessing contraception. Providers should offer a full range of contraceptive options to women immediately postabortion.

Implications

Postabortion LARC is more likely to be utilized by women from groups who have been shown to have difficulty accessing traditional family planning clinical care: those who are young, do not live in a city and are from groups with recognized health disparities. Offering postabortion LARC increases the options for these women.

Adolescent contraception — United States 2021 sexual activity and contraceptive use patterns are summarized as follows: In 2021, 30% of all high school students reported ever having sex; among sexually active students in 2021, 52% reported using a condom at last sexual intercourse and 33% reported that they or a partner used an effective form of contraception (either long acting reversible method [LARC] or hormonal method) at last sexual intercourse, and of those, 10% reported dual use of condom and a more effective hormonal or LARC method together; Almost 14% of sexually active youth used no method of contraception at last sexual intercourse; and the majority of the declines in adolescent pregnancy since the 1990s are attributable to increased use of contraception.

### From awareness to usage of long-acting reversible contraceptives: results of a large European survey [^a25bd589]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Medium credibility.

When respondents ranked pre‐defined barriers to adoption of different birth‐control methods for importance, aversion to insertion and lack of knowledge were among the main reasons that discouraged respondents from using intrauterine contraception (Fig. 5B). For implants and hormonal coils, the older group perceived having extra hormones in their bodies as a more important barrier, and the younger group viewed pain during placement as more important.

Among 2091 respondents who would not consider using a hormonal coil, the main reason was to switch to hormone‐free methods, with 41% indicating that they did not want more hormones in their bodies. Concerns related to this were that hormones released by coils could adversely affect mood, libido, or fertility. Fear of pain during coil insertion was another factor. Of women who would not consider hormonal coils, copper coils and implants were considered by 11.9% and 10.7%, respectively.

3.4 Consultation

Approximately 36% of younger and 44% of older participants who were considering switching to LARCs actually went on to discuss them with their HCP (Fig. 2).

Overall, 4590 respondents (63.6%) had visited an HCP to discuss birth control, 1729 (23.9%) did not plan to visit an HCP for this reason, and the remainder (902; 12.5%) had not yet visited an HCP to discuss birth control but expressed an intention to do so. Respondents had most commonly discussed condoms, the combined pill, and the mini‐pill with an HCP, all more frequently in the younger than the older group (Fig. 6A). Hormonal coils were discussed with a greater proportion of older than younger respondents (11.9% versus 8.2%). Similar proportions in the older and younger groups discussed copper coils (7.1% versus 6.7%) and implants (4.3% versus 4.6%).

### Contraceptive procedures [^4d44a6ac]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Although most women desire to control the size and spacing of their family, the rate of unintended pregnancy in the United States remains high, with approximately half of all pregnancies being unintended. Reducing unintended pregnancy is a national public health goal, and the increased use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) (intrauterine devices and implants) can help meet this goal. LARCs are among the most effective forms of contraception available. There are few contraindications to their use, and insertion and removal are straightforward procedures that are well tolerated in the outpatient office setting.

### Increasing access to intrauterine devices and contraceptive implants: ACOG committee statement no. 5 [^bc68e38b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Insurance coverage and reimbursement — barriers to LARC access — are detailed as follows: "Insurance type and benefit design affect access to contraceptive care", and "Inequities by insurance type exist; compared with patients with private insurance, patients with Medicaid insurance are less likely to receive LARC when two or more visits are required (79% vs 66%)". Cost and reimbursement are highlighted, as "The high cost of LARC devices can present a barrier when ob-gyns receive reimbursement from payers that is below the cost of the device and insertion procedure", with evidence from Louisiana where "a twofold increase in LARC use" occurred "when Medicaid policy increased the contraceptive device reimbursement rate to the wholesale acquisition cost". Regulatory limits also affect availability because "Some state Medicaid programs, for example, place limits on the types of practitioners who can serve patients who have Medicaid insurance", and "Any restriction of qualified health care professionals reduces access to care". Coverage gains are noted: "Since implementation of the Affordable Care Act, most insurance plans cover all contraceptives, including LARC methods, with no patient cost sharing", and safety-net access persists because "Many practices receiving federal Title X family planning funding, Planned Parenthood clinics, and federally qualified health centers offer LARC methods at low or no cost".

### Determining the survival benefit of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with pT1-3N1M0 rectal cancer undergoing total mesorectal excision: a retrospective analysis [^fdcdfca4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In 1982, Heald et al. proposed that TME reduces the local recurrence rate of rectal cancer to approximately 10%. However, this idea was not accepted by most surgical experts around the world until the end of the twentieth century, when it became the gold standard for treatment of middle and lower rectal cancers. Subsequent studies, such as CAO/ARO/AIO-94, CKVO9504, and MRCCR07, showed that preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy further reduced the local recurrence rate of LARC after radical resection to approximately 5%. Since then, preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy in conjunction with TME has become the standard treatment plan for middle- and lower-grade LARC. Although it reduces the local recurrence rate by approximately 5%, preoperative radiotherapy does not improve the overall survival (OS). In view of the fact that long-term adverse reactions caused by radiotherapy seriously affect patient quality of life by impairing anal, voiding, and sexual functions, injuries that can still increase with the passage of time, potentially increasing the risk of developing a second tumor, some scholars have attempted to remove radiotherapy from the perioperative treatment of LARC.

The Chinese FOWARC study was the first phase III clinical randomized controlled trial to introduce preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy into a neoadjuvant therapy plan for the treatment of rectal cancer. The results showed no significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) and local recurrence rates between the perioperative mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy regimen without radiotherapy and standard fluorouracil-based neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The 3-year local recurrence rates in the two groups were 8.3% and 8.0%, respectively. The aforementioned study speculated that mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy may be used as the initial regimen of neoadjuvant therapy for LARC, and radiotherapy can be used as a selective supplement based on the efficacy of chemotherapy. The American PROSPECT study was the most anticipated study on neoadjuvant chemotherapy for rectal cancer, as it was a head-to-head control study that aimed to compare neoadjuvant therapy using a simple mFOLFOX6 regimen with standard neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The results of the aforementioned study will have a decisive impact on the status of radiotherapy in the perioperative treatment of LARC and whether the comprehensive treatment of LARC will enter the era of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The results of the FOWARC study posed a strong challenge to the perioperative use of radiotherapy for LARC.

### The acceptability of asking women to delay removal of a long-acting reversible contraceptive to take part in a preconception weight loss programme: a mixed methods study using qualitative and routine data (plan-it) [^57a3819c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

The findings of the two work packages are described separately: Work Package 1 results use routine data to identify the numbers of eligible women that could be potentially recruited into to a preconception WLI study. To do this the results are divided into four sections: (A) LARC use; (B) pregnancy within 1 year and 3 months of LARC removal; (C) codes to refute or confirm that the pregnancy was planned; (D) BMI status. Work Package 2 results describe the contextual factors firstly of the relevant policy and guidelines, secondly the survey findings reflecting the views of the LARC users and practitioners and finally the reflections on these findings from the SAGs.

Work Package 1: The use of routine data to identify women using LARCs and planning a pregnancy

A total of 2,632,871 records from women of reproductive age (16 to 48 years old) were identified from the CPRD between 1 st January 2009 to 31 st December 2018, of whom 318,040 (12.1%) women were in the pre-defined study population (at least one consultation identified as LARC-related) (see Additional file 4 for the generation and exclusions of the study population).

LARC-related consultations

A total of 315,755 (12.0%) women in the study population had at least one LARC event (total of 929,099 LARC events). The proportion of women with at least one LARC event decreased over the time period from 2.2% in 2009 (approx. 42 LARC events per practice) to 1.3% in 2018 (approx. 24 LARC events per practice). Table 2 shows LARC-related consultations broken down by consultation type. Individuals in our study population could experience more than one code over the study period. A total of 108,987 women had a LARC removal (34.5% of the study population); 12,615 (12%) had more than one LARC removal code recorded over the study period.

Table 2
LARC events by consultation type

† N = 9,062 codes were double counted due to three codes (IUD – Not otherwise specified (NOS), Subcutaneous contraceptive NOS, and Subcutaneous contraceptive) being coded as both LARC in situ and LARC insertion

### Same-day LARC insertion attitudes and practices [^a4706b83]. Contraception (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Little is known regarding clinicians' attitudes about or the extent to which the recommendation to offer same-day insertions for long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) is applied in practice.

Study Design

Since 2006, 47 family planning agencies in Colorado and Iowa participated in two initiatives to reduce unintended pregnancy by increasing LARC provision. Clinic directors (n = 45) and clinicians (n = 114) participating in these initiatives were interviewed and surveyed regarding their LARC provision practices and attitudes.

Results

Agencies required fewer visits for the contraceptive implant than for the intrauterine device (IUD). Only 18% of agencies typically offered an IUD, and 36% typically offered an implant in one visit. Years of experience and professional title significantly predicted attitudes about the number of visits required to get LARC.

Discussion

Barriers must be overcome for full implementation of professional LARC guidelines and for more women to receive chosen methods without the extra burden of multiple visits.

### Use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) and the depo-provera shot in adolescents [^d2cc7286]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

The intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the subdermal implant, collectively known as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC), along with the Depo-Provera shot, represent highly efficacious methods of birth control for all reproductive-age women, including adolescents. They are also safe, private, and convenient, and can be used for their noncontraceptive benefits. Additionally, LARC and Depo-Provera represent methods of contraception that do not contain estrogen and may be safely used in young women who have contraindications to estrogen-containing medications. The LARC methods have traditionally been underused by adolescents due to lack of knowledge and misperceptions about safety and effects on future fertility. However, studies have found that when barriers to the use of LARC are removed, adolescents have increasingly chosen the IUD and implant for birth control and most continue to use these methods with satisfaction. This chapter will provide an overview of IUDs, the subdermal implant and Depo-Provera, address barriers to care for adolescents, efficacy, continuation rates, common side effects and reasons for discontinuation, contraindications, and noncontraceptive benefits.

### Acceptance of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods by adolescent participants in the contraceptive CHOICE project [^3b8753c3]. Contraception (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Adolescent women have a high risk of unintended pregnancy. Currently, there are little data about their choice to initiate long-acting reversible contraception (LARC).

Study Design

We evaluated the association of age and preference for a LARC vs. a non-LARC method among adolescent participants in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, comparing those aged 14–17 years to adolescents aged 18–20 years. We then analyzed the association between age and choice of the implant vs. the intrauterine device (IUD) among adolescents.

Results

Of the 5086 women enrolled, 70% (n = 3557) of participants chose a LARC method. Among adolescents aged 14–20 years, 69% of 14-17-year-olds chose LARC, while 61% of 18-20-year-olds chose LARC (relative risk 1.16, 95% confidence interval 1.03–1.30). Among adolescents choosing a LARC method, 63% (n = 93/148) of the 14-17-year-olds chose the implant, whereas 71% (n = 364/510) of the 18-20-year-olds chose the IUD.

Conclusion

Long-acting reversible contraception use is clearly acceptable and common among adolescents enrolled in the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, with the younger group being most interested in the implant.

### Optimal neoadjuvant strategies for locally advanced rectal cancer by risk assessment and tumor location [^381bff95]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

Neoadjuvant therapy is standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Advancements in multimodality therapy options and sequencing of radiation therapy (RT), surgery, and chemotherapy make decision-making challenging. Traditional treatment of patients with LARC involves neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by total mesorectal excision and consideration of adjuvant chemotherapy. Advancement in RT has led to trials offering both short-course and long-course RT with good long-term clinical outcomes. Intensification of therapy in high-risk patients has led to studies of total neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy and chemoradiation, now standard management for most LARC. De-escalation of therapy in patients with favorable prognosis has led to several considerations, including non-total mesorectal excision management or neoadjuvant chemotherapy only. Several considerations of patient and disease factors can help inform the optimal chemotherapy regimens in different sequencing of neoadjuvant strategies. Finally, novel biomarkers, such as microsatellite instability, has led to utilization of novel therapies, including neoadjuvant immunotherapy, with substantial response. This review attempts to frame the rapidly growing data in LARC in context of disease and patient risk factors, to inform optimal, personalized treatment of patients with LARC.

### Barrier protection use by adolescents during sexual activity [^7c852bb1]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Adolescent barrier protection and contraceptive patterns — An analysis of YRBS cross-sectional data reported that among 2288 sexually active female participants, 2% used LARCs; 6% used depot medroxyprogesterone acetate injection, the ethinyl estradiol and norelgestromin patch, or the etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring; 22% used oral contraceptives; 41% used condoms; 12% used withdrawal or another method; 16% used no contraceptive method; and 2% were not sure. LARC users were approximately 60% less likely to use barriers compared with oral contraceptive users. Authors did not find significant differences in condom use between LARC users and depot injection, patch, or ring users; LARC users were more than twice as likely to have 2 or more recent sexual partners compared with oral contraceptive, depot injection, patch, or ring users. In a secondary analysis, LARC use was associated with increased acquisition of an STI within the first 12 months after placement compared with no use of LARCs, and these findings suggest that adolescents using other contraceptive methods besides barriers may be engaging in risk compensation.

### The acceptability of asking women to delay removal of a long-acting reversible contraceptive to take part in a preconception weight loss programme: a mixed methods study using qualitative and routine data (plan-it) [^571b8511]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Individual freedom to choose

LARC users and HCPs highlighted the ethical implications of what could be interpreted as an imposition of a contraceptive decision on patients. Some LARC users referred to discrimination against people with raised BMI and the perceived insinuation that

"fat people shouldn't breed". (LU4)

They felt that state involvement in personal reproductive decisions was unacceptable and they were concerned that people may feel pressured into agreeing to delay LARC removal, acknowledging that HCPs, despite acting with best intentions, may be unaware of this consequence. However, HCPs also acknowledged the potential to pressure patients in a "doctor-led approach".

"I would find it ethically complex to suggest to women that their freedom of choice to have their contraception removed may be compromised by their weight". (HCP57)

"… this is already happening in places, with women reporting having been 'refused' to have their implant/coil removed, conditional on losing weight. That may not be what the healthcare professional thought they were saying, but that is the message women are hearing". (LU8)

"Because you're denying someone the right to get pregnant due to their weight. That is a breach of their human rights". (LU180)

Complexity of timing in conception decisions

The timing of decision making about conception was characterised as complex: LARC users identified multiple influential factors including relationships, studies, career choices, sibling age-gap, and financial implications. LARC users and HCPs commented on the risk of delay for older patients or those with fertility issues.

"How dare anyone think they have the right to intervene in such a monumentally personal decision for a couple?" (LU8)

"Personally, I have a coil and have planned it's duration around my university studies and finances. I can't imagine I am the only one. I have planned when I will begin a family regardless of my weight or what a doctor tells me". (LU109)

"… may not achieve anything other than delaying pregnancy and LARC removal — so you end up with older overweight people getting pregnant".(HCP42)

### Phase II study of preoperative capecitabine and oxaliplatin-based intensified chemoradiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer and synchronous liver-limited resectable metastases [^7c682af6]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

It is still controversial whether the addition of oxaliplatin to the standard single fluoropyrimidine-based preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen is of benefit to LARC patients without metastasis.–However, the addition of oxaliplatin to fluoropyrimidine improved the survival outcomes of metastatic colorectal cancer patients and is now a standard chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Accordingly, oxaliplatin was added to the preoperative chemoradiotherapy regimen for systemic control of LMs in our study, which may have contributed to the considerable efficacy outcomes. Moreover, this intensified chemoradiotherapy regimen is well tolerated, with a toxicity profile similar to that of the standard single fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy. Thus, CapeOx-RT can be an additional reasonable approach to LARC patients with resectable metastases who need both local and systemic control.

Recently, the addition of targeted agents such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor or vascular epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor to the conventional chemotherapy regimen according to the results of companion diagnostics have significantly improved the outcomes of unresectable colorectal cancer patients with metastasis.–The new EPOC trial, which was conducted to find a benefit of the addition of cetuximab, an epithelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, to chemotherapy in the perioperative setting of resectable colorectal cancer patients with metastasis was stopped early because it met the predefined futility criteria. However, the results of that study are not universally accepted due to several limitations, as recently mentioned by Nordlinger et al, and further confirmatory clinical studies are required to determine the efficacy of the addition of cetuximab to this group of patients.

Bevacizumab is a potent inhibitor of VEGF activity, and it has thus been suggested that its use in a perioperative setting could potentially impact postoperative wound healing. Nevertheless, when bevacizumab was stopped at least 5 weeks before or started at least 28 days after the surgery, there was no increase in wound complications. Thus, the addition of bevacizumab can be considered in the treatment of LARC with resectable LMs in future studies in an attempt to improve distant disease control.

Triple combination strategies, FOLFOXIRI (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and 5-fluorouracil), with or without bevacizumab was proven to bring maximal tumor shrinkage as well as improved survival outcomes. The OLIVIA trial, which compared bevacizumab plus FOLFOX with bevacizumab plus FOLFOXIRI for patients with liver-limited metastases, demonstrated that the R0 resection rate was 49% in the bevacizumab plus FOLFOXIRI arm. Thus, triplet combination with or without bevacizumab also can be considered as neoadjuvant strategy for this population.

### A prospective analysis of the relationship between sexual acceptability and contraceptive satisfaction over time [^9cc2a671]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Overview, data source, and population

Data derive from the HER Salt Lake Contraceptive Initiative, a longitudinal cohort nested in a quasi-experimental, observational study (Identifier:). Recruitment occurred at 4 participating family planning health centers in Salt Lake County, Utah, from September 2015 to March 2017. Individuals could enroll in the survey arm if they were 18 to 45 years old, spoke English or Spanish, were a new patient or were receiving a new contraceptive method, and did not want to become pregnant for at least 1 year. Compared with the all-served cohort, survey arm participants were more likely to be 18 to 24 years old, non-Hispanic White, parous, and self-paying, and to select a LARC method. All participants engaged in standardized contraceptive counseling with a trained clinic staff member. This study was approved by the University of Utah Institutional Review Board.

For 1 year beginning on March 28, 2016, clients received their method at no cost and could freely switch or discontinue methods for up to 3 years (n = 3709). We excluded participants who continued an existing method (n = 307), did not select one of the 6 most common methods (n = 87), lacked valid data on the length among surveys (n = 286), or discontinued their enrolment method before 1 month (n = 147). Because we used measures designed for sexually active populations, we excluded participants not sexually active at baseline or 1 month (n = 335). Finally, we excluded respondents missing complete data on our outcome or main explanatory variables (n = 668). Our final analytical sample included 1879 individuals (Figure).

### Continuous quality improvement strategy for increasing immediate postpartum long-acting reversible contraceptive use at jimma university medical center, jimma, Ethiopia [^2cae3f71]. BMJ Open Quality (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

The study showed that the baseline prevalence of LARCs use at JUMC over 8 weeks before intervention was only 6.9%. Of these, implant accounts for 5.6% and IUD accounts for 1.3%.

Our finding is similar with the recent study from Ethiopia about the proportions of LARCs methods use but low with regard to the immediate postpartum LARCs use, which is 21.3%. Low utilisation of LARCs is also reported by the United Nations which showed, that only 15.5% of women worldwide use IUDs, and only 3.4% use subdermal implants. The common reasons for low uptake include misperceptions about the safety and efficacy of LARCs, perceived lack of consumer demand, inadequately trained providers and the relative complexity of providing LARCs compared with short-acting methods. Our study finding was also comparable with a study done in one of the Kenyan Hospitals, which showed a low prevalence of LARCs due to the barriers like; lack of staff skills in counselling and provision of LARCs, poor community awareness of LARCs and lack of family planning commodities in the maternity ward.

### Five-year contraceptive efficacy and safety of a levonorgestrel 52-mg intrauterine system [^986f2be2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 45% of pregnancies each year are unintended. Females who use long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods, specifically the currently available copper intrauterine device, levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), or single-rod contraceptive implant, have substantially lower rates of unintended pregnancy than those using other methods of reversible contraception. These methods are not new in the United States with U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the currently available copper intrauterine device in 1986, the first LNG-IUS in 2000, and the single-rod implant in 2002. However, for many years, multiple barriers to access limited their use. The Contraceptive CHOICE study in St. Louisand two population-based clinical intervention projects, aimed at decreasing barriers to access for LARC methods showed substantial increases in LARC uptake and decreases in unintended pregnancy and abortion rates.

Long-acting reversible contraception use has increased in the United States over the past decade, with data demonstrating an increase from 6% (2008 data) to 14% (2014 data) of contracepting females. Approximately two thirds of females obtaining a LARC method choose a hormonal IUS. Even with the introduction of mandated contraceptive coverage without cost sharing for insured individuals through the 2010 Affordable Care Act, females without insurance, with insurance through entities claiming religious exemptions, or who do not qualify for medical assistance still encounter significant financial barriers. Individual cost for contraception is a significant public health concern because socioeconomic level has an important relationship to unintended pregnancy. In 2011, females with household incomes below 200% of the federal poverty level had a 5.6-fold greater risk of unintended pregnancy than those with higher incomes. This disparity has increased from a 2.5-fold difference in 1994.

To address these barriers, Medicines360, a nonprofit pharmaceutical company, developed a new LNG 52-mg IUS, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2015 for 3 years of contraception based on an ongoing phase 3 study. The IUS was brought to market at a $50 price for public sector clinics participating in the Federal 340B drug discount program. Four-year U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval was granted in October 2017. In this evaluation, we aim to report the data supporting a 5-year contraceptive indication.

The Sponsor, Medicines360, designed the study and oversees its conduct, including funding the trial, and provided all study product free of charge to participants.

Results

Baseline

Out of 798 deliveries seen over 8 weeks before the baseline survey, 789 mothers were candidates for counselling and offering of LARCs excluding those for whom Bilateral tubal ligation and total abdominal hysterectomy were done. Of these, only 55 (6.9%) postpartum mothers were provided with LARCs, out of which implant was provided for 45 (5.6) and IUD was for 10 (1.3%) mothers (figure 2).

A total of 100 immediate postpartum mothers who gave birth at JUMC were randomly selected for exit interviews (table 2). From our study, 68 (68%) of the current pregnancies were unplanned, 59 (59%) mothers were para 2–4 and 71 (71%) have 3 and above alive babies. Nearly 95% of mothers who plan to have their next baby has plan to postpone their pregnancy beyond 2 and more years. Eighty-seven per cent of mothers were ever heard about LARCs methods, and 50 (57.5%) were counselled about LARC during ANC visits. Of the current participants, 35 (40.2%) were provided with Implants and only 2 mothers were provided with IUD.

Table 2
Reproductive information, knowledge and utilisation of immediate postpartum mothers at JUMC (March and April 2019)

Among the reasons why the immediate postpartum women did not use LARCs were, fear of side effects in 17 (26.9%), husband disapproval in 13 (20.6%) and taking after 6 weeks of delivery in 11 (17.5%). The other reasons were no trained healthcare providers and no commodities available at the labour and maternity service delivery units (table 2).

In addition to a mother exit interview, we also interviewed healthcare providers to know the challenges they face while offering contraceptives to postpartum mothers. Only 2 out of 45 midwives and none of the 51 residents working at the labour and maternity ward of JUMC were trained on contraception or LARCs. A total of 20 randomly selected midwives and residents were interviewed considering the saturation of information in our qualitative study. From this, 9 (45%) of health providers involved in an interview has no training and 7 (35%) of them did not provide LARCs due to the unavailability of the commodities at the needed time in labour and maternity wards.

### Contraceptive prescribing and dispensing after the defense health agency's policy change [^841526ef]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

DHA-PI 6200.02 ensures that ADSW receive an adequate supply of SARCs to support deployment readiness and allows for dispensing up to a 12-month supply through military pharmacies. It also includes provisions for menstrual suppression. This aims to reduce clinic visits and unintended pregnancies, enhance adherence, and contribute to mission readiness. The policy also mandates timely access to contraception within 24 hours for ADSW before deployment, promotes counseling on LARC, and addresses storage challenges with SARC. Additionally, it requires annual evidence-based family planning education, covering contraceptive options, emergency contraception, menstrual suppression, and chronic condition management.

While the DHA-PI 6200.02 attempts to improve contraceptive care access, education, and counseling, its implementation and associated outcomes have not been evaluated. This study leveraged a pragmatic, retrospective design, to evaluate the implementation of DHA-PI 6200.02 using implementation science constructs such as adoption and fidelity, with a focus on extended contraception supply and related prescribing and dispensing practices within the MHS.

For women at an increased risk of pregnancy complications who are not pregnant — During counseling before pregnancy, women should be informed about both maternal and fetal health risks and strategies to prevent or reduce these risks, the first step should be to assess a woman's reproductive life plan, and if a woman does not desire pregnancy in the next year, counseling regarding appropriate contraception options is recommended; healthcare practitioners should consult The United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use when counseling high-risk women with preexisting conditions to verify safety and appropriateness of each option, and it is important to provide balanced information about all options to reduce the likelihood of reproductive coercion.

### Contraceptive counseling and methods for adolescents: clinical report [^1e50c381]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Adolescent decision-making capacity and counseling workflow — equity-based approach and method options emphasize capacity, reflection, and tailored choices. Research suggests adolescents make decisions differently than adults, yet "studies of overall capacity for health decisions demonstrated that adolescents have adult-type capacity to understand health information, weigh risks and benefits, and make rational, voluntary choices", and "in a study of contraceptive decision making, by 14 years of age, participants demonstrated the capacity to self-screen for medical contraindications… and make voluntary decisions". An adolescent-centered counseling approach "starts with a pediatrician reflecting on their own biases", and those declining care for conscience reasons "are directed to the AAP policy statement, 'Physician Refusal to Provide Information or Treatment on the Basis of Claims of Conscience'. "Referrals need to be time-sensitive, respectful, nonjudgmental and done with an awareness of the power differential". Next steps include "assessing the adolescent's stated goals and preferences… developmental needs and contextual factors", including whether a method requires "a prescription or procedure" and perceived efficacy. "After this assessment, the pediatrician can then present method options" and ideally provide a range "from over-the-counter (OTC) options like emergency contraception, condoms, and progestin-only contraceptive pills, which do not require a prescription and are not disclosed to guardians through the EHR or EOB, to prescription-based options such as combined hormonal contraceptive methods, the contraceptive injection, and long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) devices such as implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs)". Clinicians also "need to take into account and educate adolescents about access to contraception and abortion services based on state law", and "if the adolescent chooses, a partner can be included in contraceptive visits and decision making".

### Levonorgestrel (Liletta) [^8b53e53a]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

2.7 Continuation of Contraception after Removal

If a patient wishes to continue using LILETTA or another intrauterine contraceptive, insertion can occur immediately after removal.

If a patient with regular cycles wants to start a different birth control method, time the removal and initiation of a new method to ensure continuous contraception. Either remove LILETTA during the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle and start the new method or start the new method at least 7 days prior to removing LILETTA if removal is to occur at other times during the cycle.

If a patient with irregular cycles or amenorrhea wants to start a different birth control method, start the new method at least 7 days before LILETTA removal.

If LILETTA is removed but no other contraceptive method has already been started, the new contraceptive method can be started on the day LILETTA is removed. The patient should use a backup barrier method of contraception (e.g., condoms) or abstain from vaginal intercourse for 7 days to prevent pregnancy.

### Interdependent barriers to providing adolescents with long-acting reversible contraception: qualitative insights from providers [^4a8dd04b]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods are the most effective form of reversible contraception but are underutilized by adolescents. The purpose of this study was to identify the context-specific barriers to providing adolescents with LARC that are experienced by pediatricians, family medicine physicians, and advanced practice nurses (APNs).

Design, Setting, Participants, and Interventions

Pediatricians, family medicine providers, and APNs (n = 16) who care for adolescents participated in semistructured qualitative interviews. Interview data were analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach.

Main Outcome Measures

Pediatricians, family medicine physicians, and APNs self-reported attitudes and practices regarding LARC provision to adolescents.

Results

Provider confidence in LARC, patient-centered counseling on LARC, and instrumental supports for LARC all work interdependently either in support of or in opposition to provision of LARC to adolescents. Low provider confidence in LARC for adolescents was characterized by confusion about LARC eligibility criteria and perceptions of LARC insertion as traumatic for adolescents. Patient-centered counseling on LARC required providers' ability to elicit patient priorities, highlight the advantages of LARC over other methods, and address patients' concerns about these methods. Instrumental support for LARC included provider training on LARC, access to and financial support for LARC devices, and opportunity to practice LARC insertion and counseling skills.

Conclusion

Although none of the identified essential components of LARC provision to adolescents exist in isolation, instrumental support like provider training on LARC and access to LARC devices have the most fundamental effect on the other components and on providers' attitudes and practices regarding LARC for adolescents.

### Free contraception and behavioural nudges in the postpartum period: evidence from a randomised control trial in nairobi, Kenya [^5370c4f8]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Intervention design, procedures and timeline

Women were eligible to participate in the study if they attended ANC services at Jacaranda, were between 18 years and 40 years old, had a gestational age of at least 7 months at the time of enrolment and could provide a valid phone number by which they could be reached in the postpartum period. Six hundred and eighty-six women attending ANC were consented and enrolled over that time period. Pregnant women were randomly assigned with equal probability to a 'standard voucher arm', a 'deadline voucher' arm or a control group. Both voucher arms received a voucher for free contraceptive methods to be redeemed at a Jacaranda Health facility, including condoms, injectables, implants, IUDs, combined and progestin-only oral contraceptives and counselling on effective use of the lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM). The value of the voucher ranged from US$0.92–US$6.45 depending on the method choice, with the largest value for the LARC methods of implants and IUDs. The 'deadline voucher' voucher expired 8 weeks after estimated date of delivery (EDD) and the 'standard voucher' expired 1 year after it was issued. A sample of each voucher is provided in online supplementary figure 1. The expiry date was made highly salient in the deadline voucher but not in the standard voucher. We used the EDD to determine the deadline date because the delivery date was unknown at the time of enrolment. Partway through the study, additional funding was received, which allowed us to expand the study (we refer to these periods as study phase 1 and phase 2). Around the same time, Jacaranda Health opened another maternity clinic, allowing for a larger potential sample size for the study. During the initial study period, we had observed unexpectedly low rates of redemptions of vouchers. Motivated in part by this observation, we designed an additional intervention to remind households of the opportunity to take up postpartum family planning. In November 2014, a cross-randomised additional treatment arm was added to the study design. Of the 686 total of women enrolled in the study, 339 were enrolled after November 2014 and, in addition to being randomly assigned with equal probability to one of three voucher arms, were also cross-randomised with equal probability into an arm that received a postpartum (5 weeks) SMS reminder or an arm receiving no SMS message, resulting in six treatment arms. Additional details about the study design and randomisation method are provided in the online supplementary appendix. Flow into experimental treatment arms is illustrated for each study phase in online supplementary figure 2a and b online supplementary figure 2ab online supplementary material 1.

### Prenatal intent and postpartum receipt of long-acting reversible contraception among women receiving medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder [^f52fe8d3]. Contraception (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Many women with opioid use disorder (OUD) do not use highly effective postpartum contraception such as long-acting reversible contraception (LARC). We evaluated factors associated with prenatal intent and postpartum receipt of LARC among women receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for OUD.

Study Design

This was a retrospective cohort study of 791 pregnant women with OUD on MAT who delivered at an academic institution without immediate postpartum LARC services between 2009 and 2012. LARC intent was defined as a documented plan for postpartum LARC during pregnancy and LARC receipt was defined as documentation of LARC placement by 8 weeks postpartum. We organized contraceptive methods into five categories: LARC, female sterilization, short-acting methods, barrier methods and no documented method. Multivariable logistic regression identified characteristics predictive of prenatal LARC intent and postpartum LARC receipt.

Results

Among 791 pregnant women with OUD on MAT, 275 (34.8%) intended to use postpartum LARC and only 237 (29.9%) attended the postpartum visit. Among 275 women with prenatal LARC intent, 124 (45.1%) attended their postpartum visit and 50 (18.2%) received a postpartum LARC. Prenatal contraceptive counseling (OR 6.67; 95% CI 3.21, 13.89) was positively associated with LARC intent. Conversely, older age (OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.91, 0.98) and private practice provider (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.32, 0.72) were negatively associated with LARC intent. Although parity was not predictive of LARC intent, primiparous patients (CI 0.49; 95% CI 0.26, 0.97) were less likely to receive postpartum LARC.

Conclusions

Discrepancies exist between prenatal intent and postpartum receipt of LARC among pregnant women with OUD on MAT. Immediate postpartum LARC services may reduce LARC access barriers.

Implications

Despite prenatal interest in using LARC, most pregnant women with OUD on MAT did not receive postpartum LARC. The provision of immediate postpartum LARC services may reduce barriers to postpartum LARC receipt such as poor attendance at the postpartum visit.

### Improving LARC access for urban adolescents and young adults in the pediatric primary care setting [^0588cdf8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

The objective of this quality improvement study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of integrating long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) delivery services into an academic pediatric primary care practice. Adolescent medicine providers in Baltimore, Maryland, were trained in LARC placement with gynecology providers integrated to offer onsite LARC placement and procedural support. Referrals, appointments, and contraceptive method choice/receipt were tabulated. Of 212 individuals referred for LARC consultations, 104 attended appointments. LARC placement at the initial referral increased from year 1 (N = 1) to year 2 (N = 42; P < .01). Adolescent medicine providers placed more LARCs in year 2 (N = 34) than year 1 (N = 0; P < .01). Patients aged 18 to 24 years were less likely to have a LARC placed than those aged 13 to 17 years (unadjusted odds ratio = 0.47 [0.26–0.86]). In conclusion, provider training and service integration of LARC services within a pediatric practice is feasible, acceptable, and increases LARC access and placement.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 55: counseling women at increased risk of maternal morbidity and mortality [^8076968e]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

A shared decision-making model — key components and definitions include deliberation (a process where patients become aware of choice, understand options, and have time and support to consider 'what matters most to them'), choice talk (conveys awareness that a choice exists, initiated by either a patient or a clinician, possibly before the clinical encounter), option talk (patients are informed about treatment options in more detail), and decision talk (patients are supported to explore 'what matters most to them', having become informed). Decision support is designed in two formats: 1) brief enough to be used by clinician and patient together and 2) more extensive, designed to be used by patients either before or after clinical encounters (paper, DVD, web). Awareness of options leads to the development of initial preferences, with the goal to arrive at informed preferences; informed preferences are personal preferences based on 'what matters most to patients', predicated on an understanding of the most relevant benefits and harms.

### Reproductive services for women at high risk for maternal mortality: a report of the workshop of the Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the fellowship in family planning, and the Society of Family Planning [^66085a99]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Counseling women at high risk of pregnancy complications — counseling content specifies risk education and pregnancy intention–aligned planning. "During pregnancy counseling, women should be made aware of both maternal and fetal health risks of pregnancy and how to prevent or reduce these risks", which "can be due to preexisting health conditions, effects of medication use, family or genetic history, or her physical environment". "If a woman does not desire pregnancy in the next year, counseling about appropriate options for contraception is recommended", and "the discussion should include information on safety, effectiveness, accessibility, affordability, and acceptability of the range of options". If a woman is ambivalent or desires pregnancy in the next year, "counseling should elicit her preferences and priorities in the context of her medical condition, include strategies to reduce risks before pregnancy, and connect her to relevant subspecialists or social services".

### Varenicline [^6bbb7ab6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

See FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide)

 Initiate Treatment and Continue to Attempt to Quit if Lapse

Instruct patients to set a date to quit smoking and to initiate varenicline tablets treatment one week before the quit date. Alternatively, the patient can begin varenicline tablets dosing and then set a date to quit smoking between days 8 and 35 of treatment. Encourage patients to continue to attempt to quit if they have early lapses after quit day [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

For patients who are sure that they are not able or willing to quit abruptly, a gradual approach to quitting smoking with varenicline tablets may be considered. Patients should begin varenicline tablets dosing and reduce smoking during the first 12 weeks of treatment, then quit by the end of that period and continue treatment for an additional 12 weeks for a total of 24 weeks [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

Encourage patients who are motivated to quit and who did not succeed in stopping smoking during prior varenicline tablets therapy for reasons other than intolerability due to adverse events, or who relapsed after treatment to make another attempt with varenicline tablets once factors contributing to the failed attempt have been identified and addressed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Studies (14.6)].

Values clarification methods and responding to patient questions — definition and application: Values clarification methods are defined as "methods to help patients think about the desirability of options or attributes of options within a specific decision context, in order to identify which option [they] prefer", may involve identifying management options, identifying aspects of options that are most important, and making comparisons between options, and when patients ask clinicians "What would you do?" the question can be used to elicit a patient's values without necessarily disclosing personal opinions; facilitating a values-based decision will lead to improved decision satisfaction and improved long-term outcomes, including coping and grief resolution.

Posthumous reproduction — policies on stored gametes and embryos emphasize that the obstetrician–gynecologist "may need to consider the ethics of the posthumous use of gametes and embryos for reproduction", and that reproductive tissue "may be cryopreserved". Patients "are strongly encouraged to state in writing their decisions regarding the disposition of their stored gametes and embryos in the case that one or both intended parents die before the gametes or embryos are used", and "such decisions should be made at the time of the initial treatment". "Options include transferring dispositional control… to a surviving partner or to a third party, donating them to research, or discarding them", and "these requests are normally honored". If others seek posthumous procurement, "family members or surrogate decision makers may ask physicians to… procure posthumous gametes for reproductive purposes", but "a request to obtain oocytes after a woman's death without the woman's prior consent or known wishes need not be honored".
