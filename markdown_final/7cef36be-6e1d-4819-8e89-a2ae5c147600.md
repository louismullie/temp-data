## Question

stress dose steroids do you need to taper?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether stress-dose steroids need to be tapered, and if so, how to do it safely and when to stop. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "stress-dose steroids" mean clinically and in which scenarios they are used. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology that drives the need for tapering. Next, I will review guideline-based taper strategies for different stress contexts, including surgery, intercurrent illness, and adrenal crisis. After that, I need to check how to monitor for recovery of adrenal function and when it is safe to stop stress dosing. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a practical, stepwise approach with safety checks and patient education points.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate concepts. Stress-dose steroids refer to temporarily increased glucocorticoid dosing during physiologic stress in patients with adrenal insufficiency or those at risk of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal suppression, to prevent adrenal crisis; they are not maintenance therapy and are intended to be time-limited, with subsequent taper back to baseline replacement or discontinuation when the stress resolves [^116teK7E] [^116uT6rM].

> I need to check the pathophysiology that mandates tapering rather than abrupt cessation. Chronic or high-dose exogenous glucocorticoids suppress the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis; abrupt withdrawal removes glucocorticoid support while the axis is still suppressed, risking hypotension, shock, or death, so the dose should be reduced as the stress abates to allow safe transition back to baseline or physiologic replacement while the HPA axis recovers [^116QSan5] [^114RmsKu].

> Next, I should review perioperative stress dosing and tapering. For major surgery, the standard is hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus followed by 200 mg over 24 hours by continuous infusion or 50 mg IV every 6 hours; wait, let me verify the duration — guidelines suggest tapering back to the patient's usual replacement dose within 48 hours after uncomplicated major surgery, extending to about a week if the surgery is more major or complicated, with clinical judgment guiding the pace and any need for ongoing stress coverage if complications persist [^113qzgbb] [^1168GXwd].

> For intercurrent illness, I should confirm the approach. Minor stress typically warrants doubling the physiologic replacement dose to about hydrocortisone 40 mg/day in divided doses for 2–5 days until well; moderate to major stress or inability to take oral medication requires parenteral hydrocortisone 100 mg IM/IV followed by 50 mg every 6 hours or 200 mg over 24 hours by infusion, with taper back to baseline as the illness resolves and oral intake returns, generally within a few days depending on clinical trajectory [^1144zn2F] [^115iAyid] [^113qzgbb].

> Hold on, I should verify adrenal crisis management and its taper. In suspected crisis, give hydrocortisone 100 mg IV/IM immediately, then 200 mg over 24 hours by continuous infusion or 50 mg every 6 hours, plus aggressive isotonic saline; once stabilized, taper the hydrocortisone to maintenance over roughly 24–72 hours while monitoring vitals and electrolytes, and initiate mineralocorticoid when the total daily hydrocortisone falls below about 50 mg if primary adrenal insufficiency is present [^113qame6] [^112yroaJ] [^117EArrH].

> Let me consider how to judge when tapering is safe and when to stop. I should double-check the recovery thresholds: a morning serum cortisol greater than about 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) obtained at least 24 hours after the last glucocorticoid dose suggests HPA recovery and supports stopping exogenous steroids; values 150–300 nmol/L indicate partial recovery and warrant continuation with reassessment; values less than 150 nmol/L suggest ongoing suppression and the need for continued physiologic replacement and follow-up testing, recognizing assay variability and clinical context [^113uLZzA] [^112CTWvK] [^112RBXX5].

> But wait, what if the patient is on long-acting agents like dexamethasone during the taper? I need to ensure we switch to shorter-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone or hydrocortisone before attempting taper or HPA testing, because long-acting agents can perpetuate suppression and confound assessment; this switch facilitates a safer, more interpretable taper and recovery evaluation [^111Ve9bU] [^1119HRB1].

> I should review special populations briefly. In children, weight-based stress dosing is used (about 50 mg/m²/day hydrocortisone divided every 6 hours or by continuous infusion), with rapid return to maintenance as soon as clinically feasible; in pregnancy, for cesarean delivery or active labor, use stress-dose hydrocortisone as for major surgery and taper promptly postpartum; in patients with immune checkpoint inhibitor–related adrenal insufficiency, taper stress doses over about 5–7 days to physiologic replacement once stabilized, with endocrine follow-up [^112Mcv51] [^114mDSxo] [^117PTETq].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and sanity-check each step. First, identify the stressor magnitude and choose an appropriate stress regimen (oral doubling for minor illness versus parenteral high-dose for major stress or crisis). Second, reassess daily during the stress period for clinical improvement and oral tolerance. Third, begin taper as soon as the stress abates: reduce parenteral dosing to oral physiologic replacement over 1–3 days in uncomplicated cases, or extend to about a week after major surgery or prolonged illness. Fourth, if uncertain about HPA recovery, obtain a morning cortisol at least 24 hours off steroids and act on the thresholds above. Fifth, provide clear sick-day education and emergency IM hydrocortisone instructions for future stresses, since suppression can persist months after glucocorticoid cessation [^113RVW44] [^114tSANd] [^114SnRMS].

> In conclusion, yes — stress-dose steroids should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly, with the pace dictated by the severity and duration of the stressor and by clinical recovery; the key is to match the taper to diminishing stress while monitoring for adrenal insufficiency and using simple biochemical criteria to confirm HPA recovery before final discontinuation, thereby minimizing the risk of rebound adrenal crisis [^116uT6rM] [^113qzgbb] [^113uLZzA].

---

Stress-dose steroids are tapered based on the severity of the stressor and clinical response [^116teK7E]. For **minor stress**, taper to baseline over 1–3 days; for **moderate stress**, taper over 3–5 days; and for **major stress**, taper over 5–7 days or longer if recovery is slow [^116teK7E]. Tapering is essential to avoid rebound adrenal insufficiency or crisis, and the dose should be reduced as the stress resolves, with close monitoring for signs of adrenal insufficiency [^112dAi4f].

---

## Indications for stress-dose steroids

Stress-dose steroids are indicated in patients with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency or those at risk of HPA axis suppression [^111TnnR9]. Common scenarios include:

- **Major surgery**: General anesthesia, extensive procedures, or surgeries involving significant blood loss [^1168GXwd].
- **Severe infection or sepsis**: Particularly when hemodynamic instability is present [^1125b7an].
- **Trauma**: Major injuries or accidents [^113JNJkX].
- **Critical illness**: ICU admissions, mechanical ventilation, or multi-organ failure [^113qzgbb].

---

## Recommended stress-dose steroid regimens

The following regimens are commonly recommended for stress dosing:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended stress-dose steroid regimen** |
|-|-|
| Major surgery | Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus at induction, followed by 200 mg IV infusion over 24 hours or 50 mg IV every 6 hours [^1156ffEy] |
| Severe infection or sepsis | Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus, followed by 200 mg IV infusion over 24 hours or 50 mg IV every 6 hours [^116J3aVt] |
| Trauma or critical illness | Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus, followed by 200 mg IV infusion over 24 hours or 50 mg IV every 6 hours [^113qzgbb] |

---

## Rationale for tapering stress-dose steroids

Tapering stress-dose steroids is essential to prevent **rebound adrenal insufficiency** or **adrenal crisis** [^113JNJkX]. Abrupt discontinuation of high-dose steroids can cause rapid suppression of the **HPA axis**, leading to inadequate endogenous cortisol production when the stressor resolves [^113SGRav]. Gradual tapering allows the HPA axis to recover and resume normal cortisol production [^113Eguj6].

---

## Recommended tapering strategies

Tapering strategies vary depending on the severity of the stressor and the patient's clinical response. The following approaches are commonly recommended:

| **Aspect** | **Minor stress (e.g. minor surgery, mild infection)** | **Moderate stress (e.g. moderate surgery, moderate infection)** | **Major stress (e.g. major surgery, severe infection, trauma, critical illness)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Initial dose | Hydrocortisone 25–50 mg IV/IM or 20–40 mg orally per day [^113qzgbb] [^1144zn2F] | Hydrocortisone 50–75 mg IV/IM or 40–60 mg orally per day [^1168GXwd] | Hydrocortisone 100–200 mg IV infusion over 24 hours or 50 mg IV every 6 hours [^1156ffEy] |
| Tapering | Reduce dose by 50% every 1–2 days until baseline replacement dose is reached | Reduce dose by 25–50% every 2–3 days until baseline replacement dose is reached | Reduce dose by 25–50% every 2–3 days, closely monitoring for signs of adrenal insufficiency |
| Duration | Total duration of stress dosing is typically 1–3 days | Total duration of stress dosing is typically 3–5 days | Total duration of stress dosing is typically 5–7 days, but may be extended based on clinical judgment and patient response [^117PTETq] |

---

## Clinical monitoring during tapering

During tapering, patients should be closely monitored for signs of adrenal insufficiency, including:

- Fatigue and weakness
- Nausea and vomiting
- Abdominal pain
- Hypotension
- Dizziness or syncope
- Confusion or altered mental status

If any of these symptoms occur, the taper should be slowed or temporarily reversed by increasing the steroid dose until symptoms resolve [^113uLZzA].

---

## Factors influencing tapering decisions

Several factors influence tapering decisions, including:

- **Severity and duration of the stressor**: Longer or more severe stressors may require prolonged tapering periods [^116teK7E].
- **Patient's baseline steroid dose and duration of therapy**: Patients on long-term or high-dose steroids may require longer tapering periods [^notfound].
- **Clinical response**: Patients who exhibit signs of adrenal insufficiency during tapering may require slower tapering or temporary dose increases [^113uLZzA].
- **Underlying medical conditions**: Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, or immunosuppression may influence tapering decisions [^112zPiSU].

---

## Risks associated with improper tapering

Improper tapering of stress-dose steroids can lead to significant complications, including:

- **Adrenal crisis**: Life-threatening hypotension, shock, and electrolyte disturbances [^notfound].
- **Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome**: Characterized by fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, and mood disturbances [^113REYhV].
- **Rebound adrenal insufficiency**: Inadequate endogenous cortisol production upon abrupt discontinuation of steroids [^112dAi4f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of individualized tapering strategies based on patient-specific factors and clinical judgment [^113uLZzA]. The Endocrine Society and other expert bodies recommend gradual tapering of stress-dose steroids, with close monitoring for signs of adrenal insufficiency during the tapering process [^113G6wSi].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Tapering is essential**: Stress-dose steroids should always be tapered gradually to prevent rebound adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis [^114PPKDv].
- **Individualized approach**: Tapering strategies should be individualized based on the severity of the stressor, patient's baseline steroid therapy, and clinical response [^112yroaJ].
- **Close monitoring**: Patients should be closely monitored for signs of adrenal insufficiency during tapering, with dose adjustments as necessary [^115u9Dcp].
- **Clinical judgment**: Tapering decisions should be guided by clinical judgment, patient-specific factors, and current clinical guidelines [^113uLZzA].

---

Tapering stress-dose steroids is a critical component of managing patients with adrenal insufficiency or HPA axis suppression. Gradual tapering, individualized to the patient's clinical scenario, helps prevent rebound adrenal insufficiency and ensures safe recovery of the HPA axis [^113uLZzA].

Rationale

Clinicians prescribing long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy should actively educate their patients about the potential development of adverse manifestations associated with exogenous Cushing syndrome during extended use. Furthermore, patients need to be informed about the risks of adrenal insufficiency, especially when tapering glucocorticoid medication below the physiologic daily dose equivalent (see Definitions section). Clinicians should also provide comprehensive guidance on the importance of stress dosing with glucocorticoids. (see recommendation 3.1). Informing patients of the adverse effects of glucocorticoids and methods to monitor and mitigate these outcomes is crucial to enhancing the beneficial aspects of glucocorticoid therapy while minimizing the undesired adverse events and risks thereof. Education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crises. Lastly, all patients initiating a glucocorticoid taper should be educated on the possibility of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome. The symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal have substantial overlap with symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and in some cases a disease flare, and can impede the tapering of glucocorticoids (see recommendation 2.3). Anticipation of these potential symptoms can increase awareness and minimize the need for urgent care.

R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

The adrenal gland cortex produces life-sustaining steroid hormones that are critical for the development and survival of the fetus and neonate. Antenatal and postnatal administration of steroids has critical therapeutic effects in preterm infants. However, prolonged postnatal steroid therapy for more than 1 to 2 weeks is associated with iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency and should prompt consideration of a steroid taper and stress dose precautions. In this review, we will describe fetal adrenal development and steroidogenesis, the effect of antenatal exogenous steroids, the therapeutic role of postnatal steroids, evaluation and treatment of adrenal insufficiency, and the role of steroid tapers after prolonged steroid treatment.

Glucocorticoid tapering and persistent adrenal insufficiency — patients with a history of glucocorticoid treatment/exposure presenting with manifestations of Cushing syndrome should be assumed to have a fully suppressed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and managed accordingly, and we suggest evaluation by an endocrinology specialist if there is no recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent and also for patients on glucocorticoids with a history of adrenal crisis. Adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after cessation, and persistent impairment beyond four years suggests recovery is very unlikely and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued, with additional testing beyond four years considered case-by-case. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone, and education is necessary on adjusting substitution doses during stressful situations to prevent or manage adrenal crises.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — tapering and discontinuation strategies are described with limited evidence: "There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering", and "Once glucocorticoids are targeted down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy". One approach is "a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (e.g., 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps", whereas others "prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated". Evidence generation is ongoing as "An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOAST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved (87)". During taper, "Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency", and "If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented".

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

Overview of topics to discuss when prescribing oral glucocorticoids describes that all patients on long-term supraphysiologic therapy should be counseled on the risk for developing exogenous Cushing syndrome at the time of initiation with education on common sequelae including weight gain, sarcopenia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and bone demineralization; the table also lists the risk for developing chronic adrenal insufficiency with emphasis that even transient adrenal insufficiency requires education to raise awareness of the need to stress dose when appropriate; for education on stress dosing strategies, eligible patients are those who have reduced dosing to physiologic or subphysiologic levels and should receive dedicated education at least when dosing approaches a physiologic range to prepare for routine and emergent stress dosing; education on injectable emergency glucocorticoid administration is included among considerations; and for glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, eligible patients are those ready to begin tapering at the time tapering begins, noting that some patients experience symptoms as the doses are tapered.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — important considerations and stress precautions: The figure states that the proposed cortisol cut-offs are only a guide and may vary according to the cortisol assay used and local protocols, that they only apply to patients who are not under major stress, and that they do not apply to subjects with abnormal CBG and albumin. Footnotes add that exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of the physiologic replacement dose range; that some patients with cortisol values close to the proposed 300 nmol/L (10 μg/dL) cut-off may have suboptimal cortisol response when exposed to major stress, so clinicians should rely on clinical judgment, offer stress glucocorticoid coverage, and that dynamic testing may also be considered; and that some patients may develop glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms and may benefit from gradual tapering rather than abrupt discontinuation.

Abstract

Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. This results in at least 1% of the population using chronic glucocorticoid therapy, being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. This risk is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility. Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it necessitates careful education and management of affected patients. Tapering glucocorticoids can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency. In general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly within a supraphysiological range, followed by a slower taper when on physiological glucocorticoid dosing. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. This first European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society joint clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid clinicians involved in the care of patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to consider offering any of the following in patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent aiming to discontinue corticosteroid therapy:

- continued gradual taper in conjunction with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency

- testing with a morning serum cortisol.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to corticosteroid therapy, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to administer stress dose coverage in case of being exposed stress in patients with current or recent corticosteroid use who have not undergone biochemical testing to rule out corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency.

### Prevention of adrenal crisis: cortisol responses to major stress compared to stress dose hydrocortisone delivery [^116teK7E]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our data provide evidence that hydrocortisone stress dose cover during surgery, trauma, and major illness in patients with adrenal insufficiency should be provided by continuous intravenous infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone over 24 hours, following the administration of an initial intravenous hydrocortisone bolus of 50–100 mg.

The required duration of such stress dose cover is an important consideration and data on circulating cortisol concentrations beyond 2 days after the onset of major physical stress are scarce. However, a recently published study has followed patients with major trauma from injury to 6 months after recovery, describing increased urinary cortisol metabolite excretion for up to 8 weeks after trauma and increased cortisol reactivation by 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 peaking at 2 weeks after severe injury and normalizing by 8 weeks. In essence, the ability to taper back to normal replacement doses will depend on whether significant systemic inflammation is still present, if the patient is still looked after in the intensive care unit setting, and is nil by mouth. With regard to elective surgery, the Endocrine Society's US primary adrenal insufficiency guidelines and the recent UK guidelines for the perioperative management of glucocorticoid replacement in adrenal insufficiency recommend that high-dose glucocorticoid replacement should be tapered back to the routine maintenance dose within 48 hours, extending this to up to a week if surgery is more major or complicated, with clinical judgement used to guide this process. Both guideline groups had access to the results of this study, which in both instances resulted in expert consensus to recommend continuous intravenous infusion as the preferred administration mode for hydrocortisone during major stress.

Adrenal crisis prevention and stress dosing in current or recent glucocorticoid users: We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea.

5.4.4 Preoperative corticosteroids

Statement 108. We recommend that prior to elective surgery for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, corticosteroids should be stopped or dose minimised wherever possible to reduce risk of postoperative complications (GRADE: strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 94.6%).

Patients undergoing IBD surgery while on corticosteroids have an increased risk of postoperative infectious complications and anastomotic leaks. There is some evidence that risks are greater for those taking high-dose steroids (40 mg prednisolone or more). A comparison of prednisolone doses greater than 20 mg versus 20 mg or less did not show a significant difference in risk of infections. Use of more than ≥ 15 mg oral corticosteroid in UC patients within 30 days of IPAA surgery, or more than ≥ 20 mg in the setting of proctocolectomy, is associated with increased risk of complications. IBD patients having elective surgery should have their corticosteroids stopped if possible, or brought to as low a dose that can be managed without deterioration.

Statement 109. We recommend that IBD patients who have been on oral corticosteroids for more than 4 weeks prior to surgery should receive an equivalent intravenous dose of hydrocortisone while nil by mouth in the perioperative period (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

Patients who are on corticosteroids at the time of their IBD surgery should be given intravenous hydrocortisone in equivalent dosage until they can resume oral prednisolone. Prednisolone 5 mg is equivalent to hydrocortisone 20 mg or methylprednisolone 4 mg. There is no value increasing steroid dosage to cover stress in the perioperative period, as shown in a randomised trial in IBD surgeryand case series. Anaesthetists will generally give a single steroid dose prior to induction (such as dexamethasone 4 mg intravenous or intramuscular) for those taking more than 5 mg prednisolone. Patients who are on physiological corticosteroid replacement because of disorders of the hypothalamic pituitary axis (such as oral hydrocortisone 20 mg mane, 10 mg nocte) should receive supplementary doses in the perioperative period. For patients who have had complete resection of active disease, it is important to avoid inappropriate prolongation of steroids after surgery, and there is virtue in standardised steroid-taper protocols in the postoperative period, dependent on the dose and duration of steroids preoperatively (table 11).

Postoperative prednisolone tapering

5.4.5 Preoperative thiopurines

With one exception, the literature on the use of immunosuppressive therapy (thiopurines and methotrexate) leading up to surgery does not describe an association with an increased risk of postoperative complications.

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remain limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○)

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Schematic representation of HPA axis recovery following discontinuation of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy (adapted from: Prete and Bancos 2021).

There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering. Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy necessitates a cautious approach due to an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency, though the risk of clinically relevant adrenal crisis is generally low. Although glucocorticoid dose and treatment duration are associated with the development of adrenal insufficiency, predicting the risk of adrenal insufficiency remains challenging. A uniform approach to tapering the glucocorticoid dose has not yet been established and there is a lack of sufficient data on this topic (see Clinical question II). While some authors recommend a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps, others prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOASST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — non-biochemical tapering and monitoring: In Scenario 1, biochemical confirmation of normal cortisol production is not desired/feasible; the steps are to gradually taper down glucocorticoids and eventually stop, and to closely monitor the patient for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency/glucocorticoid withdrawal throughout the tapering period and after glucocorticoid discontinuation. If there are clinical concerns, options are to move to Scenario 2 or temporarily increase the glucocorticoid dose and taper down over a longer period.

### Dexamethasone (taperDex 12-day) [^111TBBG5]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For oral administration: The initial dosage of dexamethasone varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated.

It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient.

After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached.

Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m²body surface area/day).

Glucocorticoid therapy — clinician-delivered patient education includes the directive, "We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)", with emphasis to educate on adverse manifestations of exogenous Cushing syndrome during long-term supraphysiologic use, inform about the risk of adrenal insufficiency especially when tapering below a physiologic daily dose equivalent, provide guidance on stress dosing, and anticipate glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome; education on stress and emergency dosing can prevent symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and hospitalizations for adrenal crisis.

Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) — intercurrent illness and perioperative stress dosing: For home management of illness with fever, hydrocortisone replacement doses are doubled (> 38°C) or tripled (> 39°C) until recovery (usually 2 to 3 d). When unable to tolerate oral medication due to gastroenteritis or trauma, adults receive im or sc hydrocortisone 100 mg; children receive im hydrocortisone 50 mg/m² or estimate; infants 25 mg; school-age children 50 mg; adolescents 100 mg. For minor to moderate surgical stress, hydrocortisone 25–75 mg/24 h is used (usually 1 to 2 d), and for children im hydrocortisone 50 mg/m² or hydrocortisone replacement doses doubled or tripled. For major surgery with general anesthesia, trauma, delivery, or disease requiring intensive care, hydrocortisone 100 mg per iv injection is followed by continuous iv infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone/24 h (alternatively 50 mg every 6 h iv or im), with children given hydrocortisone 50 mg/m² iv followed by hydrocortisone 50–100 mg/m²/d divided q 6 h; weight-appropriate continuous iv fluids include 5% dextrose and 0.2 or 0.45% NaCl, with rapid tapering and switch to oral regimen depending on clinical state.

### What is the best approach to tailoring hydrocortisone dose to meet patient needs in 2012? [^112zKy3X]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Cortisol is an essential stress hormone and replacement with oral hydrocortisone is lifesaving in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Cortisol has a diurnal rhythm regulated by the central body clock and this rhythm is a metabolic signal for peripheral tissue clocks. Loss of cortisol rhythmicity is associated with fatigue, depression and insulin resistance. A general principle in endocrinology is to replace hormones to replicate physiological concentrations; however, the pharmacokinetics of oral immediate-release hydrocortisone make it impossible to fully mimic the cortisol rhythm and patients still have an increased morbidity and mortality despite replacement. Traditionally, physicians have replaced hydrocortisone with a total daily dose based on the diurnal 24-h cortisol production rate with hydrocortisone given twice or thrice daily, with the highest dose first thing in the morning. Monitoring treatment and dose titration has been much debated with some clinicians using cortisol day curves and others relying on clinical symptoms. The main challenge is that there is no established biomarker of cortisol activity. In addressing the clinical question, we have taken the view that an understanding of the cortisol circadian rhythm and hydrocortisone pharmacokinetics is essential when tailoring hydrocortisone dose. Using this approach, we have developed a thrice daily, weight-related, dosing regimen and a pharmacokinetic and clinical method to monitor treatment. Our argument for replicating the cortisol circadian rhythm is based on the observation that disruption of the rhythm is associated with ill health, and the few studies that have compared different treatment regimens. Further studies are required to definitively test the benefits of replacing the cortisol circadian rhythm in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

Systemic glucocorticoid taper for non-endocrine conditions — short-term versus long-term, withdrawal, and transition: We suggest not to taper in short-term therapy of < 3–4 weeks and state glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing; for long-term therapy, taper only if the underlying disease is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required, aiming toward a physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome with temporary dose increase and prolongation of taper if severe. We recommend against routine adrenal insufficiency testing on supraphysiologic doses or when glucocorticoids are still needed. We suggest switching from long-acting (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting agents are no longer needed. We suggest that at a physiologic daily dose equivalent, patients either continue gradual taper with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or be tested with a morning serum cortisol.

### New guidelines on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency: the end of short synacthen test in rheumatology? [^113oKEDG]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of GIAI were recently published for the first time by the European Society of Endocrinology (ESE) and the Endocrine Society (ES). The experts recommend that the risk for adrenal insufficiency should be considered for GC treatment durations exceeding 3–4 weeks and doses greater than the physiological levels (ie, equivalent of 15–25 mg/day hydrocortisone or 4–6 mg/day prednisone). Figure 1 summarises the two proposed approaches for managing the risk of adrenal insufficiency during the discontinuation of GC therapy. The initial step in both approaches involves tapering GC doses to physiological replacement levels, following a switch from long-acting GCs (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to short-acting GCs (eg, prednisone or hydrocortisone) when applicable. Interestingly, the recent STAR study demonstrated that tapering prednisone by 1 mg/day each month or replacing prednisone with 20 mg/day of hydrocortisone for 3 months, followed by a reduction to 10 mg/day for an additional 3 months, resulted in comparable rates of successful GC withdrawal at 1 year in patients with RA. Once tapering of GC doses to physiological levels has been achieved, the ESE/ES experts propose two options: either gradually tapering GCs while monitoring for clinical signs of adrenal insufficiency (option 1), or, more cautiously, assessing morning serum cortisol levels at least 24 hours after the last GC dose (option 2). To date, no studies have shown the superiority of either approach. Physicians must keep in mind that, in addition to implementing an appropriate GC discontinuation scheme, preventing adrenal crises necessitates patient education on sick-day rules, emphasising the importance of temporarily increasing GC doses during periods of physiological stress or surgical procedures.

Summary of Recommendations

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

1. General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice) R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○) R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice) R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice) R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice) R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○) R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○) R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum, with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○) As a guide: 1.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; 2.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months); 3.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months. R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○) R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1.000000000000000e+00 with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2.000000000000000e+00 using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3.000000000000000e+00 using high-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4.000000000000000e+00 using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5.000000000000000e+00 who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6.000000000000000e+00 receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. R 2.10 — We suggest that patients with current or previous glucocorticoid treatment presenting with signs and symptoms of exogenous Cushing syndrome are assumed to have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. (Good clinical practice) R 2.11 — We suggest that patients aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids, but without recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent, should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. We suggest that patients on glucocorticoids and history of adrenal crisis should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. (Good clinical practice) R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

Adrenal crisis prevention and stress dosing with current or recent glucocorticoid use — we recommend that patients who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when exposed to stress, with oral glucocorticoids used for minor stress without hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting/diarrhea and parenteral glucocorticoids for moderate to major stress, anesthesia, prolonged avoidance/inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting/diarrhea. Such patients under minor stress or local anesthesia will require coverage with stress doses of oral glucocorticoids, and the recommended stress dose is double the physiologic replacement dose (ie, hydrocortisone 40 mg daily).

### Adrenal insufficiency in adults: a review [^114RmsKu]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency:

- **Definition**: Corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, also known as adrenal suppression, is a condition arising from prolonged or high-dose exogenous glucocorticoid therapy, which suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, leading to a decrease in endogenous cortisol production.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology involves the inhibition of the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone and ACTH due to the exogenous corticosteroids, leading to reduced production and secretion of cortisol from the adrenal glands. When the exogenous corticosteroids are reduced or stopped, the suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may not immediately resume normal function, leading to a deficiency in cortisol, especially during times of stress.
- **Epidemiology**: Corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency is the most common form of adrenal insufficiency in adult patients. Long-term oral corticosteroid use in the general population is estimated at 0.5–1.8%, with an absolute risk of 48.7% for developing adrenal insufficiency.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency include prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy, high-dose ICSs, and abrupt cessation of corticosteroids after prolonged use. Other risk factors include underlying diseases, age, and the number of treating clinicians involved in the care of the patient, as these factors may increase the likelihood of polypharmacy and the risk of iatrogenic events.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, patients with corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. These symptoms can be exacerbated by stress or infection, potentially leading to an adrenal crisis characterized by severe hypotension and shock.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency is generally good with appropriate management, which involves gradual tapering of the exogenous corticosteroids and supportive care. If left untreated or if treatment is delayed, the condition can lead to severe complications, such as adrenal crisis.

Rationale — Responsibilities and referral thresholds in non-endocrine glucocorticoid therapy: The guideline states that management of glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical skill to be handled by the prescribing clinician, with underlying disease guiding taper speed, and notes that the patient population is large (at least 1% of the general population) relative to endocrinology capacity. When stopping therapy, prescribing clinicians should educate their patient on tapering methods, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose; referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered when long-term supraphysiologic therapy causes HPA axis suppression greater than 1 year or when adrenal crises occur.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114YTyrW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Tapering of steroids for irAE management — taper length is individualized, but tapering should occur slowly, generally over 4–6 weeks; detailed oral and intravenous (IV) strategies, options for physiologic hydrocortisone when very low doses are reached, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis testing guidance are provided. Oral tapering is recommended over 4–6 weeks with a reduction in prednisone or prednisolone of 10 mg every 3–7 days until the dose is 10 mg/d, then reduced by 5 mg every 3–7 days; for IV steroids, tapering is recommended over 4 weeks or longer with initial IV methylprednisolone ≥ 1 mg/kg/d converted to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d at minimum, and longer tapers (> 4–6 weeks) may be required. When ready to drop below 5 mg of prednisone or 0.5 mg of dexamethasone after a longer course with concern for iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic dosing (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon) is an option; if needed for disease control, a simultaneous slow, low-dose taper can decrease by 1 mg prednisone per week, and HPA axis function can be tested 24 hours after the last oral hydrocortisone with AM cortisol and ACTH, with ACTH stimulation for ambiguous results.

Adrenal crisis — precipitating factors include, common to all patients with adrenal insufficiency, infections, acute illness including fever, physical trauma, surgery or other procedures requiring anesthesia, bowel procedures requiring laxatives or enema, labor and delivery, dental procedures, severe stress and pain including severe anxiety and bereavement, and strenuous exercise; factors specific to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency include abrupt glucocorticoid withdrawal during long-term treatment, tapering below physiological replacement doses, switching inhaled glucocorticoid types or doses leading to variability in systemic absorption, and initiation of strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers that increase liver metabolism of several glucocorticoids.

Rationale

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods to taper the dose, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose (Table 2). In the vast majority of cases, glucocorticoid taper does not cause any clinical endocrine concerns. In rare cases, however, when long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy has resulted in prolonged suppression of HPA axis (greater than 1 year), or when patients experience adrenal crises, referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered (see recommendation 2.11). However, it should be recognized that endocrinology providers have no specialized diagnostic approaches or therapies to facilitate unique care of glucocorticoid tapering. In this regard, the education and approach to stopping glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical process that every clinician who prescribes glucocorticoids should be familiar with.

R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

Pregnancy — glucocorticoid use and dosing: Nonfluorinated glucocorticoids should be used when needed, but substitution of steroid-sparing pregnancy-compatible immunosuppressive therapy is desirable when high-dose or prolonged use is required. We conditionally recommend continuing low-dose glucocorticoid treatment (≤ 10 mg daily of prednisone or nonfluorinated equivalent) during pregnancy if clinically indicated. We strongly recommend tapering higher doses of nonfluorinated glucocorticoids to < 20 mg daily of prednisone, adding a pregnancy-compatible glucocorticoid-sparing agent if necessary. Although there are only minimal data regarding prolonged treatment with low-dose glucocorticoids during pregnancy, we conditionally recommend against routine administration of stress-dose glucocorticoids at the time of vaginal delivery, but conditionally do recommend such treatment for surgical (cesarean) delivery.

Once glucocorticoids are tapered down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy (Fig. 2). Selecting one approach over the other might be driven by patient-related aspects including co-morbidities, co-medication, age and pre-test probability for adrenal insufficiency or by the medical context such as training and experience of the treating clinician or accessibility to laboratory diagnostics. There are no studies showing the superiority of any of these approaches in terms of clinical outcomes or cost-benefit.

Figure 2.
Proposed approach to systemic glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency. If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented. If the patient does not experience any symptoms, the tapering proceeds until glucocorticoid discontinuation.

Alternatively, patients may undergo testing with a morning serum cortisol (sample collected between 8:00 and 9:00) for the determination of HPA axis recovery (R 2.7). If adrenal insufficiency is documented, exogenous glucocorticoid should not be reduced below the lower end of physiologic replacement dose ranges to ensure adequate replacement for adrenal insufficiency, yet still providing a stimulus for HPA-axis recovery. Patients should be retested according to recommendations in 2.7. and further significant dose reduction should only occur with indication of HPA-axis recovery.

R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum (Considering this continuum, suggested cut-offs in nmol/l and μg/dL are not exact conversions but have been rounded to improve clinical applicability in an international context.), with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○)

As a guide:

we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely;
we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months);
we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

Glucocorticoid tapering safety — Evidence from included studies: One study considered only the patient group tapering glucocorticoids (n = 131), and another evaluated a rapid, individualized steroid-reduction algorithm after benralizumab initiation in 598 patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma; across all five studies, the data showed no symptomatic adrenal insufficiency or clinical events related to potential adrenal insufficiency during follow-up. The authors note that these results suggest it is often safe to stop glucocorticoids abruptly after short-term high-dose use, and that after long-term use, more rapid tapering at supraphysiologic dosing followed by a slower taper at physiologic dosing appears safe; no studies compared different tapering schemes.

### Methylprednisolone (methylprednisolone sodium succinate) [^1144vykQ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In general, high dose corticosteroid therapy should be continued only until the patient's condition has stabilized; usually not beyond 48 to 72 hours.

In other indications, initial dosage will vary from 10 mg to 40 mg of methylprednisolone depending on the specific disease entity being treated. However, in certain overwhelming, acute, life-threatening situations, administrations in dosages exceeding the usual dosages may be justified and may be in multiples of the oral dosages. It Should Be Emphasized that Dosage Requirements are Variable and Must Be Individualized on the Basis of the Disease Under Treatment and the Response of the Patient. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation, it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^112zPiSU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Glucocorticoids should only be tapered if the underlying disease no longer requires glucocorticoid therapy. In general, glucocorticoid taper can be faster and in larger decrements if the total daily glucocorticoid dose is high (eg, greater than 30 mg of prednisone). As the total daily glucocorticoid dose is approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (greater than equivalent of 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone, see Table 1), the taper should be slower and with smaller decrements (Table 4). In certain patients with glucocorticoid-induced complications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and hyperglycemia, glucocorticoid-induced psychosis, or herpetic keratitis, a more rapid glucocorticoid taper towards physiologic daily dose equivalent may be required. The pre-test probability of adrenal atrophy and concurrent adrenal insufficiency is high for patients taking long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses; adrenal function testing is unnecessary until a physiologic glucocorticoid dose is achieved.

Table 4.
Suggested tapering regimen depending on glucocorticoid dose

HPA recovery is possible once the glucocorticoid therapy has been tapered to a near-physiologic daily dose (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). At this time, taper or assessment for HPA recovery could be performed unless glucocorticoids at this dose are required for control of the underlying condition (for example transplant, or polymyalgia rheumatica).

It is helpful to consider the likelihood of adrenal insufficiency and the risk of underlying disease flare before planning further tapering. It is also important to consider the underlying comorbidities and evaluate concurrent drugs that could impact glucocorticoid metabolism and overall glucocorticoid exposure. Although lacking systematic evidence, empirically, the patient's previous history of success or failure of glucocorticoid taper may also help design the most effective glucocorticoid taper. Additional factors that may impact the risk of adrenal insufficiency include inter-individual variability of glucocorticoid pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics. A study examining oral and intravenous methylprednisolone found that 20% of individuals demonstrated increased clearance of methylprednisolone. In general, older individuals have reduced drug clearance, despite a small sample size in these studies, data suggest a considerable and multifactorial inter-individual variability in what would be considered a physiological glucocorticoid dose.

R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice)

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^116Enp9S]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Empowering patients with knowledge of the benefits and risks of glucocorticoid therapy is critical. Patients require information in an age, education level, and learning style-appropriate format, along with access to supportive social resources such as family members or care providers and disease-oriented support groups. We recommend the inclusion of at least one family member or primary caregiver in all education sessions.

Patient education and empowerment to adjust glucocorticoid doses according to stressors are essential to prevent severe symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis. Confidence in self-management to prevent adrenal crisis was demonstrated to be low in a large study that surveyed patients with adrenal insufficiency, including patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Poor disease knowledge and lack of awareness of adrenal insufficiency subtype diagnosis were associated with higher rates of adrenal crisis. Standardized patient education programs for patients and their relatives proved to be useful for sustainably improving the level of knowledge regarding the prevention of adrenal crisis, as well as self-confidence in dealing with the disease.

The risk for developing adrenal insufficiency and the potential for adrenal crisis during glucocorticoid treatment and taper is low but increases with the cumulative number of risk factors including glucocorticoid potency, administration route, dose and treatment duration (Table 3).

Table 3.
Risk factors for developing adrenal insufficiency, and susceptibility to adrenal crisis, during glucocorticoid therapy and withdrawal from therapy

The educational content and timing of education delivery should be individualized to each patient. This relates to adverse effects of glucocorticoid therapy, symptoms of withdrawal and adrenal crisis and means to prevent and treat adrenal crisis. Patients at low risk for developing adrenal insufficiency or adrenal crisis may not require substantial education when initiated on glucocorticoid therapy. In contrast, patients with a moderate-to-high number of risk factors should receive more intensive education to minimize the risk of adverse outcomes. They may require multiple, well-timed trainings that should be reinforced until their glucocorticoid therapy is discontinued (Table 2).

2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○)

Combined stress-hormone approaches

Effectiveness of stress-hormone interventions may depend on timely administration and/or dose for prompt onset of action, and/or use of concurrently administered combinations. In a recent, two-center, randomized clinical trial (RCT) of in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA; participants, n = 184), we assessed the effect of methylprednisolone 40 mg, or placebo (plus repeated 1-mg epinephrine) during ALS, followed by postresuscitation hydrocortisone (240 mg/day for 7 days maximum and gradual taper) or placebo on several physiological and long-term outcomes. Neutral results, primarily on early post-ROSC arterial pressure and inflammatory response, strongly implied a resistance to previously well-documented, circulatory and immunomodulatory effects of steroids. Nevertheless, single, high-dose (i.e. 250 mg) methylprednisolone within 5–30 min following successful out-of-hospital ALS has been recently associated with lower postresuscitation interleukin-6, improved postresuscitation hemodynamics and higher probability of survival to discharge; these benefits might reflect a rapid, nongenomic, high-dose methylprednisolone action.

A major characteristic of our IHCA-steroids RCT was prolonged median ALS duration, i.e. 25–27 min. Notably, pooled data analyses (n = 368) from our two, prior vasopressin-steroids-epinephrine (VSE) RCTs revealed median ALS duration of just 14 min in VSE patients, as opposed to 20 min in controls. In these RCTs, we added up to five doses of 20-IU vasopressin to epinephrine during ALS to maximize CPP/expedite ROSC by concurrent stimulation of V1A vasopressin and alpha-1 adrenergic receptors; stress-dose steroids were also given during and after ALS for their hypertensive/anti-inflammatory effects. Triple stress-hormone intervention resulted in higher ROSC-rates and postresuscitation arterial pressure, lower serum cytokine concentrations, more organ failure-free days, and improved long-term outcomes.

### 'Should we stop or continue conventional synthetic (including glucocorticoids) and targeted DMARDs before surgery in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases?' [^115EB4dA]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Long-term glucocorticoid therapy cannot be abruptly stopped during a physiologic stress such as surgery, however, out of concern for adrenal insufficiency causing hypotension and even death. The question for clinicians is whether to administer supraphysiologic doses ('stress dose steroids') at the time of surgery to prevent adrenal insufficiency or continue the usual dose; however, stress dosing, or supraphysiologic doses meant to mimic the response to stress, remains prevalent. There are little data to guide the need for stress dosing. In a systematic review that included seven observational cohorts and two randomised controlled trials and included 315 patients and 389 operations, there was no haemodynamic difference between those receiving stress dosing compared with those who did not, and measuring cortisol levels was not helpful. Given the potential for an increase in infection risk and little data to support its use, the ACR/AAHKS guideline recommends giving only the usual daily dose of glucocorticoids on the day of surgery for adults receiving chronic steroids for their rheumatic condition at the time of elective TKA and THA.

### Perioperative management of patients treated with glucocorticoids [^116TqjQm]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

HPA suppression is a common consequence of glucocorticoid therapy, whereas overt secondary adrenal insufficiency is a rare but life-threatening condition. Prolonged hypotension and a response to adequate doses of a glucocorticoid agent are not reliable ways to assess adrenocortical function. One must also demonstrate plasma cortisol levels that are inappropriately low for the clinical situation. Hypotension in patients previously treated with glucocorticoids is caused by loss of the permissive effect of glucocorticoids on vascular tone, which may be related in turn to enhanced PGI2 production in the absence of glucocorticoids. It is not caused by mineralocorticoid deficiency. Recurrent problems of study design and interpretation have plagued this area of investigation. Any patient who has received a glucocorticoid in doses equivalent to at least 20 mg a day of prednisone for more than 5 days is at risk for HPA suppression. If the doses are closer to but above the physiologic range, 1 month is probably the minimal interval. Recovery from prolonged exposure to high doses of glucocorticoids may take up to 1 year. Pituitary function returns before adrenocortical function. Recovery from short courses of treatment (e.g., 5 days) occurs more rapidly, in about 5 days. Recovery is time-dependent and spontaneous. The rate of recovery is a function of the dose and duration of therapy before tapering is started and while the dose is being reduced. ACTH therapy does not cause adrenocortical suppression but offers no advantage over glucocorticoids, has several disadvantages, and should no longer be used. Patients on alternate day glucocorticoid therapy have some suppression of basal cortisol levels but have normal or nearly normal responses to provocative tests of adrenocortical function. The standard short ACTH stimulation test is a reliable means of assessing adrenocortical function preoperatively. The low dose (1 microgram) short ACTH test is promising but has not been sufficiently well characterized, requires serial dilutions and cannot be recommended at this time. Studies of the physiologic adrenocortical response to surgical stress provide a basis for revised dose recommendations for perioperative coverage in the patient with known or suspected HPA suppression. Recommendations of a multidisciplinary group are presented.

Pathophysiology of Glucocorticoid-induced Adrenal Insufficiency

Glucocorticoids suppress HPA axis activity by inhibiting the production of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) by the hypothalamus and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary. Inhibition of CRH and ACTH induced by exogenous glucocorticoids is similar to the mechanisms involved in the physiologic cortisol negative feedback. Prolonged duration of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy often leads to a reduction in the overall responsiveness of the anterior pituitary gland. In rodent models, glucocorticoids exert pro-apoptotic effects on the pituitary gland and promote protein degradation as represented by Crooke's hyaline in corticotroph cells. This ultimately results in atrophy of the adrenal cortex. Conversely, following withdrawal of glucocorticoids, there is resurgence of ACTH stimulation of the adrenal cortex. In most instances, the adrenal cortex will recover and produce adequate levels of cortisol. Despite these adaptive responses, the time to full biochemical and clinical restitution of the HPA axis is highly variable.

Any glucocorticoid dose above the physiologic daily dose equivalent can potentially lead to suppression of the HPA axis. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure, which, amongst other factors, is determined by potency of the glucocorticoid (Table 1), glucocorticoid dose, length of therapy, and individual susceptibility. Notably, any route of administration has the potential of HPA axis suppression, including oral, topical, inhaled, intra-nasal, intravenous and intra-articular administration.

Table 1.
Pharmacologic characteristics of commonly prescribed systemic glucocorticoids

With regards to glucocorticoid therapy, immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory doses considerably exceed the equivalent of endogenous cortisol production and, therefore, invariably result in HPA axis suppression. While tapering glucocorticoids within the supraphysiologic dose range, patients can develop glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, which manifests with clinical features similar to those of adrenal insufficiency. However, symptoms due to adrenal insufficiency are much more likely to develop when overall total daily glucocorticoid dose is below physiologic levels, or levels required for an adequate stress response.

Adrenal insufficiency

Adrenal insufficiency or hypophysitis, an endocrine immune-related AE seen with anti-PD-1/cytotoxic T lymphocyte 4 (CTLA-4) therapy and anti-lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3) treatment, may develop in about 0.5%–6% of patients treated with ICI monotherapy and 9%–11% treated with combination therapy. Patients with adrenal insufficiency have been and can be safely treated with non-myeloablative lymphodepletion, TIL, and IL-2. In some cases, patients may develop hypotension and require 2–3 times the usual maintenance fluids during lymphodepletion and/or IL-2 administration. Fluids can often be infused during lymphodepletion and tapered prior to TIL/IL-2 infusion. Endocrinology consult is recommended at admission. For patients with known adrenal insufficiency and/or prior hypophysitis, physiological replacement steroids (< 10 mg prednisone equivalent) should be continued at home dosing throughout the regimen. In our collective experience, many patients with adrenal insufficiency will not require stress-dose steroids and hence, we do not recommend administering them prophylactically. However, we have a low threshold to administer stress-dose steroids if hypotension develops in patients with known adrenal insufficiency. In the setting of adrenal insufficiency and fluid-resistant hypotension, stress-dose steroids should be administered in consultation with an endocrinologist per institutional standards.

### Prevention of adrenal crisis: cortisol responses to major stress compared to stress dose hydrocortisone delivery [^1147JxJ5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in response to stressful stimuli elicits increased glucocorticoid output aimed at restoring homeostasis. Cortisol is the major glucocorticoid produced by the human adrenal glands and is a key component of the physiological stress response.

Adrenal insufficiency is caused by failure of the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol, which can be caused by loss of function of the adrenal itself or its hypothalamic-pituitary regulatory center or, most commonly, long-term exogenous glucocorticoid treatment for other conditions. Patients with adrenal insufficiency are unable to produce adequate amounts of cortisol in response to stress and, therefore, require increased hydrocortisone replacement doses to avoid life-threatening adrenal crisis during surgery, trauma, or severe infection. Prevention of adrenal crisis is challenging and studies investigating the optimal dose and mode of steroid cover during major stress are lacking. Currently, administered hydrocortisone doses are chosen empirically rather than based on evidence. There is considerable variability in recommended administration modes, total doses, and dosing intervals. The lack of evidence-based recommendations for dose and mode of glucocorticoid replacement in major stress sends a confusing message to healthcare staff, which regularly exposes patients to harm.

This study was designed to determine the most appropriate hydrocortisone dose and delivery mode for patients with adrenal insufficiency during major stress. We employed tandem mass spectrometry to measure glucocorticoid concentrations in subjects with preserved adrenal function exposed to various conditions of stress and compared them to concentrations achieved after administration of stress dose hydrocortisone by a range of currently used delivery modes in patients with adrenal insufficiency.

A postoperative morning cortisol level higher than 15 μg/dL may mitigate the requirement for postoperative GC treatment, and a morning cortisol measurement might be useful even after intraoperative administration of dexamethasone.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — management during suspected adrenal crisis or stress specifies that for suspected adrenal crisis give hydrocortisone 100mg injection I.V. or I.M. followed by hydrocortisone 200mg infusion over 24 hours and provide fluid resuscitation with 0.9% saline solution; hydrocortisone infusion should be continued only in patients with confirmed adrenal crisis. During prolonged vomiting or diarrhoea without haemodynamic instability, absorption of oral glucocorticoids may be reduced and parenteral glucocorticoids should be considered to prevent adrenal crisis. For moderate to major stress, parenteral glucocorticoids are required until the stress has resolved to prevent adrenal crisis. For minor stress, extra glucocorticoids may not be needed for some patients already on glucocorticoids, whereas other patients should increase their daily glucocorticoid dose until the stress has resolved; in all cases, the need for extra cover and regimen must be guided by individual patient requirements and clinical judgment.

Adrenal — primary adrenal insufficiency (AI) during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy: Evaluate AM levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, with ACTH flagged if > 2× ULN and cortisol if < 3 μg/dL, obtain a basic metabolic panel plus renin and aldosterone, and for indeterminate results consider standard dose ACTH stimulation testing defined by AM cortisol > 3 μg/dL and < 15 μg/dL; adrenal CT is advised for metastasis or hemorrhage. For all grades, Referral to endocrinology and Education on steroid stress dosing, emergency injections, and a medical alert bracelet or necklace, accessory, or system are advised. For G1 (asymptomatic or mild symptoms), Consider holding ICI until patient is stabilized on replacement hormone; initiate hydrocortisone 15–20 mg in divided doses, titrate to maximum of 30 mg daily total dose, and add fludrocortisone starting dose 0.05–0.1 mg/d with renin response targeted to the upper half of the reference range. For G2 (moderate symptoms, able to perform activities of daily living), provide outpatient corticosteroid treatment at 2–3 times maintenance (eg, hydrocortisone 30–50 mg total dose or prednisone 20 mg daily), initiate fludrocortisone 0.05–0.1 mg/d, and decrease stress dose corticosteroids down to maintenance after 2 days. For G3–4 (severe or life-threatening, unable to perform activities of daily living), Hold ICI until patient is stabilized on replacement hormone, provide inpatient management with Normal saline (at least 2L), IV stress dose hydrocortisone 50–100 mg Q 6–8 hours initial dosing, and taper stress dose corticosteroids down to oral maintenance over 5–7 days. Additional considerations include hydrocortisone diurnal dosing — Typically, 2/3 of the dose is given in the morning and 1/3 in the early afternoon — and dose equivalence where Hydrocortisone 20 mg is equivalent to prednisone 5 mg.

In a patient with PAI, hydrocortisone doses of > 50 mg/day have sufficient action at the mineralocorticoid receptor, therefore additional mineralocorticoid therapy is not required at this point.

Prompt rehydration should be initiated with isotonic saline; a rapid IV infusion of 1 litre of isotonic saline within the first hour or 5% glucose in isotonic saline, followed by continuous IV isotonic saline guided by individual patient needs (usually 4–6 litres in 24 hours, while monitoring for fluid overload in high-risk patients, i.e. in patients with heart failure, renal impairment and in elderly patients). The patients should be managed in a critical care environment with close monitoring of vital signs and regular assessment of serum electrolytes should be performed to avoid rapid over correction of hyponatraemia. Patients may also require parenteral glucose therapy if hypoglycaemic. Treatment for the precipitant of the adrenal crisis should be also be instigated, if necessary, as well as venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, and consideration of a short course of proton pump inhibitor therapy to prevent potential gastric stress ulceration.

Urgent review by the endocrinology team is recommended to guide safe tapering of hydrocortisone to maintenance doses, in addition to guiding further investigations in a patient with unknown AI. If the patient is clinically stable, tapering of hydrocortisone to replacement doses can be initiated usually within 24–72 h. In patients with PAI, mineralocorticoid administration should be started as soon as total daily hydrocortisone dose is lower than 50 mg/24 h. During an admission with an adrenal crisis, the physician should take the opportunity to address the context of the acute medical admission and attempt to identify any missed opportunities that could have prevented the adrenal crisis and educate the patient and fellow clinicians further.

Rationale

As discussed in sections R1.2, R1.3, and R3.2, patients need to be educated on stress dosing of glucocorticoids aiming to prevent adrenal crises and their negative sequelae (Fig. 3). Potential adrenal insufficiency and the need for stress dosing should be considered even after discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy and replacement, particularly in those patients that had not undergone biochemical testing to confirm recovery of the HPA-axis. Based on a retrospective analysis mortality is increased particularly in the immediate period following the cessation of glucocorticoid therapy. Therefore, patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency who are under minor stress (eg, fever, infection requiring antibiotics, physical trauma, significant emotional stress) not leading to hemodynamic instability and with no evidence of oral glucocorticoid malabsorption (vomiting, diarrhea) or are undergoing a surgical procedure under local anesthesia will require coverage with stress dose of oral glucocorticoids (as a general guide, see Table 8). The recommended stress dose of hydrocortisone is the same as for patients with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency of other etiology: patients should receive double the physiologic replacement dose (ie, hydrocortisone 40 mg daily, usually split in three doses 20 mg on rising, 10 mg 12 midday, 10 mg 5). In patients using other glucocorticoid formulations, a dose equivalent to 40 mg hydrocortisone is suggested and this regime needs to be offered for the duration of the stress period eg, prednisone 10 mg total daily dose to be given in one or two divided doses (as a general guide, see Table 8). Particularly for patients undergoing surgery under general or regional anesthesia associated with long recovery time, parenteral stress doses of hydrocortisone or equivalent doses of other glucocorticoids such as methylprednisolone or dexamethasone are recommended (as a general guide, see Table 8). We base our suggested stress-dose glucocorticoid regimens on clinical practice and the guidelines from the Association of Anaesthetists, the Royal College of Physicians, the Endocrine Society and the Society for Endocrinology UK. However, we acknowledge that in the absence of robust evidence and head-to-head comparison of different glucocorticoid regimens, practices vary considerably among centers and lower doses are also routinely used in patients under moderate or major stress.

Perioperative management around pituitary surgery — AI, CH, DI, and retesting: We recommend using stress doses of steroids in AI before surgery and tapered doses after surgery before repeating testing. (1|⊕⊕⊕○). In patients with normal preoperative adrenal function, we suggest an individualized clinical approach for postoperative GC administration until the HPA axis can be evaluated. (2|⊕⊕○○). With preoperative CH, we recommend using L-T4 therapy before nonemergency surgery and throughout the perioperative period. (1|⊕⊕⊕○). With intact preoperative thyroid function, we recommend measuring fT4 levels 6–8 weeks postoperatively to assess for CH. (1|⊕⊕⊕○). We suggest that initial therapy for DI utilizes short-acting sc aqueous ADH, allowing for safer use in the vast majority of cases in whom DI resolves spontaneously. (2|⊕⊕○○). We do not suggest prescheduled DDAVP dosages in the first week postsurgery due to hyponatremia risk and SIADH that may occur 7–10 days after surgery. (2|⊕⊕○○). We suggest oral or intranasal DDAVP after discharge with instructions to use it only if significant polyuria occurs. (2|⊕⊕○○). We suggest retesting all pituitary axes starting at 6 weeks after pituitary surgery and then periodically to monitor the development or resolution of deficiencies. (2|⊕⊕○○).

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — biochemical confirmation pathway: In patients receiving supraphysiologic glucocorticoid doses and at high risk of adrenal insufficiency, taper down glucocorticoids to physiologic replacement doses (avoid dexamethasone), then in Scenario 2 measure early-morning serum cortisol 24 hours after the last glucocorticoid dose. A likelihood bar from HIGH to LOW displays cortisol thresholds at 150 nmol/L 5.0 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L 10.0 μg/dL. Actions presented are to continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few months, continue glucocorticoid replacement and re-check early-morning cortisol after a few weeks and consider dynamic testing, or stop glucocorticoid replacement. Separately, we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months.

If the child vomits the oral stress dose within 30 minutes, the caregivers can try another oral stress dose. If the child vomits again, IM HSS must be promptly administered. Caregivers are generally reluctant to inject their child with an IM medication. The preferred formulation is the Act-O-Vial®, where the liquid and powder medication are separated. These 2 components are mixed at the time of the injection. When reconstituted the Act-O-Vial® contains 100 mg HSS in 2 mL diluent. Adolescents and adults should receive 100 mg, school-age children should receive 50 mg, and infants/preschool children should receive 25 mg. However, families should clarify specific dose recommendations with their healthcare providers.

Caregivers must make sure the child is drinking adequate fluids to avoid dehydration. Fluids such as Pedialyte can be offered. Despite appropriate glucocorticoid stress dosing, children with CAH can become hypoglycemic, especially if they have not taken any food or fluid for several hours. Specific recommendations include 15 grams of simple carbohydrates such Gatorade TM, Pedialyte TM, and noncaffeinated sodas offered every 4 to 6 hours. Patients with gastrointestinal illnesses not readily responsive to oral fluids and stress dosing should go to the nearest emergency department for evaluation and intravenous fluids. Caregivers may feel more comfortable contacting the local emergency medical services (EMS) for transport to the hospital.

Whereas the general details regarding how much extra hydrocortisone should be given are established, the tougher question is "Does my child need to be stressed dosed now?" Caregivers often question whether their child is "sick enough" to be stress dosed. When in doubt, it is preferable that stress dosing is administered for 1 to 2 doses. When children require surgery, parents need to advocate that their child receives adequate glucocorticoid stress dosing in the perioperative period.

Patient

While rare, most sick days were related to infectious illnesses that seemed to affect me more than my peers. My parents had a low threshold for stress dosing and for going to the emergency room if intractable vomiting limited oral hydration or medication was regurgitated within 30 minutes of administration. Despite severe acute symptoms, intravenous hydration and HSS administration usually led to recovery within a few hours. I was often able to return to school the next day with an oral steroid taper over the next few days.

Stress dosing for CAH — in all patients who require glucocorticoid (GC) treatment, for febrile illness (> 38.5°C), gastroenteritis with dehydration, major surgery accompanied by general anesthesia, and major trauma, we recommend increasing the GC dosage (1|⊕⊕⊕○), and we suggest that stress dosing be given every 6 hours. For adrenal crisis, initial parenteral hydrocortisone (HC) doses are infants and preschool children 25 mg, school‑age children 50 mg, and adults 100 mg; successive IV HC may be administered as one‑quarter of the initial parenteral HC dose given every 6 h. In studies of adrenally intact children undergoing anesthesia and minor surgery, serum cortisol does not exceed 10 μg/dL (276 nmol/L), and therefore the need for stress dosing for minor procedures should be assessed on an individualized basis.

### The approach to the adult with newly diagnosed adrenal insufficiency [^1151VFKR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Adrenal insufficiency, primarily presenting as an adrenal crisis, is a life-threatening emergency and requires prompt therapeutic management including fluid resuscitation and stress dose hydrocortisone administration. Primary adrenal insufficiency is most frequently caused by autoimmune adrenalitis, and hypothalamic-pituitary tumors represent the most frequent cause of secondary adrenal insufficiency. However, the exact underlying diagnosis needs to be confirmed by a stepwise diagnostic approach, with an open eye for other differential diagnostic possibilities. Chronic replacement therapy with glucocorticoids and, in primary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoids requires careful monitoring. However, current replacement strategies still require optimization as evidenced by recent studies demonstrating significantly impaired subjective health status and increased mortality in patients with primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency. Future studies will have to explore the potential of dehydroepiandrosterone replacement and modified delayed-release hydrocortisone to improve the prospects of patients with adrenal insufficiency.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of CORTEF Tablets may vary from 20 mg to 240 mg of hydrocortisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, CORTEF should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of CORTEF for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually, rather than abruptly.

United Kingdom guidelines on the management of bone density in adults on steroid therapy recommend dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning for patients receiving > 7.5 mg/d for more than 6 months, and repeated every 1–3 years with the addition of bisphosphonate therapy for those patients on > 15 mg/d for more than 6 months. Bisphosphonate therapy has been used in a limited number of children with secondary osteoporosis from corticosteroid administration. Although short-term use has been well tolerated, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of bisphosphonates as standard therapy.

Growth retardation is a very important complication of steroid therapy in a disorder already associated with short stature. Growth curves should be closely monitored especially during periods of high growth velocity, such as in infancy and puberty. Steroid dosage should be kept to a minimum during these times. A growth plateau may indicate that steroids should be interrupted and substituted by a short-term transfusion program. Growth hormone therapy has been used successfully to increase growth velocity, but early, prolonged exposure to pharmacological doses of growth hormone should only be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis in DBA. As there is an increased risk of malignancy in DBA, including osteogenic sarcoma, the use of growth hormone should be individualized, although no relationship between the administration of growth hormone and cancer has been established.

Patients should be made aware of the danger of stopping steroids suddenly and of the need to inform any medical practitioner of current and past steroid treatment in order that stress doses be administered under appropriate conditions, i.e. surgery, sepsis, injury, and other emergencies. Maintenance treatment with steroids should be given as an early morning dose to minimize adrenal suppression. An endocrinological evaluation may be helpful in guiding a steroid taper after prolonged use.

Stress dosing advice: the 'sick day' rules

Education of patients and partner/family members regarding symptom awareness and the correct adjustment of glucocorticoid replacement dose is imperative. The following advice should be given.

Sick day rule 1: need to double the routine oral glucocorticoid dose when the patient experiences fever or illness requiring bed rest; when requiring antibiotics for an infection; or before a small outpatient procedure (e.g. dental work). The patient should ensure that they have an additional supply of hydrocortisone tablets so that they can double their dose for at least 7 days if required.
Sick day rule 2: need to inject a glucocorticoid preparation IM/IV in the case of severe illness, trauma, persistent vomiting, when fasting for a procedure (colonoscopy) or during surgical intervention.
Inject 100 mg hydrocortisone IV, IM, or subcutaneously followed by 200 mg hydrocortisone per continuous IV infusion, alternatively repeated bolus doses of 50 mg of hydrocortisone (IV or IM) every 6 h.

There are no randomized controlled studies that have evaluated the dose to be given in cases where the requirement for hydrocortisone is increased. Published recommendations therefore rest largely on expert opinion. The Addison's Clinical Advisory Panel (ACAP), a group of UK Endocrinologists who specialise in adrenal disease, give specific guidance to the ADSHG and physicians on glucocorticoid requirements and recommendations for adjustment for surgical procedures.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during taper — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper; when glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is present, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome, and in a recent study symptoms included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

### Deflazacort [^113SGRav]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Alterations in Endocrine Function

Corticosteroids, such as deflazacort, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving deflazacort for Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and adrenal insufficiency after deflazacort withdrawal. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at increased risk for adverse endocrine events.

Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal

Corticosteroids produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if corticosteroids are withdrawn abruptly, and can be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiency produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of corticosteroid therapy. The risk is reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment. This insufficiency may persist, however, for months after discontinuation of prolonged therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period of discontinuation, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may need to be increased.

A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in corticosteroid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels.

There are little data to support a specific steroid tapering schedule. Based on consensus, once the patient responds, the steroids should be weaned to an average daily dose of 1 mg/kg per day over 8–12 weeks. Reducing to an alternate day dosing schedule, often increasing the first day's dose while decreasing the second day's dose, can accomplish this. The dose should then be further tapered slowly to find the minimal maintenance dose necessary to keep the hemoglobin in the range of 80–100 g/l, the target level being determined by the individual patient's requirement to sustain growth and activity. The recommended maximum maintenance dose is ≤ 1 mg/kg every other day or ≤ 0.5 mg/kg daily. Steroids should be tapered more slowly, and with great care, below this level to reduce the risk of overshooting the minimal effective dose for that individual. If this occurs, the dose should be immediately increased to the previous level at which the hemoglobin was within target range. The hemoglobin should be monitored closely during this phase because a too rapid taper often necessitates the reinstitution of the initial 2 mg/kg per day dose to re-achieve response. If an acceptable hemoglobin cannot be sustained at the recommended dose, steroids should be tapered and discontinued. Some patients require very small doses for continued response.

### Dexamethasone (hemady) [^112dAi4f]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Alterations in Endocrine Function

Corticosteroids, such as HEMADY, can cause serious and life-threatening alterations in endocrine function, especially with chronic use. Monitor patients receiving HEMADY for adrenal insufficiency after corticosteroid withdrawal and Cushing's syndrome and hyperglycemia while receiving corticosteroids. In addition, patients with hypopituitarism, primary adrenal insufficiency, or congenital adrenal hyperplasia, altered thyroid function, or pheochromocytoma may be at risk for adverse endocrine events.

Risk of Adrenal Insufficiency Following Corticosteroid Withdrawal

Corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, with the potential for the development of secondary adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment. Acute adrenal insufficiency can occur if glucocorticoids are withdrawn abruptly and can be fatal. The degree and duration of adrenocortical insufficiently produced is variable among patients and depends on the dose, frequency, and duration of glucocorticoid therapy. The risk may be reduced by gradually tapering the corticosteroid dose when withdrawing treatment. This insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, corticosteroid therapy should be reinstituted. For patients already taking corticosteroids during times of stress, the dosage may have to be increased.

A steroid "withdrawal syndrome", seemingly unrelated to adrenocortical insufficiency, may also occur following abrupt discontinuance of corticosteroids. This syndrome includes symptoms such as: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headache, fever, joint pain, desquamation, myalgia, and/or weight loss. These effects are thought to be due to the sudden change in glucocorticoid concentration rather than to low corticosteroid levels.

Rationale

The use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of HPA axis and subsequent adrenocortical function impairment. This is due to the continuous and non-circadian glucocorticoid effect of these drugs, especially when administered systemically (Table 1).

Long-acting glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone or betamethasone, even in physiologic daily dose equivalent, are more likely to cause HPA axis suppression, exogenous Cushing syndrome, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when being tapered. HPA axis recovery is impossible in the setting of continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids. In contrast, intermediate- or short-acting glucocorticoids — which have both a shorter biological half-life and lower glucocorticoid potency — are more likely to allow HPA recovery, provided that they are not administered at nighttime, when they can more pronouncedly inhibit ACTH production and the early-morning rise of endogenous cortisol.

If treatment with long-acting glucocorticoids is no longer needed, we recommend changing to shorter-acting formulations such as prednisone, prednisolone, hydrocortisone, or cortisone acetate to promote recovery of the HPA axis. For patients on non-oral glucocorticoids, eg, inhaled steroids, in whom there is a concern for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate when non-oral glucocorticoids or no longer needed. Prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements, thus potentially enabling HPA axis to recover. For replacement of adrenal insufficiency, prednisone is usually provided as single morning dose, whereas due to shorter half-life hydrocortisone and cortisone acetate are divided into 2–3 doses with higher doses given in the morning and subsequent doses given at lunch and late afternoon if applicable.

Definitions

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered as a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency, is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — 3–4 weeks, or greater
Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

Physiologic daily dose equivalent: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability
Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy: Any dose greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above)
Short-term glucocorticoid therapy: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration
Long-term glucocorticoid therapy: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)
Glucocorticoid taper: Taper of glucocorticoid therapy dose, initially guided by the management of the underlying disease (= therapeutic taper), and later by the management of glucocorticoid withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency (= endocrine taper)
Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome: Symptoms experienced when lowering glucocorticoid dose within the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dose range, that are not due to the underlying disease for which the glucocorticoids were initially prescribed for and per definition not due to untreated adrenal insufficiency, as the total glucocorticoid daily dose is still supraphysiologic

Glucocorticoid doses vary based on glucocorticoid agent and are defined as physiologic within the lower and upper ranges to illustrate the inter-individual differences. In the recommendations, prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably.

### Cortisone acetate [^117FKJRD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

For Oral Administration

DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT.

The initial dosage varies from 25 to 300 mg a day depending on the disease being treated. In less severe diseases doses lower than 25 mg may suffice, while in severe diseases doses higher than 300 mg may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until the patient's response is satisfactory. If satisfactory clinical response does not occur after a reasonable period of time, discontinue cortisone acetate tablets and transfer the patient to other therapy.

After a favorable initial response, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial dosage in small amounts to the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response.

Patients should be observed closely for signs that might require dosage adjustment, including changes in clinical status resulting from remissions or exacerbations of the disease, individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of stress (e.g., surgery, infection, trauma). During stress it may be necessary to increase dosage temporarily.

If the drug is to be stopped after more than a few days of treatment, it usually should be withdrawn gradually.

Osteoporosis prevention and management in IBD.

Bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy are associated with the rare adverse effects of osteonecrosis of the jaw or atypical femoral fractures. Current UK guidance for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis recommends dental examination with preventative dentistry in those with dental disease or other risk factors (eg, use of corticosteroids or smoking). These guidelines also encourage patients to maintain good oral hygiene and regular check-ups with reporting of new oral symptoms (eg, dental mobility, pain or swelling) while on therapy. Treatment review is recommended to consider stopping bisphosphonate after 5 years (after 3 years for zolendronate) unless patients are aged over 70, have previous hip/vertebral fracture, sustain a fracture during treatment or are continuing ≥ 7.5 mg prednisolone, in which case treatment may be continued. If treatment is discontinued fracture risk should be assessed after a new fracture, or if no new fracture should be assessed after 18 months to 3 years.

5.2.8.4 Corticosteroid-related adrenal suppression

Good Practice Recommendation 18. Patients receiving prolonged courses of corticosteroids are at risk of adrenal suppression and should have a tapering course if stopping. They should be warned about possible steroid withdrawal syndrome, including non-specific symptoms such as weakness, nausea and arthralgia (Agreement: 97.8%).

Corticosteroid withdrawal syndrome can present with weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain, and so can mimic the underlying disease. It is under-recognised, occurring in about half of patients tested immediately after withdrawal of medium- or high-dose prednisolone used for long periods. Symptoms may be mild, with decompensation only when exposed to stressful situations, or can be severe. Stimulation tests (such as the ACTH test or short synacthen test) are abnormal in 46–100% immediately after stopping, but still abnormal in 26–49% after 1 week, and in a few patients remain abnormal 6–22 months later. Neither previous prednisolone dose nor duration are good predictors of the problem, which will occur with rectal-administered as well as oral steroids, and can occur after as little as 4 weeks of treatment. Steroid tapering does not completely prevent its occurrence. There is no optimal test to confirm adrenal suppression in this situation. Steroid dose and duration should be minimised where possible, with slow taper, and awareness when suggestive symptoms occur. Slow tapering of budesonide is not required as there is little or no suppression of the HPA axis.

### Glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency [^116uT6rM]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Synthetic glucocorticoids are widely used for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive actions. A possible unwanted effect of glucocorticoid treatment is suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. Factors affecting the risk of glucocorticoid induced adrenal insufficiency (GI-AI) include the duration of glucocorticoid therapy, mode of administration, glucocorticoid dose and potency, concomitant drugs that interfere with glucocorticoid metabolism, and individual susceptibility. Patients with exogenous glucocorticoid use may develop features of Cushing's syndrome and, subsequently, glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome when the treatment is tapered down. Symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal can overlap with those of the underlying disorder, as well as of GI-AI. A careful approach to the glucocorticoid taper and appropriate patient counseling are needed to assure a successful taper. Glucocorticoid therapy should not be completely stopped until recovery of adrenal function is achieved. In this review, we discuss the factors affecting the risk of GI-AI, propose a regimen for the glucocorticoid taper, and make suggestions for assessment of adrenal function recovery. We also describe current gaps in the management of patients with GI-AI and make suggestions for an approach to the glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome, chronic management of glucocorticoid therapy, and education on GI-AI for patients and providers.

### Prevention of adrenal crisis: cortisol responses to major stress compared to stress dose hydrocortisone delivery [^116J3aVt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Context

Patients with adrenal insufficiency require increased hydrocortisone cover during major stress to avoid a life-threatening adrenal crisis. However, current treatment recommendations are not evidence-based.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate mode of hydrocortisone delivery in patients with adrenal insufficiency who are exposed to major stress.

Design and Participants

Cross-sectional study: 122 unstressed healthy subjects and 288 subjects exposed to different stressors (major trauma [N = 83], sepsis [N = 100], and combat stress [N = 105]). Longitudinal study: 22 patients with preserved adrenal function undergoing elective surgery. Pharmacokinetic study: 10 patients with primary adrenal insufficiency undergoing administration of 200 mg hydrocortisone over 24 hours in 4 different delivery modes (continuous intravenous infusion; 6-hourly oral, intramuscular or intravenous bolus administration).

Main Outcome Measure

We measured total serum cortisol and cortisone, free serum cortisol, and urinary glucocorticoid metabolite excretion by mass spectrometry. Linear pharmacokinetic modeling was used to determine the most appropriate mode and dose of hydrocortisone administration in patients with adrenal insufficiency exposed to major stress.

Results

Serum cortisol was increased in all stress conditions, with the highest values observed in surgery and sepsis. Continuous intravenous hydrocortisone was the only administration mode persistently achieving median cortisol concentrations in the range observed during major stress. Linear pharmacokinetic modeling identified continuous intravenous infusion of 200 mg hydrocortisone over 24 hours, preceded by an initial bolus of 50–100 mg hydrocortisone, as best suited for maintaining cortisol concentrations in the required range.

Conclusions

Continuous intravenous hydrocortisone infusion should be favored over intermittent bolus administration in the prevention and treatment of adrenal crisis during major stress.

### Tapering patients off of benzodiazepines… [^116kfy7z]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

The patient had been experiencing increased symptoms between doses, including anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, dysphoric moods, and a slight tremor. She requested a refill at the new higher dosage of 4 mg per day to help manage these "new" symptoms. We had concerns about prescribing such a high dosage, but we did not know how to respond. How should we counsel this patient, and what are some evidence-based strategies for tapering her down and off of the benzodiazepine. HOW TO TAPER Abruptly discontinuing benzodiazepines after a patient has been taking them daily for more than one month is potentially dangerous; withdrawal can be severe or even life-threatening. Taper schedules should be individualized, considering factors such as lifestyle, personality, environmental stressors, reasons for taking benzodiazepines, and amount of available personal and clinical support.

Because anticipatory anxiety is often related to withdrawal, benzodiazepines are commonly tapered slowly, with psychological support emphasized during the process to help patients learn alternative coping skills. There are three basic approaches to a benzodiazepine taper: use the same medication for tapering; switch to a longer-acting equivalent; and use adjunctive medications to help mitigate potential withdrawal symptoms. The dosage reduction mainly depends on the starting dose and whether the patient is tapering as an inpatient or outpatient. For safety reasons, outpatient tapers usually need to be slower than inpatient tapers. Patients taking higher dosages of benzodiazepines can usually tolerate larger reductions than those taking lower dosages. 5, 6 The initial reduction typically ranges between 5% and 25% of the starting dose, with further reductions of 5% to 25% every one to four weeks as tolerated.

### Oral prednisone taper versus placebo for the treatment of acute… [^116wWmt6]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview The management of MS-patients requires treatment with immune-modifying or immune-suppressive agents to prevent new relapses and progression of disability. Several studies have evaluated the effect of steroid treatment on clinical recovery after an acute relapse. An important unanswered clinical question is, whether or not an oral tapering dose of corticosteroids offers any additional advantage over intravenous methylprednisolone alone in improving neurologic recovery as well as safety and tolerability after a relapse. This study aims to compare the efficacy, tolerability and safety of tapering doses of oral prednisone and placebo after short-term high-dose i. v. methylprednisolone on the recovery from an acute relapse in patients with clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and primary or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis with superimposed relapses.

Patients will be treated during 25 days with de-escaling doses of prednisone or placebo. The primary analysis will test whether placebo is equivalent to oral prednisone taper on the recovery status as measured by EDSS change from baseline to 3 months after baseline. The purpose of this double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, prospective, parallel group, single centre study is to evaluate the effect of tapering oral doses of prednisone or placebo taken during 25 days following short-term high-dose i. v. methylprednisolone on the outcome of a relapse in patients with CIS; RR-MS, PP-MS or SP-MS with superimposed relapses. After standard treatment of an acute clinical relapse with high dose, short term i. v. methyprednisolone patients will be randomised to one of the two treatment arms. Patients allocated to prednisone will be treated with tapering oral doses during 25 days. The initial dose of 60 mg will be reduced twice by 20 mg, than by 10 and 5 mg.

Each dose regimen will be taken during 5 ± 2 days. Patients randomised to placebo will receive placebo treatment during 25 days. Drug: Prednisone Drug: Placebo

### Long-lasting behavioral changes following prednisone withdrawal… [^116G6pg9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — Behavioral changes occurring during corticosteroid therapy are well recognized. 1–3 There have been few reports, however, of behavioral changes persisting well beyond the discontinuation of steroid treatment. 2–3 Freyberg et al3 described a corticosteroid "withdrawal syndrome" characterized by fatigue, anorexia, discouragement, and depression in approximately 21% of their patients with rheumatoid arthritis, subsiding after 2 to 8 weeks and possibly representing an emotional response to clinical relapse. Given what we now know about the direct effects of corticosteroids on the central nervous system, 4–6 it is possible that such withdrawal syndromes represent the sequelae of corticosteroid actions on the central nervous system. Because of the widespread use of corticosteroids, it is important to investigate such behavioral reactions.

We report here two cases of long-lasting behavioral disturbances that began during the tapering off of steroid medication, persisted for several weeks following steroid withdrawal, and were related.

### Adequate initial dosage and steroid tapering methods to reduce the total corticosteroid dose in myasthenia gravis… [^113yzZQS]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor We read the interesting article by Sharshar and colleagues1 and appreciate the authors' efforts to answer the long-standing question of which incremental or decremental methods of prednisone dosage are better for the treatment of patients with myasthenia gravis. There was a significant difference in the primary outcome between the slow-tapering and rapid-tapering groups. The percentage of patients with no MG symptoms who could wean off prednisone was higher in the rapid-tapering group. Moreover, patients in the rapid-tapering group had a lower cumulative dosage of prednisone. However, we would like to point out 2 concerns. Akamine H, Uzawa A, Kuwabara S.
