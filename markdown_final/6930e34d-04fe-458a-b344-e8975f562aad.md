## Question

Ecg leads and coronary artery territory

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how ECG leads map to coronary artery territories, including anterior, inferior, lateral, posterior, and right ventricular involvement, with attention to special patterns, limitations, and guideline-based actions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational anatomic-electrical correlation and standard ECG lead nomenclature. Then, I should verify territory-specific patterns for LAD, RCA, and LCx, including reciprocal changes. Next, I will examine special high-risk patterns such as aVR elevation and de Winter T waves. After that, I need to check the limitations of standard 12-lead ECG and the role of posterior and right-sided leads. Finally, I will integrate guideline recommendations and practical algorithms, and close with a concise summary that preserves the reasoning flow and self-verification language throughout.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: the 12-lead ECG detects regional ischemia via injury currents that project onto specific lead vectors, enabling inference of the culprit coronary territory; however, I need to ensure I do not overstate precision, because ECG is a surrogate of anatomy rather than a direct anatomic image, and distribution varies among patients due to coronary dominance and collateralization, so I should keep those caveats in mind as I proceed [^116nPhJK] [^116uhmu8].

> I will now examine the anterior territory and LAD patterns; wait, let me verify the classic teaching that anterior ST elevation in V2–V4 implies LAD occlusion and that more extensive anterior involvement with ST elevation in I and aVL plus reciprocal inferior ST depression suggests proximal LAD, which aligns with AHA/ACCF/HRS statements and observational angiographic correlations showing that LAD occlusion commonly manifests with ST elevation in V2–V3 and that proximal LAD often produces reciprocal inferior depression and larger infarct burden [^114JgCpa] [^112bjHYM] [^111nxqE7].

> Hold on, I should verify the special LAD patterns; de Winter T waves with upsloping ST depression and hyperacute T waves in the precordial leads indicate a proximal LAD occlusion even without classic ST elevation, and I need to remember that isolated T-wave inversion in aVL can be an early marker of mid-LAD ischemia, so I should not dismiss subtle aVL changes when the clinical context fits ACS [^1131VVrA] [^114PMAUA] [^1125FPR9].

> Next, I should review the inferior territory; let me think about the II, III, aVF triad and the RCA versus LCx question, because III greater than II favors RCA while II greater than III favors LCx, and I should double-check that this heuristic is supported by both physiologic vector reasoning and clinical series showing high PPV for III > II predicting RCA and II > III predicting LCx, albeit with imperfect sensitivity and the need for adjunct leads [^116xnwn3] [^111p3ypi] [^1151zkVx].

> Wait, I need to ensure I incorporate right ventricular involvement; when RCA is proximal, right-sided leads V3R–V4R may show ST elevation, and guidelines recommend recording V3R–V4R early in suspected inferior STEMI because RV infarction changes management and hemodynamics, so I should not forget to ask for these leads when inferior ST elevation is present [^116xnwn3] [^112MtadT] [^112JTzTy].

> Let me consider the lateral wall; I should confirm that ST elevation in I and aVL with reciprocal inferior depression suggests high lateral involvement often from proximal LCx or diagonal/OM branches, and that ST elevation in V5–V6 can reflect lateral wall ischemia and may help distinguish LCx from RCA in inferior presentations, though I must acknowledge that lateral changes are frequently underrepresented on standard 12-lead ECG [^114Ysczh] [^111nxqE7] [^114VQb86].

> I will now examine posterior ischemia; hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "posterior leads V7–V9 are essential whenever V1–V3 show ST depression", but I should correct myself — posterior leads are indicated when there is isolated ST depression in V1–V3 or when LCx occlusion is suspected and the standard ECG is nondiagnostic, because posterior MI is electrically "silent" anteriorly and can be missed without V7–V9, with ESC recommending a low threshold to add posterior leads and use a 0.5–1.0 mm STE threshold depending on context [^112KqJhU] [^112MtadT] [^111UCT1j].

> But wait, what if the pattern suggests diffuse subendocardial ischemia; I should confirm that ST elevation in aVR with diffuse ST depression elsewhere, particularly when more prominent than in V1, points toward left main or severe multivessel disease and carries high risk, so recognizing this pattern should prompt urgent invasive evaluation rather than waiting for biomarkers [^111wiZJz] [^1179imTm] [^111STs7p].

> Next, I should review the limitations of the standard 12-lead ECG; I need to ensure I emphasize that LCx occlusions are disproportionately underdetected, that up to a quarter or more of NSTEMI patients may harbor an occluded culprit artery, and that subtle or nondiagnostic ST changes warrant serial ECGs and a low threshold for posterior/right-sided leads or advanced ECG mapping, because missing occlusion delays reperfusion and worsens outcomes [^111KGAVN] [^115uUd5Z] [^114VQb86].

> Let me integrate guideline-based actions; I should double-check that ESC 2023 ACS guidance recommends adding V3R–V4R and V7–V9 in inferior STEMI or when total vessel occlusion is suspected but standard leads are inconclusive, and that the Fourth Universal MI definition endorses serial ECGs and supplemental leads with a very low threshold when the initial tracing is nondiagnostic, which operationalizes early detection of occlusion myocardial infarction beyond the STEMI/NSTEMI binary [^112MtadT] [^112KqJhU] [^1112igCX].

> I need to ensure practical algorithms are clear; for chest pain with suspected ACS, obtain a 12-lead ECG within 10 minutes, repeat ECGs every 15–30 minutes if symptoms persist or the tracing is nondiagnostic, add posterior leads when V1–V3 show isolated ST depression or LCx is suspected, add right-sided leads for inferior STEMI, and escalate to angiography for STEMI, high-risk NSTE-ACS, or high-risk ECG patterns such as aVR elevation with diffuse depression, even if troponin is initially negative, because ECG evolution may precede biomarker rise [^1112igCX] [^116xnwn3] [^112JTzTy].

> Let me reconsider the anatomic-electrical mapping to synthesize; anterior precordial leads V1–V4 map to the septal and apical-anterior walls and generally implicate the LAD, inferior leads II, III, aVF map to the inferior wall and implicate RCA or LCx with vector-based discrimination, lateral leads I, aVL, V5–V6 map to the lateral wall and implicate LCx or diagonal branches, posterior leads V7–V9 capture posterior wall ischemia typically from LCx, and right-sided V3R–V4R capture RV ischemia from proximal RCA, while remembering that dominance and collaterals can shift expected patterns and that ECG is a guide rather than a perfect anatomic map [^116uhmu8] [^116xnwn3] [^112KqJhU].

> In summary, I should confirm that accurate culprit localization relies on integrating contiguous lead patterns, reciprocal changes, and special high-risk signatures, then applying guideline-directed supplemental leads and serial ECGs to mitigate the blind spots of the standard 12-lead, because timely recognition of occlusion myocardial infarction — whether STEMI or occlusion-NSTEMI — drives faster reperfusion and better outcomes [^111KGAVN] [^114VQb86] [^117QcL38].

The ECG leads map to coronary territories as follows: **anterior leads (V1–V4) reflect LAD** [^114JgCpa] [^112bjHYM], **inferior leads (II, III, aVF) reflect RCA or LCx** [^116xnwn3] [^1151zkVx], and **lateral leads (I, aVL, V5–V6) reflect LCx or diagonal branches** [^111MEsdo] [^111nxqE7]. Posterior MI is inferred from **V1–V3 ST depression** [^112KqJhU] and confirmed with **V7–V9** [^112MtadT]; **right ventricular infarction** requires V3R–V4R [^116xnwn3]. Lead aVR is critical for detecting **left main or multivessel disease** [^111wiZJz] [^111STs7p]. Accurate localization guides urgent management and catheterization laboratory activation [^1112igCX].

## Anterior myocardial infarction (MI) and the left anterior descending (LAD) artery

- **Leads**: V1, V2, V3, V4 (anterior/septal/apical walls).
- **Artery**: LAD (septal and diagonal branches).
- **ECG findings**: ST elevation in V1–V4; reciprocal ST depression in II, III, aVF [^114JgCpa].
- **Proximal LAD**: ST elevation in I, aVL, V1–V4 with reciprocal ST depression in II, III, aVF [^114JgCpa].
- **Distal LAD**: ST elevation in V3–V6 without reciprocal inferior depression [^114JgCpa].

---

## Inferior MI and the right coronary artery (RCA) or left circumflex artery (LCx)

- **Leads**: II, III, aVF (inferior wall).
- **Arteries**: RCA (dominant in ~80–90%) or LCx (~10–20%).
- **ECG findings**: ST elevation in II, III, aVF [^116xnwn3].
- **RCA vs LCx**: III > II favors RCA; II > III favors LCx [^1151zkVx] [^111p3ypi].
- **Right ventricular involvement**: Obtain V3R–V4R; ST elevation indicates RV infarct [^116xnwn3] [^112MtadT].

---

## Lateral MI and the left circumflex artery (LCx) or diagonal branches

- **Leads**: I, aVL, V5, V6 (lateral wall).
- **Arteries**: LCx or diagonal branches.
- **ECG findings**: ST elevation in I, aVL, V5, V6; reciprocal ST depression in II, III, aVF [^notfound].
- **LCx occlusion**: Often posterior/lateral; may show isolated V1–V3 ST depression [^112KqJhU].

---

## Posterior MI and the left circumflex artery (LCx)

Posterior MI is suggested by **V1–V3 ST depression** with tall R waves and is confirmed by **V7–V9 ST elevation** [^112KqJhU] [^112MtadT]. The culprit artery is typically the **LCx** [^notfound].

---

## Right ventricular infarction and the RCA

Right ventricular infarction is assessed with **V3R–V4R**; ST elevation in these leads indicates RV infarct [^116xnwn3]. The culprit artery is typically the **proximal RCA** [^116xnwn3].

---

## Lead aVR and multivessel or left main disease

Lead aVR shows **ST elevation in aVR** with diffuse ST depression elsewhere, suggesting left main or multivessel disease [^111wiZJz] [^111STs7p]. This pattern is a **high-risk ECG marker** [^111STs7p].

## ECG leads and coronary artery territories

| **ECG leads** | **Territory** | **Coronary artery** |
|-|-|-|
| V1–V4 | Anterior/septal/apical | LAD |
| II, III, aVF | Inferior | RCA or LCx |
| I, aVL, V5–V6 | Lateral | LCx or diagonal branches |
| V7–V9 | Posterior | LCx |
| V3R–V4R | Right ventricle | Proximal RCA |
| aVR | Diffuse | Left main or multivessel |

---

## Clinical implications

- **Rapid diagnosis**: ECG localization enables fast triage and cath lab activation [^1112igCX].
- **Guideline support**: ESC/ACC endorse posterior (V7–V9) and right-sided (V3R–V4R) leads when indicated [^112MtadT] [^114PftFF].
- **Limitations**: LCx and posterior MIs are often underrecognized; use supplemental leads and serial ECGs [^112KqJhU] [^111KGAVN].

---

ECG lead patterns reliably map to coronary territories: **anterior (V1–V4) to LAD**, **inferior (II, III, aVF) to RCA/LCx**, and **lateral (I, aVL, V5–V6) to LCx/diagonals**. Posterior and right ventricular infarcts require **V7–V9** and **V3R–V4R**, respectively, and **aVR** flags left main or multivessel disease.

### Correlation between index electrocardiographic patterns and pre-intervention angiographic findings: insights from the HORIZONS-AMI trial [^112bjHYM]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To improve ECG interpretation accuracy in patients with chest pain prior to activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI).

Background

Despite current guideline-based ECG criteria, challenges remain in optimizing the rate of appropriate catheterization laboratory activation.

Methods

The HORIZONS-AMI trial enrolled 3,602 patients with chest pain consistent with myocardial infarction (MI). ECG and angiographic core laboratory databases were analyzed for correlation between the qualifying study ECG and the baseline coronary angiogram.

Results

LAD occlusion manifested in > 80% of cases as ST-segment elevation in leads V2 and V3, while the culprit vessel was the RCA and LCx in 75 and 25% of cases, respectively, for inferior MI ECG patterns. The study threshold of ≥ 1.0 mm ST-segment elevation in ≥ 2 contiguous ECG leads was not met in 189 (5.3%) patients. When stratified by culprit artery, the prevalence of reciprocal ST-segment depression ranged from 24 to 88%, being least common for lesions in the mid- and distal left anterior descending artery. Despite study eligibility, no posterior MIs were enrolled. Only 36 LBBB cases were identified (25% of whom did not undergo PCI), and 5 of 11 left main coronary occlusions (45%) had ST-segment elevation in lead aVR.

Conclusions

The present study confirms prior ischemic ECG findings predicted by vectorcardiography, validates certain ECG patterns as reliable surrogate markers for acute coronary occlusion, and provides novel insights correlating index ECG ischemic changes and pre-intervention coronary angiography. These results may enhance the rate of appropriate catheterization laboratory activation. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Correlation of comparative "abc" and 12-lead measurements

Numeric values of comparative "abc" lead-derived measurement Cabc demonstrated strong correlation with the 12-lead-derived comparative measurements (Cxyz, C₁₂L) in all arteries (r = 0.77–0.94) with 95% of readings being concordant (True/True, False/False), located in left lower/right upper quadrant marked by the cutoff threshold lines in Figure 4. Discordant readings were located close to the cutoff thresholds. As expected, the 12-lead-derived measurements Cxyz and C₁₂L demonstrated even stronger correlations (r = 0.96–0.97) between themselves (Supplemental Figure 3).

Figure 4
Correlation Between Comparative C_abc and 12 Lead-Derived (C_xyz and C₁₂L) ST-Segment Shift Measurements

Blue open circles represent preinflation; solid pink circles represent inflation; and blue lines represent cutoff threshold values for respective measurements.

All automated "abc" and 12-lead measurements (both comparative and spot) correctly classified all tracings meeting standard STEMI and acute ischemia criteria (Supplemental Table 5).

To summarize, the 3-lead "abc" derived measurements performed similarly to the 2 12-lead measurements, "xyz" and "12L" (constructed with and without vectorcardiographic approach, respectively) in detecting coronary artery occlusion. All spot and comparative measurements correctly detected all STEMI tracings. Comparative measurements performed significantly better than spot ones.

Human ECG interpretation

Human spot consensus interpretation (HCS1) in the whole group had sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 58%; comparative consensus interpretation (HCC) had sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 98%. The repeat human spot consensus interpretation (HCS2) used for reliability analysis had sensitivity of 68% and specificity of 83%, quite different from HSC1 with an increase in specificity and drop in sensitivity indicating high intraobserver variability (Figure 3). Human interpretation accuracy (both sensitivity and specificity) was the highest in the LAD territory, decreasing in RCA, and especially in LCX territory, where it was the worst (see Supplemental Table 6 for the detailed description of human and automated performance).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to ECG (resting), ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain a resting 12-lead ECG in all patients reporting chest pain (unless an obvious non-cardiac cause is identified), particularly during, or immediately after, an episode suggestive of myocardial ischemia.

### Localising culprit artery in inferior STEMI [^1151zkVx]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The ECG is pivotal in defining ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and instrumental in determining interventional therapy. In the setting of STEMI, the distribution of ST elevation on the ECG localises the myocardial territory involved. This is particularly true in the case of anterior infarctions, which involve the left anterior descending artery. However, the inferior territory can be supplied by one of two arteries — 70%–90% of the time it is supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA), but 8%–15% of the time it is supplied by the distal left circumflex artery (LCx), a branch of the left coronary artery. This represents a dilemma for cardiologists, as a choice must be made on whether to plan intervention for the left or right coronary circulations first. Time to diagnosis and intervention of the culprit lesion are important performance metrics of catheterisation laboratories as they correlate strongly with risk of adverse outcomes in STEMI. Knowledge of culprit lesion location may help reduce door-to-balloon time, thus improving outcomes. Multiple diagnostic algorithms have been proposed to help predict the culprit artery in inferior STEMI. A study performed by Zimetbaum et al suggested that ST elevation in lead III greater than lead II may predict RCA culprit lesion as opposed to a LCx culprit lesion. Alternatively, it has been proposed that II greater than III may predict LCx occlusion. Anecdotally, we noticed a preponderance of case series that questioned this concept. Accordingly, we analysed our prospectively collected STEMI Database to assess whether comparison of leads II and III, in the case of inferior STEMI, could distinguish a culprit artery in either the RCA or LCx.

### Lead aVR: beyond' No man's land' [^1114Jesi]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of mortality in the world. Treadmill test is a very useful non-invasive test to diagnose and stratify the risk of CAD. Lead aVR is usually a neglected lead while reading the ECG. We describe a case demonstrating the importance of subtle changes in lead aVR that has got a direct angiographic correlation with left main CAD. Therefore picking up the subtle clues on ECG may help in stratifying the risk and optimal treatment of the patient in a timely fashion.

### Contemporary cardiovascular imaging methods for the assessment of at-risk myocardium [^116nPhJK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Traditional Methods for Assessing the Myocardial Area at Risk

Electrocardiography

Arguably, the most readily available diagnostic test in cardiovascular medicine for rapidly assessing at‐risk myocardium at the time of acute coronary occlusion and clinical symptoms is the 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG). Upon initial patient presentation, the ECG not only provides rationale for prompt triage of patients with STEMI to the cardiac catheterization lab for revascularization, but can also offer information on the presence and location of both at‐risk myocardium and myocardial infarction. Through the use of vectorcardiography, an ECG technique that measures the magnitude and direction of electrical forces of the heart, the ST‐segment vector, or "injury current" vector, can be used to identify patients with a large at‐risk area in the setting of acute STEMI. Depending on the direction and magnitude of the ST vector, one can localize the area of myocardial injury and at‐risk myocardium to a specific coronary artery territory, or infarct‐related artery (IRA). In this way, the ECG provides pathophysiologic information regarding the myocardium during acute ischemic injury without directly imaging the heart. Several methods have been described that attempt to quantify the myocardial area at risk by ECG. – However, ECG scoring methods carry with them significant limitations and largely provide information regarding the presence or absence of at‐risk myocardium in a specific coronary artery territory rather than offering a robust method to accurately delineate infarction and salvage. At present, despite utility in the clinical setting, electrocardiographic methods for defining at‐risk and infarcted myocardium have suboptimal accuracy for assessing response to therapeutic intervention in the clinical setting given significant quantitative limitations.

### QRS fragmentation in preserved ejection fraction heart failure: functional insights, pathological correlates, and prognosis [^117K47kr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Definition of

Standard 12‐lead ECGs were collected and analyzed. The fQRS in the current study was limited to ECGs with QRS duration < 120 ms and was defined by the presence of various RSR patterns, including the presence of an additional R wave (R), a notching of the R wave, a notching in the nadir of the S wave, or the presence of more than 1 R in at least 2 contiguous leads, corresponding to a specific and major coronary artery territory. Bundle branch block was excluded from the definition of fQRS. Furthermore, when notching was confined to the terminal QRS accompanied by a J‐point elevation of at least 0.1 mV, it was classified as early repolarization rather than fQRS.

fQRS was then further categorized by anatomic locations and coronary territory distributions. fQRS was classified into anterior (leads V1–V5), lateral (leads I, aVL, and V6), or inferior (leads II, III, and aVF). Among the 1120 admitted patients with HFpEF, 960 had ECG‐defined QRS morphology data available and were classified into the 3 categories: 657 non‐fQRS, 220 inferior fQRS, and 83 subjects with fQRS on anterior or lateral leads (anterior/lateral). We also classified our study participants into 2 groups according to QRS duration cutoff: ≤ 110 ms and those with > 110 ms.

Echocardiography

Comprehensive echocardiography was performed within the first 3 days of HF admission. Two‐dimensional cine loops and Doppler images are acquired in 3 consecutive heartbeats during the hospital stay or on arrival at the emergency department. Our current study mainly focused on parameters of left ventricular (LV) structure (wall thickness, internal dimension, LV mass index, LV end‐diastolic and end‐systolic volume) and geometry as recommended by a standardized protocol, with left ventricular ejection fraction determined by using biplane Simpson's method. Right ventricular (RV) structure/function (RV end‐diastolic area and RV end‐systolic area) and RV function (RV fractional area change, as %) were also determined. LV diastolic function including mitral E / A ratio, deceleration time, interventricular relaxation time, early mitral annulus tissue Doppler velocity e ′ and s ′, LV filling E divided by e ′ (E / e ′), and bi‐atrial (right atrium and left atrium) volume index were all analyzed and quantified using contemporary guidelines.

### Electrocardiographic signs of remote myocardial infarction [^111Fziuj]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Twelve-lead electrocardiogram is an integral part of the evaluation of an acute and a remote myocardial infarction (MI). Electrocardiographic signs of an acute ST-elevation MI are more precise than those of an acute non-ST-elevation MI. Recognition of a remote MI is more difficult because once the repolarization abnormalities (ST-segment and T-wave changes) stabilize after an acute MI resolves, then the Q wave remains as the only universally recognized sign of MI. In addition, there is no specific sign of a non-Q-wave MI or a non-ST-elevation MI, or in fact of an ST-elevation MI that did not result in Q waves. The fragmented QRS (fQRS) is another recently described sign of a remote MI. It is defined by the presence of an additional R wave (R') or notching in the nadir of the S wave, or the presence of > 1 R' (fragmentation) in 2 contiguous leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory. The specificity of fQRS is inferior to that of a Q wave for an MI scar (89% vs 99%). However, fQRS has a superior sensitivity and a negative predictive value compared with a Q wave. In addition, there is an incremental gain in the sensitivity up to 91.4% when these 2 signs (fQRS and Q wave) are combined. The repolarization abnormalities of MI may also persist indefinitely as a sign of a remote MI in few patients. These abnormalities include persistent ST elevation, ST depression, nonspecific ST-T wave changes, and T-wave inversion.

### QRS fragmentation does not predict mortality in survivors of acute myocardial infarction [^111iBMxt]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 ECG analysis

The baseline characteristics of the 609 survivors of acute MI are presented in Table 1. Resting 12‐lead ECGs were obtained a median of 4 days (IQR: 2–7 days) after the index MI. QRS fragmentation was present in 285 patients (46.8%). In 206 patients (72.3%) QRS fragmentation was present in leads corresponding to the inferior segments, in 115 patients (40.4%) QRS fragmentation was present in leads corresponding to the anterior myocardial segments, and in 42 patients (14.7%) QRS fragmentation was present in leads corresponding to the lateral segments. Repeatedly, fragmented QRS complexes were seen in more than one major coronary artery territory. Most commonly, they were simultaneously found in anterior and inferior leads (n = 40, 14.0%). In 11 patients (3.9%) QRS fragmentations were simultaneously found in inferior and lateral leads as well as in anterior and lateral leads, respectively. QRS fragmentations in all coronary artery territories were present in eight patients (2.8%).

Table 1
Clinical characteristics of the study population.

The median QRS duration in the study population was 90 ms (IQR: 80–95 ms). QRS duration was longer in patients with fragmented QRS complexes (90 ms, IQR: 85–100 ms) compared to patients with normal QRS morphology (85, IQR: 80–90 ms). This difference was statistically significant (p < .001, Figure 2).

Figure 2
QRS duration in patients with and without fragmented QRS complexes. Boxplots show medians and interquartile ranges.

3.2 Patient characteristics in groups with and without fragmented QRS complexes

Baseline characteristics in patients with and in patients without fragmented QRS complexes are shown in Table 1. Compared to the patients without QRS fragmentations, the patients with QRS fragmentations had more severe MIs as quantified by higher serum creatine kinase concentrations (1438 vs. 1160 U/L, p = .039) and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (52% vs. 54%, p = .011). Interestingly, the proportion of women was higher in patients without fragmented QRS (22.8%) compared to patients with fragmented QRS (15.8%, p = .029), meaning that in the here presented cohort of MI survivors fragmented QRS was more frequent in men (49.0%) than in women (37.8%). Medical and interventional therapy was not different in both groups.

### QRS fragmentation in preserved ejection fraction heart failure: functional insights, pathological correlates, and prognosis [^114qpC8Y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Fragmented QRS (fQRS) refers to various QRS morphologies that are typically < 120 ms in duration in the presence or absence of the Q‐wave on body surface 12‐lead ECG. It is characterized by an R' or notching in the nadir of the S wave, and there can also be more than 1 R' in 2 contiguous leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory.fQRS complexes are new ECG signals associated with varied conduction abnormalities and are assumed to originate from the delay in peri‐infarct conduction because of myocardial scarring or necrosis. This specific ECG morphology is observed in patients with coronary artery diseases, cardiomyopathies, structural heart diseases, heart rhythm disturbances, and cardiac sarcoidosis. Several studies have shown that the presence of fQRS is a predictor of sudden cardiac death in patients with cardiomyopathy and heart failure (HF). Furthermore, it has been shown to be a prognostic marker of cardiac events and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), and a predictor of dysrhythmia in patients with Brugada syndrome.

As a clinical HF phenotype accompanied by a high clinical comorbidity burden (ie, coronary heart disease or hypertrophy from hypertension) with unfavorable myocardial remodeling, patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) may theoretically have a higher chance of developing a longer QRS duration. However, reports investigating the prevalence and significance of fQRS in HFpEF or the general population were either small in sample size or with study limitations.

In this study, we sought to investigate the prevalence and long‐term prognostic significance of fQRS and QRS duration in patients with HFpEF.

### Fragmented QRS on a 12-lead ECG: a predictor of mortality and cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease [^116KGrYE]. Heart Rhythm (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fragmented QRS (fQRS) on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is associated with myocardial scar in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

Objective

We postulated that fQRS is a predictor of cardiac events and mortality in patients who have known CAD or who are being evaluated for CAD.

Methods

The cardiac events (myocardial infarction, need for revascularization, or cardiac death) and all-cause mortality were retrospectively reviewed in 998 patients (mean age 65.5 ± 11.9 years, male 967) who underwent nuclear stress test. The fQRS on a 12-lead ECG included various RSR' patterns (≥ 1 R' prime or notching of S wave or R wave) without typical bundle branch block in 2 contiguous leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory.

Results

All-cause mortality (93 [34.1%] vs 188 [25.9%]) and cardiac event rate (135 [49.5%] vs 200 [27.6%]) were higher in the fQRS group compared with the non-fQRS group during a mean follow-up of 57 ± 23 months. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed significantly lower event-free survival for cardiac events (P < .001) and all-cause mortality (P = 0.02). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that significant fQRS was an independent significant predictor for cardiac events but not for all-cause mortality. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no significant difference between fQRS and Q waves groups for cardiac events (P = 0.48) and all-cause mortality (P = 0.08).

Conclusion

The fQRS is an independent predictor of cardiac events in patients with CAD. It is associated with significantly lower event-free survival for a cardiac event on long-term follow-up.

### Electrocardiographic diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction: current concepts for the clinician [^1113fnj3]. American Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Over the past 2 decades, the 12-lead electrocardiogram has attained special significance for the diagnosis and triage of patients with chest pain because timely detection of myocardial injury and a rapid assessment of myocardium at risk proved pivotal to implementing effective reperfusion therapies during acute myocardial infarction. However, this wealth of information could still be underutilized by clinicians who may restrict their diagnostic quest in patients with chest pain to the more classic electrocardiographic signs.

Methods

The medical literature on electrocardiographic manifestations of acute myocardial infarction was extensively reviewed.

Results

The widespread utilization of both coronary angiography and methods to determine myocardial function and metabolism in patients with acute myocardial infarction over the last 10 years has provided the means for rigorous comparisons with electrocardiographic information. We summarize these electrocardiographic signs and patterns in terms of their relevance to the clinician to help reduce the incidence of "nondiagnostic electrocardiograms" and improve timely decision-making.

Conclusions

The electrocardiogram continues to be an invaluable tool in the initial evaluation of patients with chest pain. The plethora of data currently available on electrocardiographic changes correlating with myocardial injury allows clinicians to make faster and better decisions than ever before.

### Concordance of electrocardiographic patterns and healed myocardial infarction location detected by cardiovascular magnetic resonance [^114ru7uR]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) location is generally based on a pathologic correlation first proposed > 50 years ago. Despite the proved reliability of contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CE-CMR) imaging to detect and locate infarcted areas, no global study has been conducted with the aim of correlating the electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns of Q-wave MI with infarct location. We studied this correlation in 51 patients with ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome who presented with Q waves or equivalents during MI. Seven preestablished ECG patterns that matched with high specificity to 7 different MI locations as detected by CE-CMR imaging were used to assess its value in clinical practice to locate an infarcted area. There were 4 ECG patterns in the anteroseptal zone (23 patients; septal, apical, and/or anteroseptal, extensive anterior, and limited anterolateral) and 3 ECG patterns in the inferolateral zone (28 patients; lateral, inferior, and inferolateral). In conclusion, (1) the predefined ECG patterns we used matched well (86% global concordance) with their corresponding infarction areas as detected by CE-CMR imaging and have real value in clinical practice, and (2) the RS morphology in lead V(1) is due to lateral MI and the QS morphology in lead aVL is due to mid-anterior and mid-lateral MI. Therefore, the terms posterior and high lateral infarction are incorrect and should be changed to lateral wall and limited anterolateral wall MI.

Automated ECG interpretation for diffuse ST depression: When the resting electrocardiogram reveals ST-segment depression greater than 0.1 mV (1 mm) in 8 or more body surface leads coupled with ST-segment elevation in aVR and/or V1 but otherwise unremarkable, the automated interpretation should suggest ischemia due to multivessel or left main coronary artery obstruction.

### Coronary artery occlusion detection Using 3-lead ECG system suitable for credit card-size personal Device integration [^111Lp6Qs]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of our study demonstrate that ECG recordings made with three "abc" leads can detect coronary occlusion comparable to the performance of a 12-lead ECG (Central Illustration). The 3-lead configuration in a mode looking for changes from baseline (comparative mode, Cabc) achieved over 90% sensitivity/specificity/accuracy in determining the state of the artery (open/closed), which is similar to other portable ECG recording technologies.

ST-segment shift computer analysis for ischemia detection (inflation) with and without using vectorcardiographic reconstruction (VCG) and blind consensus human reading performed in "comparative" (baseline/inflation, baseline/preinflation comparison) and "spot" (preinflation, inflation without baseline information) modes. Areas under the ROC curves (AUC) along with points representing "STEMI standard definition" (black square) and human consensus readings (2 independent "spot", open triangles 1 and 2, and 1 "comparative, solid triangle) are presented. All ECG analyses in "comparative" mode were superior to "spot" mode (P < 0.05 for AUC differences) without significant difference between "abc" and 12 leads. Human "spot" readings 1 and 2 highlight low reproducibility of human reading. ECG = electrocardiogram; STEMI = ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction

The advantage of the "abc" electrode configuration is that it can be incorporated into a credit card-size device without separate leads/wires with the limb lead "a" provided by direct finger to device contact improving its ease of use.

The information content of the 3 "abc" leads was comparable to that of the 12-lead ECG for the purpose of coronary occlusion detection based on the following findings: 1) there was no statistically significant difference between ROC curves of "abc" and 12-lead ECG-based comparative measurements; 2) coronary occlusion results in numerically similar changes in "abc"- and 12-lead-derived measurements that remain consistent across the occlusion locations and demonstrated close correlations; 3) binary decisions by "abc"- and 12-lead-derived comparative measurements demonstrate 95% concordance (eg, same true/false positive/negative cases) with no significant differences in validity analyses; 4) none of the measurements missed any tracings matching the standard ischemia definition.

### Prevalence and outcome of patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction with occluded "culprit" artery-a systemic review and meta-analysis [^114VQb86]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Our analysis suggested that OCA represents a substantial portion of NSTEMI, and carries a worse clinical outcome. Some researchers proposed that this condition should be considered as "STEMI equivalent" and treated as such. However, whether OCA mandates a more aggressive treatment strategy or simply reflects worse disease severity cannot be determined from the current analysis. There are several possible causes of OCA in NSTEMI: (1) acute total occlusion of vessel suppling some part of myocardium (esp lateral wall) which does not consistently lead to ST elevation in conventional 12-lead ECG, probably due to the absence of corresponding leads; (2) acute total occlusion of vessels with good collaterals; (3) acute total occlusion in the territory with dual blood supply; (4) acute total occlusion with a small infarction area; or (5) chronic total occlusion misclassified as acute occlusion. In the first condition, timely reperfusion by primary percutaneous coronary intervention may improve the outcome as in STEMI. Although our analysis cannot provide evidence for any of the aforementioned hypotheses, the higher percentage of LCx as the culprit artery suggests that acute total occlusion not detected by standard 12-lead ECG may be the most possible cause. Acute LCx occlusion can result in isolated posterior infarction with ST elevation only detected in leads V7–V9. The isolated posterior infarction due to LCx occlusion is not uncommonly missed by medical personnel, and is associated with longer time to reperfusion and is less likely to be treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention. These factors are possibly associated with less favourable outcome, as in our analyses. Collateral artery status was described in only one study, reporting higher incidence of angiographic collaterals in NSTEMI with OCA. The authors also identified better outcome in these patients with OCA with collaterals, compared with those without. Further study on the impact of collateral in patients with NSTEMI with OCA is needed. Finally, determination of the culprit artery is sometimes difficult in NSTEMI without diagnostic ECG. Hence, misclassifying a chronic total occlusion as the culprit is possible clinically, and the true incidence of misclassified chronic total occlusion cannot be determined by our analysis.

Inferior wall ischemia/infarction vessel inference — RCA versus LCx: When inferior changes are accompanied by ST-segment depression in leads V1, V2, and V3, it is not possible to determine whether the right coronary artery (RCA) or left circumflex (LCx) is occluded; absence of such changes is more suggestive of RCA than LCx occlusion. When the LCx is occluded, the frontal-plane ST-segment vector is more leftward, so the ST segment may be elevated more in lead II than lead III and may be isoelectric or elevated in leads I and aVL.

### Coronary artery occlusion detection Using 3-lead ECG system suitable for credit card-size personal Device integration [^114SoJEw]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical analysis

Point and interval estimates for ST-segment shifts were calculated using general linear model analysis with fixed factors including coronary artery involved (LAD, left circumflex coronary artery [LCX], right coronary artery [RCA]), location of the inflated balloon within the artery (proximal, mid-, and distal), presence of baseline ECG abnormalities, and patients as random factor using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Correlation between measurement values was performed using Pearson's correlation coefficient.

ROC curves were used to evaluate the performance of the automated measurements. Areas under the ROC curve (AUC) were compared using the DeLong methodand 95% point confidence limits determined by bootstrapping. Optimal thresholds were determined from the ROC curves using Youden function and served to calculate the number of true positive/false positive/true negative/false negative recordings (TP, FP, TN, FN). Fisher exact test was used to compare sensitivity/specificity of the automated measurements and human binary decisions using 2 × 2 tables (TP/FP, TN/FN).

The validity (agreement with the reference) and reliability (inter- and intra-observer variability) of binary decisions was performed using interclass correlation coefficient (mixed model with absolute agreement), Spearman's rho, and Krippendorf's alpha (Kalpha) statistics. Two-sided P value of < 0.05 was considered significant. All computations were performed using SPSS ver.20, IBM and MatLab ver. 2016b, MathWork).

### Fragmented QRS complexes not typical of a bundle branch block: a marker of greater myocardial perfusion tomography abnormalities in coronary artery disease [^111M1ic7]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Fragmented QRS (FQRS) complexes, not typical of a bundle branch block, are a marker of regional myocardial injury. The extent of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) abnormalities with FQRS patterns is not known.

Methods and Results

Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) in 501 patients undergoing stress MPI were studied. FQRS was defined as a QRS duration of 120 milliseconds or less, with notches or slurs of QRS complexes, on 2 contiguous leads of a coronary artery territory. Abnormal MPI was defined as a regional summed stress score (SSS) and summed rest score (SRS) of 3 or greater based on a 17-segment model. Patients with a typical bundle (n = 26), paced rhythm (n = 2), and Q waves (n = 64) were excluded. Of the remaining 409 patients (mean age, 58 ± 13 years; 52% male), 155 (38%) had FQRS on the ECG. FQRS patients had a higher mean SSS, SRS, and global summed difference score and a lower left ventricular ejection fraction (all P < .001), as well as greater regional stress MPI scar (69% vs 11%, P < .001). FQRS pattern sensitivity was 75% and specificity was 94% for a corresponding regional MPI scar. On logistic regression, SSS, SRS, summed difference score, left ventricular ejection fraction, and regional scar were univariate predictors of the FQRS pattern on the ECG (all P < .01), and any regional scar (odds ratio, 32; P < .001) was a multivariate predictor.

Conclusions

FQRS complexes on an ECG are a marker of higher stress MPI perfusion and functional abnormalities. Regional FQRS patterns denote the presence of a greater corresponding focal regional myocardial scar on stress MPI.

### Myocardial infarction following cannabis induced coronary vasospasm [^112eC43C]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Smoking cannabis is a rare cause of myocardial infarction. We report a 29-year-old man who presented with acute coronary syndrome following consumption of a type of cannabis with the street name 'Kerala Ganja'. KG is smuggled into Sri Lanka from India; it is grown in the south Indian state of Kerala and is much more potent than the local ganja (marijuana). The patient developed dynamic ST-segment elevations in different leads in sequential ECGs, corresponding to different coronary artery territories. Coronary angiogram did not demonstrate evidence of occlusive atherosclerotic disease, but showed slow flow down the left anterior descending artery, which improved with administration of intracoronary nitrates. The patient's cardiac biomarkers were significantly elevated. A diagnosis was made of vasospasm causing myocardial infarction, most likely to have been triggered by cannabis consumption. We highlight the importance of considering this possible aetiology, particularly in patients with ACS with a susceptible social profile.

### Magnitude and consequences of missing the acute infarct-related circumflex artery [^111KGAVN]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Emergent reperfusion strategies are integral to providing optimal patient outcomes in the setting of acute coronary artery occlusion. ST-segment elevation on the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram, although specific as a surrogate marker, is insensitive to acute posterior circulation coronary artery occlusion. Studies of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome consistently identify patients who have epicardial vessel occlusion at the time of initial angiography, which is usually delayed for hours or days after the initial presentation. In addition, studies of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction often divulge a disparity in identification of the infarct-related artery, with an underrepresentation of the left circumflex artery. Taken together, it is likely that many patients with left circumflex artery occlusion are "missed" during the early phases of myocardial infarction due to the electrocardiographically silent nature of the posterior territory, resulting in delayed myocardial salvage and worse cardiovascular outcomes. In this review, we report on the magnitude of missed left circumflex infarction and the consequences of this delay in diagnosis. We review the electrocardiographic findings of left circumflex occlusion and discuss strategies to enhance early identification. Heightened awareness of this clinical scenario and the available methods to avoid missing this elusive diagnosis are imperative in our quest to further improve the outcomes of patients with acute myocardial infarction.

### The electrocardiogram in the ACS patient: high-risk electrocardiographic presentations lacking anatomically oriented ST-segment elevation [^113hgQsm]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is defined as pathologic ST-segment elevation occurring in at least 2 anatomically contiguous leads in a patient with a clinical presentation consistent with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); these findings can suggest the need for urgent revascularization. Unfortunately, the electrocardiogram (ECG) may be nondiagnostic in a large portion of patients who initially present with AMI; furthermore, it is now recognized that ECG patterns that do not meet the traditional diagnostic criteria for STEMI may represent significant AMI — these patterns are generally referred to as the STEMI equivalent patterns in that they are caused by occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery, place significant portions of the left ventricle in jeopardy, and can result in a poor outcome if not recognized and treated appropriately.

### A new electrocardiographic algorithm to locate the occlusion in left anterior descending coronary artery [^116K6gfK]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Early prediction of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion is essential from a clinical point of view

Hypothesis

To develop an electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm based on ST-segment deviations to predict the location of occlusion of LAD as a culprit artery.

Methods

ECG and angiographic findings were correlated in 100 patients with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) in precordial leads V(1), V(2), and V(4) through V(6).

Results

ST-depression ≥ 2.5 mm in leads III + ventricular fibrillation (VF) presents sensitivity (SE) of 77% and specificity (SP) of 84% for LAD occlusion proximal to the first diagonal artery (D1). ST-segment in III + VF isoelectric or elevated, presents SE of 44% and SP of 100% for LAD occlusion distal to D1. Subsequent analysis of the equation summation operator of ST-deviation in VR + V(1) - V(6) < 0, allows us to predict occlusion distal to first septal artery (S1) with 100% SP. On the other hand, any ST-depression in III + VF > 0.5 mm + summation operator of ST-deviation in VR + V(1) - V(6) ≥ 0 identifies a high-risk group (lower ejection fraction, worse Killip findings, higher peak of CPK and CK-MB, and major adverse cardiac events [MACE]: death, reinfarction, recurrent angina, persistent left ventricular failure, or sustained ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalization).

Conclusions

This sequential ECG algorithm based on ST-segment deviations in different leads allowed us to predict the location of occlusion in LAD with good accuracy. Cases with proximal LAD occlusion present the most markers of poor prognosis. We recommend the use of the algorithm in everyday clinical practice.

### Value of 12-lead electrocardiogram to predict myocardial scar on FDG PET in heart failure patients [^115NWF1L]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A surface 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is widely available, fast, inexpensive, and safe. However, its value to predict a true myocardial scar in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) has not been studied extensively yet. This study was conducted to assess whether Q waves on resting surface 12-lead ECG are predictive of non-viable myocardium in patients with ICM.

Methods

We analyzed resting ECGs of 149 patients with ICM undergoing cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) with 13N-ammonia (NH 3) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) at our institution. Pathological Q waves and QS complexes were assigned to one of three coronary artery territories and compared to the PET findings. Myocardial scar was defined as 2 or more contiguous myocardial segments with an average (matched) reduction of NH 3 and FDG uptake < 50% of the maximum value.

Results

Pathological Q waves had a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 40%, respectively, and a PPV and NPV of 37% and 73%, respectively, to detect myocardial scar on FDG PET. For QS complexes, sensitivity and specificity were 46% and 59%, respectively, and PPV and NPV were 36% and 68%, respectively. Sensitivity was lower, but specificity was significantly higher in both the LCX and RCA compared to the LAD territory (p < 0.001), particularly for QS complexes.

Conclusion

Pathological Q waves on resting 12-lead ECG have poor or at best moderate sensitivity and specificity to detect myocardial scar on FDG PET. These findings support the use of more advanced imaging techniques to assess myocardial viability in ICM.

### Another step toward early ischemia Detection? [^112EaYEk]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

This is not the first portable 3-lead system to be introduced. Van Heuverswyn et aldemonstrated the feasibility of their 3-lead detection ("RELF") automatic algorithm built into a mobile handheld device for detection of acute coronary artery occlusion in patients who had been discharged with planned elective PCI. Self-recording was feasible for most patients with a sensitivity of 0.95 and 0.87 for an acute coronary artery occlusion with and without ECG changes respectively. Another smartphone ECG algorithm derives a 12-lead ECG equivalent from multiple single-lead recordings from a modified version of the AliveCor Heart Monitor paired with a fifth generation iPod Touch device. This has shown good correlation with the standard 12-lead ECG at time of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction presentation. The Apple Watch is also capable of creating an ECG by positioning the smartwatch at various positions along the precordium creating 6 single-lead ECGs for V 1 to V 6 and has showed a strong correlation with the standard ECG.

The decision to proceed to coronary angiography is made on the complete patient presentation (history and physical exam, ECG, and focused bloodwork). However, we are fast entering into a new world where the ECG may soon take precedence. One can imagine in the not-so-distant future that smart-devices will be able to automatically detect active ischemia in the field, activate a rapid-response team that includes an ambulance and a cath lab team to provide streamlined access, skipping the emergency department altogether. Improving early detection and rapid response to a myocardial infarction is necessary; however, we need to proceed cautiously ensuring that the interpretation accounts for the patient as a whole.

### Estimating myocardial infarction size with a simple electrocardiographic marker score [^117ATgwb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Each patient ECG was also coded for the presence of contiguous QWMI (cQWMI), contiguous fragmented QRS (cFQRS), and contiguous T wave inversion (cTWI). These contiguous ECG markers required involvement of ≥ 2 ECG leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory (II‐III‐aVF, I‐aVL, or V 1‐6; aVF = augmented Vector Foot, aVL = augmented Vector Left). Figure 1 illustrates examples of ECG's with a range of contiguous ECG abnormalities, with corresponding CMR images.

DETERMINE Score and Selvester Score

The modified Selvester QRS scoring system was developed to estimate infarct size using 37 ECG criteria to calculate an overall score with a possible range of 0 to 29. We applied the criteria as previously defined. 8 We developed our own simplified scoring system to estimate infarct size based on the presence and extent of abnormal ECG markers. Multivariable linear regression was performed to assess the independent relationship between the number of leads affected by each ECG marker and MI% by CMR. In Model S3 of Table S1A the B coefficient relating the number of leads with QW to infarct size was approximately double the B coefficients relating the number of leads with FQRS and TWI to infarct size. Therefore, we defined: DETERMINE Score = [number of leads with QW (×2)]+[number of leads with FQRS]+[number of leads with TWI].

### Dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia and ST-segment elevation in collateral-dependent myocardium [^116ZVqai]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

In patients with obstructive coronary artery disease, electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-segment elevation (STE) is frequently seen during dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) in leads overlying previous transmural left ventricular (LV) myocardial infarction. The mechanism of occasional STE during DSE in LV region with inducible myocardial ischemia and no previous myocardial infarction has not been well delineated. We retrospectively identified 28 adults (age 51 to 83 years [69 ± 8]; 82% men) with STE (> 1 mm at ≥ 80 ms after J point in ≥ 2 contiguous leads without pathologic Q waves) and inducible myocardial ischemia in the same territory during DSE. STE occurred in inferior (n = 16), inferolateral (n = 8), anterior (n = 1), lateral (n = 2), or anterolateral (n = 1) leads and was associated with ischemic symptoms in 17 patients (61%). Inducible LV wall motion abnormality developed in LV segments corresponding to ECG STE in all patients. Coronary arteriography (within 1 week of the index DSE) showed severe luminal narrowing in the major epicardial coronary artery supplying the region with DSE STE and ischemia (90% to 99% in 9 patients [32%] and 100% in 19 patients [68%]). The ischemic region was supplied by ipsilateral (n = 4 [14%]), contralateral (n = 21 [75%]), or both ipsilateral and contralateral (n = 3 [11%]) collateral branches. In conclusion, dobutamine-induced ECG STE in LV segments with normal baseline wall motion is a highly reliable marker of viable collateral-dependent myocardium.

### Myocardial ischaemia in patients with coronary endothelial dysfunction: insights from body surface ECG mapping and implications for invasive evaluation of chronic chest pain [^112TKWtp]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Aims

Coronary endothelial dysfunction (ED), by predisposing to abnormal vasomotion, may cause chest pain in individuals with non-obstructed coronary arteries. The aim of this study was to correlate the magnitude of coronary ED with the presence and extent of inducible myocardial ischaemia using body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) mapping in symptomatic patients.

Methods and Results

In 30 patients with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries or mild atherosclerosis, we studied endothelium-dependent responses with acetylcholine (ACH) and endothelium-independent function with nitroglycerin and adenosine in the left anterior descending artery. Eighty-lead body surface ECG maps were collected at baseline and after each dose of ACH. There was a significant correlation between the maximal change in epicardial diameter with ACH and the magnitude of ST-segment shift [r = -0.44 (95% CI: -0.097 to -0.69), P = 0.015]. Patients with ≥ 0.05 mV ST-segment shift/lead had greater epicardial vasoconstriction (31.6 vs. 15.6%, P = 0.019), and lower coronary flow reserve (2.9 vs. 3.6, P = 0.047) compared with those with ST-segment shift < 0.05 mV. Four patients had inducible ischaemia with ACH in the absence of abnormal epicardial or global microvascular vasomotion (> 20% decrease in diameter or < 50% increase in blood flow).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that abnormal vasomotion due to coronary ED is associated with myocardial ischaemia in patients with chest pain. The magnitude of ischaemia correlates with the extent of ED. A small subset of patients develop myocardial ischaemia during ACH infusion without significant abnormalities in epicardial or global microvascular endothelium-dependent blood flow responses.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^116d8aj8]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) — clinical features, ECG, and biomarkers: TTS can mimic myocardial infarction (MI) and is found in 1% to 2% of patients presenting with suspected ST-elevation MI (STEMI); its onset is often triggered by intense emotional or physical stress such as bereavement, and over 90% of patients are postmenopausal women. Cardiovascular complications occur in 50% of patients, and the inpatient mortality is similar to STEMI (4% to 5%); ST-segment elevation is frequent (44%) and is usually widespread across the lateral and precordial leads beyond a single coronary artery distribution, whereas ST-segment depression occurs in < 10% of patients and after 12 to 24 hours deep, symmetric T wave inversion and QTc prolongation are typically observed. There are usually transient elevations in cardiac troponin (cTn) levels (> 95% of cases), but the peak cTn values observed are modest and contrast with the large territory of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction.

### Usefulness of fragmented QRS on a 12-lead electrocardiogram in acute coronary syndrome for predicting mortality [^114xN5vu]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Electrocardiographic signs of a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) are nonspecific, and therefore the diagnosis of NSTEMI during acute coronary syndromes (ACS) depends mainly on cardiac biomarker levels. Fragmented QRS (fQRS) represents myocardial conduction abnormalities due to myocardial infarction (MI) scars in patients with coronary artery disease. However, the time of appearance of fQRS during ACS has not been investigated. It was postulated that in patients with ACS, fQRS on 12-lead electrocardiography occurs within 48 hours of presentation with NSTEMI as well as ST elevation MI and that fQRS predicts mortality. Serial electrocardiograms from 896 patients with ACS (mean age 62 ± 11 years, 98% men) who underwent cardiac catheterization were studied. Four hundred forty-one patients had MIs, including 337 patients with NSTEMIs, and 455 patients had unstable angina (the control group). Serial electrocardiograms were obtained every 6 to 8 hours during the first 24 hours after the diagnosis of MI and the next day (< 48 hours). Fragmented QRS on 12-lead electrocardiography was defined by the presence of single or multiple notches in the R or S wave, without a typical bundle branch block, in ≥ 2 contiguous leads in 1 of the major coronary artery territories. Fragmented QRS developed in 224 patients (51%) in the MI group and only 17 (3.7%) in the control group (p < 0.001). New Q waves developed in 122 (28%), 76 (23%), and 2 (0.4%) patients in the MI, NSTEMI, and control groups, respectively. The sensitivity values of fQRS for ST elevation MI and NSTEMI were 55% and 50%, respectively. The specificity of fQRS was 96%. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with fQRS had significantly decreased times to death compared to those without fQRS. Fragmented QRS, T-wave inversion, and ST depression were independent predictors of mortality during a mean follow-up period of 34 ± 16 months. In conclusion, fQRS on 12-lead electrocardiography is a moderately sensitive but highly specific sign for ST elevation MI and NSTEMI. Fragmented QRS is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with ACS.

### Prevalence of electrocardiographic markers associated with myocardial fibrosis in masters athletes: a cohort study [^116Qucpm]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The prevalence of fQRS exceeded rates in the general population and patients with known or suspected cardiac disease or chronic kidney disease, highlighting the distinct cardiac characteristics of masters athletes. In contrast, among subjects with angiographically documented coronary artery disease (CAD) with ≥ 50% occlusion in one of the main coronary arteries without prior myocardial infarction, fQRS was observed in 35.3%, exceeding the prevalence in our cohort. In patients with CAD and a history of prior myocardial infarction, the prevalence of fQRS was even higher, approximately 40%, indicating a significant association between fQRS and the extent of myocardial damage in these patients.

While fQRS was associated with conditions such as prolonged PR interval, incomplete RBBB, LVH and RVH, it is important to note that fQRS was not solely attributable to these abnormalities, as in only a subset of athletes. Some cases involved multiple cardiac territories, indicating that additional underlying cardiac changes beyond the typical abnormalities may contribute to the presence of fQRS. Our study found 8% TWI prevalence and 3% prolonged QRS complex prevalence, contrasting with higher rates in the general population. However, TWI in anterior chest leads may indicate a physiological norm variant, similar to pathological Q waves, especially in lead III.

Abnormal ECG findings underscore the need for systematic cardiac screening in masters athletes. Using our study as a pre-participation screening method for cardiovascular conditions (excluding MF markers) in masters athletes would have identified 16% of participating masters athletes for potential further cardiac examinations.

Consistent with existing literature, our findings suggest that the advancing age of athletes, rather than their athletic specialisation, may substantially impact MF development. Although fQRS was more frequently observed in older masters athletes in our cohort, the Pearson correlation between fQRS and age was not statistically significant (p = 0.548), indicating no strict correlation with increasing age.

Ageing is well-documented to induce progressive fibrosis changes in various organ systems, including the cardiovascular system, where ageing is associated with LVH and MF, even in otherwise healthy adults. Athletes generally risk developing MF more than their sedentary counterparts. However, it is crucial to emphasise the comprehensive benefits of regular exercise for overall health during the ageing process, with its advantages significantly outweighing potential risks and side effects.

Our study contributes to the growing literature on MF-related ECG markers in athletes.

ECG marker definition

fQRS, characterised by RSR' patterns in the QRS interval (< 120 ms) with or without the Q wave, was defined by additional R waves (R'), notching in the nadir of the S wave, or the presence of more than one R' within two contiguous leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory. For example, fQRS in ≥ 2 contiguous anterior leads (V1 to V5) indicated MF in anterior segments or the left anterior descending territory, while fQRS in ≥ 2 contiguous lateral leads (I, aVL and V6) indicated MF in lateral segments or left circumflex territory. Similarly, fQRS in ≥ 2 contiguous inferior leads (II, III and aVF) was associated with MF in the inferior segments or the right coronary artery territory.TWI was defined as a T wave amplitude of ≤ −0.1 mV in at least two anterior (V1−V3), lateral (I, aVL, V4−V6) or inferior (II, aVF, III) leads. Pathological Q waves were defined as Q waves in at least two contiguous leads with the following criteria: > 20 ms in V2 and V3, ≥ 40 ms and ≥ 0.1 mV deep in lead III and ≥ 30 ms and ≥ 0.1 mV deep in other leads. A prolonged QRS complex was defined as > 110 ms without bundle branch blocks in at least two contiguous leads. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) were determined by a positive Sokolow–Lyon index. Additionally, the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB), right bundle branch block (RBBB) and prolonged PR interval (> 200 ms) were investigated for their association with MF-related ECG markers.

### Machine learning-based prediction of acute coronary syndrome using only the pre-hospital 12-lead electrocardiogram [^112NpQ1s]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Nearly seven million Americans visit the emergency department annually for a chief complaint of chest pain. Approximately ten percent of those patients have an acute disruption in blood supply to the heart attributed to underlying atherosclerotic disease in the coronary arteries, a life-threatening condition referred to as acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, more than 50–75% of the seven million patients with chest pain are admitted to the hospital because the initial clinical evaluation is not sufficient to rule in or rule out ACS. This problem results from the low sensitivity of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and initial clinical data to predict the presence of ongoing acute myocardial ischemia in those with ACS. As the first available clinical test, the standard 10-s 12-lead ECG can identify a small subset of ACS patients that have ST segment elevation on their ECG, hence the term ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The majority (> 50%) of ACS patients, however, have no such ST elevation on their ECG, and thus require a time-consuming biomarker-driven approach and/or provocative testing to rule in or out acute myocardial ischemia. More sensitive classification tools using the 12-lead ECG could improve speed and accuracy of ACS detection.

Critical narrowing or occlusion of a coronary artery leads to myocardial ischemia in the region supplied by that coronary artery. Regional ischemia leads to reduction in the duration, resting potential, and propagation velocity of action potentials in the affected myocardium, which leads to a wide variability in the conduction speeds between various myocardial regions. Variability in conduction speeds between the epicardial and endocardial walls of the affected region results in temporal changes in specific ECG leads facing that region (i.e. features of waveform duration and amplitude in individual leads), whereas variability in ischemic regions and healthy myocardium results in spatial changes between orthogonal ECG leads (i.e. features of global electrical heterogeneity). Thus, using both temporal and spatial features of the 12-lead ECG would be more robust in detecting ACS than using temporal waveform features alone, such as ST elevation. We have shown that mild-to-moderate ischemia distorts the temporal–spatial features of the 12-lead ECG before ST changes evolve, suggesting that building sensitive ACS classification algorithms using only the 12-lead ECG is plausible.

2.3 Coronary Angiography and Gensini Score Calculation

Coronary angiography records were reviewed for all included patients. All procedures had been performed via the femoral or radial approach during the index hospitalization, following standard techniques. Coronary angiograms were retrospectively analyzed by two experienced interventional cardiologists who were blinded to the ECG findings. The severity of CAD was quantified using the Gensini score, which considers both the degree of luminal narrowing and the functional significance of the location of the stenosis. For each lesion, a severity score was assigned: 1 for 1%−25% stenosis, 2 for 26%−50%, 4 for 51%−75%, 8 for 76%−90%, 16 for 91%−99%, and 32 for total occlusion. This score was then multiplied by a factor representing the functional significance of the lesion location: left main (5), proximal left anterior descending (LAD) or proximal left circumflex (2.5), mid‐LAD (1.5), distal LAD, first diagonal, proximal right coronary artery (RCA), distal left circumflex, obtuse marginal, or posterior descending artery (1), and others (0.5). The total Gensini score was calculated as the sum of all segment scores.

Based on the Gensini score, patients were classified into two groups: mild CAD (Gensini score < 25, n = 81) and moderate‐to‐severe CAD (Gensini score ≥ 25, n = 102).

2.4 Definition of MACE

In‐hospital MACE was defined as a composite of cardiac death, recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, malignant ventricular arrhythmias requiring intervention, or urgent revascularization during the index hospitalization. All events were identified through a comprehensive review of electronic medical records, including daily progress notes, cardiac monitoring records, procedure reports, and discharge summaries.

### ECG-gated multi-detector row spiral CT in the assessment of myocardial infarction: correlation with non-invasive angiographic findings [^113tetDE]. European Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Our objective was to retrospectively evaluate the ability of multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) to detect previous myocardial infarctions (MIs) and to correlate necrosis with the status of coronary arteries supplying the infarcted territory. After having clinically evaluated 187 patients referred for ECG-gated MDCT of the coronary arteries, 30 previous MIs were identified in 29 patients (9 recent and 21 chronic). MDCT data were evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively by measuring attenuation values and wall thickness within the infarcted region and normal adjacent myocardium. Each MI was also assigned to the distribution territory of a coronary vessel, and morphological data were combined with MDCT angiographic findings. MDCT was able to detect 25/30 MIs showing an overall sensitivity and specificity of 83 and 91%, respectively. Quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in attenuation values between normal and infarcted regions (38.9 ± 14 HU vs. 104.0 ± 16 HU). Regional wall thinning was observed in chronic MIs (4.1 ± 2 mm vs. 10.5 ± 3.8 mm), and not in patients with recent event (7.9 ± 1.6 mm vs 9.1 ± 4 mm). In 22/25 cases, MDCT angiographic findings showed the presence of suspicious critical lumen narrowing (n = 3), previous coronary stenting (n = 14) and surgical revascularization (n = 5) in the infarct-related coronary. During a single examination, MDCT might provide comprehensive imaging of MI offering a combined morphological and angiographic assessment.

### Localising culprit artery in inferior STEMI [^111p3ypi]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) represents a cardiac emergency. Time to diagnosis, identification of culprit lesion, and intervention are important. Inferior STEMI represents a dilemma for cardiologists. The territory can be supplied by the right coronary artery (RCA) or the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx). Diagnostic algorithms have been proposed to predict the culprit artery.

Methods

We performed a single-centre retrospective cohort analysis of all patients admitted to our hospital from 2008 to 2020 with a diagnosis of inferior STEMI. We examined the diagnostic 12 lead ECG for quantification of ST elevation in leads II and III and compared this to culprit lesion found on angiography.

Results

There were 304 patients identified with STEMI in our database; 105 were found to have an inferior myocardial infarction by ECG criteria. Ninety-nine were included in our study with either RCA or LCx culprit lesions on angiography (82 males, 17 females). The average age of these patients was 64.9 years old. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for ST elevation in lead II exceeding lead III predicting LCx culprit lesion was 0.32 (95%CI 0.13 to 0.57), 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.98), 0.55 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.78), 0.85 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.89), respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for ST elevation in lead III exceeding lead II predicting RCA culprit lesion was 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.98), 0.32 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.57), 0.85 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.89), 0.55 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.78), respectively.

Conclusions

In inferior STEMI, comparison of ST elevation in leads II and III can reliably predict culprit lesion artery and guide intervention.

### QRS fragmentation and sudden cardiac death in the obese and overweight [^117URtmQ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

QRS Fragmentation and Other ECG Parameters

Parameters assessed from the 12‐lead ECG included heart rate, QRS duration, QT interval, presence of Q waves, and QRS fragmentation. ECGs prior but unrelated to the SCD event were used for cases. Taking into consideration previously established criteria for assessing fQRS, the present analysis was limited to ECGs with narrow QRS (QRS duration < 120 ms). The QT interval was corrected using Bazett's formulaand categorized as normal or abnormal using sex‐specific criteria (men: QT c ≤ 430 ms — normal, 431 to 450 ms — borderline, > 450 ms — abnormal; women: QTc ≤ 450 ms — normal, 451 to 470 ms — borderline, > 470 ms — abnormal). Pathologic Q waves were defined as Q waves ≥ 40 milliseconds in duration and > 25% of the voltage of the following R wave. Q waves were classified according to territory, based on presence in at least 2 contiguous leads, as anterior (leads V1–V5), lateral (leads I, aVL, and V6), and inferior (leads II, III, and aVF). fQRS was identified as previously definedby the presence of various RSR′ patterns with or without Q wave, including an additional R wave (R′), notching of the R wave, notching in the nadir of the S wave, or the presence of more than 1 R′ (fragmentation) in at least 2 contiguous leads corresponding to a major coronary artery territory (Figure 1 A and 1 B). If notching was confined only to the terminal QRS accompanied by J point elevation of ≥ 0.1 mV, it was classified as early repolarization pattern rather than fragmentation. Fragmentation was classified by anatomic territory, similar to Q waves, into anterior (leads V1–V5), lateral (leads I, aVL, and V6), or inferior (leads II, III, and aVF). ECG assessment for fragmentation and Q waves were performed by 2 trained readers blinded to the case/control status of the subjects. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Cedars‐Sinai Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University, and all participating hospitals.

### Relation of ST-segment changes in inferior leads during anterior wall acute myocardial infarction to length and occlusion site of the left anterior descending coronary artery [^111AQ1DY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

We investigated the relation between left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery morphology and inferior lead ST-segment changes to elucidate the clinical significance of such changes in 159 patients with anterior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Patients with 1-vessel LAD artery lesions were divided into an ST depression group (n = 40), an ST elevation group (n = 25), and a no-ST-change group (n = 94) based on ST-segment changes in the inferior leads. The relation between each group and the infarct-related lesion and the presence of a wrapped LAD artery was then investigated. The percentage of patients with the infarct-related lesion in the proximal LAD artery was significantly higher in the ST depression group and significantly lower in the ST elevation group. The percentage of patients with a wrapped LAD artery was significantly higher in the ST elevation group and significantly lower in the ST depression group. The wall motion index determined echocardiographically was significantly higher in the ST depression group and the no-ST-change group than in the ST elevation group. Our findings suggest that inferior lead ST-segment changes during anterior wall AMI arise as a result of competition between reciprocal changes caused by high lateral wall AMI due to lesions of the proximal LAD artery, which depress the ST segment, and inferoapical wall AMI due to a wrapped LAD artery, which elevates the ST segment. In patients with no ST-segment changes, echocardiography was useful for distinguishing the amount of affected LAD artery territory.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Inferior wall infarction and right ventricular involvement — ECG patterns and recording recommendations are as follows: Inferior wall infarction that results in ST-segment elevation in only leads II, III, and aVF may be the result of occlusion of either the right coronary artery (RCA) or the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx). When the RCA is occluded, this will result in greater ST-segment elevation in lead III than in lead II and will often be associated with ST-segment depression in leads I and aVL. When the RCA is occluded in its proximal portion, ischemia/infarction of the right ventricle may occur, which causes ST-segment elevation in leads placed on the right anterior chest, in positions referred to as V3R and V4R, and often in lead V1; leads V3R and V4R should be recorded as rapidly as possible after the onset of chest pain, and the joint task force has recommended that right-sided chest leads V3R and V4R be recorded in all patients presenting with ECG evidence of acute inferior wall ischemia/infarction. In addition, 1) ECG machines should be programmed to suggest the recording of the right-sided chest leads V3R and V4R when ST elevation greater than 0.1 mV occurs in leads II, III, and aVF; 2) ECG machines should be equipped with a mechanism to label leads V3R and V4R; and 3) descriptive and interpretative statements should be developed to describe and interpret abnormalities that might occur in leads V3R and V4R.

### Is anteroseptal myocardial infarction an appropriate term? [^116KpKdN]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Anteroseptal myocardial infarction is defined by the presence of electrocardiographic Q-waves limited to precordial leads V(1) to V(2), V(3), or V(4). We sought to determine whether this term is appropriate by correlating electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, and angiographic findings. We studied 50 consecutive patients admitted for a first acute myocardial infarction with Q-waves in precordial leads V(1) to V(2)-V(4), and who had undergone echocardiography and coronary angiography during hospitalization. Echocardiograms in the apical long-axis, two-chamber, and four-chamber views were studied using a wall motion scoring index.Q-waves were present in precordial leads V(1)-V(2) in 4 patients, V(1)-V(3) in 28 patients, and V(1)-V(4) in the remaining 18 patients. The presumptive culprit lesion was in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending artery in 15 patients, in the middle segment in 33 patients, and indeterminate in 2 patients. This lesion was before the first septal branch in 19 patients and after the first septal branch in 29. Mean (± SD) left ventricular ejection fraction was 51% ± 10%. Echocardiographic analysis showed that the septal wall was never the only wall that was affected. However, the apex was affected in all patients and was the only wall that was affected in 26 (52%) patients (apical wall index, 2.1 ± 0.5). In the remaining 24 patients, the septum was also affected (septal index, 1.5 ± 0.3), but less severely than was the apex (apical index, 2.3 ± 0.4; P < 0.0001 vs. septum). In these 24 patients, the anterior and lateral walls were also affected (anterior index, 1.4 ± 0.4; lateral index, 1.1 ± 0.2), but again, less severely than was the apex (P < 0.0001 for both vs. apex). Neither angiographic nor echocardiographic data support the notion of an isolated anteroseptal myocardial infarction. Left anterior descending artery involvement appears more often to be midsegment and postseptal. The apex is always and principally affected. These findings suggest that anteroseptal myocardial infarction is a misnomer and that the V(1) to V(2)-V(4) Q-wave pattern should be considered to indicate a predominantly apical, and generally limited, myocardial infarction.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Acute anterior wall ischemia/infarction — electrocardiogram (ECG) automated interpretation mapping to left anterior descending (LAD) occlusion is specified as follows: Anterior wall ischemia/infarction is invariably due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. When ST-segment elevation is present in I and aVL, as well as in leads V1 through V4 and sometimes in V5 and V6, and ST-segment depression is present in leads II, III, and aVF, the automated interpretation should suggest an extensive anterior wall or anterobasal ischemia/infarction due to occlusion of the proximal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. When ST-segment elevation is present in leads V3 through V6 and ST-segment depression is not present in leads II, III, and aVF, the automated interpretation should suggest anterior wall ischemia/infarction due to occlusion of the mid or distal portion of the left anterior descending coronary artery.

### Electrocardiographic clue for a mid-LAD lesion [^114PMAUA]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

ECG is still the first diagnostic tool for coronary artery disease. It is possible to predict the localisation of affected vessel(s) through ST and T changes on ECG. Sometimes, reciprocal changes may be the only marker of acute myocardial ischaemia, as single T-wave inversion in lead aVL may represent a coronary artery lesion in the left anterior descending (LAD). A 49-year-old woman presented to the emergency department, with left-sided chest pain. Her initial ECG showed no ischaemic changes. On the third hour ECG there was T-wave inversion in leads aVL and V2, and troponin turned positive. Coronary angiography showed 90% mid-LAD occlusion. The importance of this case is that patients with ischaemic chest pain should be followed with serial ECG. Also, emergency physicians should be alert to identify new changes on ECG, as isolated T-wave inversion in lead aVL can be the only finding to take the patient into the catheterisation laboratory.

### Lead aVL on electrocardiogram: emerging as important lead in early diagnosis of myocardial infarction? [^1125FPR9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Although a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) that mandates emergency reperfusion therapy requires ST-segment elevation greater than 1 mm in at least 2 contiguous leads, some of the early electrocardiogram (ECG) changes of AMI can be subtle. Any ST-segment depression or T-wave inversion in lead aVL may be implicated in left anterior descending artery lesion or early reciprocal changes of inferior wall myocardial infarction, particularly when the clinical context suggests ischemia. Early recognition of reciprocal changes and serial ECG help initiate early appropriate intervention. Heightened awareness of ST segment and T-wave changes in lead aVL is of paramount importance to quickly identifying life-threatening condition.

Quantification "most commonly" uses the Agatston technique where "the total calcium score is a summed score based on the amount and density of calcified plaque", and per SCCT "CAC scores should be reported both as total score for the patient, and as scores for each individual coronary artery".

### Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in angiographically documented occluded infarct vessel: limitations of ST-segment elevation in standard and extended ECG leads [^114xw4Wj]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The majority of thrombolysis studies require defined ST-segment elevations as an inclusion criterion for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, depending on the occluded infarct vessel and the criteria applied, the ECG diagnosis of AMI can be difficult to establish. Accordingly, this study was performed to evaluate the sensitivity of ST-segment elevation of standard and extended ECG leads in a cohort of patients with angiographically confirmed diagnosis of AMI.

Patients and Methods

In 418 patients (mean ± SD age, 60 ± 13 years) with AMI (pain onset, 4.8 ± 3.0 h), coronary angiography with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty/stenting of the culprit lesion was performed. The diagnosis of AMI was confirmed by emergency coronary angiography and laboratory analyses. ST-segment elevation (in two contiguous leads) of 1 mm in standard lead I through aVF and ST-segment elevations of 2 mm (or 1 mm, corresponding values presented in parentheses) in V(1) through V(6) were considered significant. In a subset of 102 AMI patients, additional right precordial leads V(3)R through V(6)R for evaluation of right ventricular infarction and additional chest leads V(7) through V(9) for evaluation of posterior infarction were recorded. ST-segment elevations of 1 mm in the right precordial leads and 1 mm or 0.5 mm in the posterior leads were considered significant.

Results

Standard leads I through V(6) showed ST-segment elevation in 85% (96%) of patients with left anterior descending artery occlusion, in 46% (61%) of patients with left circumflex coronary artery (CX) occlusion, and in 85% (90%) of patients with right coronary artery occlusion. On consideration of additional ECG tracings in the subgroup of 102 patients (V(3)R through V(6)R and V(7) through V(9)), the respective numbers increased by 2 to 8% depending on different criteria for ST-segment elevation; in patients with CX occlusion, the increase amounted to 6 to 14%. There was a trend toward an extended infarct size (maximum creatine kinase [CK] values) with concomitant ST-segment elevation in additional ECG leads as assessed by maximum CK levels.

Conclusions

The sensitivity of the ECG diagnosis of AMI is only marginally increased by extended precordial chest leads. There is a trend toward an extended infarct size in those patients with concomitant ST-segment elevation in additional ECG leads.

### Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography expert consensus document on myocardial computed tomography perfusion imaging [^111KbdNS]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2019). High credibility.

Myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) key consensus statements — We recommend that myocardial CTP may be added to coronary CTA when there is a high likelihood of ischemic heart disease, known CAD, prior coronary intervention, or significant calcifications, and additionally, CTP may be added when there is a known stenosis of indeterminate functional significance. Myocardial CTP imaging with pharmacologic stress testing requires supervision by a trained healthcare provider experienced in the administration of pharmacologic stress agents and stress testing. Continuous 12-lead ECG monitoring may be performed using radiolucent electrodes and leads; alternatively, 12-lead ECG monitoring can be interrupted during scan acquisition while continuous rhythm is still being recorded and monitored by the scanner console, and upon the completion of imaging, a 12 lead ECG should be performed to ensure there are no significant changes from baseline suggestive of post-stress myocardial ischemia or injury. A delay of 10–20 minutes between the rest and stress CTP acquisitions is recommended to minimize myocardial contrast agent contamination and to eliminate the potential adverse interactions of pharmacologic stress agents and nitroglycerin administration. In static visual CTP interpretation, myocardial images are typically arranged using three standard orthogonal views - the short axis, vertical long axis, and horizontal long axis, and perfusion defects should be described in terms of size, transmurality, and reversibility in the context of the degree of stenosis in the supplying coronary artery.

Results

Baseline Characteristics

Of the 482 patients who entered the study, 168 were excluded from analysis because of STEMI (n = 86), 12‐lead ECG confounders (n = 73), therapy before 12‐lead ECG and/or BSPM (n = 7), and a delay > 15 minutes between 12‐lead ECG and BSPM (n = 2). No patient was excluded for having > 6 leads of poor quality on BSPM. Thus, 314 patients met the study criteria (62% male; age 64 ± 11 years) (Figure 1), 254 (81%) of whom had AMI by cTnT/CK‐MB definition. Patients with AMI had higher incidence of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cigarette smoking than non‐AMI patients (Table 1). However, non‐AMI patients were more likely to be male and have a prior history of AMI and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) than those with AMI. Otherwise, baseline characteristics between groups were similar.

BSPM Diagnosis

Of the 254 (81%) who had AMI, 231 patients had BSPM STE — sensitivity 0.91 (95% CI: 0.77–1.00), specificity 0.72 (95% CI: 0.61–0.85), positive predictive value 0.93 (95% CI: 0.84–1.00), negative predictive value 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56–0.85), and c‐statistic 0.803 (95% CI: 0.700–0.907) for AMI diagnosis (P < 0.001). Of those with BSPM STE and AMI (n = 231), STE maxima were most frequently detected in the posterior (n = 111, 48%), lateral (n = 53, 23%), inferior (n = 39, 17%), RV (n = 21, 9%), and high right anterior (n = 7, 3%) territories (Table 2, Figures 3 and 4). Furthermore, there was overlap with other territories not reaching the maxima but above the threshold, most frequently occurring in the inferoposterior and inferolateral regions.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to indications for revascularization, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to choose between revascularization or medical therapy alone, after careful evaluation, preferably by the heart team, of coronary anatomy, correlation between CAD and LV dysfunction, comorbidities, life expectancy, individual risk-to-benefit ratio, and patient perspectives in patients with chronic coronary syndrome with LVEF ≤ 35%.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^1112igCX]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Electrocardiographic detection of myocardial infarction — an electrocardiogram (ECG) "should be acquired and interpreted promptly (ie, target within 10 minutes) after first medical contact", and "prehospital ECGs reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment, and can facilitate the triage of STEMI patients… if within the recommended time interval (120 minutes from STEMI diagnosis)". For ongoing symptoms or a nondiagnostic tracing, "recording several standard ECGs… at 15–30 minute intervals for the initial 1–2 hours, or the use of continuous computer-assisted 12-lead ECG recording… is reasonable". Certain patterns carry prognostic/diagnostic implications: "ST-segment depression ≥ 1 mm in 6 leads… is suggestive evidence of multivessel disease or left main disease", while a comparison tracing helps but "should not delay the decision for treatment". Early ischemic changes include "increased hyperacute T wave amplitude… in at least 2 contiguous leads", and infarction evolution is reflected as "the development of new Q waves" indicating necrosis that "starts minutes/hours after the myocardial insult", with "transient Q waves" sometimes seen during acute ischemia or "(rarely) during acute MI with successful reperfusion".

Electrocardiogram (ECG) — aVR ST-segment elevation pattern is most often caused by diffuse subendocardial ischemia and usually occurs with significant left main coronary artery or multivessel coronary artery disease, characterized by ST-segment elevation in aVR ≥ 1 mm with absence of contiguous ST-segment elevation in other leads.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Medium credibility.

Acute ischemia/infarction ECG standardization — lead labeling and limb lead display — states that labeling specific leads as anterior, inferior, and lateral should be avoided, and that leads should be identified according to their original nomenclature (leads I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, and V1 through V6). It also recommends that ECG machines should be equipped with switching systems that will allow the limb leads to be displayed and labeled appropriately in their anatomically contiguous sequence.

Electrocardiogram — supportive considerations: When an ECG is nondiagnostic, it "should be compared with previous ECGs, if available", and "a normal or unchanged ECG is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out ACS", so decision‑making "should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG". Masking conditions may occur, and "Up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the ED with a normal ECG", therefore "serial ECGs should be performed and management should be guided by new electrocardiographic changes or other diagnostic testing". When ST‑elevation is present on the initial ECG, "management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms", and if ST depression is identified, "management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines". Because a normal ECG may accompany certain occlusions and posterior ischemia, which is "often 'electrically silent'; therefore, right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected".

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Electrocardiogram interpretation and repeat testing — supportive points: A normal or unchanged electrocardiogram (ECG) is reasonably useful but not sufficient at ruling out acute coronary syndrome (ACS), decision-making should not be based solely on a single normal or nondiagnostic ECG, and up to 6% of patients with evolving ACS are discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a normal ECG; when the initial ECG is normal or without ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, or ST depression, serial ECGs should be performed and the timing for repeat ECG should be guided by symptoms; when ST-elevation is present on the initial ECG, management should follow the prescribed STEMI treatment algorithms, and if ST depression is identified on the initial ECG, management should follow the NSTE-ACS guidelines; a normal ECG may be associated with left circumflex or right coronary artery occlusions and posterior wall ischemia, therefore right-sided ECG leads should be considered when such lesions are suspected; an initial normal ECG does not exclude ACS and patients with an initial normal ECG should have a repeat ECG if symptoms are ongoing until other diagnostic testing rules out ACS.

### Clinical and electrocardiographic correlates of normal coronary angiography in patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention [^114cyzy1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

This study sought to determine the prevalence as well as clinical and electrocardiographic correlates of patients referred for primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who had angiographically normal coronary arteries. Data for 690 consecutive patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) referred for primary PCI within a metropolitan area health service were reviewed. Characteristics of patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (n = 87; 13%) were compared with patients with angiographically shown culprit lesions (control group; n = 594). Nine patients with significant coronary disease, but no identifiable culprit lesion, were excluded. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) from both groups were reviewed by 2 cardiologists blinded to angiographic findings. Patients in the normal coronaries group were younger and had fewer risk factors. On expert review of ECGs, 55% of patients in the normal coronaries group had ST-elevation criteria for STEMI (vs 93% in the control group; p < 0.001), but the ECG was considered consistent with a diagnosis of STEMI by both observers in only 33% (vs 92% in the control group; p < 0.001). Left branch bundle block independently correlated with normal coronary arteries on multivariate analysis (odds ratio for STEMI 0.016, 95% confidence interval 0.004 to 0.064, p < 0.001). The discharge diagnosis in the normal coronaries group was predominantly pericarditis (n = 72; 83%). In conclusion, the prevalence of angiographically normal coronary arteries in patients referred for primary PCI was 13%. Electrocardiographic correlation suggested that this can be reduced by adherence to conventional electrocardiographic criteria for STEMI diagnosis and review of ECGs by experienced clinicians.

Additional ECG findings consistent with acute coronary artery occlusion — diagnostic cues — note that the application of STEMI ECG criteria on a standard 12-lead ECG alone will miss a significant minority of patients who have acute coronary occlusion; therefore, the ECG should be closely examined for subtle changes such as hyperacute T waves or ST-segment elevation < 1 mm, particularly when combined with reciprocal ST-segment depression, as concomitant reciprocal ST-segment depression may be visually more evident than ST-segment elevation; if present, these patients should be evaluated for emergent coronary angiography.

### Localising culprit artery in inferior STEMI [^112dxjrT]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

When comparing our findings to the studies summarised in table 5, our data are mostly in agreement. In particular, sensitivity and PPV for III > II predicting RCA culprit artery are high. The specificity of this algorithm in our study was lower than those in table 5, likely driven by our low overall number of both II > III ECGs and LCx culprit lesions.

We find it most clinically relevant to examine PPV, as we anticipate this algorithm will be most often used when a cardiologist needs to make a rapid decision of which coronary artery to plan for intervention based on ECG data. In this sense, both II > III predicting LCx culprit artery and III > II predicting RCA culprit artery perform well, with high PPVs.

Our data and interpretation is potentially limited by our small sample size, in particular our small number of cases in which ST elevation in lead II exceeded lead III. In addition, our review is a retrospective analysis of prospectively gathered data. Some of the other studies cited in table 5 also used different leads to complement their analysis which may account for the improved sensitivity for LCx obstruction using vector analysis. A potential area for future study could be assessing if the ratio of lead II and III elevations can be used to guide order of vessel evaluation in the setting of inferior STEMI and if this results in a shorter door-to-balloon time.

### Improving the diagnosis of culprit left circumflex occlusion with acute myocardial infarction in patients with a nondiagnostic 12-lead ECG at presentation: a retrospective cohort study [^113NKF5y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

In previously published work from our unit, epicardial potentials derived from the BSPM, a technique known as inverse electrocardiography, have been shown to further improve BSPM sensitivity for AMI diagnosis — sensitivity 98%, specificity 79%, positive predictive value 85%, and negative predictive value 97%. 30 Moreover, early BSPM in patients with ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest and return of spontaneous circulation improve diagnosis of acute coronary occlusion (sensitivity 88%, specificity 100%), with 33% of those studied having culprit LCx occlusion and STE beyond the territory of the 12‐lead ECG. 31

Early BSPM has the potential to identify STE and AMI in those with culprit LCx stenosis and nondiagnostic 12‐lead ECG at presentation. These patients would likely benefit from emergent revascularization to improve prognosis and reduce adverse clinical outcomes (ie, late heart failure, malignant arrhythmias, and mortality). Future randomized studies are required to assess whether early BSPM as part of a clinical decision pathway improves prognosis in all patients presenting with acute ischemic‐type chest pain.

Limitations

This study is a nonrandomized retrospective analysis and as such it is possible that both identified and unidentified confounders may have influenced the results. Consecutive patients admitted to the coronary care unit with nondiagnostic initial 12‐lead ECG at presentation and LCx culprit stenosis on angiography were studied. This represents a highly selected, potentially high‐risk patient group and is not representative of all patients presenting to the emergency department with ischemic‐type chest discomfort. In addition, patients had to survive to angiography and the distribution of patent and occluded arteries among patients who died before angiography is not known. Furthermore, 12‐lead ECG, BSPM, and angiography were not performed simultaneously; therefore, a patent artery at the time of 12‐lead ECG may have occluded in the time from ECG/BSPM to angiography and vice versa. Diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction required cTnT ≥ 0.1 μg/L 12 hours post symptom onset and did not require temporal change in cTnT.

### Electrocardiographic R wave peak time: correlation with the severity of coronary artery disease and prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome [^113xwqFT]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

4 Discussion

The present study was designed to investigate the relationship between electrocardiographic RWPT and both the severity of CAD and prognosis in patients with ACS. Our findings demonstrated a significant positive correlation between RWPT and the Gensini score. Furthermore, we observed that RWPT was significantly prolonged in patients with moderate‐to‐severe CAD patients compared to those with mild disease. Importantly, multivariate logistic regression analysis identified RWPT as an independent risk factor of in‐hospital MACE.

The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the association between prolonged RWPT and CAD severity can be explained by ischemia‐induced alterations in ventricular conduction. In ACS, myocardial ischemia causes conduction disturbances within the Purkinje fibers and ventricular myocytes, leading to delayed electrical impulse propagation from the endocardium to the epicardium. This delay manifests as prolonged RWPT on surface electrocardiograms. The severity of these conduction abnormalities likely reflects the extent of myocardial ischemia, which in turn correlates with the anatomical complexity and functional significance of coronary lesions. Additionally, prolonged RWPT may be associated with microvascular dysfunction in ACS, as impaired coronary microcirculation can exacerbate myocardial ischemia and further disrupt intraventricular conduction. When compared with other electrocardiographic parameters, RWPT appears to be more sensitive to early ischemic changes. While QRS duration represents the total ventricular depolarization time, RWPT specifically reflects the initial phase of ventricular activation, which may be more vulnerable to ischemic insult. Similarly, PWPT primarily reflects atrial conduction, which may be less directly affected by acute myocardial ischemia than ventricular conduction parameters.

### Another step toward early ischemia Detection? [^111pydfz]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Consecutive patients undergoing PCI were fitted with a control 12-lead ECG system, as well as an additional 4 electrodes across the chest. Additional leads A and B were placed on the right and left shoulders respectively, with C and D matching below at chest level. This lead placement corresponds to the lead configuration that could eventually be implemented in a portable device with integrated electrodes, where right- and left-hand fingers produce a vector consistent with lead I (right-to-left 'a' lead), lead aVF (vertical 'b' lead), and a sagittal 'c' lead, creating the so-termed 'abc' lead ECG.

Patients then underwent 90-second balloon occlusion of the artery planned for PCI. Ten-second recordings of an 'abc' lead and standard 12-lead were taken at baseline, pre-inflation while the patient was on the table, and after 90-seconds of artery occlusion. The 90-second balloon occlusion could be stopped prematurely at 60 seconds in the presence of severe chest pain, hemodynamic instability, or ventricular arrhythmias. If more than 1 artery was targeted for PCI, then a second balloon occlusion of the other artery was performed with pre and post ECG recordings. Analyses of the ECGs were then performed using a vectrocardiographic approach for the 'abc' lead analysis, automated maximal single-lead ST-segment deviation for the standard 12-lead ECG, and standard 12-lead ECG interpretation by a cardiologist. Standard ischemic criteria were used based on the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction definition.

Electrocardiographic interpretation — criteria and lead selection for suspected acute coronary syndromes: For ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), diagnostic thresholds include "ST-elevation of ≥ 1 mm in ≥ 2 anatomically contiguous leads (measured at the J-point) in all leads other than V2-V3 and ≥ 2 mm in men ≥ 40 y, ≥ 2.5 mm in men < 40 y, and ≥ 1.5 mm in women regardless of age in leads V2-V3". Posterior infarction assessment is supported as "Posterior leads (V7-V9) should be obtained in patients with suspected left circumflex occlusion particularly in the setting of isolated ST-segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1-V3". For non–ST-elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS), ischemic findings include "horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in ≥ 2 contiguous leads and/or T-wave inversion > 1 mm in ≥ 2 contiguous leads", and the table clarifies that "Many patients with NSTE-ACS have either nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes or a normal ECG.

### Influence of the extent of coronary atherosclerotic disease on ST-segment changes induced by ST elevation myocardial infarction [^111nxqE7]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The accuracy of the admission electrocardiogram (ECG) in predicting the site of acute coronary artery occlusion in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and multivessel disease is not well known. This study aimed to assess whether the presence of multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) modifies the artery-related ST-segment changes in patients with acute coronary artery occlusion. We reviewed the admission ECG, clinical records, and coronary angiography of 289 patients with STEMI caused by acute occlusion of left anterior descending (LAD; n = 140), right (n = 118), or left circumflex (LCx; n = 31) coronary arteries. All patients underwent primary percutaneous coronary reperfusion during the first 12 hours. The magnitude and distribution of artery-related ST-segment patterns were comparable in patients with single (n = 149) and multivessel (n = 140) CAD. Occlusion of proximal (n = 55) or mid-distal (n = 85) LAD artery induced ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V5, but only the proximal occlusion induced reciprocal ST-segment depression in leads II, III, and aVF (p < 0.001). Proximal and mid-distal occlusion of right (n = 45 and 73, respectively) or LCx (n = 15 and 16) coronary artery always induced ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF and reciprocal ST-segment depression in leads V2 and V3. ST-segment elevation in lead V6 > 0.1 mV predicted LCx artery occlusion. In conclusion, patients with STEMI with single or multivessel CAD have concordant artery-related ST-segment patterns on the admission ECG; in both groups, reciprocal ST-segment depression in LAD artery occlusion predicts a large infarct. Subendocardial ischemia at a distance is not a requisite for the genesis of reciprocal ST-segment changes.

### Prader-Willi syndrome: a nest for premature coronary artery disease? [^116KMGfq]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Individuals affected by Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) may show increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD), which probably relates, at least, with high burden of cardiovascular risk factors. A 27-year-old man with PWS, obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia attended the emergency department with complaints of flu-like condition and chest pain. The ECG revealed a mild ST-segment elevation in inferior leads, followed by positive myocardial necrosis biomarkers. Attending to the high cardiovascular risk profile, ST-segment elevation in inferior territory and wall motion abnormalities, a coronary angiogram was performed. The latter showed a three-vessel CAD, 60% stenosis in midanterior descending artery, total occlusion (100%) of the obtuse marginal artery and 99% stenosis with high thrombi burden in the proximal right coronary artery. The present case report emphasises the plausibility of premature CAD in patients with PWS, a possible underdiagnosed feature of this condition.

### Prevalence and outcome of patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction with occluded "culprit" artery-a systemic review and meta-analysis [^113syTPe]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) has been categorized into ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST segment elevation ACS (NSTEACS) based on the results of initial 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG). In patients with STEMI, early reperfusion therapy of the culprit artery is a class I indication in current guidelines. In contrast, NSTEACS represent a wide spectrum of clinical syndromes, ranging from unstable angina (without cardiomyocyte loss) to NSTEMI (with cardiomyocyte necrosis). The management of NSTEACS is guided by risk stratification, with an early invasive strategy favoured in high-risk patients, especially for patients with positive cardiac necrosis biomarkers.

STEMI results from acute total or nearly total occlusion of a coronary artery. However, totally occluded culprit artery (OCA) has also been observed among patients with NSTEACS. According to recent large retrospective studies, up to 30% of patients with NSTEACS had OCA. One of the reasons for OCA to present as NSTEACS, instead of STEMI, is that ECG is not sensitive enough to detect acute ischaemia or infarction over posterior or lateral walls, when the left circumflex artery (LCx) is usually the culprit artery. Indeed, the inferolateral territory was more frequently involved among patients with NSTEACS with OCA, compared with those with a non-occlusive culprit artery.

The clinical implication of OCA in NSTE-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is still controversial, and how patients with NSTEACS with OCA should be treated is also unknown. Some studies report worse outcome for patients with OCA, while other studies report otherwise. As unstable angina without positive cardiac markers was also included in some of these studies, the observations on outcomes were inevitably variable. Given the high incidence of NSTEACS worldwide, and the potential impact of OCA on outcome, it is necessary to analyse in detail the currently available data. To decrease ambiguity, we limited our analysis to patients with positive cardiac necrosis biomarkers, i.e. NSTEMI. The goals of this meta-analysis were (1) to determine the proportion of patients with OCA in NSTEMI and (2) to determine the impact of OCA on the clinical severity and outcomes including death and recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) following NSTEMI.

### AI-enhanced reconstruction of the 12-lead electrocardiogram via 3-leads with accurate clinical assessment [^114ujbxw]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite these solutions to identify heart diseases in an automatic manner –, the reconstruction of a 12-lead ECG represents a fundamental step towards detection of acute coronary syndrome, specifically STEMI, that can be effectively verified by a cardiologist. Previous research that exploited AI for this goal was based on limited-size datasets (a few hundred records), not suitable for the training of complex learning models. In other studies, data from the same patient was used both in training and testing, affecting generalizability.

Our results suggest that it is possible to reconstruct a 12-lead ECG from the measurement of a limited set of 1 precordial and 2 limb leads, and that the synthetized signal can be used by a cardiologist for the detection of STEMI. While most of previous investigations assumed that septal lead V2 is the most important precordial lead, we have shown that measuring anterior lead V3 provides the best accuracy for the reconstruction. This finding may be attributed to the central position of V3, resulting in stronger correlations not only with anterior lead V4 but also with septal and lateral leads. Our study highlighted how the reconstructed 12-lead ECG is not only useful for an automatic algorithm in the identification of acute MI, but it can also be interpreted by cardiologists and used to identify STEMI. Considering that the required input can be obtained using commercial sensors without the need for a complete 12-lead ECG, this solution becomes particularly valuable in scenarios where acquiring a full 12-lead ECG is impractical. This is especially relevant in settings such as care facilities with limited resources or remote locations lacking clinical infrastructures.

### ECG patterns of occlusion myocardial infarction: a narrative review [^117QcL38]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The traditional management of acute coronary syndrome has relied on the identification of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as a proxy of acute coronary occlusion. This conflation of STEMI with acute coronary occlusion has historically overshadowed non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), despite evidence suggesting 25% to 34% of NSTEMI cases may also include acute coronary occlusion. Current limitations in the STEMI/NSTEMI binary framework underscore the need for a revised approach to chest pain and acute coronary syndrome management. The emerging paradigm distinguishing occlusion myocardial infarction from nonocclusion myocardial infarction (NOMI) seeks to enhance diagnostic accuracy and prognostic effect in acute coronary syndrome care. This approach not only emphasizes the urgency of reperfusion therapy for high-risk ECG patterns not covered by current STEMI criteria, but also emphasizes the broader transition from viewing acute coronary syndrome as a disease defined by the ECG to a disease defined by its underlying pathology, for which the ECG is an important but insufficient surrogate test. This report outlines the emerging occlusion myocardial infarction paradigm, detailing specific ECG patterns linked to acute coronary occlusion, and proposes a new framework that could enhance triage accuracy and treatment strategies for acute coronary syndrome. Although further validation is required, the occlusion myocardial infarction pathway holds promise for earlier acute coronary occlusion detection, timely cath lab activation, and improved myocardial salvage-offering potentially significant implications for both clinical practice and future research in acute coronary syndrome management.

### Inferior subtle ST elevation. would you activate cardiac catheterization laboratory? [^111Pqah2]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

According to guidelines, patients with inferior myocardial infarction only qualify for emergent reperfusion if they have at least 1 mm of ST elevation in two contiguous inferior leads. Although this has remained the standard for years, acute coronary occlusion may occur in patients with nondiagnostic ST elevation. Accordingly, a paradigm change is instigated, shifting the focus to physiopathology (occlusion myocardial infarction) rather than ST criteria.

Case Report

A middle-aged man presented to our emergency department with chest pain and subtle nondiagnostic electrocardiography (ECG) changes in inferior leads. A careful examination of aVL to detect ST depression in this lead was the key to successfully diagnosing occlusion myocardial infarction, allowing early revascularization of an occluded right coronary artery. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Accurate diagnosis of coronary occlusion by means of ECG can be challenging in certain situations, as acute myocardial ischemia may occur in patients with nondiagnostic ST elevation, especially in the inferior leads. A thorough examination of aVL searching for ST depression is essential in these situations.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^112KqJhU]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction — application of supplemental electrocardiogram leads states that supplemental leads and serial ECG recordings should be deployed with a very low threshold in patients with ischemic chest pain and a nondiagnostic initial ECG. Isolated ST-segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1–V3 may indicate left circumflex occlusion, and posterior leads V7, V8, and V9 at specified positions are recommended to capture it; recording of these leads is strongly recommended when suspicion is high. For posterior leads, a cut-off point of 0.5 mm ST elevation is recommended in leads V7–V9, with specificity increased at a cut-off point ≥ 1 mm and this ≥ 1 mm cut-off should be used in men < 40 years old. For suspected right ventricular infarction, V4R and V3R may show ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm, and early recording of V3R and V4R should be performed since ST-elevation ≥ 0.5 mm (≥ 1 mm in men < 30 years old) provides supportive diagnostic criteria.

Asymptomatic spontaneous coronary artery spasm is rare and there are no case reports in literature presenting with acute ST elevation on routine ECG. We present the case of a 68-year-old Caucasian man who presented to a primary care physician for a routine ECG as part of hypertension follow-up. ECG revealed ST elevation in inferior leads II, III and aVF with reciprocal ST depression in leads I, aVL and also ST depression in anterior leads V1, V2 and V3 suggesting ongoing inferoposterior ST elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was completely well, stable and asymptomatic and he was rushed immediately to the coronary care unit via emergency ambulance. The patient was subjected to a battery of urgent investigations which were all normal. Also an urgent coronary angiogram was undertaken which showed completely normal coronary anatomy.

### Noninvasive cardiac testing [^1162XoN8]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, more specifically with respect to noninvasive stress imaging, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining tiered testing starting with exercise stress testing with ECG followed by stress testing with echocardiography as a cost-effective approach in selected low-risk patients with stable chest discomfort.

### Do the right precordial leads during exercise testing contribute to detection of coronary artery disease? [^117J6nkX]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

It is still unknown whether or not the additional right precordial leads (RPL) during exercise testing contribute to detection of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Hypothesis

The aim of this study was to evaluate the RPL during exercise testing for the detection of CAD.

Methods

The study included 157 consecutive patients (116 men and 41 women, mean age 66 years) suspected of having CAD, who underwent conclusive treadmill exercise testing (heart rate reached at least 85% of the predicted maximum or positive electrocardiogram [ECG] changes were exhibited) and coronary angiography. During exercise testing, the ECG was recorded with the standard 12 leads and 4 RPL (V3R, V4R, V5R, V6R).

Results

Of the 157 patients, 67 had CAD (> 75% stenosis in at least one major coronary artery), and 64 had positive ST changes in the standard ECG leads during exercise testing. Using the conventional 12-lead method, sensitivity and specificity were 76 and 86%, respectively. Only three patients exhibited positive changes in the RPL leads; all had > 0.1 mV ST elevation in one of the RPL leads with > 0.1 mV ST elevation in aVR. Two of these patients had significant right coronary artery lesions and the other had a lesion of the left anterior descending artery which perfused the inferior as well as the anteroseptal area. In the standard 12 leads, one of the patients with an abnormal RPL and a right coronary lesion was negative, while the other two patients were positive. Combining RPL with the conventional 12-lead method, sensitivity and specificity were 78 and 86%, respectively. Therefore, RPL did not improve the accuracy of the exercise ECG.

Conclusion

The use of RPL during exercise testing may contribute to the detection of ischemia perfused by the right coronary artery; however, it does not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the exercise test.

### Non-invasive imaging in coronary syndromes: recommendations of the European association of cardiovascular imaging and the American Society of Echocardiography, in collaboration with the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology, Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^111cpxxy]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2022). High credibility.

Echocardiography for coronary artery disease and stress testing — regional wall motion abnormality (WMA) assessment and contrast use are specified as follows: Segments with WMA due to coronary artery disease should be contiguous and correspond with coronary territories, and regional WMA must be detected visually in at least two echocardiographic views. The use of approved ultrasound enhancing agents is recommended when two or more contiguous segments cannot be adequately visualized at rest or are likely to not be adequately visualized during stress, but the use of ultrasound enhancing agents for assessment of myocardial perfusion has not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Before stress echocardiography, acute coronary syndromes within 2 days for non‑ST‑segment elevation myocardial infarction and other listed contraindications must be excluded, and patients who are able to exercise should undergo exercise stress testing. Risk and prognosis from stress echocardiography are based on global ischemic burden including the percentage of myocardium with an abnormal response ≥ 20% and the wall motion score index > 1.41. Direct Doppler evaluation of epicardial coronary flow may be possible, but only large primary vessels can be reliably imaged and difficulty in imaging all three major coronary arteries limits wide clinical use, while more novel echocardiographic techniques for stress testing require further validation.

Acute coronary syndromes — types and classification differentiate non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) from ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) by angiographic and electrocardiographic findings; NSTEMI features "Partially occlusive thrombus" and may show "ST-segment depression", with "Nonspecific or no electrocardiographic changes may instead be seen", whereas STEMI features "Completely occlusive thrombus" with "ST-elevation in ≥ 2 contiguous leads on standard 12-lead ECG (or ST-elevation on posterior lead ECG)".

### Incidence, distribution, and prognostic impact of occluded culprit arteries among patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes undergoing diagnostic angiography [^115uUd5Z]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Because acute occlusion of coronary arteries supplying the inferolateral myocardium frequently eludes standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, these patients may present as non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS).

Methods

We examined culprit artery occlusion among 1,957 NSTE-ACS patients in the Platelet IIb/IIIa Antagonism for the Reduction of Acute Coronary Syndrome Events in a Global Organization Network trial who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography. We compared baseline characteristics, electrocardiographic findings, in-hospital treatment, and long-term outcomes between patients with and without occluded culprit arteries.

Results

The culprit artery was occluded in 528 (27%) patients. Culprit lesions were more frequently identified in the inferolateral territory among patients with an occluded culprit artery (63%) compared with those with a nonoccluded artery (45%, P < .0001). Patients with an occluded culprit artery were younger, more often male, and more likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction. Despite similar in-hospital treatment, patients with an occluded culprit artery had larger infarcts (median peak creatine kinase-MB 4.3 vs 2.1 x upper limit of normal, P < .0001) and higher risk-adjusted 6-month mortality (hazard ratio 1.72, 95% CI 1.07–2.79).

Conclusions

More than 25% of NSTE-ACS patients had an occluded culprit artery on angiography. These patients may represent ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction equivalents; thus, improved early risk stratification techniques would help more rapidly triage these high-risk patients to an early invasive management strategy.

### Validation of collateral fractional flow reserve by myocardial perfusion imaging [^114MKGRV]. Circulation (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Collateral fractional flow reserve (FFR(coll)) is an index to quantify collateral blood flow, derived from coronary pressure measurements. Although well defined theoretically, its direct validation by myocardial perfusion imaging has not been established so far. Validating this index by myocardial perfusion imaging is the main aim of this study.

Methods and Results

Twenty-four consecutive patients with stable angina and single left anterior descending artery stenosis underwent simultaneous measurement of aortic pressure (P(a)), coronary wedge pressure (P(w)), and central venous pressure (P(v)) during balloon inflation. FFR(coll) was calculated and compared with the extent and severity of the defect during coronary occlusion using (99m)Tc-sestamibi imaging at balloon inflation of the respective coronary artery. Although the pressure-derived collateral indexes (P(w), P(w)/P(a), and FFR(coll)) ranged widely, they were closely correlated with extent and severity scores of the nuclear occlusion images and superior to the ECG for that purpose. Of all parameters, FFR(coll) correlated best with the severity score at imaging (r = -0.88), followed by the P(w)/P(a) ratio (r = -0.74) or P(w) alone (r = -0.69).

Conclusions

FFR(coll), calculated from coronary pressure during balloon occlusion, is highly correlated with the extent and severity of the defect at myocardial perfusion of the territory of the occluded artery and can be used for quantitative assessment of collateral blood flow in conscious humans.

### Chest pain evaluation: updated guidelines from the AHA / ACC… [^1158u1Hw]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Attempt to perform 12-lead ECG in patients with chest pain within 10 minutes of arrival to a clinic or emergency setting.
- Use a clinical decision pathway to identify patients with low-risk chest pain who can be discharged from the emergency department.
- If available, use CCTA preferentially over stress testing for patients with intermediate-risk chest pain to determine the need for invasive coronary angiography. For patients with high-risk chest pain, provide referral for invasive coronary angiography. Diagnostic Evaluation Initial evaluation should involve 12-lead electrocardiography, which is recommended within 10 minutes of arrival in clinic and emergency settings. Because up to 6% of patients with cardiac ischemia are discharged from the emergency department after a single normal ECG, repeat testing should be considered in patients with normal ECG but a higher index of suspicion.

Adding leads V7 to V9 should be considered on repeat testing to assess for posterior wall ischemia. ST elevation, hyperacute T waves, left bundle branch block, and ST depression are the most concerning findings for cardiac chest pain. Anatomic testing with CCTA and invasive coronary angiography demonstrates the extent of obstructive disease. Adding a calculation of fractional flow reserve with computed tomography to CCTA provides an estimation of lesion-specific ischemia. Invasive coronary angiography identifies obstructive stenosis and allows revascularization. CCTA has an effective dose of 3 to 5 mSv, compared with 4 to 10 mSv for angiography. CCTA without stenosis or plaque has a warranty period of two years for similar symptom frequency and negative troponin testing. Exercise ECG testing is equally predictive of future events as stress imaging, despite lower sensitivity for obstruction.

Failure to exceed five metabolic equivalents or to achieve 85% of predicted heart rate suggests a poor prognosis, whereas exceeding 10 metabolic equivalents confers a low risk of cardiac events. Positive exercise ECG results can be further clarified by CCTA or functional fractional reserve testing. Intermediate-risk patients with known CAD and acute chest pain should have blood pressure and cholesterol management maximized before additional testing. CCTA can document CAD progression in patients with previous testing demonstrating nonobstructive lesions. Patients with a history of high-risk CAD or worsening frequency of symptoms who have optimized blood pressure and cholesterol management should be evaluated with invasive coronary angiography. High-risk patients with acute chest pain should receive invasive coronary angiography.

### Lead aVR should not Be neglected… [^111STs7p]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor We read with great interest the case report by Dr Vallelonga and colleauges1 regarding an extremely subtle alteration on the electrocardiogram tracing of a patient who had experienced occlusive myocardial infarction. The case was excellently presented; however, we would like to emphasize the critical role of lead aVR. Subtle ST-segment elevation in leads V1 through V3 and slight ST-segment depression in inferolateral leads were demonstrated in these ECG findings on admission. However, STE in lead aVR was not properly described. A sign of proximal left anterior descending, left main coronary artery stenosis, or severe triple-vessel disease, STE-aVR is used to assess the need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery. It has a high specificity for the left main disease 2 and is closely associated with in-hospital death rates, recurrent ischemic events, and heart failure, and its absence can nearly exclude a substantial LMCA lesion. The presence of STE in lead aVR that is more prominent than in lead V1 may distinguish LMCA obstruction from LAD and right coronary artery occlusion. 3 However, the subtle magnitude of STE in both leads aVR and V1 makes the differential diagnosis of LMCA and proximal LAD difficult.
