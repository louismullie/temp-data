## Question

Can you summarize the ACTION-CVT study?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a summary of the ACTION-CVT study, including its design, anticoagulation outcomes, recurrence predictors, diagnostic-delay substudies, and how it fits within the broader CVT evidence base. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core ACTION-CVT cohort and analytic methods. Then, I should verify the comparative effectiveness and safety of DOACs versus warfarin. Next, I will examine predictors of recurrent venous thrombosis. After that, I should review the delayed-diagnosis substudies and their implications. Finally, I will contextualize these findings within contemporary guidelines and related trials to synthesize practical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the study framework and population. ACTION-CVT is a multicenter, international, retrospective cohort of consecutive CVT patients treated with oral anticoagulation across 27 centers in the United States, Europe, and New Zealand from 2015 to 2020, with 1,025 patients screened and 845 meeting inclusion criteria; the mean age was 44.8 years and 64.7% were women, with a median follow-up of 345 days and 83.6% having at least 3 months of follow-up, which establishes a large real-world dataset for comparative analyses [^116q1YRC] [^112i3jE5].

> I need to check the exposure groups and analytic approach. Patients were categorized as DOAC-only, warfarin-only, or both sequentially; adjusted inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) Cox models were used to compare recurrent venous thrombosis, death, and major hemorrhage, and IPTW logistic regression was used for recanalization outcomes, which helps mitigate confounding by indication in this nonrandomized comparison [^116q1YRC].

> Now, let me verify the primary comparative outcomes. Recurrent venous thrombosis occurred at 5.68 per 100 patient-years overall, with no significant difference between DOACs and warfarin (adjusted hazard ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.51–1.73), and mortality was likewise similar (aHR 0.78, 95% CI 0.22–2.76), supporting noninferiority of DOACs for recurrence and death in routine practice [^116q1YRC].

> Hold on, I should verify the safety signal carefully. Major hemorrhage occurred at 3.77 per 100 patient-years overall, and DOACs were associated with a significantly lower risk of major hemorrhage compared with warfarin (aHR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15–0.82), which is a clinically important safety advantage that warrants attention in shared decision-making and risk stratification [^116q1YRC].

> Next, I should review recanalization data to ensure completeness. Among 525 patients with adequate follow-up imaging, complete recanalization was observed in 36.6%, partial in 48.2%, and no recanalization in 15.2%, with no significant difference in partial or complete recanalization between DOACs and warfarin (adjusted odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.48–1.73), suggesting comparable radiographic outcomes across anticoagulant strategies [^116q1YRC].

> Let me consider predictors of recurrent venous thrombosis, and I should double-check the multivariable model. In a secondary analysis of 947 patients, independent predictors of recurrence included Black race (aHR 2.13), prior VTE history (aHR 3.40), and positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aHR 3.85), with sensitivity analyses restricted to events occurring on oral anticoagulation yielding similar findings, which strengthens the inference that these are robust risk markers for recurrence after CVT [^112i3jE5].

> I will now examine the delayed-diagnosis substudies, and I need to ensure the definitions are consistent. Delayed diagnosis was defined as diagnosis in the fourth quartile of time from symptom onset, corresponding to more than 10 days in this cohort; 22.7% of patients experienced this delay, and independent predictors included isolated headache presentation, older age, and papilledema, whereas higher NIHSS was inversely associated with delay, which aligns with the clinical intuition that subtle or nonspecific presentations prolong time to diagnosis [^111GAAFZ] [^111QUwP8].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical consequences of diagnostic delay, because I initially thought delay might worsen outcomes. Surprisingly, delayed diagnosis was not associated with worse 90-day functional outcomes (mRS ≤ 1) after adjustment, suggesting that while delay is common and concerning, it did not translate into measurable short-term disability differences in this cohort, though this does not negate the potential for harm or the need for systems improvements [^111GAAFZ] [^111QUwP8].

> Next, I should review how ACTION-CVT fits within the broader evidence base, and I need to ensure I cite the pivotal trials correctly. The RE-SPECT CVT randomized trial found no recurrent VTE with either dabigatran or warfarin over 24 weeks and similar major bleeding, supporting the safety and efficacy of DOACs in CVT, albeit in a small exploratory study, while the prospective DOAC-CVT cohort recently reported no difference in a composite of recurrent VTE and major bleeding between DOACs and VKAs at 6 months, reinforcing the equivalence signal for clinical outcomes [^115bED3S] [^111QYPPn] [^116tGpTN].

> But wait, what about endovascular therapy, since some might conflate ACTION-CVT with interventional data. I should confirm that ACTION-CVT is an anticoagulation study and that EVT evidence remains negative; the TO-ACT randomized trial showed no benefit of EVT over standard care, and a propensity-matched analysis aligned with this, so EVT should not be extrapolated from ACTION-CVT's anticoagulation findings [^111sbtkV] [^111L4ozk].

> Let me synthesize the clinical implications and make sure they align with guidelines. DOACs appear to be a reasonable alternative to warfarin for CVT with similar recurrence and mortality but fewer major hemorrhages, which is particularly relevant for patients at higher bleeding risk or those preferring to avoid INR monitoring; however, patients with antiphospholipid antibody positivity or prior VTE may warrant individualized risk assessment and consideration of extended or indefinite anticoagulation, consistent with ASH guidance that indefinite anticoagulation is reasonable in selected high-risk phenotypes, while routine thrombophilia testing solely to guide duration is not recommended in all settings [^116q1YRC] [^117JorE1] [^114C1Ugz].

> Finally, I should confirm the study's limitations and the need for prospective data. ACTION-CVT's retrospective design and IPTW adjustment reduce but do not eliminate confounding, and the authors appropriately call for larger prospective or randomized studies to confirm these findings; nonetheless, the convergence with RE-SPECT CVT and DOAC-CVT, along with guideline evolution, supports the growing acceptance of DOACs as a standard option for CVT management in routine care [^116q1YRC] [^115bED3S] [^116tGpTN].

The ACTION-CVT study is a multicenter, international, retrospective cohort that included 1,025 patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) treated with oral anticoagulation from 2015–2020 [^116q1YRC]. It found that **DOACs had similar rates of recurrent venous thrombosis and death versus warfarin**, but a **lower risk of major hemorrhage** (aHR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15–0.82) [^116q1YRC]. Recanalization rates were comparable between groups. Secondary analyses identified **Black race, prior VTE, and antiphospholipid antibodies** as independent predictors of recurrence [^112i3jE5], and found that delayed diagnosis (> 10 days) occurred in 23% of patients but was not associated with worse 90-day outcomes [^111GAAFZ]. These data support DOACs as a safe, effective alternative to warfarin for CVT, with a favorable bleeding profile [^116q1YRC].

## Study design and patient population

- **Design**: Multicenter, international, retrospective cohort study.
- **Population**: 1,025 CVT patients treated with oral anticoagulation (DOACs or warfarin) from January 2015 to December 2020 [^116q1YRC].
- **Demographics**: Mean age 44.8 years, 64.7% female, median follow-up 345 days (IQR 140–720) [^116q1YRC].

---

## Primary outcomes

- **Recurrent venous thrombosis**: No significant difference between DOACs and warfarin (aHR 0.94, 95% CI 0.51–1.73; P = 0.84) [^116q1YRC].
- **Death**: No significant difference in mortality (aHR 0.78, 95% CI 0.22–2.76; P = 0.70) [^116q1YRC].
- **Major hemorrhage**: Significantly lower with DOACs vs warfarin (aHR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15–0.82; P = 0.02) [^116q1YRC].

---

## Secondary outcomes

Recanalization rates were similar between DOACs and warfarin (aOR 0.92, 95% CI 0.48–1.73; P = 0.79) [^116q1YRC]. Functional outcomes were not explicitly reported in the primary publication but are generally favorable in CVT cohorts [^113V8Rsd].

---

## Subgroup analyses and secondary publications

- **Predictors of recurrence**: Black race (aHR 2.13), prior VTE (aHR 3.40), and antiphospholipid antibodies (aHR 3.85) independently predicted recurrence [^112i3jE5].
- **Delayed diagnosis**: Occurred in 23% of patients; associated with isolated headache, older age, and papilledema, but not with worse 90-day outcomes [^111GAAFZ].
- **Recanalization and outcomes**: Failure to achieve at least partial recanalization independently predicted poor functional outcomes [^113V8Rsd].

---

## Clinical implications

DOACs are a **reasonable alternative to warfarin** for CVT, with similar efficacy and fewer major hemorrhages [^116q1YRC] [^116tGpTN]. Risk stratification should consider Black race, prior VTE, and antiphospholipid antibodies when planning anticoagulation duration and intensity [^112i3jE5]. Diagnostic delays are common but were not linked to worse short-term outcomes in this cohort [^111GAAFZ].

---

## Limitations

The study's **retrospective design** limits causality and is susceptible to confounding and selection bias. Variability in imaging protocols and timing may have affected recanalization assessments, and follow-up was relatively short for detecting late recurrences or chronic outcomes.

---

ACTION-CVT demonstrates that DOACs have comparable efficacy to warfarin for CVT with a **lower major bleeding risk**, supporting their use as an alternative anticoagulation strategy [^116q1YRC].

### Predictors of recurrent venous thrombosis after cerebral venous thrombosis: analysis of the ACTION-CVT study [^112i3jE5]. Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cause of stroke carrying a nearly 4% risk of recurrence after 1 year. There are limited data on predictors of recurrent venous thrombosis in patients with CVT. In this study, we aim to identify those predictors.

Methods

This is a secondary analysis of the ACTION-CVT study which is a multicenter international study of consecutive patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of CVT over a 6-year period. Patients with cancer-associated CVT, CVT during pregnancy, or CVT in the setting of known antiphospholipid antibody syndrome were excluded per the ACTION-CVT protocol. The study outcome was recurrent venous thrombosis defined as recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) or de novo CVT. We compared characteristics between patients with vs without recurrent venous thrombosis during follow-up and performed adjusted Cox regression analyses to determine important predictors of recurrent venous thrombosis.

Results

Nine hundred forty-seven patients were included with a mean age of 45.2 years, 63.9% were women, and 83.6% had at least 3 months of follow-up. During a median follow-up of 308 (interquartile range 120–700) days, there were 5.05 recurrent venous thromboses (37 VTE and 24 de novo CVT) per 100 patient-years. Predictors of recurrent venous thrombosis were Black race (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.13, 95% CI 1.14–3.98, p = 0.018), history of VTE (aHR 3.40, 95% CI 1.80–6.42, p < 0.001), and the presence of one or more positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aHR 3.85, 95% CI 1.97–7.50, p < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses including events only occurring on oral anticoagulation yielded similar findings.

Discussion

Black race, history of VTE, and the presence of one or more antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with recurrent venous thrombosis among patients with CVT. Future studies are needed to validate our findings to better understand mechanisms and treatment strategies in patients with CVT.

### Report from the 2nd cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) summit of the diabetes and cardiovascular disease (D&CVD) EASD study group [^113E326v]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

Other questions debated during the 2nd CVOT Summit on Diabetes were the following:
What are the key learnings from CVOTs in 2016? One of the main points of discussion. In general it was agreed that the latest CVOTs have shown that glucose lowering drugs can decrease CV morbidity and mortality. However, the exact mechanisms involved are still unknown. To which extent is it due to glucose-lowering mechanisms or by means of non-glycemic effects like weight loss or blood pressure control, remains under question. The positive cardiovascular effects observed in this year's published trials on GLP-1 RA, LEADER and SUSTAIN-6, demonstrated clear within-class differences, especially when compared to results observed in trials like ELIXA. This variability of results observed for drugs from the same class (GLP-1 RA) raises questions as to whether it is reasonable to expect a class effect for anti-hyperglycemic drugs. Moreover, the dissimilarities between trials with respect to single cardiovascular endpoints raises the point of mechanistic differences between GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2 inhibitors. While effects driven by GLP-1 RA would be mainly mediated by endothelial changes leading to improved myocardial perfusion, SGLT-2 inhibitors would exert their action by mediating hemodynamic changes. For all the above, it is necessary therefore to deepen the knowledge on the mechanism of action of these drugs, and to that effect initiate new trials aiming on that direction.
Can CVOTs lead to changes in treatment algorithms? The general answer to this question was affirmative under a certain set of conditions, namely that results are consistent among trials with the same drug and therefore there is an independent confirmation of results. Furthermore, trial design must be of such quality that allows results validation (pre-specified statistical analysis plan, P < 0.01 for primary endpoint and consistent results in major subgroups…). Finally, drugs examined by CVOTs must show a certain strength of demonstrated benefits and/or safety signals to be considered in the guideline recommendations by professional associations.
Can CVOT results be extrapolated to broader populations? In general, it seems reasonable to assume CV safety in broader populations given the high risk profile of the studied groups, even when this very same condition, the inclusion of high risk populations in CVOT design, might be a limiting factor for extrapolation. However, result extrapolation might be possible to some extent provided that specific eligibility criteria of target populations are satisfied and that subgroup analysis of CVOT subjects show consistency of results.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus warfarin in the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis (ACTION-CVT): a multicenter international study [^116q1YRC]. Stroke (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A small randomized controlled trial suggested that dabigatran may be as effective as warfarin in the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We aimed to compare direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) to warfarin in a real-world CVT cohort.

Methods

This multicenter international retrospective study (United States, Europe, New Zealand) included consecutive patients with CVT treated with oral anticoagulation from January 2015 to December 2020. We abstracted demographics and CVT risk factors, hypercoagulable labs, baseline imaging data, and clinical and radiological outcomes from medical records. We used adjusted inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox-regression models to compare recurrent cerebral or systemic venous thrombosis, death, and major hemorrhage in patients treated with warfarin versus DOACs. We performed adjusted inverse probability of treatment weighted logistic regression to compare recanalization rates on follow-up imaging across the 2 treatments groups.

Results

Among 1025 CVT patients across 27 centers, 845 patients met our inclusion criteria. Mean age was 44.8 years, 64.7% were women; 33.0% received DOAC only, 51.8% received warfarin only, and 15.1% received both treatments at different times. During a median follow-up of 345 (interquartile range, 140–720) days, there were 5.68 recurrent venous thrombosis, 3.77 major hemorrhages, and 1.84 deaths per 100 patient-years. Among 525 patients who met recanalization analysis inclusion criteria, 36.6% had complete, 48.2% had partial, and 15.2% had no recanalization. When compared with warfarin, DOAC treatment was associated with similar risk of recurrent venous thrombosis (aHR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.51–1.73]; P = 0.84), death (aHR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.22–2.76]; P = 0.70), and rate of partial/complete recanalization (aOR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.48–1.73]; P = 0.79), but a lower risk of major hemorrhage (aHR, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.15–0.82]; P = 0.02).

Conclusions

In patients with CVT, treatment with DOACs was associated with similar clinical and radiographic outcomes and favorable safety profile when compared with warfarin treatment. Our findings need confirmation by large prospective or randomized studies.

### Delayed diagnosis in cerebral venous thrombosis: associated factors and clinical outcomes [^111HXTbn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Design

This is a substudy of the ACTION‐CVT study, a multicenter retrospective international cohort study of consecutive patients with CVT hospitalized from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2020. All patients who had available data on their date of CVT symptom onset and their date of CVT diagnosis were included in the current study.

Deidentified data are available on reasonable request to the corresponding author.

Measurements

We defined time to diagnosis of CVT as the interval in days between the onset of CVT symptoms (day of first symptom thought to be related to CVT by the site investigator) and diagnosis of CVT (day of CVT diagnosis reported by the site investigator). We used temporal quartiles to evaluate for factors associated with delayed diagnosis among included study patients. We defined a delayed diagnosis of CVT as occurring when CVT diagnosis was made in the fourth (final) quartile of days from symptom onset among all study participants, in keeping with prior literature specific to CVT diagnosisas well as with the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine definition of diagnostic error as "the failure to establish an accurate and timely explanation of the patient's health problem", (p. 4) which has been widely accepted. In addition, we report the proportion of patients discharged from a hospital/ED encounter with any neurologic symptoms in the 3 months preceding their CVT hospitalization. Although these encounters 3 months before CVT hospitalization may have been unrelated to subsequent CVT detection, some may represent instances of severely delayed or missed CVT diagnosis.

### Effects of intensive glucose lowering in type 2 diabetes [^113irrWW]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Excellent credibility.

The study ACCORD was published by Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study Group and colleagues in 2008 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the ACCORD study, the trial question was: what is the role of intensive glycemic control therapy in high-risk patients with T2DM? In the ACCORD study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the ACCORD study, the population was: 10251 patients (3895 female, 6356 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM who had either established CVD or additional cardiovascular risk factors. The key exclusion criteria were frequent or recent serious hypoglycemic events, unwillingness to do home glucose monitoring or inject insulin, a body-mass index > 45, a serum creatinine level > 1.5 mg/dL (133 mcmol/L), or other serious illness. In the ACCORD study, the interventions were: n = 5128 intensive glycemic control (targeting an HbA1c < 6.0%) n = 5123 standard glycemic control (targeting an HbA1c 7.0–7.9%). In the ACCORD study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (6.9% vs. 7.2%; HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.04). In the ACCORD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in the rate of death at a mean follow-up of 3.5 years (5% vs. 4%; HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.46). In the ACCORD study, the safety outcomes were: significant differences in hypoglycemia requiring assistance (16.2% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001) and weight gain > 10 kg (27.8% vs. 14.1%, p < 0.001). In the ACCORD study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM who had either established CVD or additional cardiovascular risk factors, intensive glycemic control was not superior to standard glycemic control with respect to nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes.

### Delayed diagnosis in cerebral venous thrombosis: associated factors and clinical outcomes [^111GAAFZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 1025 patients included in the ACTION‐CVT study, a total of 935 were included in this substudy. Median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4 days (interquartile range, 1–10 days). The Figure shows the full distribution of time from symptom onset to diagnosis. A total of 84.5% of patients (n = 790) had head computed tomography obtained, and 84.7% had brain magnetic resonance imaging (n = 792) performed at the time of CVT diagnosis.

Figure
Time from symptom onset to diagnosis (n = 894).

A total of 41 patients who were diagnosed > 40 days from symptom onset are not shown.

Delayed CVT diagnosis occurred in 212 (22.7%) patients (median time to diagnosis, > 10 days). A total of 155 patients were discharged from a hospital/ED encounter in the 3 months before their index CVT hospitalization for neurologic symptoms, including 64 of the 212 patients (30.2%) with a delayed CVT diagnosis. Table 1 summarizes the associations between various patient factors and time‐to‐diagnosis temporal quartiles. We found that the presenting symptoms and signs of CVT associated with delayed diagnosis were low median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, isolated headache, nonfocal deficit, lack of seizure, lack of encephalopathy, presence of papilledema, and increased intracranial pressure (Table 1). In a stepwise regression analysis, presence of isolated headache (aOR, 2.36 [95% CI, 1.50–3.73]; P < 0.001), older age (aOR by 1 year, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.004–1.03]; P = 0.01), and papilledema (aOR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.03–3.89]; P = 0.04) were associated with diagnostic delay. Presenting with a higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was inversely associated with diagnostic delay (aOR by 1 point, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.89–1.00]; P = 0.049).

### A randomized trial of inhaled levodopa (CVT-301) for motor fluctuations in Parkinson's disease [^111GNNpx]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although levodopa is the most effective oral PD therapy, many patients experience motor fluctuations, including sudden loss of dose effect and delayed benefit. CVT-301 is a levodopa inhalation powder with the potential for rapid onset of action. The objective of this study was to evaluate CVT-301 self-administered by PD patients to relieve OFF episodes.

Methods

PD patients with ≥ 2 hours per day of OFF time despite oral levodopa ≥ 4 times per day were randomized to CVT-301 or placebo for 4 weeks, to be used up to 3 times per day for OFF episodes. After 2 weeks, the study-drug dose was escalated from 35 to 50 mg. The primary end point was mean change in UPDRS Part III score from a predose OFF state to the average of postdose scores obtained at 10, 20, 30, and 60 minutes, as assessed in-clinic at the end of week 4. Home diaries were recorded.

Results

Eighty-six patients used the study drug at an average frequency of 2.1 times per day for CVT-301 and for placebo. At 4 weeks, least-squares mean change in UPDRS Part III score favored CVT-301 by 7.0 points (P < 0.001). A treatment effect was evident at 10 minutes. At 4 weeks, least-squares mean OFF-time change from baseline favored CVT-301 by 0.9 hours per day (P = 0.045). The most frequently reported adverse events in the CVT-301 group were dizziness, cough, and nausea, each in 7% (3 of 43 patients).

Conclusions

CVT-301 self-administered during OFF episodes provided rapid improvement of motor function, and daily OFF time was significantly reduced at the higher dose. CVT-301 was generally safe and well-tolerated. © 2016 The Authors. Movement Disorders published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### SGLT2 inhibitors: cardiovascular benefits beyond HbA1c-translating evidence into practice [^112wdYPQ]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

However, there is a limit to the effectiveness of targeting glycaemic control alone, using traditional anti-diabetic medications for the management of CVD and HF. In addition, there are cautionary notes in the aggressive pursuit of lower HbA1c. No significant benefits were observed with intensive treatment of hyperglycaemia in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD; targeting an HbA1c below 6.0%) study, the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE; targeting an HbA1c below 6.5%) study or the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT; median HbA1c of 6.9%). Notably, the ACCORD study reported a significant 22% increase [hazard ratio (HR) 1.22; 95% CI 1.01–1.46; P = 0.04] in total deaths in the intensively treated group compared with placebo. Until the recent CVOT findings, metformin was the only diabetes therapy associated with a lower rate of all-cause mortality in people with T2DM and HF, compared with combinations with sulfonylurea or insulin therapy.

Given that T2DM is associated with independent risk factors for CVD, considerations beyond just elevated HbA1c need to be accounted for when developing management strategies. Appropriate, early intervention is needed to improve CV outcomes in people with T2DM, with treatment goals beyond achieving glycaemic control alone.

When treating T2DM in a person with comorbidities, especially one at risk of CVD, HCPs need to consider a personalised approach that achieves glucose lowering and reduces CV risk factors. Recent CV outcomes studies have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits in people receiving an SGLT2i therapy for the management of T2DM.

### Normal values and reproducibility of the real-time index of vagal tone in healthy humans: a multi-center study [^117SfsgT]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Over the recent past, CVT has been increasingly utilized, particularly in GI pain, nociceptive physiological and wider research in the field of psychosomatic medicine. The ANS has provided an attractive candidate for linking psychological traits with physical symptoms as it integrates with regions of the brain associated with pain, interoception and behavior. However, a considerable methodological draw back as Tillisch notes, has been " the inability to measure the ANS in action throughout the body". Arguably, within the literature, the most widely utilized proxy measures of autonomic tone in humans are surrogates derived from spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) yet they are not without methodological limitations. For instance, many of the validated measures of HRV are inaccurate in epochs of less than 1 min, which should therefore limit experimental design, although this is not always the case. Not surprisingly therefore, many studies using HRV, across a diverse array of academic disciplines, have reported disappointingly inconsistent results. CVT however transcends many of these difficulties, allowing researchers to interrogate and study smaller epochs of interest, which may, in future, further its applications in GI research. A recent example of this is a study by Paine et al, who demonstrated for the first time co-activation of the SNS and PNS in response to a painful visceral stimulus using CVT and CSB. The traditional and dogmatic understanding would have predicted a classical "fight or flight" response in response to an acutely painful stimulus, being characterized by SNS activation with concomitant PNS withdrawal. These data highlight the knowledge gaps that remain in our understanding of the response of the ANS to acutely stressful stimuli.

### Development and validation of a clinical score to predict epilepsy after cerebral venous thrombosis [^1165ebhj]. JAMA Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Importance

One of 10 patients develop epilepsy in the late phase after cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) diagnosis but predicting the individual risk is difficult.

Objective

To develop and externally validate a prognostic score to estimate the individual risk of post-CVT epilepsy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This observational cohort study included both retrospective and prospective patients enrolled from 1994 through 2022. For development of the DIAS3 score, data from the International CVT Consortium (n = 1128), a large international hospital-based multicenter CVT cohort, were used. For validation, data from 2 independent multicenter cohorts, the ACTION-CVT (n = 543) and the Israel CVT study (n = 556), were used. Of 2937 eligible, consecutively enrolled adult patients with radiologically verified CVT, 710 patients with a history of epilepsy prior to CVT, follow-up less than 8 days, and missing late seizure status were excluded.

Exposure

The prediction score (DIAS3) was developed based on available literature and clinical plausibility and consisted of 6 readily available clinical variables collected during the acute phase: decompressive hemicraniectomy, intracerebral hemorrhage at presentation, age, seizure(s) in the acute phase (excluding status epilepticus), status epilepticus in the acute phase, and subdural hematoma at presentation.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to a first late seizure, defined as occurring more than 7 days after diagnosis of CVT.

Results

Of 1128 patients included in the derivation cohort (median age, 41 [IQR, 30–53] years; 805 women [71%]), 128 (11%) developed post-CVT epilepsy during a median follow-up of 12 (IQR, 3–26) months. According to the DIAS3 score, the predicted 1-year and 3-year risk of epilepsy in individual patients ranged from 7% to 68% and 10% to 83%, respectively. Internal and external validation showed adequate discrimination in the derivation cohort (1 year and 3 years: C statistic, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.70–0.79) and the 2 independent validation cohorts, (ACTION-CVT) 1 year: C statistic, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67–0.84; 3 years: C statistic, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66–0.84; and Israel CVT study 1 year: C statistic, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75–0.86. Calibration plots indicated adequate agreement between predicted and observed risks.

Conclusions and Relevance

The DIAS3 score (freely available online) is a simple tool that can help predict the risk of post-CVT epilepsy in individual patients. The model can improve opportunities for personalized medicine and may aid in decision-making regarding antiseizure medication, patient counseling, and facilitation of research on epileptogenesis in CVT.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^115rKinR]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of effective asthma controller therapies, a significant proportion of patients have suboptimal asthma control, characterized by frequent symptoms, lifestyle restrictions, and healthcare use. In addition to controller medications, acute reliever or rescue medications, e.g. short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABAs) are used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. The frequency of SABA use as rescue medication reflects the frequency and intensity of symptoms, and is an important component for classifying asthma severity and level of disease control.

Short-acting anticholinergic agents have been used in asthma for decades; however, their exact role in asthma has not been well established. Studies directly comparing short-acting anticholinergic agents with a variety of SABAs have shown that SABAs provide greater bronchodilation than short-acting anticholinergic agents alone in stable asthma; however, individual studies have demonstrated that specific asthma populations, e.g. older patients, and those whose asthma is related to psychogenic factors, cigarette smoke, or β-blocking drugs, might benefit from anticholinergic therapy.

Short-acting anticholinergic agents have also been evaluated in combination with a SABA or sequentially following SABA administration. The rationale for use of a combination of a short-acting anticholinergic agent and a SABA includes differences between the two classes of medications regarding mechanisms of action, side-effect profiles, onset and duration of action, and site of action. Studies evaluating combination therapy with a short-acting anticholinergic and a SABA have shown variable results, mainly due to small numbers of patients or inappropriate patient populations; however, many of these studies showed an additional (although not significant) benefit.

Combivent® inhalation aerosol metered-dose inhaler (CVT-MDI) is a fixed-dose combination of the short-acting anticholinergic, ipratropium bromide, and the SABA, albuterol sulfate, using a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellant. It should be noted that the CFC-MDI formulation of Combivent (CVT-MDI) used in this study is no longer available, but Combivent is available in the Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler (Combivent® Respimat®), which is considered therapeutically equivalent to the CFC-MDI formulation, and studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have indicated that it has similar bronchodilator effects.

### Delayed diagnosis in cerebral venous thrombosis: associated factors and clinical outcomes [^111QUwP8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background Identifying factors associated with delayed diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) can inform future strategies for early detection. Methods and Results We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all participants from ACTION-CVT (Anticoagulation in the Treatment of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis) study who had dates of neurologic symptom onset and CVT diagnosis available. Delayed diagnosis was defined as CVT diagnosis occurring in the fourth (final) quartile of days from symptom onset. The primary study outcome was modified Rankin Scale score of ≤ 1 at 90days; secondary outcomes included partial/complete CVT recanalization on last available imaging and modified Rankin Scale score of ≤ 2. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent variables associated with delayed diagnosis and to assess the association of delayed diagnosis and outcomes. A total of 935 patients were included in our study. Median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 4days (interquartile range, 1–10days). Delayed CVT diagnosis (time to diagnosis > 10days) occurred in 212 patients (23%). Isolated headache (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.36 [95% CI, 1.50–3.73]; P < 0.001), older age (aOR by 1year, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.004–1.03]; P = 0.01), and papilledema (aOR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.03–3.89]; P = 0.04) were associated with diagnostic delay, whereas higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was inversely associated with diagnostic delay (aOR by 1 point, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.89–1.00]; P = 0.049). Delayed diagnosis was not associated with modified Rankin Scale score of ≤ 1 at 90days (aOR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.60–1.96]; P = 0.79). Conclusions In a large multicenter cohort, a quarter of included patients with CVT were diagnosed > 10days after symptom onset. Delayed CVT diagnosis was associated with the symptom of isolated headache and was not associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

### Report from the 3rd cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) summit of the diabetes&cardiovascular disease (D&CVD) EASD study group [^111Rhqxr]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Should we continue CV trials in the light of approved benefits?

In general, the answer to this question was affirmative. Any medication for chronic disease should undergo long-term safety studies best carried out with standardised and clinically relevant endpoints. An additional CV or microvascular benefit was considered to be a pre-requisite for new approaches in the management of diabetes. Beside the high relevance of CV endpoints, microvascular endpoints should not be neglected. Studies focussing primarily on renal outcomes in diabetes are awaited in the near future.

Suggestions for future CVOTs were discussed. It was agreed that novel treatments should also be tested against treatment approaches, which have already shown to have proven CV benefit. It was acknowledged that it will be an increasing challenge to demonstrate an additional CV benefit. Suggestions included the need for mechanistic studies to further understand mechanisms responsible for CV and/or microvascular benefits as well as potential side effects. Studies should also help to clarify which group of diabetic patients benefits from specific treatment strategies or class of treatment and which diabetic patient groups do not.

### Cardiovascular safety outcome trials: a meeting report from the cardiac safety research consortium [^114NYU2H]. American Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

This White Paper provides a summary of presentations and discussions at a Cardiovascular Safety Outcome Trials Think Tank cosponsored by the Cardiac Safety Research Consortium, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the American College of Cardiology, held at American College of Cardiology's Heart House, Washington, DC, on February 19, 2014. Studies to assess cardiovascular (CV) risk of a new drug are sometimes requested by regulators to resolve ambiguous safety signals seen during its development or among other members of its class. Think Tank participants thought that important considerations in undertaking such studies were as follows: (1) plausibility-how likely it is that a possible signal indicating risk is real, based on strength of evidence, and/or whether a plausible mechanism of action for potential CV harm has been identified; (2) relevance-what relative and absolute CV risk would need to be excluded to determine that the drug had an acceptable benefit-to-risk balance for its use in the intended patient population; and (3) how plausibility and relevance influence the timing and approach to further safety assessment.

### Effect of endovascular treatment with medical management vs standard care on severe cerebral venous thrombosis: the TO-ACT randomized clinical trial [^111sbtkV]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Importance

To date, only uncontrolled studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment (EVT) in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT), leading to the lack of recommendations on EVT for CVT.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of EVT in patients with a severe form of CVT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

TO-ACT (Thrombolysis or Anticoagulation for Cerebral Venous Thrombosis) was a multicenter, open-label, blinded end point, randomized clinical trial conducted in 8 hospitals in 3 countries (the Netherlands, China, and Portugal). Patients were recruited from September 2011 to October 2016, and follow-up began in March 2012 and was completed in December 2017. Adult patients with radiologically confirmed CVT who had at least 1 risk factor for a poor outcome (mental status disorder, coma state, intracerebral hemorrhage, or thrombosis of the deep venous system) were included. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle from March 2018 to February 2019. The trial was halted after the first interim analysis for reasons of futility.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive either EVT with standard medical care (intervention group) or guideline-based standard medical care only (control group). The EVT consisted of mechanical thrombectomy, local intrasinus application of alteplase or urokinase, or a combination of both strategies. Patients in the intervention group underwent EVT as soon as possible but no later than 24 hours after randomization.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary end point was the proportion of patients with a good outcome at 12 months (recovered without a disability; modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score of 0–1). Secondary end points were the proportion of patients with an mRS score of 0 to 1 at 6 months and an mRS score of 0 to 2 at 6 and 12 months, outcome on the mRS across the ordinal continuum at 12 months, recanalization rate, and surgical interventions in relation to CVT. Safety end points included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Results

Of the 67 patients enrolled and randomized, 33 (49%) were randomized to the intervention group and 34 (51%) were randomized to the control group. Patients in the intervention group vs those in the control group were slightly older (median [interquartile range (IQR)] age, 43 [33–50] years vs 38 [23–48] years) and comprised fewer women (23 women [70%] vs 27 women [79%]). The median (IQR) baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 12 (7–20) in the EVT group and 12 (5–20) in the standard care group. At the 12-month follow-up, 22 intervention patients (67%) had an mRS score of 0 to 1 compared with 23 control patients (68%) (relative risk ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71–1.38). Mortality was not statistically significantly higher in the EVT group (12% [n = 4] vs 3% [n = 1]; p = 0.20). The frequency of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was not statistically significantly lower in the intervention group (3% [n = 1] vs 9% [n = 3]; p = 0.61).

Conclusions and Relevance

The TO-ACT trial showed that EVT with standard medical care did not appear to improve functional outcome of patients with CVT. Given the small sample size, the possibility exists that future studies will demonstrate better recovery rates after EVT for this patient population.

### Delayed diagnosis in cerebral venous thrombosis: associated factors and clinical outcomes [^115Z7xZF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Identifying factors associated with delayed diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) can inform future strategies for early detection.

Methods and Results

We conducted a retrospective cohort study including all participants from ACTION‐CVT (Anticoagulation in the Treatment of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis) study who had dates of neurologic symptom onset and CVT diagnosis available. Delayed diagnosis was defined as CVT diagnosis occurring in the fourth (final) quartile of days from symptom onset.

### Delayed diagnosis in cerebral venous thrombosis: associated factors and clinical outcomes [^113UvGHp]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Outcomes

Our primary outcome was excellent functional outcome, defined as 90‐day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤ 1 because recent studies have shown that most patients with CVT have excellent functional outcome. As a secondary outcome, we included good functional outcome, defined as 90‐day mRS score of ≤ 2 and any (partial or complete) CVT recanalization on the last available venous imaging study obtained. Presence or absence of any recanalization was abstracted from radiology reports by the local site investigators. Complete recanalization was defined as full recanalization of the thrombosed vein or sinus without any residual thrombus. Partial recanalization was defined as improved opacification or flow in the affected cerebral sinus or vein, but with residual thrombus present on follow‐up imaging. No recanalization was defined as no change or worsening in opacification or flow in the affected cerebral sinus or vein from baseline imaging. We hypothesized that delayed CVT diagnosis would be associated with poor outcomes even after adjustment for patient factors previously known to be predictive of poor outcome in CVT (ie, patient age, active cancer, and CVT with deep vein involvement) in the entire study cohort. We additionally explored the primary study outcome in 3 different patient subgroups: those who presented with (1) isolated headache, (2) focal deficits, or (3) coma.

Subgroup Analysis

Because prior studies have shown an increased risk of delayed diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease in patients with isolated headache complaints, we separately evaluated for factors associated with delayed CVT diagnosis in the subset of included patients with isolated headache complaints. We defined isolated headache as having no symptoms other than headache at the time of index CVT hospitalization.

Standard Protocol Approvals and Patient Consents

Institutional review board approval was obtained from each participating center to perform the ACTION‐CVT study. Patient consent was waived because of the retrospective design of the study.

### Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate vs dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: a randomized clinical trial [^113E3c1y]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Limitations

RE-SPECT CVT has several limitations. It was an exploratory trial with a small sample size. Owing to the low frequency of recurrent VTE after CVT, the study was not powered to detect statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment groups for recurrent VTE. Assuming a preservation of 50% of the benefit of warfarin, a noninferiority trial with a 3% VTE rate would require approximately 2000 patients. Given the low incidence of CVT, such a trial is unlikely to be feasible.

Open-label compared with double-blind, double-dummy trials in anticoagulation have complementary strengths and weaknesses. Double-blind trials unavoidably deviate from routine clinical practice, and doing so limits their external validity. Open-label design may influence postrandomization management decisions, as well as outcome reporting and evaluation, and is a potential source of bias. To decrease the risk of such bias, we used the PROBE design. External evaluators, who were blinded to treatment allocation, adjudicated the outcome events on the basis of predefined criteria.

### Report from the 4th cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) summit of the diabetes&cardiovascular disease (D&CVD) EASD study group [^113R2mdq]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

CVOTs in diabetes: how should we continue?

On the 10 year anniversary of the FDA "Guidance for Industry" in 2018, a FDA advisory board re-evaluated the benefit and perpetuation of CVOTs, parallel to the 4th CVOT Summit in October 2018. Among the issues addressed by the FDA advisory board were: (1) the impact of the recommendations in the 2008 "Guidance for Industry" on the assessment of CV risk for drugs indicated to improve glycaemic control in patients with T2DM; (2) the transferability of CV safety findings from members of a drug class to the entire class of drugs, and (3) whether an inacceptable increase in CV risk needs to be excluded for all new drugs to improve glycaemic control in patients with T2DM, regardless of the presence or absence of a signal for CV risk in the development program. The FDA panel voted for continuation, yet improvement of CVOTs.

Questions of similar manner were discussed at the 4th CVOT Summit. On the one hand, positive aspects of CVOTs were reflected by, for example, the detection of unexpected benefits as observed in EMPA-REG OUTCOME, CANVAS, DECLARE-TIMI 58, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6 and Harmony Outcomes. These benefits often are not restricted to CV endpoints; e.g. the CANVAS trial revealed a positive effect of canagliflozin on renal outcomes. These safety and benefit analyses led to the refinement of treatment algorithms as stated in the 2018 ADA/EASD Consensus Statement and the integration of new drugs as "preferred" or "safe" second- or third-line therapy into new guidelines. On the other hand, limitations of current CVOTs, such as the lack of generalisability (i.e. participants often are at high risk for a CV event or death, thus not representative for a larger population), relatively short time-lines for assessing potential harms or benefits and the placebo-controlled design of CVOTs were addressed. Room for improvement of cost-effectiveness and cost-sharing options as well as modification of end points and analyses were also discussed. In summary, concomitant with the FDA panel vote, it was concluded that continuation but modification of CVOTs is highly beneficial as they provide safety aspects relevant to all T2DM patients and create a broad body of evidence to base new guidelines and therapies on.

### Stratifying cardiovascular benefits from GLP-1RA: a multisource analysis of patient-level CVOT and real-world data using AI-driven methods [^1113j9En]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current treatment guidelines/consensus statements recommend using cardioprotective agents (SGLT2i and GLP-1RA) independently from glucose control for patients with high cardiovascular risk, prioritizing GLP-1RA in the presence of atherosclerotic disease. Some suggest the use of these agents as first-line treatment for T2D in patients with overt CVD, such as prior MI or stroke. Our findings offer a new perspective, showing that patients older than 71 years without overt CVD derive a clinical benefit from treatment with GLP-1RA that is similar or even greater than do patients with overt CVD. For patients aged ≥ 71 years in primary prevention versus those in secondary prevention, respectively, the NNT was 31 versus 22 in CVOTs (over 3.6 years) and 25 versus 26 in the real world (over 2.1 years). In simple terms, once started on a GLP-1RA, elderly individuals without overt CVD are expected to gain the same absolute benefit as do patients with overt CVD. This might be particularly relevant from the perspective of patients and healthcare systems, both being more sensitive to absolute risk than relative risk reduction. More so, if we consider that the subgroup of elderly patients in primary prevention represents a much larger proportion of the real-world T2D population. The aging of the population and the decline in overall mortality among T2D patients highlight the clinical relevance of our findings.

By suggesting that elderly patients with T2D would benefit from treatment with GLP-1RA, we are not denying the importance of intervening earlier in the natural course of the disease. Even a smaller benefit obtained over a relatively short treatment (2–4 years) in the younger population is expected to translate into a greater benefit on the lifetime risk of CVD. Indeed, patients with T2D onset in their 40s and 50s have the worst diabetes-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Support for GLP-1RA efficacy in younger populations with lower baseline CVD risk also comes from the GRADE trial. In this large randomized study, participants had a mean age of 57 years, relatively short diabetes duration and predominantly free of established CVD. In post hoc analyses, those randomized to liraglutide experienced a lower rate of MACE events compared with those assigned to other glucose-lowering agents (glimepiride, insulin glargine, or sitagliptin). In these terms, our study confirms the broad benefits of GLP-1RA against cardiovascular events also in the younger population under routine care.

### Study of rivaroxaban for cerebral venous thrombosis: a randomized controlled feasibility trial comparing anticoagulation with rivaroxaban to standard-of-care in symptomatic cerebral venous thrombosis [^115VcC42]. Stroke (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Emerging data suggest that direct oral anticoagulants may be a suitable choice for anticoagulation for cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). However, conducting high-quality trials in CVT is challenging as it is a rare disease with low rates of adverse outcomes such as major bleeding and functional dependence. To facilitate the design of future CVT trials, SECRET (Study of Rivaroxaban for Cerebral Venous Thrombosis) assessed (1) the feasibility of recruitment, (2) the safety of rivaroxaban compared with standard-of-care anticoagulation, and (3) patient-centered functional outcomes.

Methods

This was a phase II, prospective, open-label blinded-end point 1:1 randomized trial conducted at 12 Canadian centers. Participants were aged ≥ 18 years, within 14 days of a new diagnosis of symptomatic CVT, and suitable for oral anticoagulation; they were randomized to receive rivaroxaban 20 mg daily, or standard-of-care anticoagulation (warfarin, target international normalized ratio, 2.0–3.0, or low-molecular-weight heparin) for 180 days, with optional extension up to 365 days. Primary outcomes were annual rate of recruitment (feasibility); and a composite of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, major extracranial hemorrhage, or mortality at 180 days (safety). Secondary outcomes included recurrent venous thromboembolism, recanalization, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, and functional and patient-reported outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, quality of life, headache, mood, fatigue, and cognition) at days 180 and 365.

Results

Fifty-five participants were randomized. The rate of recruitment was 21.3 participants/year; 57% of eligible candidates consented. Median age was 48.0 years (interquartile range, 38.5–73.2); 66% were female. There was 1 primary event (symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage), 2 clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events, and 1 recurrent CVT by day 180, all in the rivaroxaban group. All participants in both arms had at least partial recanalization by day 180. At enrollment, both groups on average reported reduced quality of life, low mood, fatigue, and headache with impaired cognitive performance. All metrics improved markedly by day 180.

Conclusions

Recruitment targets were reached, but many eligible participants declined randomization. There were numerically more bleeding events in patients taking rivaroxaban compared with control, but rates of bleeding and recurrent venous thromboembolism were low overall and in keeping with previous studies. Participants had symptoms affecting their well-being at enrollment but improved over time.

### Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate vs dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: a randomized clinical trial [^111QYPPn]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study showed that the risk of recurrent VTE was low in patients with CVT who received anticoagulant therapy with either dabigatran or dose-adjusted warfarin for 6 months. Anticoagulant therapy was associated with few major or clinically relevant bleeding events, new intracranial bleeds, or enlargement of baseline hemorrhagic lesions. Dabigatran and dose-adjusted warfarin may be safe options to prevent recurrent VTEs in patients with CVT. Because of the limited sample size, we could not demonstrate the noninferiority or superiority of either treatment.

### Cerebral venous thrombosis: clinical predictors and emerging treatments [^117FgBot]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Comment

This was an exploratory trial demonstrating low risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism and of clinically relevant bleeding with either dabigatran or dose-adjusted warfarin in the study population. However, due to the small sample population and the low frequency of recurrent venous thromboembolism after CVT, the study was not powered to detect non-inferiority between the two treatment groups.

### Direct oral anticoagulants versus vitamin K antagonists for cerebral venous thrombosis (DOAC-CVT): an international, prospective, observational cohort study [^116tGpTN]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Background

There is an unmet need for high-quality data from prospective studies on the safety and effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of DOACs versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for the treatment of CVT in a setting that reflects daily clinical practice.

Methods

DOAC-CVT was an international, prospective, observational cohort study done in 65 hospitals in 23 countries across five continents. Eligible patients were adults (aged ≥ 18 years) with radiologically confirmed CVT starting oral anticoagulant treatment with either DOACs or VKAs, as per local practice, within 30 days after diagnosis. Exclusion criteria were previous use of anticoagulants at the time of CVT diagnosis or an absolute contraindication to DOACs (eg, pregnancy and lactation, or severe renal or liver disease). Data were collected during routine clinical visits or telephone consultations at CVT diagnosis (baseline) and at 3months, 6months, and 12months after CVT diagnosis. The primary endpoint was a composite of symptomatic venous thromboembolism and major bleeding events (International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis criteria) at 6 months. Main outcomes were adjusted for the confounders age, renal function, active cancer, CNS infections, concomitant antiplatelet use, country of inclusion's income status, Glasgow Coma Scale score, intracranial haemorrhage, antiphospholipid antibodies, previous major bleeding, and previous venous thromboembolism using inverse probability-of-treatment weighting. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04660747) and is ongoing.

Findings

Between Jan 27, 2021, and Jan 15, 2024, 619 patients were included; 401 (65%) patients started DOAC treatment, and 218 (35%) patients started VKA treatment. 390 (63%) of 619 patients were female and 229 (37%) of 619 patients were male. Patients' median age was 41 years (IQR 28–51). 6-month follow-up data were available for 617 (> 99%) of 619 patients. 12 (3%) of 401 patients in the DOAC group and seven (3%) of 218 patients in the VKA group had a primary outcome event (weighted odds ratio [OR] 0·99 [95% CI 0·37–3·38]). Three (1%) of 401 patients in the DOAC group died versus three (1%) of 218 patients in the VKA group (weighted OR 0·55 [95% CI 0·11–2·80]).

Interpretation

The rate of recurrent thrombosis and major bleeding did not differ between patients with CVT treated with DOACs versus VKAs. This study adds to the increasing evidence that DOACs are a reasonable treatment option for CVT alongside VKAs.

### Glycemic control, preexisting cardiovascular disease, and risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: systematic review with meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials and intensive glucose control trials [^1141G2rY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

IGCTs and MACE

Intensive glycemic control (IGC) has an imperfect role in reducing the cardiovascular complications associated with T2DM. The CONTROL (Collaborators on Trials of Glucose Lowering) meta‐analysis 14 included 4 large IGCTs (UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study), ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes), ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease), and VADT (Veterans Administration Diabetes Trial)) 15, 16, 17, 18 with 27 049 patients: IGC led to a mean 0.9% A1C reduction and was associated with a significant 9% reduction of MACE (Table 1), although the reduction was not significant in any single trial. Moreover, compared with less intensive glycemic control, IGC was associated with a clear risk of serious hypoglycemia (HR = 2.48, 95% CI 1.91‐3.21). 14 There is some evidence favoring a delayed cardiovascular benefit of early IGC, as suggested by the 10‐year follow‐up of UKPDS, 19 which enrolled newly diagnosed T2DM patients, most without preexisting CVD. On the other hand, the attainment of IGC in long‐established and poorly controlled T2DM was associated with 22% excess cardiovascular mortality, prompting early termination of the intensive arm of the ACCORD trial. 16 This evidence has generated the concept of "residual vascular risk", the risk of macrovascular event that persists high to very high after IGC despite the attainment of prespecified and near‐to‐normal A1C targets. 20, 21

### Transitioning to active-controlled trials to evaluate cardiovascular safety and efficacy of medications for type 2 diabetes [^116Xk5sG]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

The demonstration of beneficial effects of antihyperglycemic medications on CV risk in patients with T2DM has been widely recognized as a major advance, changing the clinical practice guidelines and consensus, recommendations of professional societies to emphasize prioritized use of SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA in patients with or at high risk of CV disease. This favorable new therapeutic landscape, on the other hand, presents significant challenges for the design, conduct, and interpretation of future CVOTs for antihyperglycemic medications. Key among these considerations include the use of a placebo control when antihyperglycemic medications with proven CV benefits are now available. For example, patients entering a placebo-controlled randomized trial who are randomized to placebo will not be allowed to receive GLP-1 RA during the trial, which may not be considered ethical nowadays. Moreover, the open-label use of other cardioprotective antihyperglycemic medications that mitigate CV risk in either trial arm as part of standard medical care could influence the primary outcome of the CVOT assessment. On the other hand, if members of new drug classes with unknown effects on CV outcomes are tested, placebo-controlled design (added to the best standard of care) may remain an important strategy to establish CV safety and efficacy. As T2DM CVOTs aim for similarly effective glycemic control in investigational and comparator groups, it is more likely that additional antihyperglycemic agents with CV efficacy will be added to patients receiving placebo. If the added medications are SGLT-2i and/or GLP-1 RA, both of which would be expected to decrease MACE, the intention-to-treat analysis of the safety and efficacy of the investigational medication would be confounded. Thus, the results may underestimate the potential benefit of the investigational therapy and may adversely influence interpretation of the safety and efficacy assessments.

### Cerebral venous thrombosis: clinical predictors and emerging treatments [^113NpmGn]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Comment

This is the first randomised clinical trial relating to the efficacy and safety of endovascular therapy on CVT. Strengths of the study include a diverse patient population and inclusion of a number of risk factors for poor outcome. Limitations include the small sample size such that the study was underpowered to detect differences between the intervention and control groups, and the exclusion of the sickest patients with CVT and impending herniation. The authors concede that at the time of the study, available techniques and devices to achieve optimal recanalization in patients may have been sub-optimal, and that future studies using more advanced techniques may identify better recovery rates.

Patients with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) are at risk of recurrent venous thrombotic events (VTEs). Non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants have not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials in CVT.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate with those of dose-adjusted warfarin in preventing recurrent VTEs in patients who have experienced a CVT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

RE-SPECT CVT is an exploratory, prospective, randomized (1:1), parallel-group, open-label, multicenter clinical trial with blinded end-point adjudication (PROBE design). It was performed from December 21, 2016, to June 22, 2018, with a follow-up of 25 weeks, at 51 tertiary sites in 9 countries (France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, and Spain). Adult consecutive patients with acute CVT, who were stable after 5 to 15 days of treatment with parenteral heparin, were screened for eligibility. Patients with CVT associated with central nervous system infection or major trauma were excluded, but those with intracranial hemorrhage from index CVT were allowed to participate. After exclusions, 120 patients were randomized. Data were analyzed following the intention-to-treat approach.

Interventions

Dabigatran, 150 mg twice daily, or dose-adjusted warfarin for a treatment period of 24 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome was a composite of patients with a new VTE (recurrent CVT, deep vein thrombosis of any limb, pulmonary embolism, and splanchnic vein thrombosis) or major bleeding during the study period. Secondary outcomes were cerebral venous recanalization and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events.

Results

In total, 120 patients with CVT were randomized to the 2 treatment groups (60 to dabigatran and 60 to dose-adjusted warfarin). Of the randomized patients, the mean (SD) age was 45.2 (13.8) years, and 66 (55.0%) were women. The mean (SD) duration of exposure was 22.3 (6.16) weeks for the dabigatran group and 23.0 (5.20) weeks for the warfarin group. No recurrent VTEs were observed. One (1.7%; 95% CI, 0.0–8.9) major bleeding event (intestinal) was recorded in the dabigatran group, and 2 (3.3%; 95% CI, 0.4–11.5) (intracranial) in the warfarin group. One additional patient (1.7; 95% CI, 0.0–8.9) in the warfarin group experienced a clinically relevant non-major bleeding event. Recanalization occurred in 33 patients in the dabigatran group (60.0%; 95% CI, 45.9–73.0) and in 35 patients in the warfarin group (67.3%; 95% CI, 52.9–79.7).

Conclusions and Relevance

This trial found that patients who had CVT anticoagulated with either dabigatran or warfarin had low risk of recurrent VTEs, and the risk of bleeding was similar with both medications, suggesting that both dabigatran and warfarin may be safe and effective for preventing recurrent VTEs in patients with CVT.

### Delayed diagnosis in cerebral venous thrombosis: associated factors and clinical outcomes [^111MBwRD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a rare cerebrovascular disease, which can result in significant disability. One challenge in diagnosing CVT relates to its often‐insidious onset compared with other types of cerebrovascular diseases and the fact that CVT can initially manifest with nonspecific clinical features. In the ISCVT (International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis), patients with CVT presented to the hospital after a median of 4 days from symptom onset, and CVT diagnosis was not established until a median of 7 days from symptom onset. In a large multistate cohort study using administrative claims data, nearly 1 in every 30 hospitalized patients with CVT had a potentially missed diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) within 14 days of their CVT diagnosis.

The purpose of this current study is to evaluate diagnostic delay in the ACTION‐CVT (Anticoagulation in the Treatment of Cerebral Venous Thrombosis) study, to identify factors associated with delayed diagnosis, and to explore the relationship between delayed CVT diagnosis and clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that the following variables would be associated with delayed CVT diagnosis: male sex, presenting with signs of increased intracranial pressure, encephalopathy, coma, headache complaints, low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and normal head computed tomography on presentation. We further hypothesized that well‐known CVT risk factors, including oral contraceptive use, cancer, and postpartum state, would be associated with a lack of delay in CVT diagnosis. An improved understanding of factors associated with diagnostic delay among patients with CVT is a key component of future interventions to improve diagnostic accuracy to impact clinical outcomes.

### CVOT summit 2022 report: new cardiovascular, kidney, and glycemic outcomes [^112c9ain]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

During a median follow-up of 2.3 years, dapagliflozin demonstrated a significant improvement in the primary composite outcome with an 18% reduction in the combined relative risk of worsening HF or CV death (hazard ratio (HR) 0.82 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73–0.92]; p < 0.001). The primary outcome event was observed in 16.4% (n = 512) of the dapagliflozin group and among 19.5% (n = 610) of the placebo group. Similar results were observed in participants with an ejection fraction of less than 60% compared to those of the overall population (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.73–0.95]; p = 0.009). Furthermore, results were similar in pre-specified subgroups, including participants with or without diabetes. When evaluating individual components of the primary outcome, a reduction in the rate of hospitalization for HF or urgent visit for HF (HR 0.79 [95% CI 0.69–0.91]) and CV death (HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.74–1.05]) was observed in the dapagliflozin group compared with the placebo group.

Secondary outcomes of interest included a significant reduction in the total number of a composite of worsening HF events and CV death with dapagliflozin use, with 815 such events occurring in the dapagliflozin group and 1057 occurring in the placebo group (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.67–0.89]; p < 0.001). In the safety analyses, serious adverse events, including death, occurred in 43.5% (n = 1361) of the dapagliflozin group and in 45.5% (n = 1423) of the placebo group. The investigators also noted that 5.8% of the dapagliflozin group and 5.8% of the placebo group discontinued treatment due to adverse events.

### Current perspectives on cardiovascular outcome trials in diabetes [^11479dMU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the most common diabetes-associated complications, as well as a leading cause for death in type 2 diabetes patients (T2D). Despite the well-known correlation between the two, up until the 2008 FDA industry guidance for licensing of new anti-hyperglycemic drugs, which required an investigation of cardiovascular outcomes (CVO) of glucose-lowering agents, only a few studies had looked into the relationship between glucose lowering drugs and cardiovascular (CV) risk. Thereafter, CVOT design has focused on non-inferiority short-term studies on high-risk patient populations aiming at capturing CV safety issues. Despite the wealth of information and useful data provided by CVOTs, this approach still suffers from certain limitations. The present review will condense the main results of the most recently completed CVOTs, reflect on the lessons learned, discuss on the issues presented by current CVOT design and offer some suggestions for improvement.

### Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate vs dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: a randomized clinical trial [^116TTphy]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Randomization and Masking

Patients were randomized 1:1 through an online telephone-guided response system to receive either dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) or warfarin (dose adjusted to maintain an international normalized ratio [INR] between 2.0 and 3.0). Randomization took place 5 to 15 days after the initial acute treatment with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin. Randomization was stratified by presence or absence of intracranial hemorrhage at baseline neuroimaging. The randomization list was generated by the study sponsor (Boehringer Ingelheim) using a validated system. The randomization code remained unseen by the whole trial team up to database lock. Because RE-SPECT CVT was an open-label trial, treatment allocation was not concealed from the patients and investigators.

Women's representation in cardiovascular randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — actions and regulatory context are summarized as follows: The poor representation of women in the majority of CV RCTs has long been recognized, and EHRA introduced 'Women in electrophysiology' (WEP) with the intent of promoting sex balance in RCTs in order to provide generalizability of study results for both women and men. In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created an Office of Women's Health to increase the focus on female enrolment in clinical trials and published an action plan to enhance the collection and availability of demographic subgroup data. In Europe, EMA concluded that gender is adequately represented in pivotal trial populations but noted that fewer women than men participated in early (Phase 1–2 studies), that women are more susceptible to QT prolongation and may metabolize drugs differently, and the authors state that the evidence in this consensus document calls for a new EMA assessment.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^117JorE1]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of the evidence

We did not identify direct studies to answer the question of the benefit of thrombophilia testing for patients with CVT. For patients with CVT, we were uncertain if the comparison should be limited duration of anticoagulant therapy or indefinite duration of anticoagulant therapy in all patients. The 2017 European Stroke Organization guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of CVT suggests "using oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists) for a variable period (3–12 months) after CVT to prevent recurrent CVT and other venous thromboembolic events", as a weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence. As a remark, the guideline also states that "patients with recurrent venous thrombosis or with an associated prothrombotic condition with a high thrombotic risk may need permanent anticoagulation". We therefore chose to answer the question using 2 scenarios: a strategy of thrombophilia testing compared with stopping anticoagulant treatment after completion of primary treatment in all patients, and a strategy of thrombophilia testing compared with indefinite anticoagulation in all patients. The effects of thrombophilia testing and a subsequent strategy of stopping anticoagulant treatment for patients without thrombophilia only, or indefinite anticoagulant treatment for patients with thrombophilia only, were indirectly calculated using 3 observational studies for thrombophilia prevalence unique to patients with CVT, RR of recurrent VTE in those with positive vs negative results for thrombophilia, and the effect of indefinite treatment, as detailed in Table 3. See the online evidence profiles for study references.

The overall risk for VTE recurrence after CVT was estimated at 38 per 1000 in the first year, based on 4 observational studies. We estimated the risk of major bleeding at 5 per 1000 in patients at low risk and 15 per 1000 in patients at high risk of bleeding, based on the lowest and highest observed rates among 11 RCTs.

### Report from the 3rd cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) summit of the diabetes&cardiovascular disease (D&CVD) EASD study group [^113HW9jo]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Data from the Swedish RiksSvikt Heart Failure registry from 2003 to 2011 was also presented. It included more than 36,000 patients with HF, of whom 8809 presented with diabetes. The database recorded about 70 variables and treatments managed by the Uppsala Clinical Research Centre. Data analysis revealed amongst others that diabetes compromises survival in HF irrespective of sex, HF aetiology or type. It increases mortality by 30–70% in diabetic patients. The prognosis is comparable between male and female diabetes patients and worst in those with systolic dysfunction and ischemic heart disease. It was concluded from the registry that special attention is required for diabetic patients with HF and strategies for improvement of outcome need to be established.

It was agreed that real-world evidences are beneficial to increase the understanding of the course of diabetes and its complications. A prerequisite for utilisation and interpretation of real-world data are high data quality and integrity of cases within the studied population. Nevertheless, discrepancies between randomised control trials and real-world data impede the comparison of such results. It was discussed that adherence to medication might differ between the two study designs and thereby contribute to contrasting results. It was consensus that real-world data are valuable tools to complement, but not replace CVOTs. Nevertheless the role for real-world data will increase in the future.

Key questions discussed during the 3rd CVOT Summit: How should results of CVOTs be reflected in guidelines?

The requirement for a balanced reflection of CVOT results in guidelines is undoubted. It was agreed that both national and international guidelines need to incorporate CVOT results in a swift and comprehensive manner, and that an adaption of international guidelines supports updates of guidelines on a local level. Further strategies to distribute new CVOT results may also include online publications of guidelines and regular updates of medical standards.

In the future guidelines might need to distinguish between diabetic patients with and without CVD considering separate algorithms for treatment strategies of the two populations. Updated guidelines should not only reflect on medication that has demonstrated CV safety but also include examples of CV risk reduction. Updated guidelines should clearly discuss potential class effects of GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 and SGLT-2 inhibitors, while at the same time highlight drug-specific effects observed in the outcome trials. Side effects and adverse events need to be included.

It was frequently suggested to provide joint guidelines by and for diabetologists, cardiologists and general practitioners (GPs).

Adjunct therapy in T1DM

As in T2DM, T1DM is associated with a considerably increased risk of CV events which were shown to occur at a younger age than in non-diabetic individuals. Variations in glucose level and hyperglycaemia in children with T1DM have been associated with persistent cognitive dysfunction and both, hyper- and hypoglycaemia were linked to various adverse CV events, although the relationship of severe hypoglycaemia in T2DM seems to be bi-directional. However, as patients with T1DM are mainly treated with insulin, CV safety of new glucose lowering agents was only investigated in the context of T2DM. As of now, a variety of studies has started to investigate the use of glucose lowering medication typically used in T2DM, like metformin, pramlintide, GLP-1 RA, SGLT-2i and dual SGLT-1 and -2i as adjunctive therapy for T1DM, particularly in patients who have inadequate insulin control and/or are overweight.

When looking at GLP-1 RA (liraglutide and exenatide) as adjunct therapy in T1DM, one is confronted with significant inter-study variability regarding reduction of HbA1c, postprandial plasma glucose and insulin doses (summarised in). In the ADJUNCT ONE trial, evaluating the use of liraglutide as adjunctive therapy in T1DM, inconsistent results regarding HbA1c reduction and reduction of daily insulin dose were obtained across three liraglutide doses compared to placebo. Adverse events included increased rates of symptomatic hypoglycaemia and an increase in hyperglycaemia with ketosis.

Various studies investigated the efficacy of SGLT-2i (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin and the dual SGLT-1 and -2i sotagliflozin) in the treatment of T1DM. All studies reported a significant decrease in HbA1c and some also reductions in body weight and daily insulin dose. Adverse events included an increase in genital infections and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Strategies for the prevention of DKA need to be further established and defined. The strong educational need of health care professionals and diabetes teams was highlighted.

It can be summarised that, although no direct comparison of T1DM and T2DM can be made, agents demonstrating CV safety in CVOTs may also exert beneficial effects when provided as adjunct therapy in T1DM. However, more and larger studies are needed to evaluate if CV safety or benefit demonstrated for those agents in T2DM, next to reductions in HbA1c, bodyweight and insulin dose, also hold true in T1DM.

### Report from the CVOT summit 2020: new cardiovascular and renal outcomes [^1168cYNv]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

SOLOIST-WHF (Table 4: HF outcomes) and SCORED (Table 2: cardiovascular outcomes)

Two other SGLT2 inhibitor trials evaluated sotagliflozin, which also provides gastrointestinal SGLT1 inhibition, and were published shortly after the Virtual CVOT Summit 2020. Both trials ended early due to loss of funding from the sponsor. This led to a reduction in power to test for the original primary endpoints. Due to these constraints, as well as evolution of the field since the trials were initiated, led to new primary composite endpoints being pre-specified in the statistical analysis plans prior to database lock. Furthermore, clinical events comprising the primary and secondary endpoints were reported by the site investigators, and not adjudicated.

The SOLOIST-WHF trial assessed the effect of a daily dose of 200 mg sotagliflozin (with a dose increase to 400 mg, depending on tolerability) in 1222 patients with T2D who were either hospitalised for worsening HF or recently discharged, with a median follow-up time of 9 months. The trial was originally designed with a primary endpoint of the first occurrence of either death from CV causes or HHF. The new primary composite endpoint was the total number of deaths from CV causes, HHF and urgent visits for HF.

The primary composite outcome was significantly reduced with sotagliflozin versus placebo by 33% (HR 0.67 [95% CI 0.52–0.85]; p < 0.001), with a relative risk reduction of CV death by 16% (HR 0.84 [95% CI 0.58–1.22]) and all-cause death by 18% (HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.59–1.24]). Of importance, there was similar treatment benefit in patients with both reduced (LVEF < 50%: HR 0.72 [95% CI 0.56–0.94]) and preserved (LVEF > 50%: HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.27–0.86]) ejection fraction. In terms of adverse events, patients with sotagliflozin showed higher prevalence for diarrhoea (6.1% vs. 3.4%) and for severe hypoglycaemia (1.5% vs. 0.3%) compared to placebo. There was no excess of DKA events with sotagliflozin versus placebo, despite the fact that this trial evaluated acutely hospitalized or recently discharged patients.

### Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate vs dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: a randomized clinical trial [^113QYMT8]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is a type of stroke caused by thrombosis of the dural sinus and/or cerebral veins. The prevalence of CVT in high-income countries is 1.3 to 1.6 per 100 000 persons, and is higher in low- and middle-income countries.

In acute-phase CVT, less than 5% of patients die and approximately 75% make a full recovery. Those who survive acute CVT are at increased risk of recurrent venous thrombotic events (VTEs) in the cerebral veins and dural sinuses, veins of the limbs, and splanchnic veins, or pulmonary embolism (PE). In observational studies, the risk of recurrent CVT was 1.5 per 100 persons per year and the risk of all VTEs was 2.0 to 4.1 per 100 persons per year. Most recurrences seem to occur in the months after the initial thrombotic event.

The recommended practice for preventing VTE recurrence after CVT is anticoagulation using vitamin K antagonists for variable periods, depending on the inherent thrombotic risk of each patient. This recommendation is based on the extrapolation of findings on prevention of recurrent VTE in deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Direct non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants are changing the practice of anticoagulation and have been used to prevent DVT and PE. Dabigatran etexilate is a direct thrombin antagonist that has been proven to be efficacious and to have a good safety and tolerability profile when used for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillationas well as when used for treatment and prevention of recurrent DVT and PE.

Dabigatran and other non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants are occasionally used off-label in patients with CVT. Small case series have been published that found promising safety and efficacy results, but these studies lacked controls and randomization. Because of the low quality of available evidence, European guidelinesdo not currently recommend non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants after CVT.

We conducted RE-SPECT CVT (A Clinical Trial Comparing Efficacy and Safety of Dabigatran Etexilate With Warfarin in Patients With Cerebral Venous and Dural Sinus Thrombosis), an exploratory randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran compared with dose-adjusted warfarin in the prevention of recurrent VTE and CVT.

### Epidemiology of antiphospholipid syndrome: macro-and microvascular manifestations [^112oWkR3]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT), including the thrombotic occlusion of the dural venous sinus and/or cerebral veins, represents only 0.5–0.7% of the cerebral vascular complications in the general population. Being such a rare manifestation, its exact prevalence in thrombotic APS is difficult to be determined. In the Euro-Phospholipid Project including 1000 APS subjects, only seven (0.7%) patients presented with a CVT. Further studies, including the APS ACTION registry, report a prevalence of around 2% to 5% in APS. On the other hand, APS contributes to a significant proportion (∼6% to 17%) of CVT cases in large studies in the general population. Recently, Jerez-Lienas et al. analysed the data from a series of 27 APS patients with CVT from three university hospitals, and a systematic literature review of CVT cases in APS. The lateral venous sinuses, including transverse and sigmoid sinuses, were the most frequently involved, followed by the superior sagittal sinus, while cerebral cortical veins thrombosis was less frequent (14% of cases). When present, CVT can be the first APS manifestation in almost 75% of patients, while headache is the most common symptom at presentation. Interestingly, it can be the only symptom in > 40% of APS-related cases. Any change from the usual headache pattern and especially the co-existence with new neurologic symptoms, should prompt a careful imaging evaluation with brain computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The 1st Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (CVOT) Summit of the Diabetes & Cardiovascular Disease (D&CVD) EASD Study Group was held during the annual meeting on 30 October 2015 in Munich. This summit was organized in light of recently published and numerous ongoing CVOTs on diabetes, which have emerged in response to the FDA and the EMA Guidelines. The CVOT Summit stands as a novel conference setup, with the aim of serving as a reference meeting for all topics related to CVOTs in diabetes. Members of the steering committee of the D&CVD EASD Study Group constitute the backbone of the summit. It included presentations of key results on DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1-Analogues, SGLT-2 inhibitors, acarbose and insulins. Diabetologists' and cardiologists' perspective on the potential need of new study designs were also highlighted. Furthermore, panel discussions on the design of CVOTs on diabetes were included in the program. The D&CVD EASD Study Group will continue its activity. In-depth discussions and presentations of new CVOTs like LEADER, will be resumed at the 2nd CVOT on diabetes of the D&CVD EASD Study Group, which will be held from 20–22 October 2016 in Munich (http://www.dcvd.org).

### Report from the 1st cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) summit of the diabetes&cardiovascular disease (D&CVD) EASD study group [^116wSNnc]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Historically, the federal drug agency (FDA) Guidance for Industry "Diabetes mellitus: evaluating cardiovascular (CV) risk in new antidiabetic therapies in type 2 diabetes", issued in 2008, led to the initiation of numerous cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) studies on diabetes.

The aim of the Guidance for Industry is to establish the safety levels of newly developed antidiabetic drugs for type 2 diabetes treatment. To that end, sponsors should demonstrate that the therapy will not result in an unacceptable increase in CV risk. According to FDA's guidance recommendations, to ensure that a new therapy does not increase CV risk to an unacceptable extent, the development program for novel type 2 antidiabetic therapies should include a prospective adjudication of CV events by an independent committee. These events should include CV mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke, but also can include hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, urgent revascularization procedures, and possibly other endpoints. Patients at higher risk of CV events, such as patients with relatively advanced disease, elderly patients, and patients with some degree of renal impairment are also recommended to be included in the studies.

It is important to notice that the FDA's guidance documents do not enforce legally binding responsibilities. Rather, it reflects the agency's standpoint and is to be viewed only as a recommendation.

The Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) highlights the need for evaluation of various safety aspects in a dataset representative of this population. It emphasizes that for an assessment of overall safety data in multiple organ systems, it is essential to, as far as possible, exclude that a new drug increases the risk of macrovascular complications, e.g. CV disease.

SGLT2 inhibitors: evidence for reduced risk of HHF

Both dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are approved in Europe and the US for the treatment of patients with chronic HFrEF, based on published findings of dedicated HF outcomes studies, DAPA-HF and EMPEROR-Reduced (Fig. 2 A, B). In February and March 2022, empagliflozin also received FDA and European Commission approval for the treatment of patients with preserved EF (HFpEF), in light of encouraging findings from the recently reported EMPEROR-Preserved trial, while the DELIVER trial of dapagliflozin in patients with HFpEF is ongoing. The recently completed EMPEROR-Preserved and ongoing DELIVER trials are covered in the 'Where Next?' section of this review.

Fig. 2
Exploring possible HF benefits with glucose-lowering drugs (mainly SGLT2 inhibitors). All clinical trials shown are of SLGT2 inhibitors, except for AMPLITUDE-O (efpeglenatide, GLP-1 RA). A consistent pattern of fewer HHF events, with a large effect size, has been seen across the SGLT2 inhibitor class. These reductions were closely mirrored in a dedicated renal outcomes study of canagliflozin in patients with diabetic kidney disease, and in dedicated HF outcomes studies of dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF with or without diabetes and of empagliflozin in patients with HFpEF with or without diabetes (A). Results from these trials are shown to illustrate the consistency of findings regarding HHF; they should not be directly compared, due to differences in study design, definitions and populations. Note that HHF as a standalone endpoint was not a primary outcome measure in any of the studies shown and has not been reported for the SOLOIST-WHF HF outcomes study, DAPA-CKD renal outcomes or SCORED cardiorenal studies. Diabetes CVOTs were not initially designed to assess any protective effect on HHF (for example, most patients were not diagnosed with HF at baseline (B)). International guidelines for the treatment of patients with T2D now recommend SGLT2 inhibitors to protect patients from HF (C), while real-world studies have confirmed the pattern of fewer HHF events in the more diverse patients seen in routine clinical practice (D).

### Report from the 1st cardiovascular outcome trial (CVOT) summit of the diabetes&cardiovascular disease (D&CVD) EASD study group [^1135m1Xd]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Main body

The CVOT Summit on Diabetes of the D&CVD EASD Study Group was organized in light of recently published and numerous ongoing CVOTs on diabetes, which have emerged in response to the FDA and the EMA guidelines.

The aims of the CVOT Summit on Diabetes were:
Establish a sustainable platform for scientific exchange on CVOTs in diabetes.
Support in-depth discussions beyond the level of presentations at large-scale international congresses.
Create a network of key stakeholders in the field.
Enforce discussions among the scientific community, trial sponsors as well as regulatory and reimbursement authorities.
Act as a reference group on matters related to CVOTs on diabetes in the future.

One of the general points of agreement was the importance of differentiating between trials with a primary focus in CVs safety and those that aim to a potential reduction of CV events.

CV safety trials, which assess CV safety of novel drugs, are characterized by a specific study design: They include high-risk diabetic patients and largely aim at glycemic equipoise between active and standard treatment. Therefore studies are designed as non-inferiority comparison trials.

This specific design does not exclude assessment of potential superiority in the trials. Moreover, they also can generate an unprecedented amount of safety data and produce significant data beyond CV outcomes.

The CVOT Summit also discussed trials with a focus on a potential reduction of CV events.

During the 1st CVOT Summit on Diabetes several key questions were debated by diabetologists, cardiologists and initiators of CVOTs:

XARELTO for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and reduction in the risk of recurrent VTE was evaluated in the EINSTEIN Junior Phase 3 study [NCT02234843], a multicenter, open-label, active-controlled, randomized study in 500 pediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years with confirmed VTE. There were 276 children aged 12 to < 18 years, 101 children aged 6 to < 12 years, 69 children aged 2 to < 6 years, and 54 children aged < 2 years. Patients < 6 months of age were excluded from enrollment if they were < 37 weeks of gestation at birth, or had < 10 days of oral feeding, or had a body weight of < 2.6 kg.

Index VTE was classified as either central venous catheter-related VTE (CVC-VTE), cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST), and all other VTE including DVT and PE (non-CVC-VTE).

Patients received initial treatment with therapeutic dosages of unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux for at least 5 days, and were randomized 2:1 to receive either body weight-adjusted doses of XARELTO (exposures to match that of 20 mg daily dose in adults) or comparator group (UFH, LMWH, fondaparinux or VKA) for a main study treatment period of 3 months (or 1 month for children < 2 years with CVC-VTE). A diagnostic imaging test was obtained at baseline and at the end of the main study treatment. When clinically necessary, treatment was extended up to 12 months in total (or up to 3 months in total for children < 2 years with CVC-VTE).

### Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate vs dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: a randomized clinical trial [^113qar7n]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Methods

Study Design and Participants

RE-SPECT CVT is an exploratory, multicenter PROBE design (prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label with blinded evaluation of end points) clinical trial conducted at 51 sites in 9 countries (France, Germany, India, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Russia, and Spain) from December 21, 2016, to June 22, 2018. All participating sites were tertiary medical centers with an interest in CVT. This trial was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee at each site and, where required, by the national ethics committees for clinical research. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before randomization. Patients who could not directly provide consent could designate a legally authorized representative to sign the consent form on their behalf. The rationale, design, and protocol of RE-SPECT CVT have been published previously; the full trial protocol is available in Supplement 1.

We recruited consecutive patients of either sex who were between 18 and 79 years of age and had a diagnosis of CVT confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plus MR venography, computed tomography (CT) plus CT venography, or intraarterial venography. Patients should have achieved clinical stability after receiving acute CVT treatment as required.

Major exclusion criteria were the inability to swallow oral medication, CVT associated with central nervous system infection or major head trauma, planned surgical procedure for CVT (eg, decompressive hemicraniectomy), life-threatening or major bleedingin the previous 6 months other than intracranial hemorrhage from the index CVT, need to continue previous treatment with an anticoagulant for an indication other than CVT, current or recent (< 6 months) malignancy, and creatinine clearance level less than 30 mL/min (to convert to mL/s/m 2, multiply by 0.0167) (eAppendix 1 in Supplement 2).

### Low-dose methotrexate for the prevention of atherosclerotic events [^115mJn63]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study CIRT was published by Ridker PM and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Coronary artery disease and Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the CIRT study, the trial question was: what is the role of low-dose methotrexate in patients with previous MI or MVCAD? In the CIRT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CIRT study, the population was: 4786 patients (898 female, 3888 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with previous MI or multivessel CAD and either T2DM or metabolic syndrome. The key exclusion criteria were history of chronic infection, tuberculosis, pulmonary fibrosis, alcohol abuse, hepatic or renal dysfunction and women of childbearing potential. In the CIRT study, the interventions were: n = 2391 low-dose methotrexate (15 to 20 mg weekly, with 1 mg folate daily) n = 2395 placebo (matching tablet weekly, with 1 mg folate daily). In the CIRT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the incidence of nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, CV death, or hospitalization for UA requiring urgent revascularization (4.13/100 py vs. 4.31/100 py; HR 0.96, 96% CI 0.79 to 1.16). In the CIRT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the incidence of nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, or CV death (3.46/100 py vs. 3.43/100 py; HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.25). In the CIRT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in serious adverse events, including bleeding and infection. Leukopenia, elevated liver enzymes and increased incidence of non-basal-cell skin cancer was noted in methotrexate group than in placebo. In the CIRT study, the conclusion was: in patients with previous MI or multivessel CAD and either T2DM or metabolic syndrome, low-dose methotrexate was not superior to placebo with respect to the incidence of nonfatal MI, nonfatal CVA, CV death, or hospitalization for UA requiring urgent revascularization.

### Cerebral venous thrombosis: clinical predictors and emerging treatments [^115mDef3]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate vs dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis

The objective of this exploratory randomised trial was to compare safety and efficacy of dabigatran, a direct thrombin inhibitor, with warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, in the prevention of recurrent thrombo-embolic events in patients who have experienced a CVT. This multicentre trial was conducted between December 2016 and June 2018 at tertiary centres in nine countries in Asia and Europe.

Adult patients with radiologically confirmed CVT were randomised 5–15 days after initial treatment to receive either Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily or Warfarin at a therapeutic dose for 24 weeks. Primary outcome was the number of patients with major haemorrhage or new thromboembolic event during the treatment trial. Secondary outcomes included recanalization rates assessed by MR venography.

120 patients were randomised equally to the 2 treatment groups. Baseline characteristics including demographics, neuroimaging findings, clinical signs and risk factors for CVT were well matched in both groups. 88% of patients in the dabigatran group and 93% in the warfarin group completed treatment over 24 weeks. All 120 patients were included in the final analysis. No recurrent venous thromboembolic events were observed in either group. Three major bleeding events were noted: one (1.7%) case of intestinal bleeding in the dabigatran group and two (3.3%) subdural haemorrhages in the warfarin group. Cerebral recanalization was noted in 33 out of 55 patients (60%) in the dabigatran group (95% CI, 45.9–73.0) and in 35 out of 52 patients (67.3%) in the warfarin group 95% CI, 52.9–79.7).

### Cerebral venous thrombosis: clinical predictors and emerging treatments [^112xYUGQ]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The first paper outlines the development of a scoring system which could be utilised as a pre-test score in the clinical assessment of suspected CVT. The second and third papers demonstrate encouraging work regarding the efficacy and safety of interventional and oral treatments for CVT. Further study on the efficacy of endovascular treatment for CVT using newer techniques and devices is desirable, and may prove of benefit to patients with severe CVT. Larger scale studies are required to demonstrate the equivalence of direct-thrombin inhibitors as an alternative means of anticoagulation in patients with CVT.

Methods

Study design and participants

The design of the WHO ACTION-I trial has been described previously in the study protocol and primary findings. In brief, WHO ACTION-I trial was a multi-country, multi-centre, individually-randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial was conducted in 29 secondary and tertiary level hospitals across Bangladesh, India, Kenya, Nigeria, and Pakistan. The trial protocol was approved by ethics committees and regulatory agencies for each country and participating hospital and the WHO Ethics Review Committee and registered prior to commencement (Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry number ACTRN12617000476336; Clinical Trials Registry-India number, CTRI/2017/04/008326). The trial was conducted and reported in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. All participants were randomized between December 2017 and November 2019, and the trial was stopped early due to evidence of benefit.

Women with a viable singleton or multiple pregnancy who presented to participating hospitals at a gestational age of 26 weeks 0 days–33 weeks 6 days and who were identified as being at risk of imminent preterm birth were eligible for inclusion and invited to participate. Imminent preterm birth was defined as planned or expected birth in the next 48 h (either provider-initiated or after preterm prelabour rupture of membranes or spontaneous labour). To be eligible, a woman's gestational age had to be informed by an obstetric ultrasound. Women were not eligible if they had clinical signs of severe infection, suspicion, or evidence of clinical chorioamnionitis, major congenital fetal anomalies, concurrent or recent use of systemic steroids, were participating in another maternal or newborn health trial, or had a contraindication to steroid use. Women were screened at the time of presentation to hospital, and randomised women and their babies were followed up until day 28 after birth, at the hospital or at home. Written informed consent was obtained from every woman prior to randomisation.

For this secondary analysis, we included randomised women (and their newborns) who received a single course of dexamethasone or placebo, had complete data for trial primary outcomes, and who had complete data on time of dexamethasone or placebo administration and time of birth. Women who received a repeat course (and their newborns) were excluded. Hence, the population for this analysis comprised 92.5% of women and 90.2% of babies who participated in the WHO ACTION-I trial.

### Endovascular therapy for cerebral vein thrombosis: a propensity-matched analysis of anticoagulation in the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis [^111L4ozk]. Neurosurgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Endovascular treatment (EVT) for cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT) has not been proven to be more effective than anticoagulation based on recent results of the Thrombolysis or Anticoagulation for Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (TO-ACT) randomized clinical trial.

Objective

To compare outcomes of EVT vs medical management in CVT.

Methods

We compared EVT vs medical management in a retrospective multinational cohort of consecutive patients with CVT across 4 countries (USA, Italy, Switzerland, and New Zealand) and 27 sites (2015–2020), using propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW), and meta-analyzed these results with the TO-ACT trial. The primary outcome was excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 0–1) at 90 days.

Results

Of the 987 patients, the mean age was 45.7 ± 16.9 years and 79 (8%) underwent EVT. With PSM (n = 124), there were no major differences in clinical or imaging features between groups other than a higher proportion of female patients receiving EVT (81% vs 65%, P = 0.04). There was no difference in the primary outcome with PSM (odds ratio [OR] 1.48, 95% CI, 0.55–3.96) or IPTW (OR 1.02, 95% CI, 0.34–3.06). EVT was associated with a higher 90-day shift in modified Rankin Scale (OR 2.00, 95% CI, 1.01–3.98) and mortality with IPTW (OR 4.60, 95% CI, 1.10–19.23) but no other differences in secondary outcomes with PSM or IPTW. A meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcomes from TO-ACT and PSM patients from anticoagulation in the treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis also showed no significant association with EVT in primary or secondary outcomes.

Conclusion

In this large observational cohort, there was no evidence of benefit with EVT for CVT. These findings corroborate the results from the TO-ACT trial.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a comparison of study designs, populations and results [^115EgoBg]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The HR for the first occurrence of a CV event in the primary composite endpoint comparing exenatide with placebo was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by baseline CV risk group and treatment group as a covariate. 12 Tests for non‐inferiority and superiority were conducted hierarchically, first testing for non‐inferiority then superiority for the primary composite endpoint. 12 A superiority test for the secondary outcome of all‐cause death was conducted only if non‐inferiority and superiority were significant for the primary composite endpoint. 12 Two formal interim efficacy analyses were planned to test for superiority (P < .0001 and P < .001) after 453 and 906 events, corresponding to one‐ and two‐thirds of the targeted 1360 primary CV events. 12 This design was to ensure a significance level of.0499 for the final analysis. 12

A total of 14 752 patients were randomized and 10 782 had established CVD (73.1%) with 3970 (26.9%) having CV risk factors, mirroring projections of a patient pool of 14 000 with 70% having established CVD. 12 There were 1744 primary composite outcome events observed, exceeding the minimum of 1360 needed to test EXSCEL's superiority and non‐inferiority hypotheses. 12 The incidence rate for MACE‐3 was 3.7 and 4.0 events/100 patient‐years for exenatide and placebo, respectively, exceeding the 2.2% assumed for testing EXSCEL's primary outcomes. 12 Primary composite outcome events occurred in 839 and 905 patients treated with exenatide or placebo, respectively; exenatide showed non‐inferiority to placebo with respect to safety, but not superiority to placebo with respect to efficacy (HR 0.91, 95% CI [0.83, 1.00]; P < .001 and P = 0.06, respectively). 12 Among other factors, EXSCEL's pragmatic design, shorter follow‐up, duration of treatment regimen exposure and lower baseline HbA1c compared with LEADER may have contributed to its lack of observed CV efficacy. 12 Compared with other GLP‐1 RA CVOTs, EXSCEL had low treatment regimen compliance (exenatide, 76.0%; placebo, 75.0%), defined as the duration of time that patients received the trial regimen relative to the duration of time that they were expected to receive the regimen during the trial. 12

### Early versus late initiation of endovascular therapy in patients with severe cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [^115HgP3R]. Neurocritical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, these preliminary results suggest a higher frequency of functional independence in early EVT as compared to late EVT in patients with severe CVST. In addition, early EVT may lead to a clinically relevant reduction in mortality. The recognition of a time-is-brain paradigm might be warranted when considering EVT for CVST in selected patients and needs to be a focus of future randomized controlled trials.

### Acetylcysteine for prevention of renal outcomes in patients undergoing coronary and peripheral vascular angiography: main results from the randomized acetylcysteine for contrast-induced nephropathy trial (ACT) [^1124bKzL]. Circulation (2011). Low credibility.

The study ACT was published by ACT Investigators. and colleagues in 2011 in the journal Circulation. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute kidney injury, Coronary artery disease, Contrast-induced nephropathy, ST-elevation myocardial infarction and Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. In the ACT study, the trial question was: what is the role of acetylcysteine for the prevention of contrast-induced AKI in patients undergoing coronary and peripheral vascular angiography? In the ACT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACT study, the population was: 2308 patients (892 female, 1416 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing an intravascular angiographic procedure with at least 1 risk factor for contrast-induced AKI (age > 70 years, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, HF, or hypotension). The key exclusion criteria were dialysis; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary angioplasty; pregnancy, lactation, or women aged < 45 years without current contraception. In the ACT study, the interventions were: n = 1172 acetylcysteine (PO 1200 mg BID, for 2 doses before and 2 doses after the procedure) n = 1136 placebo (matching placebo PO BID, for 2 doses before and 2 doses after the procedure). In the ACT study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in contrast-induced AKI (12.7% vs. 12.7%; RR 1, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.25). In the ACT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death or need for dialysis at 30 days (2.2% vs. 2.3%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.69) No significant difference in death, need for dialysis, or doubling in serum creatinine at 30 days (3.2% vs. 3.6%; RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.39) No significant difference in death at 30 days (2% vs. 2.1%; HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.73). In the ACT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in any other adverse events, except for vomiting (0.3% vs. 1.2%, p = 0.02). significant differences in other serious adverse events (1.3% vs. 2.2%, p = 0.09). In the ACT study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing an intravascular angiographic procedure with at least 1 risk factor for contrast-induced AKI (age > 70 years, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, HF, or hypotension), acetylcysteine was not superior to placebo with respect to a contrast-induced AKI.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^116fwRkU]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — intensive glycemic control outcomes and risks: Intensive therapy reduced the risk of a renal composite outcome by 21% that included ESRD, which was also reduced in long-term follow-up, but in both trials, rates of hypoglycemia and weight gain were higher with intensive therapy than with conventional therapy. In the ACCORD study, death from any cause was more common in the intensive group; low HbA1c nearly doubled the rate of hypoglycemia and increased the risk of death from any cause by 22%, and the number needed to harm for all-cause mortality over 3.5 years was 100. Trials of older patients with longer durations of diabetes, such as ADVANCE and VADT, did not show an increased risk of all-cause mortality with lower HbA1c targets, and overall intensive therapy improves some clinical outcomes in patients with T2DM at the expense of risk for adverse events, while the patient populations that stand to benefit or suffer potentially catastrophic harms are poorly defined by the evidence. Achieving and sustaining HbA1c levels between 7–8.5% clearly reduces significantly the risk of microvascular complications and possibly nonfatal CV events when compared with higher HbA1c levels. In VADT, participants sustained a median HbA1c of 6.9% in the intensive treatment group compared with 8.5% in the conventional group through 5.6 years, which reduced the risk of proteinuria during treatment and reduced non-fatal CV events by 17% at 10 years of follow-up. In UKPDS, although the average HbA1c was 7% in the intensively treated group, microvascular benefits associated with intensive therapy emerged when the group's average HbA1c had risen to 7–8% as compared with 8–9% in the conventional treatment group.

### Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate vs dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: a randomized clinical trial [^1144AMT3]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Procedure

The trial consisted of 3 sequential periods: a screening period of 5 to 15 days, a treatment period of 24 weeks, and a follow-up period of 7 days (Figure 1). Screened patients could be enrolled into the trial (ie, signed informed consent) once they had a confirmed diagnosis of CVT; met the inclusion and exclusion criteria; and received treatment for the acute phase of CVT, including with initial parenteral anticoagulation (unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin) as recommended by current guidelines. Endovascular treatment was allowed. Randomization occurred 5 days after the start of parenteral anticoagulation therapy if the patient was stable, but it could be postponed until the patient was stable for up to 15 days after the start of parenteral therapy. In the warfarin group, parenteral therapy continued until an INR of 2.0 or higher was achieved for 2 consecutive measurements; in the dabigatran group, parenteral therapy was discontinued as soon as the trial treatment was started.

INR indicates international normalized ratio; LMWH, low-molecular-weight heparin; UFH, unfractionated heparin. Adapted with permission from SAGE Publications, Ltd.

At screening, neuroimaging from the time of diagnosis of the CVT was used. At the end of trial treatment, recanalization was assessed by MRI plus MR venography by using a trial-specific MRI protocol (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2). All neuroimaging data were reviewed by the adjudication committee, blinded for clinical data and treatment group.

A flowchart of the study is depicted in eAppendix 3 in Supplement 2. Follow-up visits at the clinic were targeted at days 29, 85, and 169 (end of treatment) after randomization. A further safety follow-up visit was performed 7 to 14 days after the end of treatment. The end-of-treatment visit included the modified Rankin Scaleand neuroimaging. For patients who discontinued trial medication, the end-of-treatment visit was carried out at the discontinuation visit. Those who discontinued trial medication early were followed up for survival and for adverse, new thrombotic, and bleeding events until day 176 (25 weeks) after randomization, unless they withdrew their informed consent. After the end of treatment or early discontinuation of trial medication, whether a patient received further nontrial treatment was at the discretion of the treating physician.

### Under-reporting of cardiovascular events in the rofecoxib Alzheimer disease studies [^117PyooK]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In September 2004, rofecoxib (Vioxx) was removed from the market after it was found to produce a near doubling of cardiovascular thrombotic (CVT) events in a placebo-controlled study. Its manufacturer stated that this was the first clear evidence of such risk and criticized previous analyses of earlier CVT risk for focusing on investigator-reported events. We studied contemporaneously adjudicated CVT events to assess the information on cardiovascular risk available while the drug was in widespread use.

Methods

Using an intention-to-treat analysis of adjudicated CVT deaths, we analyzed detailed patient-level data collected during 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials of rofecoxib versus placebo that had been designed to define the drug's possible role in the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer disease. All trials had been completed by April 2003.

Results

In the 3 studies combined, the data indicated that rofecoxib more than tripled the risk of confirmed CVT death (risk ratio = 3.57 [1.48–9.72], P = 0.004). This finding reached the P < .05 level of significance by June 2001.

Conclusion

Intention-to-treat analysis of placebo-controlled studies of rofecoxib for Alzheimer disease demonstrated that the drug produced a significant increase in confirmed CVT deaths nearly 40 months before it was removed from the market. By contrast, published analyses of these trials were restricted to on-treatment analyses (ending 14 days after cessation of treatment) that did not reveal this risk. Intention-to-treat analyses of clinical trial data can reveal important information about potential drug risks and should be performed routinely and reported in a timely manner.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115PYFTr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Canagliflozin — CANVAS and CANVAS-R cardiovascular outcomes — enrolled 4,330 and 5,812 patients, respectively, with 72% having established ASCVD, and randomized participants to placebo or canagliflozin (100 or 300 mg in CANVAS, and 100 mg with an optional increase to 300 mg in CANVAS-R). The combined analysis demonstrated a 14% relative reduction in triple MACE versus placebo (HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.97 from 31.5 to 26.9 events per 1,000 person-years). Although none of the individual components were statistically significant on their own, point estimates favored SGLT2 therapy — CV death (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.06), fatal or nonfatal MI (HR: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.09), and fatal or nonfatal stroke (HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.09) — and all-cause mortality showed HR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.01.

### Safety and efficacy of dabigatran etexilate vs dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis: a randomized clinical trial [^1173Qunc]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

As is the case for all randomized clinical trials, the inclusion and exclusion criteria induced sample selection bias. The characteristics of the sample were, in general, expected in a convenience sample of patients with CVT admitted to tertiary centers. Because patients who could not swallow were excluded, no comatose patients were included in the trial. We also excluded patients with major trauma, central nervous system infections, or active cancer as well as those requiring hemicraniectomy. The allocated sample consisted of CVT cases of mild to moderate severity, as demonstrated by the low score on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (score range for this sample: 0–13, indicating mild to moderate), CVT risk scores, and modified Rankin Scale at 4 weeks or up to 24 weeks.

The frequency of recurrent VTEs in RE-SPECT CVT was lower than anticipated. This low frequency may be attributable to the excellent treatment adherence and good INR control among patients. Alternative explanations are follow-up of only 6 months, the effect of early parenteral heparin, and selection bias leading to a low inclusion rate for patients at high risk for recurrence. Severely affected patients, often bedridden for long periods, have a higher risk of DVT of the limbs and PE compared with those less severely affected. Active cancer is also a risk factor for recurrent VTE; these patients were excluded from the trial. Older age, male sex, genetic thrombophilia, and myeloproliferative syndromes increase the risk of recurrent VTE in patients with CVT. RE-SPECT CVT had no cases of myeloproliferative neoplasm or acquired thrombophilia, and only 8 patients with confirmed genetic thrombophilia were enrolled. Those conditions were not an exclusion criterion, except for active or recent cancer.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials: a paradigm shift in the current management of type 2 diabetes [^116V3aqN]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Historical concerns about cardiovascular (CV) risks associated with certain glucose-lowering medications gave rise to the introduction of cardiovascular outcomes trials (CVOTs). Initially implemented to help monitor the CV safety of glucose-lowering drugs in patients with T2D, who either had established CVD or were at high risk of CVD, data that emerged from some of these trials started to show benefits. Alongside the anticipated CV safety of many of these agents, evidence for certain sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have revealed potential cardioprotective effects in patients with T2D who are at high risk of CVD events. Reductions in 3-point major adverse CV events (3P-MACE) and CV death have been noted in some of these CVOTs, with additional benefits including reduced risks of hospitalisation for heart failure, progression of renal disease, and all-cause mortality. These new data are leading to a paradigm shift in the current management of T2D, with international guidelines now prioritising SGLT2 inhibitors and/or GLP-1 RAs in certain patient populations. However, clinicians are faced with a large volume of CVOT data when seeking to use this evidence base to bring opportunities to improve CV, heart failure and renal outcomes, and even reduce mortality, in their patients with T2D. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth summary of CVOT data-crystallising the key findings, from safety to efficacy-and to offer a practical perspective for physicians. Finally, we discuss the next steps for the post-CVOT era, with ongoing studies that may further transform clinical practice and improve outcomes for people with T2D, heart failure or renal disease.

### Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19-final report [^115bxuXM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2020). Excellent credibility.

The study ACTT-1 was published by John H Beigel and colleagues in 2020 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: COVID-19 infection. In the ACTT-1 study, the trial question was: what is the role of remdesivir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who have evidence of lower respiratory tract infection? In the ACTT-1 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ACTT-1 study, the population was: 1062 patients (378 female, 684 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection. The key exclusion criteria were alanine transaminase or aspartate transaminase > 5 times the ULN; eGFR < 30 mL/min; pregnancy or lactation; allergy to any study medication. In the ACTT-1 study, the interventions were: n = 541 remdesivir (200 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 100 mg daily for up to 9 additional days) n = 521 placebo (matching placebo or normal saline for up to 10 days). In the ACTT-1 study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in time to recovery (10 days vs. 15 days; RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.49). In the ACTT-1 study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in clinical improvement at day 15 (with an ordinal score of 1) (29% vs. 22.1%; OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9) No significant difference in the rate of death by day 29 (11.4% vs. 15.2%; HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.03) Significant increase in median time to discharge (8 days vs. 12 days; HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.46). In the ACTT-1 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in grade 3 or 4 adverse events and nonserious adverse events. significant differences in serious adverse events (24.6% vs. 31.6%), serious respiratory failure adverse events (8.8% vs. 15.5%). In the ACTT-1 study, the conclusion was: in adult patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 and had evidence of lower respiratory tract infection, remdesivir was superior to placebo with respect to time to recovery.

### Standards of medical care in diabetes – 2010 [^115qAoGV]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Because of ongoing uncertainty regarding whether intensive glycemic control can reduce the increased risk of CVD events in people with type 2 diabetes, several large long-term trials were launched in the past decade to compare the effects of intensive versus standard glycemic control on CVD outcomes in relatively high-risk participants with established type 2 diabetes. In 2008, results of three large trials (ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT) suggested no significant reduction in CVD outcomes with intensive glycemic control in these populations. Details of these three studies are shown in Table 10, and their results and implications are reviewed more extensively in a recent ADA position statement.

Table 10
Comparison of the three trials of intensive glycemic control and CVD outcomes

The ACCORD study randomized 10,251 participants with either history of a CVD event or significant CVD risk to a strategy of intensive glycemic control (target A1C < 6.0%) or standard glycemic control (A1C target 7.0–7.9%). Investigators used multiple glycemic medications in both arms. From a baseline median A1C of 8.1%, the intensive arm reached a median A1C of 6.4% within 12 months of randomization, while the standard group reached a median A1C of 7.5%. Other risk factors were treated aggressively and equally in both groups. The intensive glycemic control group had more use of insulin in combination with multiple oral agents, significantly more weight gain, and more episodes of severe hypoglycemia than the standard group.

In early 2008, the glycemic control arm of ACCORD was halted on the recommendation of the study's data safety monitoring board due to the finding of an increased rate of mortality in the intensive arm compared with the standard arm (1.41 vs. 1.14%/year, hazard ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.01–1.46), with a similar increase in cardiovascular deaths. The primary outcome of ACCORD (MI, stroke, or cardiovascular death) was lower in the intensive glycemic control group due to a reduction in nonfatal MI, although this finding was not statistically significant when the study was terminated. Of note, prespecified subset analyses showed that participants with no previous CVD event and those who had a baseline A1C < 8% had a statistically significant reduction in the primary CVD outcome, although overall mortality was not reduced in these groups.

### Safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban in pediatric cerebral venous thrombosis (EINSTEIN-Jr CVT) [^115TvGuN]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulant treatment of pediatric cerebral venous thrombosis has not been evaluated in randomized trials. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of rivaroxaban and standard anticoagulants in the predefined subgroup of children with cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) who participated in the EINSTEIN-Jr trial. Children with CVT were randomized (2:1), after initial heparinization, to treatment with rivaroxaban or standard anticoagulants (continued on heparin or switched to vitamin K antagonist). The main treatment period was 3 months. The primary efficacy outcome, symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and principal safety outcome, major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, were centrally evaluated by blinded investigators. Sinus recanalization on repeat brain imaging was a secondary outcome. Statistical analyses were exploratory. In total, 114 children with confirmed CVT were randomized. All children completed the follow-up. None of the 73 rivaroxaban recipients and 1 (2.4%; CVT) of the 41 standard anticoagulant recipients had symptomatic, recurrent VTE after 3 months (absolute difference, 2.4%; 95% confidence interval, -2.6% to 13.5%). Clinically relevant bleeding occurred in 5 (6.8%; all nonmajor and noncerebral) rivaroxaban recipients and in 1 (2.5%; major [subdural] bleeding) standard anticoagulant recipient (absolute difference, 4.4%; 95% CI, -6.7% to 13.4%). Complete or partial sinus recanalization occurred in 18 (25%) and 39 (53%) rivaroxaban recipients and in 6 (15%) and 24 (59%) standard anticoagulant recipients, respectively. In summary, in this substudy of a randomized trial with a limited sample size, children with CVT treated with rivaroxaban or standard anticoagulation had a low risk of recurrent VTE and clinically relevant bleeding. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02234843.

### Randomized trial of complete versus lesion-only revascularization in patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention for STEMI and multivessel disease: the CvLPRIT trial [^116TJSqN]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal management of patients found to have multivessel disease while undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (P-PCI) for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction is uncertain.

Objectives

CvLPRIT (Complete versus Lesion-only Primary PCI trial) is a U.K. open-label randomized study comparing complete revascularization at index admission with treatment of the infarct-related artery (IRA) only.

Methods

After they provided verbal assent and underwent coronary angiography, 296 patients in 7 U.K. centers were randomized through an interactive voice-response program to either in-hospital complete revascularization (n = 150) or IRA-only revascularization (n = 146). Complete revascularization was performed either at the time of P-PCI or before hospital discharge. Randomization was stratified by infarct location (anterior/nonanterior) and symptom onset (≤ 3 h or > 3 h). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure, and ischemia-driven revascularization within 12 months.

Results

Patient groups were well matched for baseline clinical characteristics. The primary endpoint occurred in 10.0% of the complete revascularization group versus 21.2% in the IRA-only revascularization group (hazard ratio: 0.45; 95% confidence interval: 0.24 to 0.84; p = 0.009). A trend toward benefit was seen early after complete revascularization (p = 0.055 at 30 days). Although there was no significant reduction in death or MI, a nonsignificant reduction in all primary endpoint components was seen. There was no reduction in ischemic burden on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy or in the safety endpoints of major bleeding, contrast-induced nephropathy, or stroke between the groups.

Conclusions

In patients presenting for P-PCI with multivessel disease, index admission complete revascularization significantly lowered the rate of the composite primary endpoint at 12 months compared with treating only the IRA. In such patients, inpatient total revascularization may be considered, but larger clinical trials are required to confirm this result and specifically address whether this strategy is associated with improved survival.

### Cerebral venous thrombosis: clinical predictors and emerging treatments [^1129o15o]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Effect of endovascular treatment with medical management vs standard care of severe cerebral venous thrombosis

This randomised clinical trial was conducted across eight hospitals in the Netherlands, China and Portugal between September 2011 and December 2017. Adult patients with radiologically confirmed CVT with high probability for poor outcome were included in the study. Risk factors for poor outcome were defined as the presence of at least one of mental status disorders, Glasgow coma scale < 9, intracerebral haemorrhage, or thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system. Exclusion criteria included thrombocytopenia, space-occupying lesion and clinical and radiological signs of impending trans-tentorial herniation.

Of 67 patients enrolled, 33 (49%) were randomised to receive endovascular treatment with standard medical care (intervention group) and 34 (51%) to receive guideline-based medical care (control group). Patients in the intervention group underwent endovascular treatment within 24 h of randomisation. Intervention consisted of mechanical thrombectomy, pharmacological thrombolysis or both, at the discretion of the interventional radiologist. All patients in the intervention group received therapeutic dose heparin after endovascular treatment was completed. Patients randomised to the control group received therapeutic dose heparin as per international guidelines. All patients in the intervention and control group received long-term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists for a variable duration of 3–12 months.

Primary end point was the proportion of patients who had recovered without disability at 12 months. Secondary end points were the proportion of patients with a good recovery at 6 and 12 months, and recanalization rates. Safety end points included symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Functional outcome was scored using the modified Rankin Scale by blinded clinicians. At 12 months of follow-up, 22 intervention patients (67%) had achieved the primary end point compared with 23 control patients (68%) (relative risk ratio 0.99; 95% CI, 0.71–1.38). There was no statistically significant difference in mortality or frequency of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage between the intervention and control group. The study was prematurely terminated following an interim futility analysis.

### How representative of a general type 2 diabetes population are patients included in cardiovascular outcome trials with SGLT2 inhibitors? A large European observational study [^111UoVXp]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

In principle, CVOT representativeness can be assessed with or without access to laboratory data, which are not always sufficiently present in many health care registries. The level of CV risk at baseline mainly determines the level of CV outcome in CVOTs and must be comparable to that in the T2D population to enhance the representativeness of a CVOT. HbA1c is used for trial‐specific reasons, has less impact on CV outcomes, and affects the representativeness of a CVOT. Using laboratory data to assess representativeness requires an HbA1c reading within a reasonable period before index; many patients will therefore be lost because they do not fulfill HbA1c inclusion criteria or values for them are missing in the registries. Also, in the eligibility assessment prior to CVOT inclusion, trial‐specific HbA1c measurements are performed to secure enrolment. Hence, the HbA1c measurement used to determine representativeness in registries is requested for reasons other than those for HbA1c measurements prior to trial enrolment. One might discuss which method, with or without laboratory data, is the most accurate to determine the representativeness of a CVOT of a general T2D population, and the truth is probably somewhere between the two. However, we have shown that comparison of representativeness among CVOTs remains robust and can be accessed via health care registries without laboratory data.

With consistent evidence of the beneficial effects of SGLT‐2is on CV risk and their strengthened position in guidelines, it is of high importance to understand the actual patient profiles in these CVOTs and, thereby, how representative of a general T2D population the included patient populations actually are. 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21 From the present analysis, it is clear that the main inclusion criteria, determining the baseline CV risk in the respective CVOT, are closely correlated to how representative of a general T2D population the trials are in comparison with each other. Trials that include patients with less CV risk and, consequently, with higher representativeness, require a larger number of patients to fulfill sufficient power criteria concerning CV outcomes. Outcomes of such trials may support a broader implementation of the study results in a real‐world setting with a broad spectrum of CV risk levels.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^114Fat93]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus — intensive glycemic control trials show no cardiovascular (CV) benefit in ADVANCE or VADT, while in ACCORD increased mortality occurred with intensive glycemic control (target A1c < 6%) versus standard control (target HbA1c 7.0–7.9%), leading to early termination; after 10 years, VADT reported 8.6 fewer major CV events per 1,000 person-years but no survival benefit, and ADVANCE showed no CV benefit on long-term follow-up though microvascular benefit was observed. In ADVANCE, in‑trial end stage renal disease (ESRD) reductions (7 versus 20 events, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.35, p = 0.02) persisted after 10 years (29 versus 53 events, HR: 0.54, p < 0.01), with greater benefits in those with lower stage CKD (p = 0.04) and with lower baseline systolic BP (p = 0.01), while effects on death, CV death, or major CV events did not differ by kidney function (p = 0.28). Macrovascular benefits were not observed in these patients with more advanced disease, and intensive control in an older population with established disease should not be routinely implemented.

### CONSORT 2025 explanation and elaboration: updated guideline for reporting randomised trials [^114Ba3Wb]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Authors should report for each group, the number of participants at risk, the number of deaths, the number of participants withdrawn due to harms, the number of participants with at least one harm event, and the number of events, if appropriate. Where appropriate, the estimated effect size with its precision (such as 95% CIs) should be reported including both absolute and relative effects for binary outcomes. It is important to separate the reporting of systematically and non-systematically assessed harms. Systematically assessed harms should be reported even if zero events were identified. It should also be clear whether the authors are reporting the number of participants with at least one harm event or the number of events per unit of time at risk and whether recurrent events were included. The number of participants withdrawn because of harms should also be reported for each group. Finally, results should be reported for all harms. We strongly discourage the use of thresholds or criteria to select which harms should be reported. All harms could be detailed in supplementary materials.

We recommend reporting the results in a table with the results for each trial arm. More detailed information can be found in the CONSORT statement extension for harms, which was updated in 2022.

### Efficacy and safety of apixaban for primary prevention of thromboembolism in patients with cancer and a central venous catheter: a subgroup analysis of the AVERT trial [^112szgPP]. Thrombosis Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The study AVERT (subgroup analysis) was published by Willem Brandt and colleagues in 2022 in the journal Thromb Res. This study is related to the following diseases: Catheter-related thrombosis and Cancer-associated thrombosis. In the AVERT (subgroup analysis) study, the trial question was: what is the effect of apixaban in patients with cancer and a central venous catheter? In the AVERT (subgroup analysis) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the AVERT (subgroup analysis) study, the population was: 217 patients. The inclusion criteria were patients with cancer-initiating chemotherapy who were at intermediate-to-high risk of VTE. The key exclusion criteria were lesions or conditions leading to increased risk of clinically significant bleeding; liver insufficiency; planned stem cell transplant; life expectancy < 6 months. In the AVERT (subgroup analysis) study, the interventions were: n = 126 apixaban (a dose of 2.5 mg BID for 6 months) n = 91 placebo (matching placebo for 6 months). In the AVERT (subgroup analysis) study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in VTE at 180 days (4.8% vs. 18.7%; HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.47). In the AVERT (subgroup analysis) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in proximal DVT at 180 days (3.2% vs. 12.4%; HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.55) Significant decrease in death at 180 days (0.8% vs. 2.2%; HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.49). In the AVERT (subgroup analysis) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding. In the AVERT (subgroup analysis) study, the conclusion was: in patients with cancer-initiating chemotherapy who were at intermediate-to-high risk of VTE, apixaban was superior to placebo with respect to VTE at 180 days.

The 7th Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (CVOT) Summit on Cardiovascular, Renal, and Glycemic Outcomes, was held virtually on November 18–19, 2021. Pursuing the tradition of the previous summits, this reference congress served as a platform for in-depth discussion and exchange on recently completed CVOTs. This year's focus was placed on the outcomes of EMPEROR-Preserved, FIGARO-DKD, AMPLITUDE-O, SURPASS 1–5, and STEP 1–5. Trial implications for diabetes and obesity management and the impact on new treatment algorithms were highlighted for endocrinologists, diabetologists, cardiologists, nephrologists, and general practitioners. Discussions evolved from outcome trials using SGLT2 inhibitors as therapy for heart failure, to CVOTs with nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and GLP-1 receptor agonists. Furthermore, trials for glycemic and overweight/obesity management, challenges in diabetes management in COVID-19, and novel guidelines and treatment strategies were discussed.

### A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of enoxaparin after high-risk coronary stenting: the ATLAST trial [^116ZMHNL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

We performed a multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to examine the efficacy and safety of enoxaparin in patients at high risk for stent thrombosis (ST).

Background

The optimal antithrombotic regimen for such patients is unknown.

Methods

We randomized 1,102 patients with clinical, angiographic or ultrasonographic features associated with an increased risk of ST to receive either twice-daily injections of weight-adjusted enoxaparin or placebo for 14 days after stenting. All patients received aspirin and ticlopidine. The primary end point was a 30-day composite end point of death, myocardial infarction (MI) or urgent revascularization.

Results

The target enrollment for the study was 2,000 patients. However, the trial was terminated prematurely at 1,102 patients after interim analysis revealed an unexpectedly low event rate. The primary outcome occurred in 1.8% enoxaparin-treated patients versus 2.7% treated with placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 1.5, p = 0.30); for death or MI the rates were 0.9% vs. 2.2%, respectively (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.2, p = 0.13); and for MI, 0.4% vs. 1.6%, respectively (OR 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.99, p = 0.04). The groups had comparable rates of major bleeding (3.3% for enoxaparin, 1.6% for placebo, p = 0.08), but minor nuisance bleeding was increased with enoxaparin (25% vs. 5.1%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The clinical outcomes of patients at increased risk of ST are more favorable than previously reported, rendering routine oral antiplatelet therapy adequate for most. However, given its relative safety and potential to reduce the risk of subsequent infarction, a 14-day course of enoxaparin may be considered for carefully selected patients.

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^116vrcED]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST grading framework — dimensions and evidence adjustment are defined explicitly. The CHEST grading system defines the grades based on two key dimensions: (1) the balance of benefits of the proposed action as compared with the possible harms or risks and (2) the methodologic quality of the supporting evidence. Both factors are represented in the overall grade, with the former represented by 1 or 2 and the latter A, B, or C. The methodologic quality is initially based on the hierarchy of study design, but studies can be upgraded or downgraded based on specific criteria (eg, existence of methodologic flaws, directness, precision, consistency of results).

### Eptifibatide [^117H35uU]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The lower-infusion-rate arm was stopped after the first interim analysis when the 2 active-treatment arms appeared to have the same incidence of bleeding.

Patient age ranged from 20 to 94 (mean 63) years, and 65% were male. The patients were 89% Caucasian, 6% Hispanic, and 5% Black, recruited in the United States and Canada (40%), Western Europe (39%), Eastern Europe (16%), and Latin America (5%).

This was a "real world" study; each patient was managed according to the usual standards of the investigational site; frequencies of angiography, PCI, and CABG therefore differed widely from site to site and from country to country. Of the patients in PURSUIT, 13% were managed with PCI during drug infusion, of whom 50% received intracoronary stents; 87% were managed medically (without PCI during drug infusion).

The majority of patients received aspirin (75–325 mg once daily). Heparin was administered intravenously or subcutaneously, at the physician's discretion, most commonly as an intravenous bolus of 5000 units followed by a continuous infusion of 1000 units/h. For patients weighing less than 70 kg, the recommended heparin bolus dose was 60 units/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 12 units/kg/h. A target aPTT of 50 to 70 seconds was recommended. A total of 1250 patients underwent PCI within 72 hours after randomization, in which case they received intravenous heparin to maintain an ACT of 300 to 350 seconds.

### Sulodexide for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism: the sulodexide in secondary prevention of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (SURVET) study: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^11652Btx]. Circulation (2015). Low credibility.

Our study, however, has some limitations. The total incidence of qualifying events was less than expected but similar to that of other trials. A better preventive approach during the period immediately after the index events and perhaps more frequent application of compressive therapy in the studied population could have contributed to decrease this incidence that, however, under the "all failures" assumption was close to the one anticipated in the sample size calculation. The smaller incidence of primary end point therefore appears unlikely to have biased the estimate of the effect size.

The proportion of patients entered in the study with major protocol violations was larger than expected. These violations included cases at lesser (longer anticoagulant treatment or short interval from anticoagulant withdrawal to randomization) and at higher (shorter or no anticoagulant treatment or long untreated interval before randomization) risk. None of these factors significantly affected the risk of recurrence in the multivariable analysis. Furthermore, the results in the per-protocol population were similar to those in the ITT population. There is therefore no evidence that the potential bias associated with protocol violations may have affected the estimate of the effect to an appreciable extent.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^112VEpub]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^1128N26B]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents — evidence sources and inclusion criteria specify that studies were generally limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews (SRs), and meta-analyses (MAs), with added context from genetic and natural history studies; eligible studies had to pertain to specified risk factors and predetermined outcomes, relate to the critical questions, focus on the target population (ages 0 to 21 years) with longitudinal cohorts initiated within this range and identifiable in analyses, include at least part of this age range for the Guidelines, and be conducted in Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, or Israel.

### Varenicline tartrate [^116wzN7q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Following the CVD study, a meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of ≥ 12 weeks treatment duration, including 7,002 patients (4,190 varenicline tablets, 2,812 placebo), was conducted to systematically assess the CV safety of varenicline tablets. The study in patients with stable CV disease described above was included in the meta-analysis. There were lower rates of all-cause mortality (varenicline tablets 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and CV mortality (varenicline tablets 2 [0.05%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]) in the varenicline tablets arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis.

The key CV safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred in the trials included in the meta-analysis, as described in Table 13. These events occurred primarily in patients with known CV disease.

The meta-analysis showed that exposure to varenicline tablets resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE of 1.95 (95% confidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82) for patients up to 30 days after treatment; this is equivalent to an estimated increase of 6.3 MACE events per 1,000 patient-years of exposure. The meta-analysis showed higher rates of CV endpoints in patients on varenicline tablets relative to placebo across different time frames and pre-specified sensitivity analyses, including various study groupings and CV outcomes. Although these findings were not statistically significant, they were consistent. Because the number of events was small overall, the power for finding a statistically significant difference in a signal of this magnitude is low.

Additionally, a cardiovascular endpoint analysis was added to the postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome study along with a non-treatment extension, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.10)].

### Methodologies for the development of CHEST guidelines and expert panel reports [^1147uGtx]. Chest (2014). Medium credibility.

CHEST strength of recommendations — weak recommendations are graded 2A, 2B, and 2C with corresponding evidence and implications. Weak recommendations (2A–2B): Benefits closely balanced with risks and burden. Weak recommendation, high-quality evidence (2A): Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; The best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (2B): Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Best action may differ depending on circumstances or patients' or societal values. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Weak recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (2C): Uncertainty in the estimates of benefits, risks, and burden; benefits, risk, and burden may be closely balanced; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Other alternatives may be equally reasonable. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

### Revealing key dimensions underlying the recognition of dynamic human actions [^116sG4uu]. Communications Psychology (2025). Medium credibility.

As shown in Supplementary Table 3, most dimensions reported by previous studies, using a range of approaches, can be integrated into the action space model revealed in the current study, speaking for its broad explanatory profile (for exceptions, see refs.). Dimensions that seem most consistent across these various studies are related to instrumental/goal-directed actions, food and food-related actions, and expressive/leisure actions. That said, in comparison to the results obtained from previous studies, the dimensions revealed in the current study correspond to a broader range of domains, including not only information related to human actions and manipulable non-living things (reported by most previous studies), but also living things, non-manipulable non-living things, environment, substance, and force. This clearly demonstrates the unique added value of our data-driven approach for disentangling the nature of action representations in humans. Importantly, the action typicality ratings along the 28 dimensions gathered from a separate group of participants revealed a close correspondence to the dimension information revealed by the SPoSE modeling procedure, suggesting that the dimensions indeed are meaningful and interpretable to a degree that they are relevant for the ability to recognize and categorize actions. These results connect information obtained from a large sample size back to the level of individual participants and further underline that the behavior-derived dimensions obtained in the current study help individuals categorize and interpret actions performed by other people.

Visualizations of each action video via rose plots (see Fig. 5) highlight that actions are represented by unique profiles along several dimensions (see also refs.). We hypothesize that the unique profile of an observed action is compared to a range of reference profiles stored in long-term memory, and that a label is assigned to the observed action based on the reference profile that resulted in the highest similarity with the profile of the observed action. Note that while some of the dimensions obtained in the current study may seem categorical (e.g. mouth and food), the dimensions revealed by the modeling procedure reflected graded responses, enabling us to quantify the degree to which these dimensions are expressed in dynamic actions. As we will discuss in more detail in the following section, this property has important implications for future lines of research.

### Clinical trials of potential cognitive-enhancing drugs in schizophrenia: what have we learned so far? [^111L5WJw]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Our analysis included 118 studies that satisfied inclusion criteria.

Terminated Trials

We identified 11 terminated trials (6 add-on, placebo-controlled double-blind trials; 1 cross-sectional prospective add-on trial; 1 open-label trial; and 3 monotherapy trials) (see online). The MCCB, was the primary outcome measure in 3 trials; the neuropsychological assessments varied across the remainder of the terminated trials. Two trials were terminated due to difficulties with recruitment, 1 trial at the sponsor's request due to adverse animal toxicology data, 4 trials due to a lack of any apparent clinical benefit, and the sponsor of 1 trial closed their neuroscience program. The results of the last trial are being analyzed by an academic consortium (Keefe, personal communication). For the remaining trials, the sponsor terminated the study prior to recruitment start without providing any reasons for the decision, in 1 trial, the compound was withdrawn from the market in European Union, and for 1 trial, no information was provided. We will not discuss terminated studies in any further detail in this article.

Completed and Ongoing Trials

Trial Design.

A randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled add-on design was recommended by the MATRICS paneland is the primary design used in CIAS trials (55.7% of all completed and 63.9% of all ongoing trials) (figure 2). Crossover or monotherapy trials were less frequent, possibly due to the concern of the utility of crossover study designs in cognition studiesand the lack of a clear regulatory path to obtaining approval for a monotherapy that would also treat cognitive impairment in schizophrenia.

Fig. 2.
Trial designs used in completed and ongoing trials.

Mechanisms of Action Studied.

The studies included many pharmacological treatments with diverse pharmacological mechanisms of action (MoA) (see online). The following MoAs have been or are currently being examined in 2 or more studies: NMDA receptor modulation, NMDA glycine site agonism/partial agonism, NMDA glycine site antagonism, H3 antagonism, selective activation of hypothalamic regions associated with wakefulness noradrenergic receptor reuptake inhibition, acetylcholine esterase inhibitors, α 7 receptors agonism/partial agonism, α4β 2 nicotinic receptors partial agonism, cannabinoid receptor antagonism, D2 partial agonism + 5-HT 2A antagonism, and D 1 /D 2 agonism. Agents acting at the NMDA receptor were the most frequently examined class of agents.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^114C1Ugz]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

For patients with CVT planning to continue anticoagulation indefinitely, should thrombophilia testing be performed to guide treatment duration?

Recommendation 8

For patients with CVT who have completed primary treatment in a setting where anticoagulation would be continued indefinitely, the ASH guideline panel s uggests not to perform thrombophilia testing to guide anticoagulant treatment duration (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence about effects ⊕○○○).

Remarks:

- A strategy with testing for thrombophilia would mean that patients with thrombophilia would receive indefinite anticoagulant treatment, and patients without thrombophilia would stop anticoagulant treatment.
- This recommendation refers to testing for hereditary and acquired types of thrombophilia.
- This recommendation addresses settings where the standard of care for patients with CVT is indefinite anticoagulant treatment; the ASH guideline panel provides a separate recommendation for settings where the standard of care is stopping anticoagulant treatment (recommendation 7).

### Effect of recanalization on clinical outcomes in patients with cerebral venous thrombosis-an ambispective study [^113V8Rsd]. European Journal of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Achieving complete recanalization has possible but unproven benefits in cerebral venous/sinus thrombosis (CVST). We reported a cohort of patients with CVST and assessed the factors associated with recanalization and its effect on outcomes.

Methods

We included 123 patients with CVST in this single-center, ambispective, observational study from October 2018 to November 2019. We noted their demographic, clinical, and radiological features, modified Rankin scale (mRS), recanalization status, and the presence of any recurrences while having periodic follow-ups every three months for one year or until complete recanalization, whichever was earlier.

Results

Out of the 123 patients enrolled, we completed the etiological evaluation in 122 and assessed the outcome at discharge in 120. One (0.8%) patient went against medical advice, 2 (1.6%) died in the hospital, and 8 (6.5%) were lost to follow-up at various time points. The majority of the patients were males (75 [60.98%]). Thrombophilia (71 [58.2%]) and hematological conditions (51[41.8%]) were the predominant risk factors for CVST. The majority (107 [95.5%] at three months) of the patients had an mRS of 0–1. Eighty-one (67.5%) and 26 (21.7%) patients attained complete and partial recanalization at their last follow-up, respectively. Involvement of transverse and sigmoid sinus was an independent predictor of poor recanalization (Odds Ratio [OR] {Confidence Intervals [CI]} - 0.2 (0.04–0.7); p = 0.01). Moreover, failure to achieve at least partial recanalization (OR [CI] - 94 [6.8–1296]; p = 0.01) and undergoing a decompression craniectomy (OR [CI] - 26.4 [1.2–582]) were the only factors that independently predicted poor functional outcomes in our cohort.

Conclusion

Most of the patients with CVST had favorable outcomes. Recanalization was a strong predictor of good functional outcomes. Therefore, recanalization status should be considered while deciding when to stop the anticoagulation. However, we found no differences in the outcomes between those who achieved partial and complete recanalization.

### Expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents: summary report [^113kmrLa]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

The pathway to recommending clinical practice–based prevention — direct randomization of young individuals to treat cardiovascular (CV) risk factors versus no treatment with long-term follow-up to determine whether CV events are prevented is described as attractive but unachievable; therefore an alternate stepwise evidence chain is used, linking studies from risk beginning before birth, to risk acquisition during childhood, to risk modification by reduction strategies, and finally to clinical disease in adulthood, with studies examining single links, connecting links, or evaluating specific interventions for risk-benefit analysis. The remaining evidence links assess whether interventions have health benefit and whether risks and costs are outweighed by reductions in CVD morbidity and mortality, with best evidence from randomized trials showing event reduction in adults, randomized trials in children showing risk reduction with change in subclinical measures of atherosclerosis or target organ damage and patient safety, genetic studies, and long-term observational studies demonstrating benefit of maintaining low risk on health and all-cause mortality.

### Varenicline tartrate (Chantix) [^1153uqay]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Following the CVD study, a meta-analysis of 15 clinical trials of ≥ 12 weeks treatment duration, including 7002 patients (4190 CHANTIX, 2812 placebo), was conducted to systematically assess the CV safety of CHANTIX. The study in patients with stable CV disease described above was included in the meta-analysis. There were lower rates of all-cause mortality (CHANTIX 6 [0.14%]; placebo 7 [0.25%]) and CV mortality (CHANTIX 2 [0.05%]; placebo 2 [0.07%]) in the CHANTIX arms compared with the placebo arms in the meta-analysis.

The key CV safety analysis included occurrence and timing of a composite endpoint of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE), defined as CV death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke. These events included in the endpoint were adjudicated by a blinded, independent committee. Overall, a small number of MACE occurred in the trials included in the meta-analysis, as described in Table 13. These events occurred primarily in patients with known CV disease.

The meta-analysis showed that exposure to CHANTIX resulted in a hazard ratio for MACE of 1.95 (95% confidence interval from 0.79 to 4.82) for patients up to 30 days after treatment; this is equivalent to an estimated increase of 6.3 MACE events per 1,000 patient-years of exposure. The meta-analysis showed higher rates of CV endpoints in patients on CHANTIX relative to placebo across different time frames and pre-specified sensitivity analyses, including various study groupings and CV outcomes. Although these findings were not statistically significant they were consistent. Because the number of events was small overall, the power for finding a statistically significant difference in a signal of this magnitude is low.

Additionally, a cardiovascular endpoint analysis was added to the postmarketing neuropsychiatric safety outcome study along with a non-treatment extension, [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Studies (14.10)].

### Challenges in returning results in a genomic medicine implementation study: the return of actionable variants empirical (RAVE) study [^116tUxqn]. NPJ Genomic Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Return of results

RoR began ~2 years after participant consent. Participants with neutral results (i.e. no actionable variants identified) were notified of their results by postal mail (except for 103 participants who received results from a study GC as part of an ancillary study) but had the option of speaking with the study team or a GC by telephone to discuss their results. Sequencing reports were scanned into the EHR and an Epic® in-basket message summarizing the results was sent to PCPs.

Participants with actionable results were mailed a letter stating that RAVE-sequencing results were available and that the participant should contact the study team to schedule an appointment with a GC. The original protocol allowed up to three mailed letters to schedule appointments; however, the study team was granted IRB approval for a fourth, more strongly worded contact letter to motivate participants who had not responded to the initial three letters to contact the study team. In addition, the protocol for mailed contact was modified during the study to enable the use of certified mail to track the receipt of study contact materials. Participants with actionable results who did not respond to four contact attempts were considered to be non-responders. Results for nonresponders were placed in the EHR and the participant's PCP or a medical provider determined to be the most contextually appropriate was notified of the result via an Epic® in-basket message. One of the three study GCs disclosed results to each participant who responded. Genetic counseling included a brief summary of the study, education about sequencing results, potential implications for medical management, risks to family members, and referral to an appropriate specialist or department for further clinical management. Participants who resided in a state where study GCs had licensure were eligible to receive results from the GC over the telephone.

Placement of genomic results in the EHR

Sequencing results were reported to the study team in multiple formats including PDF, HTML, JSON, and XML files templated on a schema developed by the eMERGE network based on Health Level 7 version 2 Genetic Test Results standards. XML files were used to generate messages for PCPs based on sequencing results. Messages were reviewed and personalized by study GCs before transmittal to the PCP.

### Patient-reported outcome monitoring during trastuzumab… [^112csRRx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

The primary end point was analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. The least-squares mean was estimated by including the categorical effects of treatment, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as well as the fixed covariates of the baseline EORTC QLQ-C30 GHS score as the fixed effect in the mixed-effects model for repeated measures. EORTC QLQ-C30 and PRO-CTCAE response rates remained high across the observation period. Throughout 24 weeks, the EORTC QLQ-C30 response rate was 99. 6% in the monitoring group and
94. 8% in the usual care group. Both the PRO-CTCAE response rate and daily vital sign reporting rates were 94. 9% in the monitoring group. Of 1230 weekly PRO-CTCAE assessments completed in the monitoring group, 221 generated alerts. In addition, 210 alerts were generated from 8211 daily vital sign entries. Of the 431 alert notifications generated through 24 weeks, 154 were considered for patient contact, of which physicians responded to 132. A flowchart summarizing the actions taken in response to alert notifications throughout the 24-week period and entire observation duration is provided in eFigure 3 in Supplement
2. At 24 weeks, the change from baseline in least-squares mean EORTC QLQ-C30 scores crossed the minimal important difference, showing significant deterioration in QOL in the usual care group vs the monitoring group, with a mean difference of 8. 0 between the groups. First, regular reporting of symptoms might enhance patients' self-management abilities. 28 Second, the monitoring group maintained a consistently high PRO-CTCAE response rate of approximately 90% throughout 24 weeks. Health care professionals responded to 85. 7% of the alerts generated, demonstrating effective symptom monitoring and management.

Third, our protocol required that symptom trends be displayed during consultations, which likely improved communication between physicians and patients. We believe that these elements together helped sustain QOL.
