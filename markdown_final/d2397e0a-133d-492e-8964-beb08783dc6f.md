---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ASA (aspirin) is an anticoagulant. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise pharmacologic definitions and how antithrombotic agents are classified. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action of ASA compared with anticoagulants. Next, I will review clinical practice patterns, trials, and guideline recommendations that separate these categories. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer and address potential sources of confusion to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Antithrombotic agents include two distinct classes: antiplatelet drugs (which inhibit platelet activation/aggregation) and anticoagulants (which inhibit coagulation factors in the clotting cascade). Wait, I should verify where aspirin sits in this taxonomy. Authoritative sources consistently classify aspirin as an antiplatelet agent, not an anticoagulant, whereas warfarin, heparins, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are anticoagulants [^112Qn4i5] [^116msPyw] [^112XttMP].

> I need to check the mechanism next. Aspirin irreversibly acetylates a serine residue on platelet cyclooxygenase-1, suppressing thromboxane A2 biosynthesis and thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation for the platelet's lifespan; that's quintessential antiplatelet pharmacology, not inhibition of factor Xa or thrombin as seen with anticoagulants. Hold on, I should verify the mechanistic contrast: anticoagulants target elements of the coagulation cascade (e.g., factor Xa, thrombin, or vitamin K–dependent factor synthesis), which is mechanistically distinct from platelet COX-1 blockade by aspirin [^116BGbim] [^1123fTDT] [^113rmaeK].

> Next, I should review real-world and regulatory patterns to ensure practice aligns with classification. Let me verify how these drugs are co-used: labels and observational data consistently note increased bleeding when aspirin is combined with anticoagulants, underscoring distinct and additive effects rather than redundancy; for example, apixaban's label shows higher bleeding with concomitant aspirin, and hospital discharge cohorts often include combination aspirin plus anticoagulation, managed as separate classes with cumulative bleeding risk, which would be unnecessary if aspirin were itself an anticoagulant [^111kmgtt] [^113hqMuX] [^113Wjccq].

> I will now examine whether comparative trials treat aspirin and anticoagulants as interchangeable or distinct. Trials such as AVERROES (apixaban vs aspirin in AF), ASPECT-2, and ESPRIT explicitly compare aspirin against oral anticoagulation (or their combination) as separate strategies, reinforcing that aspirin is not considered an anticoagulant in study design or interpretation. Wait, let me double-check the directions of benefit: in AF populations unsuitable for warfarin, apixaban outperformed aspirin; in post-ACS and cerebrovascular populations, anticoagulation and aspirin were studied as different arms or combined, again emphasizing separate classes [^11152cqz] [^114emPtf] [^1176s7Kv].

> Guidelines should provide a final consistency check. The AHA/ASA and AAFP recommendations for atrial fibrillation prioritize oral anticoagulation (DOACs or warfarin) for stroke prevention rather than aspirin, reflecting that aspirin is not an anticoagulant; cardiology guidelines also detail when to add or withdraw aspirin alongside oral anticoagulation after PCI, which only makes sense if these are distinct drug classes; neurology guidance for intracranial atherosclerotic disease similarly distinguishes scenarios where anticoagulation is not favored over aspirin unless otherwise indicated [^113EFB3o] [^111ofyM9] [^1132StHX] [^115wvemD].

> But wait, what if someone notes aspirin is sometimes used for VTE prophylaxis after arthroplasty and concludes it behaves like an anticoagulant? I should clarify that point. While aspirin can be used as an antithrombotic option for selected orthopedic patients and may be noninferior in certain contexts, its mechanism remains antiplatelet, and it is still classified separately from anticoagulants; that clinical acceptability in specific prophylaxis strategies does not reclassify its pharmacology [^111YCnZv] [^114Rmyfw] [^112XttMP].

> Synthesis: I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. No, ASA is not an anticoagulant; it is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits platelet COX-1 to reduce thromboxane A2–mediated aggregation. Anticoagulants, by contrast, inhibit components of the coagulation cascade. Both are antithrombotic and are sometimes combined for additive effect, but they are distinct in class, mechanism, indications, and guideline-directed use, which is consistently reflected in pharmacologic texts, clinical practice patterns, randomized trials, and professional guidelines [^112Qn4i5] [^116BGbim] [^112XttMP] [^113EFB3o].

---

No, ASA (aspirin) is **not an anticoagulant**; it is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking thromboxane A2 production [^116BGbim] [^112Qn4i5]. Anticoagulants such as warfarin, heparin, and DOACs **act on the coagulation cascade** to prevent fibrin clot formation, and are used for conditions like atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, and mechanical heart valves [^113EFB3o] [^11152cqz]. ASA is used for **arterial thrombosis prevention** (e.g. MI, stroke) and is not a substitute for anticoagulants in venous or cardioembolic disease [^112Qn4i5] [^1141Qzpv] [^11152cqz] [^112UEpPj].

---

## Mechanism of action

ASA **irreversibly acetylates platelet COX-1**, blocking thromboxane A2 and inhibiting aggregation for the platelet lifespan (7–10 days) [^116BGbim] [^112Qn4i5]. In contrast, anticoagulants **inhibit coagulation cascade factors** (e.g. thrombin, factor Xa), preventing fibrin clot formation [^113BvsjJ].

---

## Clinical indications

### ASA (antiplatelet agent)

ASA is **indicated for prevention of arterial thrombosis** (e.g. MI, ischemic stroke, peripheral arterial disease) [^112Qn4i5] [^1141Qzpv]. It is also a cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy in cardiovascular disease [^112Qn4i5] [^1132StHX].

---

### Anticoagulants

Anticoagulants are **indicated for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism** (VTE), atrial fibrillation-related stroke, and mechanical heart valve thrombosis [^111ofyM9] [^113EFB3o]. Examples include warfarin, heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, and edoxaban [^11152cqz].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **AF stroke prevention**: Anticoagulants are recommended for atrial fibrillation; ASA is not sufficient [^113EFB3o] [^11152cqz] [^113su7Tg].

- **VTE management**: Anticoagulants are preferred for VTE; ASA is not a substitute [^1168joFP] [^112UEpPj].

- **Arterial thrombosis**: ASA is recommended for arterial thrombosis prevention (e.g. MI, stroke) [^112Qn4i5] [^1151BAYW].

---

## Risks and benefits

### ASA (antiplatelet agent)

ASA **reduces arterial thrombotic events** (e.g. MI, ischemic stroke) [^112Qn4i5] [^1151BAYW]. It also increases bleeding risk, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding [^112Qn4i5] [^111Xd7gW] [^113tuesT].

---

### Anticoagulants

Anticoagulants are **effective for VTE, atrial fibrillation-related stroke, and mechanical heart valve thrombosis** [^113EFB3o] [^111ofyM9]. They also increase bleeding risk, including major bleeding [^111kmgtt].

## Summary table: ASA vs anticoagulants

| **Feature** | **ASA (antiplatelet)** | **Anticoagulants** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism | Inhibits platelet aggregation | Inhibits coagulation cascade |
| Indications | Arterial thrombosis (MI, stroke) | Venous thrombosis, AF stroke prevention, mechanical valves |
| Examples | Aspirin | Warfarin, heparin, DOACs |
| Risks | Bleeding (GI) | Bleeding (major) |

### Does aspirin prevent venous thromboembolism [^1168joFP]. Hematology, American Society of Hematology Education Program (2020). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE; deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism) is a well-established cause of morbidity and mortality in the medical and surgical patient populations. Clinical research in the prevention and treatment of VTE has been a dynamic field of study, with investigations into various treatment modalities ranging from mechanical prophylaxis to direct oral anticoagulants. Aspirin has long been an inexpensive cornerstone of arterial vascular disease therapy, but its role in the primary or secondary prophylaxis of VTE has been debated.

Risk-benefit tradeoffs between aspirin and anticoagulants have changed, in part due to advances in surgical technique and postoperative care, and in part due to the development of safe, easy-to-use oral anticoagulants. We review the proposed mechanisms in which aspirin may act on venous thrombosis, the evidence for aspirin use in the primary and secondary prophylaxis of VTE, and the risk of bleeding with aspirin as compared with anticoagulation.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, particularly in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), anticoagulation therapy is recommended. According to the AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines, oral anticoagulation should be initiated to reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Recommended anticoagulants include apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin. It is advised to start oral anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of recurrent stroke regardless of the AF pattern, whether paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent.

### Overview of aspirin and platelet biology [^112Qn4i5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) has historically been one of the most important drugs in cardiology and has long been the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy. Although its role in acute coronary syndrome remains undisputed, emerging data suggest that a reappraisal of the efficacy of long-term ASA in some primary and secondary prevention may be warranted. This review aims to place these new results in the context of previous evidence by appraising the body of evidence on its use for cardiovascular diseases.

- **History and pharmacology**: This overview first summarizes the discovery of aspirin, its pharmacology, and the concept of ASA resistance.

- **Primary and secondary prevention**: We recapitulate the evidence of ASA on primary and secondary prevention, starting from classical studies. This serves as an introductory background for examining the most recent clinical trials discussed in the rest of the supplement.

Although the benefit of ASA in acute coronary syndrome remains incontrovertible, emerging evidence challenges the universal need for primary prevention or lifelong treatment in secondary prevention for all adults with stable coronary disease at high risk for ASA-induced bleeding. The role of aspirin is rapidly changing, and this review provides a comprehensive discussion for clinicians about the role of this drug in cardiovascular care.

### The role of aspirin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^113su7Tg]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of stroke and thromboembolism, resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality. For the majority of patients with AF, aspirin has a limited role in stroke prevention, being an inferior strategy and not necessarily safer than the anticoagulant warfarin, especially in the elderly. Novel oral anticoagulant drugs, such as oral direct thrombin inhibitors and oral factor Xa inhibitors, might further diminish the role of aspirin for stroke prevention in AF.

Nonetheless, aspirin use should continue in the early stages following presentation of a patient with AF and acute coronary syndrome, and after stenting, in combination with oral anticoagulant drugs and clopidogrel, as appropriate. Notably, aspirin combined with clopidogrel shows only modest benefit in stroke prevention compared with aspirin monotherapy in patients with AF who refuse oral anticoagulant drugs (including warfarin), or in those individuals who have difficulties in anticoagulation monitoring, and can be used where bleeding risk is not excessive.

The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

If the 75% threshold was reached and provided the certainty of the evidence was moderate or high, panel members intended to discuss and vote on the strength of recommendation (strong vs. conditional). If 75% of the members voted for strong, the recommendation would begin with "we recommend that… " Strong recommendations imply that most informed patients would choose the recommended course of action, and clinicians should provide it to most patients. If less than 75% of the members voted for strong, the recommendation would be considered conditional and began with the words "we suggest that… " Conditional recommendations indicate that most individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, although others might not. Clinicians should help each patient make decisions consistent with their risks, values, and preferences, ideally using decision aids. Recommendations with low or very low certainty of evidence were designated as conditional by default (without voting on the strength), although such recommendations could have still been considered strong if they fulfilled criteria for one of the four "paradigmatic situations".

A search of contemporary studies and recent systematic reviews was also performed and detailed in the evidence profile to inform the panel deliberations concerning the preferences of providers and patients for a cardiovascular event vs. a gastrointestinal bleeding event (see Appendix 2, Supplementary Digital Content, pages 3–6).

Each voting panel member, including the two co-chairs, prepared a draft for designated sections after the voting videoconference.

### Intermediate-dose anticoagulation, aspirin, and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19: A propensity score-matched analysis [^111DyZAT]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Low credibility.

Thrombotic complications occur at high rates in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, yet the impact of intensive antithrombotic therapy on mortality is uncertain. We examined in-hospital mortality with intermediate- compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation and separately with in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy, in a large, retrospective study of 2,785 hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients. In this analysis, we established two separate, nested cohorts of patients who (a) received intermediate- or prophylactic-dose anticoagulation ("anticoagulation cohort", N = 1,624) or (b) were not on home antiplatelet therapy and received either in-hospital aspirin or no antiplatelet therapy ("aspirin cohort", N = 1,956). To minimize bias and adjust for confounding factors, we incorporated propensity score matching and multivariable regression utilizing various markers of illness severity and other patient-specific covariates, yielding treatment groups with well-balanced covariates in each cohort. The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

Among propensity score-matched patients in the anticoagulation cohort (N = 382), in a multivariable regression model, intermediate- compared to prophylactic-dose anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death (hazard ratio 0.518 [0.308–0.872]). Among propensity score-matched patients in the aspirin cohort (N = 638), in a multivariable regression model, in-hospital aspirin compared to no antiplatelet therapy was associated with a significantly lower cumulative incidence of in-hospital death.

### Drug insight: aspirin resistance — fact or fashion [^116Lk9he]. Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The term aspirin resistance has been increasingly used in clinical studies. The aim of this review is to analyze the origin of this term, discuss the biochemical, functional, and clinical correlates of the phenomenon, and offer a conceptual framework to redefine the major determinants of variability between individuals in response to aspirin. Awareness needs to be increased regarding factors that might interfere with the desired antiplatelet effect of aspirin, particularly in terms of patients' adherence to treatment and avoidable drug interactions with some traditional NSAIDs. Gaining such knowledge could result in improved care of patients and might prevent the requesting of unnecessary platelet function tests of unproven clinical significance.

### Medium intensity oral anticoagulants versus aspirin after cerebral ischaemia of arterial origin (ESPRIT): a randomised controlled trial [^1176s7Kv]. The Lancet Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Oral anticoagulants are better than aspirin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction and after cerebral ischaemia in combination with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. The European/Australasian Stroke Prevention in Reversible Ischaemia Trial (ESPRIT) aimed to determine whether oral anticoagulation with medium intensity is more effective than aspirin in preventing future vascular events in patients with transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin.

- **Methods**: In this international, multicentre trial, patients were randomly assigned within 6 months following a transient ischaemic attack or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin to either anticoagulants (target INR range 2.0–3.0; n = 536) or aspirin (30–325 mg daily; n = 532). The primary outcome was the composite of death from all vascular causes, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or major bleeding complication, whichever occurred first. In a post hoc analysis, anticoagulants were compared with the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole (200 mg twice daily). Treatment was open, but auditing of outcome events was blinded. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered as an International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial (number ISRCTN73824458) and with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00161070).

- **Findings**: The anticoagulants versus aspirin comparison of ESPRIT was prematurely ended because ESPRIT reported previously that the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole was more effective than aspirin alone. Mean follow-up was 4.6 years (SD 2.2).

### Hemorrhage in patients with polycythemia vera receiving aspirin with an anticoagulant: A prospective, observational study [^115qt71B]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage. Aspirin, recommended for primary thromboprophylaxis, is often combined with anticoagulants during the management of acute thrombotic events. The safety of dual antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is not established in PV. In a prospective, observational study, 2,510 patients with PV were enrolled at 227 sites in the United States. Patients were monitored for the development of hemorrhage and thrombosis after enrollment.

A total of 1,602 patients with PV received aspirin with a median follow-up of 2.4 years (range, 0–3.6 years). The exposure-adjusted rate of all hemorrhages in patients receiving aspirin alone was 1.40 per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99–1.82). The combination of aspirin plus anticoagulant was associated with an incidence of hemorrhage of 6.75 per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 3.04–10.46). The risk of hemorrhage was significantly greater in patients receiving the combination of aspirin and anticoagulant compared with aspirin alone (total hemorrhages, hazard ratio [HR]: 5.83; 95% CI: 3.36–10.11; P < 0.001).

- **Platelet count**: Patients with a platelet count over 600×10⁹/L were associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage (HR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.16–4.38; P = 0.02). Rates of hemorrhage were similar for aspirin in combination with warfarin or direct-acting oral anticoagulants.

We conclude that the combination of aspirin and anticoagulants is associated with a significantly increased risk of hemorrhage in patients with PV.

- **Thrombocytosis**: Elevated platelet counts (> 600×10⁹/L) were associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage (HR: 2.25; 95% CI: 1.16–4.38; P = 0.02).

The rates of hemorrhage were similar for aspirin in combination with warfarin or direct-acting oral anticoagulants. We conclude that the combination of aspirin and anticoagulants is associated with a significantly increased risk of hemorrhage in patients with PV.

### Impact of acetylsalicylic acid in patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm surgery - Should the neurosurgeon really worry about it [^116BGbim]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

Low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is recommended as preventive treatment for many disorders, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, as well as for patients receiving percutaneous coronary or carotid artery stenting to prevent stent thrombosis. Additionally, many patients suffering from atrial fibrillation use aspirin or other anticoagulant therapies for stroke prevention.

By transferring its acetyl group to a serine residue in the platelet cyclooxygenase receptor, ASA irreversibly inhibits platelet function. It prevents the formation of thromboxane A2 and subsequently the aggregation of platelets for their entire lifecycle (7–10 days). The inhibition of platelet function occurs even at lower dosages. Abrupt interruption of ASA use may lead to hypercoagulability, which is associated with some major adverse cardiovascular events that have been reported.

ASA has been proven as a major risk factor for the development of postoperative hemorrhage following neurosurgical procedures. Because postoperative rebleeding is frequently a life-threatening complication after intracranial operations, ASA is usually discontinued seven days or more prior to elective intracranial procedures.

- **Assessing risks**: Weighing the risks of perioperative hemorrhage and cardiovascular complications in patients using ASA is a challenging task in daily neurosurgical routine. Yet, only a very limited number of studies have evaluated the risk of ASA discontinuation or continuation before and after neurosurgical treatment. There are a limited number of studies that have shown worse outcomes.

### 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI guideline for coronary artery revascularization: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111eDgoE]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for coronary artery disease, and more specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, the ACC/AHA/SCAI 2022 guidelines recommend discontinuing aspirin therapy after 1–4 weeks. This is while maintaining P2Y12 inhibitors in addition to a non-vitamin K oral anticoagulant (OAC) such as rivaroxaban, dabigatran, apixaban, or edoxaban, or warfarin, to reduce the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and taking OACs.

### Association of aspirin with prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients after total knee arthroplasty compared with other anticoagulants: A noninferiority analysis [^111YCnZv]. JAMA Surgery (2019). High credibility.

There has been significant debate in the surgical and medical communities regarding the appropriateness of using aspirin alone for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis following total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

The objective was to determine the acceptability of aspirin alone versus anticoagulant prophylaxis for reducing the risk of postoperative VTE in patients undergoing TKA.

This was a noninferiority study of a retrospective cohort of TKA cases submitted to the Michigan Arthroplasty Registry Collaborative Quality Initiative at 29 member hospitals. These ranged from small community hospitals to large academic and nonacademic medical centers in Michigan. The study included 41,537 patients who underwent primary TKA between April 1, 2013, and October 31, 2015, with clinical events monitored for 90 days after surgery. Data were analyzed between September and October 2016.

The exposures were the method of pharmacologic prophylaxis: neither aspirin nor anticoagulants for 668 patients (1.6%), aspirin only for 12,831 patients (30.9%), anticoagulant only (e.g. low-molecular-weight heparin, warfarin, and Xa inhibitors) for 22,620 patients (54.5%), and both aspirin/anticoagulant for 5,418 patients (13.0%). Most patients were also using intermittent pneumatic compression stockings.

The main outcome and measures were the primary composite outcome, which was the first occurrence of VTE or death. The noninferiority margin was specified as 0.3, and the secondary outcome was bleeding events.

Of the 41,537 patients, 14,966 were men (36%), and the mean age was 65.8 years. A VTE event occurred within the monitoring period.

### Aspirin and coumadin after acute coronary syndromes (the ASPECT-2 study): a randomised controlled trial [^114emPtf]. Lancet (2002). High credibility.

Antiplatelet treatment with aspirin and oral anticoagulants reduces recurrence of ischaemic events after myocardial infarction. We aimed to investigate which of these drugs is more effective in the long term after acute coronary events, and whether the combination of aspirin and oral anticoagulants offers greater benefit than either of these agents alone, without excessive risk of bleeding.

- **Methods**: In a randomised open-label trial in 53 sites, we randomly assigned 999 patients to low-dose aspirin, high-intensity oral anticoagulation, or combined low-dose aspirin and moderate-intensity oral anticoagulation. Patients were followed up for a maximum of 26 months. The primary composite endpoint was the first occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death.

- **Findings**: The primary endpoint was reached in 31 (9%) of 336 patients on aspirin, 17 (5%) of 325 on anticoagulants (hazard ratio 0.55 [95% CI 0.30–1.00], p = 0.0479), and 16 (5%) of 332 on combination therapy (0.50 [0.27–0.92], p = 0.03). Major bleeding was recorded in three (1%) patients on aspirin, three (1%) on anticoagulants (1.03 [0.21–5.08], p = 1.0), and seven (2%) on combination therapy (2.35 [0.61–9.10], p = 0.2). The frequency of minor bleeding was 5%, 8% (1.68 [0.92–3.07], p = 0.20), and 15% (3.13 [1.82–5.37], p = < 0.0001) in the three groups, respectively. A total of 164 patients permanently discontinued the study drug. Analyses were done by intention to treat.

- **Interpretation**: In patients recently admitted with acute coronary events, treatment with high-intensity oral anticoagulants or aspirin with medium-intensity oral anticoagulants offers varying levels of effectiveness and risk profiles.

### Low adherence to national guidelines for proton-pump inhibitor prescription in patients receiving combination aspirin and anticoagulation [^113hqMuX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Results**

- **Patient characteristics**: A total of 2,422 patients were discharged on combination aspirin and anticoagulation during this 5-year period. The median age was 69 years, 53.2% were male, 42.7% were white, 21.3% were Spanish speaking, and 42% were married. A proportion of 9.3% of patients had Medicaid as their primary insurance, while 22.5% had Medicare insurance. The median length of hospital admission was 6 days.

A total of 1,958 (80.8%) patients were discharged on an aspirin dose of 81 mg, and 414 (17.1%) were prescribed 325 mg. In the remaining 50 (2.06%) patients, the aspirin dose was not specified in the discharge medication list. A total of 1,179 (48.7%) patients were discharged on oral anticoagulation therapy, 705 (29.1%) were prescribed parenteral anticoagulation, and 538 (22.2%) were prescribed both oral and parenteral anticoagulation at discharge as a bridge to oral anticoagulation.

The most common anticoagulants prescribed at discharge were warfarin (56.5%), enoxaparin (49.9%), and rivaroxaban (12.9%). In addition, 435 (18.0%) of these patients were discharged on antiplatelet therapy, 472 (19.5%) on corticosteroid therapy, and 76 (3.14%) on both antiplatelet and corticosteroid therapy.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^114vZKHh]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

The ESC 2023 guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes recommend considering the administration of aspirin plus clopidogrel for more than one week and up to one month in patients treated with oral anticoagulation who have high ischemic risk, or in those with other anatomical or procedural characteristics that are judged to outweigh the bleeding risk, particularly in the case of ST-elevation myocardial infarction with revascularization.

### Antithrombotic agents and invasive procedures — hematologist point of view [^1174kuJA]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

The management of a patient treated with an antithrombotic agent who requires an invasive procedure remains challenging. There are antidotes neither for the antiplatelet agents nor the new anticoagulants. A good knowledge of the basic pharmacology of these drugs and the help of a hematologist within a multidisciplinary approach are essential. The potential interest of laboratory tests, the use of reversal agents, and the transfusion of plasma and platelets will be discussed.

### Aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in people with diabetes: A position statement of the American Diabetes Association, a scientific statement of the American Heart Association, and an expert consensus document of the American College of Cardiology Foundation [^114mq2QH]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Development of reliable surrogate testing for platelet reactivity and response to antiplatelet therapies would be helpful in the management of patients for whom concerns have been raised about aspirin resistance, such as those with diabetes. Such testing could also allow more precise determination of the dose-response relationship for aspirin in patients both with and without diabetes and better inform the design of large outcomes studies. However, while some encouraging epidemiologic and retrospective data exist for methods of surrogate platelet testing for aspirin, these data lack sufficient rigor to inform clinical decision-making, particularly in the setting of primary prevention.

### Eliquis [^111kmgtt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents**: Coadministration of antiplatelet agents, fibrinolytics, heparin, aspirin, and chronic NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding. The APPRAISE-2 study, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Eliquis in high-risk, post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with Eliquis compared to placebo. The rate of ISTH major bleeding was 2.8% per year with Eliquis versus 0.6% per year with placebo in patients receiving single antiplatelet therapy and was 5.9% per year with Eliquis versus 2.5% per year with placebo in those receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.

- **Concomitant use in ARISTOTLE trial**: In the ARISTOTLE trial, concomitant use of aspirin increased the bleeding risk on Eliquis from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year, and the concomitant use of aspirin and warfarin increased the bleeding risk from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year. In this clinical trial, there was limited (2.3%) use of dual antiplatelet therapy with Eliquis.

### Aspirin therapy on prophylactic anticoagulation for patients hospitalized with COVID-19: A propensity score-matched cohort analysis of the HOPE-COVID-19 registry [^113JDXhb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

After excluding patients who did not receive any anticoagulation and/or aspirin, and those who received therapeutic anticoagulation, 3,309 patients were included in the study. Three hundred sixty (4.6%) patients received prophylactic anticoagulation (PAC) and aspirin, while 2,949 (37.6%) received only PAC.

Patients treated with PAC and aspirin were older (73 ± 11 versus 64 ± 16 years, P = 0.01) and had a higher prevalence of male sex (69% versus 58%, P = 0.01). They also showed a higher prevalence of comorbidities such as diabetes (38% versus 19%, P = 0.01), hypertension (81% versus 45%, P = 0.01), and a history of cardiovascular disease (66% versus 13%, P = 0.01).

Through propensity score matching, the analysis was restricted to 596 patients: 298 (out of 360, 83%) treated with PAC and aspirin, and 298 (out of 2,949, 10%) with only PAC. The mean age was 73 ± 11 years, with 66% to 67% being male. The prevalence of hypertension and diabetes was 79% and 33% to 35% respectively, and 7% underwent invasive ventilation. The cumulative mortality incidence was lower at hospital discharge in the PAC and aspirin group compared to PAC alone (15% versus 21%, Log Rank P = 0.012).

### Challenging the FDA black box warning for high aspirin dose with ticagrelor in patients with diabetes [^1123fTDT]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The claimed ticagrelor-ASA interaction states that ticagrelor plus low-dose ASA is beneficial, whereas increasing doses of ASA in combination with ticagrelor produces adverse effects. Ticagrelor, having nearly complete P2Y12 platelet receptor blockade, does not exhibit the added antiaggregatory benefit derived from ASA, in contrast to what is seen with clopidogrel. Moreover, it is postulated that the incomplete and variable P2Y12 blockade seen with clopidogrel derives more benefit from ASA with less display of adverse effects. This hypothesis distinguishes between ASA-mediated effects in platelets versus targeting endothelial cells in the vessel wall; that is, in platelets, ASA's inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 causes a decrease in thromboxane A2 formation, inhibiting platelet aggregation. However, at higher doses, ASA also blocks the COX-2– mediated production of the vasodilator prostacyclin, causing an increase in vascular resistance.

The PLATO sponsor conducted a study in anesthetized dogs in an attempt to show vascular effects secondary to inhibition of prostacyclin production. The study showed no difference between ticagrelor and ASA compared with clopidogrel and ASA combination or ASA alone when absolute blood flow was examined. The FDA records indicate that "there is no clear explanation why ASA's proposed inhibition of endothelial prostacyclin is able to outweigh ticagrelor's, but not clopidogrel's beneficial effects of thromboxane-A2 inhibition, platelet inhibition, and interactions with phosphodiesterase isoforms".

### The risk of venous thromboembolism with aspirin compared to anticoagulants after hip and knee arthroplasty [^111js91m]. Thrombosis Research (2017). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines include aspirin as an option to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) in selected patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery. However, the efficacy of aspirin after arthroplasty has not been well-defined, particularly in more contemporary patient populations. We compared rates of post-operative VTE between patients who received aspirin-only versus anticoagulants after hip or knee arthroplasty, using data from a large US-based administrative database.

- **Materials and methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 231,780 adults who underwent total knee arthroplasty and 110,621 who underwent total hip arthroplasty in 2009–2012 and who received pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (aspirin or anticoagulant) within the first 7 days after surgery. We compared the risk of post-operative VTE between patients receiving aspirin-only vs. anticoagulants, controlling for clinical and hospital characteristics using multivariable logistic regression with propensity score adjustment.

- **Results**: Aspirin-only prophylaxis was administered to 7.5% of patients after knee arthroplasty and 8.0% after hip arthroplasty. Post-operative VTE was diagnosed in 2,217 (0.96%) patients after knee arthroplasty and 454 (0.41%) after hip arthroplasty. Compared to anticoagulants, aspirin was not associated with a higher risk for post-operative VTE either after knee arthroplasty (adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval [OR] 0.34 [0.24–0.48]) or hip arthroplasty (OR 0.82 [0.45–1.51]).

- **Conclusions**: Aspirin was uncommonly administered as the sole prophylactic agent after hip and knee arthroplasty.

### Short- and long-term efficacy of aspirin and clopidogrel for thromboprophylaxis for mechanical heart valves: an in vivo study in swine [^113Eg55A]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

In the interest of exploring alternatives to warfarin, we tested the hypothesis that clopidogrel combined with aspirin is effective for thromboprophylaxis of mechanical valves using a swine model.

- **Methods**: Adult swine underwent heterotopic implantation of a modified bileaflet mechanical valved conduit bypassing the ligated, native descending thoracic aorta. Animals were randomized to no anticoagulation (n = 7), 175 U/kg dalteparin administered subcutaneously twice daily (n = 9), 325 mg of aspirin (n = 6), 75 mg of clopidogrel (n = 6), or 325 mg of aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (n = 6) and survived for 30 days. Additionally, 11 animals were randomized to no anticoagulation (n = 5) or 325 mg of oral aspirin and 75 mg of clopidogrel daily (n = 6) and survived for 150 days.

- **Results**: At 30 days, we observed 216 ± 270 mg of thrombus for the no anticoagulation group, 53 ± 91 mg for the dalteparin group, 33 ± 23 mg for the aspirin group, 25 ± 10 mg for the clopidogrel group, and 17 ± 9 mg for the combined aspirin and clopidogrel group, respectively (P < .01 for clopidogrel and aspirin vs no anticoagulation). At 150 days, we observed 223 ± 200 mg of thrombus for the no anticoagulation group and 4 ± 4 mg for the aspirin and clopidogrel group (P = 0.02). Mean platelet deposition on the valve was 4.1 × 10⁹ ± 3.6 × 10⁹ for the no anticoagulation and 6.81 × 10⁷ ± 1.4 × 10⁸ for the combined aspirin and clopidogrel groups, respectively (P = 0.03). No major hemorrhagic events were observed.

- **Conclusions**: Effective short- and long-term thrombopro…

### New anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents: A primer for the gastroenterologist [^112XttMP]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

A large number of patients worldwide receive anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, collectively known as antithrombotic agents. Several new anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents recently were approved for use. Gastroenterologists may be unfamiliar with the mechanism of action, indications for use, and pharmacokinetics of these newer drugs. In patients undergoing elective and urgent endoscopic procedures, clinicians must be familiar with these medications to optimize outcomes. When the decision is made to continue the newer antithrombotic agents for elective procedures, the clinician must understand the risk that these agents may impart on procedural-induced bleeding. Finally, it is important to understand how to manage these agents in the presence of acute gastrointestinal bleeding. In this article, the use of newer antithrombotic agents is reviewed.

### Narrative review: Aspirin resistance and its clinical implications [^117AkHU1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Aspirin is currently the most cost-effective drug for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, but treatment failures are relatively common. Several factors have been linked to these revascular events in patients prescribed aspirin, including smoking, drug interactions, nonadherence, comorbid conditions, and aspirin resistance. The term aspirin resistance describes not only an absence of the expected pharmacologic effects of aspirin on platelets but also poor clinical outcomes, such as revascular events, in patients treated with aspirin. Aspirin resistance is perhaps more precisely understood as the phenomenon of measurable, persisting platelet activation that occurs in patients prescribed a therapeutic dose of aspirin and may underlie an unknown proportion of aspirin treatment failures.

Key challenges for future research include standardizing a definition of aspirin resistance and comparing whether different measures of platelet activation, either alone or in combination, independently predict cardiovascular events. These challenges must be met before researchers conduct studies to assess the clinical utility of testing on patient outcomes and cost-effective prescribing.

### Anticoagulants versus antiplatelet agents for acute ischaemic stroke [^1151BAYW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet agents produce a small but worthwhile benefit in long-term functional outcome and survival and have become standard treatment for acute ischaemic stroke. Anticoagulants are often used as an alternative treatment, despite evidence that they are ineffective in producing long-term benefits. We wanted to review trials that have directly compared anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents to assess whether any anticoagulant regimen offers net advantages over antiplatelet agents overall or in some particular category of patients, such as patients with atrial fibrillation.

- **Objectives**:
	- To assess the effectiveness of anticoagulants compared with antiplatelet agents in acute ischaemic stroke and to determine whether the addition of anticoagulants to antiplatelet agents offers any net advantage over antiplatelet agents alone.

- **Search strategy**:
	- We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Central/CCTR), the trials register held by the Antithrombotic Therapy Trialists' Collaboration, MEDLINE (1966–2000), and EMBASE (1980–2000). All searches were performed during April and May 2001.

- **Selection criteria**:
	- Truly unconfounded, randomized controlled trials comparing anticoagulants with antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents with antiplatelet agents alone, given within 14 days of onset of presumed or confirmed ischaemic stroke.

- **Data collection and analysis**:
	- Both reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion in the review, assessed trial quality, and extracted data.

- **Main results**:
	- A total of…

### Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: Time for a platelet-guided approach [^1143fg8Y]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). Low credibility.

Aspirin has been widely studied for its role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Recent evidence suggests that a platelet-guided approach may enhance the efficacy of aspirin in this context. It is crucial to tailor aspirin therapy based on an individual's platelet response rather than applying a one-size-fits-all strategy. Integrating platelet function testing into routine clinical practice could potentially improve patient outcomes by identifying those who would benefit most from aspirin therapy while mitigating risks such as bleeding.

Further research is needed to validate the benefits of a platelet-guided approach and establish guidelines for its implementation in clinical settings. The need for such personalized approaches in cardiovascular prevention underscores the importance of advancing precision medicine in this field.

### Low-dose aspirin for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolism [^112UEpPj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). High credibility.

The ASPIRE study, published by Brighton TA and colleagues in 2012 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*, investigated the role of low-dose aspirin in patients who have had a first episode of unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) and possess a high risk of recurrence after the discontinuation of anticoagulants. The study focused on diseases such as pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis.

The ASPIRE study was a multi-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 822 patients, with a distribution of 375 females and 447 males. The inclusion criteria required patients to have completed initial anticoagulant therapy following a first episode of unprovoked VTE. Key exclusion criteria included a first unprovoked episode of VTE occurring more than two years prior to enrollment, any indication or contraindication for the use of aspirin, other antiplatelet therapies or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or any indication for continuing oral anticoagulation therapy. Additionally, any medical problems that would interfere with trial participation or limit life expectancy were grounds for exclusion.

- **Interventions**:
	- **Aspirin group**: 411 patients received 100 mg of aspirin PO once daily, for up to four years.
	- **Placebo group**: 411 patients received a matching placebo PO once daily, for up to four years.

- **Outcomes**:
	- **Primary Outcome**: No significant difference was found in the incidence of recurrent VTE (4.8% per year vs. 6.5% per year; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.05).
	- **Secondary Outcomes**: There was a significant decrease in the incidence of major vascular events (5.2% per year vs. 8% per year; HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.92).

### Anticoagulants: Major advances without clear consensus [^113BvsjJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Therapeutics for thrombosis were discovered because of observations made nearly one hundred years ago. The mainstays of these treatments have been either heparin or warfarin, with the latter being preferred for long-term anticoagulation. In the last six years, newer agents with anticoagulant activities have been approved for clinical use. These agents have advantages and disadvantages over warfarin, and consensus for their use is still being formed, as is the manner in which the more traditional agents, such as warfarin, should be used and monitored.

The primary objective of the study was to determine if ELIQUIS was superior to aspirin in preventing the composite outcome of stroke or systemic embolism. The study was stopped early based on a prespecified interim analysis, which demonstrated a significant reduction in stroke and systemic embolism for ELIQUIS compared to aspirin, with a modest increase in major bleeding [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Evolution of clinical thinking and practice regarding aspirin: What has changed and why [^112Q278A]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Aspirin (ASA) is the original antiplatelet agent. Its routine use, long unquestioned for both primary and secondary prevention in cardiovascular disease, is under increasing scrutiny as the risk-benefit balance for ASA becomes less clear and other disease- and risk-modifying approaches are validated. It can be viewed as a significant advance in evidence-based medicine that the use of an inexpensive, readily available, long-validated therapy is being questioned in large, rigorous trials. In this overview, we present the important questions surrounding a more informed approach to ASA therapy: duration of therapy, assessment of net clinical benefit, and timing of start and stop strategies. We also consider potential explanations for "breakthrough" thrombosis when patients are on ASA therapy. Other manuscripts in this Supplement address the specifics of primary prevention, secondary prevention, triple oral antithrombotic therapy, and the future of ASA in cardiovascular medicine.

### Hemorrhage in patients with polycythemia vera receiving aspirin with an anticoagulant: a prospective, observational study [^111SHPc3]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

Management of thrombotic events in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) is challenging. Although low-dose aspirin can effectively reduce the rate of thrombotic complications in polycythemia vera (PV), the optimal antithrombotic approach to secondary prevention is less clear. There are no randomized studies evaluating different antithrombotic regimens in patients with MPN, and thrombosis is common after the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation. Combined antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy is often prescribed in patients with MPN without knowledge of hemorrhagic risks.

In this large, prospective multicenter study, we evaluated whether the addition of aspirin to an anticoagulant increased the risk of hemorrhage in patients with PV. We observed that the combination of an anticoagulant with aspirin was associated with a greater than seven-fold increased risk of severe hemorrhage compared with aspirin alone.

Our observation that the combination of aspirin and an anticoagulant significantly increased the risk of hemorrhage aligns with the larger published experience evaluating the combination for cardiovascular indications. The Augustus trial recently reported rates of hemorrhagic outcomes in more than 4,600 patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions who were randomized to warfarin or apixaban plus aspirin or placebo. The risk of major hemorrhage was significantly higher in patients receiving aspirin plus an anticoagulant compared with an anticoagulant without aspirin (HR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.59–2.24; P < 0.001). There are limited published data on the safety of combined therapy in this context.

### Aspirin alone versus dual antiplatelet therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis [^112X18bu]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

In this patient-level meta-analysis of randomized trials investigating aspirin alone compared with aspirin with clopidogrel after TAVI in patients without a chronic indication for oral anticoagulation, aspirin alone was associated with a significant reduction of the composite of major and life-threatening bleeding or thromboembolic events, including all-cause mortality, major and life-threatening bleeding, stroke, or myocardial infarction, and major or life-threatening bleeding, compared with DAPT at 30 days and 3 months. Furthermore, aspirin alone, compared with DAPT, did not increase the incidence of the composite of thromboembolic events, such as all-cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction, at 30 days and 3 months.

### Influence of aspirin resistance on platelet function profiles in patients on long-term aspirin and clopidogrel after percutaneous coronary intervention [^115VJSgK]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Increased platelet inhibition is achieved when clopidogrel is added to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]). A broad variability in platelet inhibition profiles during the early phases of treatment has been demonstrated and may be attributed to ASA resistance. However, the influence of ASA sensitivity on platelet function profiles of patients on long-term dual antiplatelet therapy has yet to be explored. A total of 135 patients who had previously undergone percutaneous coronary intervention on long-term (> 1 month) ASA and clopidogrel therapy was included.

The PFA-100 system was used to define ASA resistance. Platelet aggregation, after adenosine diphosphate (6 and 20 micromol/L) and collagen (6 microg/ml) stimuli, and platelet activation (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa activation and P-selectin expression), after adenosine diphosphate (2 micromol/L) and thrombin receptor-activating peptide (50 micromol/L) stimuli, were assessed by light transmittance aggregometry and flow cytometry, respectively. Patient variability in response to treatment was defined by the coefficient of variability.

ASA resistance was found in 60 of 135 patients (44%). Patients with diabetes were more frequently ASA resistant. Collagen/epinephrine- and collagen/adenosine diphosphate-coated cartridges on the PFA-100 had shorter closure times in the ASA-resistant population compared with ASA-sensitive patients. Platelet aggregation and activation were significantly higher in ASA-resistant patients. A broad variability (coefficient of variation > 0.25) in patient response to treatment was observed in ASA-resistant patients.

Aspirin has potential benefits in cardiovascular primary prevention in diabetes, but these may be counterbalanced by an increased bleeding risk. There are suggestions of differential effects of aspirin on cardiovascular outcomes by treatment dosage and duration, as well as smoking status, but more data is required. The use of low-dose aspirin may need to be individualized and based on each individual's baseline cardiovascular disease and bleeding risk.

### Does acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) have a role in the prevention of venous thromboembolism [^111MR1TM]. British Journal of Haematology (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines differ on whether acetyl salicylic acid (ASA, aspirin) should be used for prophylaxis in patients at high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), principally because of differences in perceptions of its efficacy. ASA is an attractive therapeutic option because it is inexpensive, easy to administer, and does not require monitoring. We critically reappraised the evidence from randomized controlled trials for the efficacy of ASA in VTE prevention. ASA is clearly efficacious in preventing VTE compared to placebo or no treatment, but appears to be less efficacious than the low molecular weight heparins in small trials. There is little data for ASA in comparison with unfractionated heparin and warfarin. A large randomized controlled trial is required to clarify the role of ASA compared to contemporary anticoagulant strategies for the prevention of VTE.

### Hemorrhage in patients with polycythemia vera receiving aspirin with an anticoagulant: A prospective, observational study [^111Au98y]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

The risk of hemorrhage associated with the use of aspirin alone or in combination with anticoagulants was examined. Aspirin alone was associated with 1.4 hemorrhagic events per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 0.99–1.82), whereas the combination of aspirin with anticoagulation was associated with 6.75 hemorrhagic events per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 3.04–10.46). The cumulative incidence of hemorrhage at 3 years was 3.6% (95% CI: 2.64–4.84) for patients receiving aspirin alone and 19.8% (95% CI: 9.78–32.45) for those receiving it with an anticoagulant, as shown in Figure 1A.

The rate of severe hemorrhage was notably higher among those who received aspirin with an anticoagulant (1.46 events per 100 patient-years; 95% CI: 0–3.21) compared to those who received aspirin alone (0.49 events per 100 patient-years; 95% CI: 0.25–0.74). The cumulative incidence rate of severe hemorrhage at 3 years was 3.7% (95% CI: 0.96–9.50) for patients who had aspirin with an anticoagulant, and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.74–2.00) for patients who had aspirin alone, as shown in Figure 1B.

In a Cox proportional hazards model, the use of aspirin plus an anticoagulant was associated with a greater than 5-fold increased risk of hemorrhage compared with aspirin alone (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.83; 95% CI: 3.36–10.11; P < 0.001). The risk of severe hemorrhage was significantly increased with the combination of aspirin plus an anticoagulant compared with aspirin alone (HR: 7.49; 95% CI: 3.02–18.62; P < 0.001).

Based on the currently available evidence, aspirin appears to have a modest effect on cardiovascular events with a relative risk reduction of approximately 10%. The absolute decrease in events depends on the underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, meaning those with higher baseline risk should experience greater absolute benefit.

The main adverse effect of aspirin is an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The excess risk may range from 1 to 5 per 1,000 per year in real-world settings. In adults with a CVD risk greater than 1% per year, the number of CVD events prevented will likely be similar to or greater than the number of bleeding events induced. However, it is important to note that the events considered (myocardial infarction, stroke, and gastrointestinal bleeding) do not equally affect long-term health.

Recommendations have been developed based on these data.

### Hemorrhage in patients with polycythemia vera receiving aspirin with an anticoagulant: a prospective, observational study [^116w2r4E]. Haematologica (2022). Low credibility.

At the time of enrollment, 300 patients (18.7%) had a history of thrombosis with 157 arterial events and 164 venous thromboembolic events. During the follow-up period, 61 patients experienced a thrombotic event. A numerically higher proportion of patients receiving an anticoagulant plus aspirin experienced a thrombotic event compared with those on aspirin alone. The 3-year cumulative incidence of thrombosis (arterial or venous) was 4.8% (95% CI: 3.57–6.20). In a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as a two-level, time-dependent covariate (adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, history of thrombosis before enrollment), the use of aspirin with an anticoagulant was not associated with a lower rate of thrombosis compared with aspirin alone (HR: 1.97; 95% CI: 0.57–6.78; P = 0.28).

- **Cumulative incidence of hemorrhage**: The cumulative incidence of (A) any hemorrhage or (B) severe hemorrhage is shown for patients receiving aspirin plus anticoagulant (blue) and aspirin alone (green).

- **Risk factors for hemorrhage**: This section considers Cox proportional hazard ratios for risk factors contributing to hemorrhage in polycythemia vera.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, specifically with respect to anticoagulant therapy, the AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines indicate that there is insufficient evidence to recommend short-term anticoagulation in patients with non-occlusive, extracranial intraluminal thrombus in the setting of AIS.

### Concomitant aspirin and anticoagulation is associated with increased risk for major bleeding in surgical patients requiring postoperative intensive care [^114dTQa4]. Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Critically ill surgical patients may receive concomitant aspirin and therapeutic anticoagulation postoperatively, yet the safety of this practice remains unknown. We evaluated the risk of major bleeding with concomitant therapy compared with anticoagulation alone.

- **Design**: Observational cohort study. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to assess the association between concomitant therapy and a primary outcome of major bleeding.

- **Setting**: Postoperative ICUs at an academic medical center.

- **Patients**: Adults (≥ 18 years old) receiving anticoagulation during postoperative ICU admission between 2007 and 2016.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: Nine thousand five hundred eighteen anticoagulated patients were included, including 3,237 (34%) receiving aspirin. A total of 1,874 unique patients (19.7%) experienced a major bleeding event. In inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses, concomitant therapy was associated with increased odds for major bleeding (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05–1.36; p = 0.006) compared with anticoagulation alone. An interaction test suggested a differential relationship between aspirin use and major bleeding based on aspirin use in the 7 days prior to anticoagulation, such that a strong association between aspirin and major bleeding was observed for recent initiators of aspirin (1.40; 1.13–1.72; p = 0.002) but not for those continuing prior aspirin use. Aspirin use prior to anticoagulation did not modify the relationship between concomitant therapy and new myocardial infarction or stroke.

### Aspirin-free strategies in cardiovascular disease and cardioembolic stroke prevention [^111cpyeN]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

In patients with manifestations of cardiovascular disease, acetylsalicylic acid (popularly known as aspirin) has been the mainstay of treatment for decades due to its capacity to reduce the risk of ischemic events. Novel antithrombotic therapies have been traditionally tested against a background of acetylsalicylic acid therapy. Although the adjunctive use of such antithrombotic therapies can potentially further reduce the risk of ischemic events, these agents are also inevitably associated with an increased risk of bleeding. However, acetylsalicylic acid itself also increases the risk of bleeding, challenging the paradigm that this agent should remain the cornerstone of antiplatelet treatment when alternative antithrombotic agents are also used.

Many antithrombotic compounds are characterized by increased potency and consistent efficacy, which might lessen the need for concomitant acetylsalicylic acid. Accordingly, numerous investigations are testing the hypothesis that acetylsalicylic acid-sparing regimens, based on newer antithrombotic agents, might have an increased net benefit for individual patients due to the reduction in bleeding risk, without a trade-off in efficacy. This review summarizes the state of the art relating to antithrombotic approaches with and without acetylsalicylic acid for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and cardioembolic stroke. Discussion of the scientific rationale, from bench to bedside, for ongoing studies of acetylsalicylic acid-free pharmacological strategies is included.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: Antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116CzFgv]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

This guideline addresses the management of patients who are receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy and require an elective surgery or procedure.

- **Methods**: The methods discussed here follow those outlined in the "Methodology for the Development of Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis Guidelines: Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines" article of this supplement.

- **Results**:
	- In patients requiring vitamin K antagonist (VKA) interruption before surgery, we recommend stopping VKAs 5 days before surgery instead of a shorter time before surgery (Grade 1B).
	- In patients with a mechanical heart valve, atrial fibrillation, or VTE at high risk for thromboembolism, we suggest bridging anticoagulation instead of no bridging during VKA interruption (Grade 2C). For patients at low risk, we suggest no bridging instead of bridging (Grade 2C).
	- In patients who require a dental procedure, we suggest continuing VKAs with an oral prohemostatic agent or stopping VKAs 2 to 3 days before the procedure instead of alternative strategies (Grade 2C).
	- In moderate- to high-risk patients who are receiving acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and require noncardiac surgery, we suggest continuing ASA around the time of surgery instead of stopping ASA 7 to 10 days before surgery (Grade 2C).
	- In patients with a coronary stent who require surgery, we recommend deferring surgery more than 6 weeks after bare-metal stent placement and more than 6 months after drug-eluting stent placement instead of undertaking surgery sooner.

### Adjuvant therapeutic efficacy of low-dose aspirin on short-term outcomes of patients with cancer-associated venous thromboembolism [^1179aUKF]. BMC Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Major findings derived from the results were as follows:

- **For patients with cancer-associated VTE**: The joint use of low-dose aspirin and anticoagulants reduced 6-month VTE recurrence and PE-related mortality rates compared with the isolated use of anticoagulants.
- **On 6-month all-cause mortality rate or NCB**: The joint use of low-dose aspirin and anticoagulants did not improve the 6-month all-cause mortality rate or NCB compared with the isolated use of anticoagulants.
- **Regarding 6-month major bleeding rate**: The joint use of low-dose aspirin and anticoagulants raised the 6-month major bleeding rate compared with the isolated use of anticoagulants.

To our best knowledge, this is the first study conducted on this topic, as there have been no comparable studies so far.

Although the primary thromboprophylactic efficacy of aspirin on cancer patients had been extensively reported, its role in the treatment of cancer-associated VTE remained unclear before this study. In the ASPIRE study, the use of aspirin did not significantly reduce the rate of isolated VTE recurrence in patients with unprovoked VTE who had completed initial anticoagulant therapy. Nevertheless, since cancer patients accounted for merely 1.2% of all patients in the ASPIRE study, the findings cannot be fully extrapolated to patients with cancer-associated VTE.

The study suggested that aspirin exhibited certain short-term adjuvant therapeutic efficacy on the secondary prophylaxis of VTE recurrence and the improvement of PE-related mortality in patients with cancer-associated VTE when used in combination with anticoagulant agents. This may be attributed to two reasons.

### Aspirin versus anticoagulation for stroke prophylaxis in blunt cerebrovascular injury: A propensity-matched retrospective cohort study [^116FzR2n]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2021). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to compare the odds of stroke 24 hours or more after hospital arrival among patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) who were treated with therapeutic anticoagulation versus aspirin.

- **Methods**: The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study at a regional level I trauma center, including all patients with BCVI who were treated over a span of 10 years. Individuals with stroke on arrival or within the first 24 hours were excluded, as were those receiving alternative antithrombotic drugs or procedural treatment. Exact logistic regression was used to examine the association between treatment and stroke, adjusting for injury grade. To account for the possibility of residual confounding, propensity scores for the likelihood of receiving anticoagulation were determined and used to match patients from each treatment group; the difference in the probability of stroke between the two groups was then calculated.

- **Results**: A total of 677 patients with BCVI receiving aspirin or anticoagulation were identified. A total of 3.8% (n = 23) of 600 patients treated with aspirin sustained a stroke, compared to 11.7% (n = 9) of 77 receiving anticoagulation. After adjusting for injury grade with exact regression, anticoagulation was associated with a higher likelihood of stroke (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.00–8.21). In the propensity-matched analysis, patients who received anticoagulation had a 15.0% (95% CI 3.7%-26.3%) higher probability of sustaining a stroke compared to those receiving aspirin.

- **Conclusions**: Therapeutic anticoagulation may be inferior to aspirin for stroke prophylaxis in patients with blunt cerebrovascular injury.

### Low adherence to national guidelines for proton-pump inhibitor prescription in patients receiving combination aspirin and anticoagulation [^111Xd7gW]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence has long supported the use of low-dose aspirin, defined as 75–325 mg, in both primary and secondary treatment of cardiovascular disease. At low doses, aspirin irreversibly acetylates cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1), which blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 and inhibits platelet aggregation. This mechanism produces beneficial antithrombotic effects that help prevent acute cardiovascular events. Despite its clear role in cardiovascular disease prevention, aspirin has been shown to double the risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB), and the risk of GIB persists in people who take aspirin for more than 1 year. Aspirin is thought to promote gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal injury by blocking the COX-1 pathway depleting necessary prostaglandins that protect GI mucosa.

Patients who require aspirin for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease may also require anticoagulation such as warfarin, unfractionated heparin, or low molecular weight heparin for acute coronary syndrome, valvular, arrhythmic, or vascular indications. When anticoagulation therapy is used in combination with aspirin, the risk of clinically significant GIB increases further. Therefore, a tradeoff must be made between the benefits of cardiovascular disease prevention and the increased risk of GIB. Collaborative guidelines between the American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) Task Force, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), and the American Heart Association (AHA) have focused on combining goals of the cardiologist and gastroenterologist.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^113tuesT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules increase the risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding include the use of other drugs that increase bleeding risk, such as anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, heparin, anagrelide, fibrinolytic therapy, and the chronic use of NSAIDs [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

- **Intracranial hemorrhage**: In the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS2), the annualized event rate for intracranial hemorrhage was 0.39% per year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 0.26% per year in the extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) group, 0.24% per year in the aspirin (ASA) group, and 0.29% per year in the placebo groups.

- **Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects**: GI side effects include stomach pain, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, and gross GI bleeding. Although minor upper GI symptoms, such as dyspepsia, are common and can occur anytime during therapy, physicians should remain alert for signs of ulceration and bleeding, even in the absence of previous GI symptoms. Inform patients about the signs and symptoms of GI side effects and what steps to take if they occur. In ESPS2, the annualized event rate for gastrointestinal bleeding was 2.97% per year in the aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules group, 1.58% per year in the extended-release dipyridamole group, 2.06% per year in the aspirin group, and 1.40% per year in the placebo groups.

- **Peptic ulcer disease**: Avoid using aspirin in patients with a history of active peptic ulcer disease, which can cause gastric mucosal irritation and bleeding.

- **Alcohol warning**: Because aspirin

In our daily anaesthetic practice, we are confronted with an increasing number of patients treated with either antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents. Over the last decade, changes have occurred that make the handling of antithrombotic medication a challenging part of anaesthetic perioperative management. This review discusses the most important antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs, perioperative management, the handling of bleeding complications, and the interpretation of some laboratory analyses related to these agents.

### Bleeding risk of patients with acute venous thromboembolism taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin [^113Wjccq]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

The combined use of anticoagulant and aspirin therapy is associated with an increased bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation, but the bleeding risk of combined use of anticoagulant and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is poorly documented. This study's objective is to estimate the bleeding risk of combined anticoagulant (rivaroxaban or enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [VKA]) and NSAID or aspirin therapy in patients with venous thromboembolism.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A prospective analysis of observational data from the EINSTEIN deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism clinical trials, comparing rivaroxaban with enoxaparin-VKA treatment, was performed in hospitals and clinics on 8,246 patients enrolled from 2007 to 2009.

- **Exposure**: Bleeding event rates during exposure to NSAID and aspirin therapy were compared to the time without exposure.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Days of NSAID or aspirin use and nonuse, clinically relevant bleeding event and major bleeding event rates by patient-years, and hazard ratios were analyzed.

During NSAID-anticoagulant concomitant treatment, clinically relevant bleeding occurred with an event rate of 37.5 per 100 patient-years compared to 16.6 per 100 patient-years during anticoagulant use only (hazard ratio [HR], 1.77 [95% CI, 1.46–2.14]). Major bleeding during NSAID-anticoagulant treatment occurred with an event rate of 6.5 per 100 patient-years, compared to 2.0 per 100 patient-years during nonuse (HR, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.51–3.75]).

### Aspirin is a safe and effective thromboembolic prophylaxis after total knee arthroplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Rmyfw]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) are at high risk for thromboembolic events compared to non-surgical patients. Both anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are used as antithrombotic prophylaxis in TKA. The aim of this review is to understand the role of aspirin in the prevention of thromboembolic events and to compare its efficacy and safety with the main anticoagulants used in antithromboembolic prophylaxis in TKA.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. An electronic systematic search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Registry to evaluate studies that compared aspirin with other anticoagulants, in terms of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after TKA. The meta-analysis compared the rate of complications between aspirin and other anticoagulants.

Thirteen studies were included in the systematic review for a total of 163,983 patients, and 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis demonstrated no statistically significant differences between aspirin and other anticoagulants in terms of the rate of deep venous thrombosis (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.81–1.08, p = 0.35) and pulmonary embolism (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.56–1.41, p = 0.61).

In conclusion, aspirin is safe, effective, and not inferior to other main anticoagulants in preventing thromboembolic events following TKA.

### Aspirin therapy on prophylactic anticoagulation for patients hospitalized with COVID-19: A propensity score-matched cohort analysis of the HOPE-COVID-19 registry [^112r28R4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

- **Results: Baseline**: Between January 16, 2020, and May 30, 2020, 8,168 patients were included in the HOPE COVID‐19 registry. After excluding patients with insufficient or unreliable data for the purposes of this analysis (n = 344), 7,824 patients were assessed for the present manuscript. The mean age of patients was 64 ± 16 years; 58% (n = 4,578) were male. The mean hospital stay was 11 ± 9 days, and the follow‐up duration was 19 ± 17 days. Several comorbidities were prevalent, including hypertension (48%), diabetes (19%), and obesity with a body mass index > 30 (19%). Moreover, 22% of patients had a history of heart disease, and 18% had lung disease. A history of cancer was present in 13%.

- **Antithrombotic therapy during hospitalization**: A total of 4,503 (57.5%) patients received anticoagulation therapy. Of these, 3,327 (73.8%) received prophylactic anticoagulation, 1,016 (22.5%) received therapeutic anticoagulation, and 149 (3.3%) received oral anticoagulation (98 warfarin, 51 novel oral anticoagulants). A total of 730 (9.3%) patients received antiplatelet therapy during hospitalization. Among these, 680 patients (93%) received a single antiplatelet drug (645 received aspirin, 33 clopidogrel, and one each received ticlopidine and ticagrelor, respectively). Fifty patients (7%) received dual antiplatelet drugs (35 received aspirin and clopidogrel, 10 received aspirin and ticagrelor, and 5 received aspirin and prasugrel).

### Effects of aspirin and low-dose heparin in head and neck reconstruction using microvascular free flaps [^116n1L2i]. The Laryngoscope (2005). Low credibility.

The success of microvascular free-tissue transfer to the head and neck has been greatly increased due to increased experience. Postoperative anticoagulation continues to be routinely used to prevent pedicle thrombosis, though there is currently no consensus on the ideal regimen, if any, for postoperative anticoagulation. This study reviews the outcome and incidence of perioperative complications in patients undergoing free flaps for head and neck reconstruction, using a simple postoperative anticoagulation regimen of aspirin and subcutaneous heparin (SQH).

- **Design**: Retrospective chart review.

- **Methods**: With institutional review board approval, the charts of 261 patients undergoing free flap reconstruction from January 2000 to January 2004 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who received a standard postoperative anticoagulation regimen of SQH (5000 U SC bid) and aspirin (325 mg PO qd) were included in the study (216 patients). Charts were reviewed for postoperative complications, specifically for free flap failure, vascular compromise (arterial insufficiency/venous congestion), and hematoma.

- **Results**: There were six flap failures (2.8%), resulting in an overall free flap survival rate of 97.2%. There were six patients with venous congestion of the flap that required neck exploration (2.8%) and 12 patients with postoperative hematoma (5.6%) requiring surgical intervention.

The free flap survival rate in patients undergoing head and neck reconstruction using this simple anticoagulation regimen of aspirin and SQH was notably high.
