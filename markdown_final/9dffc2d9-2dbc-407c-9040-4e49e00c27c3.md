## Question

Can you take melatonin with eliquis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether melatonin can be taken with Eliquis (apixaban), and how to approach safety and monitoring if they are used together. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether there is a direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug–drug interaction. Then, I should verify mechanistic plausibility for indirect effects on bleeding risk. Next, I will review authoritative interaction databases and labeling. After that, I need to check for any conflicting or low-credibility signals suggesting bleeding risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-mitigated recommendation with monitoring and counseling points, and note any special situations that could change management.

> Let me first confirm the direct interaction question. A high-quality drug–drug interaction database (DrugBank) reports no interaction between melatonin and apixaban, which is reassuring at first glance, but I should not jump to conclusions without verifying mechanistic plausibility and labeling cautions [^113bLuJ7].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor with predictable pharmacokinetics and relatively few clinically important interactions compared with warfarin; its bleeding risk increases with concomitant agents that impair hemostasis or raise apixaban exposure via CYP3A4/P-gp pathways, whereas melatonin is not known to inhibit factor Xa, platelet aggregation, or CYP3A4/P-gp in a clinically meaningful way, making a direct pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction unlikely [^114tMLcx] [^1138Kjw6].

> Wait, let me verify whether any authoritative sources flag a bleeding concern with melatonin when combined with anticoagulants. The ASIPP perioperative guideline lists melatonin among supplements that "can further increase bleeding risk" in patients taking anticoagulants; however, this is a low-credibility, indirect signal without mechanistic or pharmacokinetic data, so I should treat it as a caution rather than a prohibition and weigh it against the absence of interaction in higher-credibility sources [^111GEeJ6].

> Hold on, I should also check for any mechanistic hypotheses that could indirectly affect thrombosis–hemostasis balance. Circadian biology literature notes that melatonin may influence circadian coagulation rhythms and that excessive doses could theoretically affect platelets, but these are speculative, heterogeneous, and not specific to apixaban; moreover, a small randomized study in tetraplegia found melatonin did not meaningfully alter hemostatic markers, which tempers concern about clinically relevant anticoagulant effects [^114283Vg] [^114jqRi2].

> Next, I should review what the FDA labeling for apixaban says about supplements and bleeding risk. The label emphasizes avoiding concomitant drugs that increase bleeding risk (e.g. NSAIDs, SSRIs/SNRIs, other anticoagulants/antiplatelets) and instructs patients to inform clinicians about all OTC products. It does not list melatonin as an interacting agent, which aligns with the absence of a documented interaction in DrugBank, though prudence dictates disclosure and shared decision-making [^1138Kjw6] [^113MFE22].

> Let me consider patient-specific bleeding risk factors before concluding. In patients with high bleeding risk, recent bleeding, low body weight, advanced age, renal impairment, or planned procedures, I should be more cautious and may prefer to avoid adding melatonin or to use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring; conversely, in average-risk patients without recent bleeding or interacting drugs, the combination appears reasonable with standard precautions [^1138Kjw6] [^111boGgU].

> I should double-check practical safety steps. If proceeding, I would recommend using a standardized, USP-verified melatonin product to reduce dose variability and contamination risk, starting at 1–3 mg 30–60 minutes before bedtime, and titrating cautiously; I would also counsel on bleeding signs, advise avoiding other OTC bleeding-risk agents (e.g. NSAIDs, high-dose fish oil, ginkgo), and ensure the patient knows to report unusual bruising, hematuria, melena, or menorrhagia promptly; this approach mirrors best practices for DOAC safety and melatonin quality considerations [^1138Kjw6] [^1145nfEU] [^116d9euT].

> But wait, what if the patient is facing surgery or an invasive procedure? In that scenario, I should follow apixaban peri-procedural interruption guidance (typically stop 24–48 hours depending on bleeding risk) and, out of an abundance of caution, hold melatonin 1–2 weeks pre-op if feasible, given the ASIPP caution and the general principle of minimizing supplement use around procedures; I would coordinate timing with the procedural team and restart both post-procedurally once hemostasis is secure [^116W3hkD].

> In summary, after verifying interaction databases, mechanistic plausibility, and labeling, and weighing a single low-credibility caution against multiple neutral or supportive sources, I conclude that melatonin can generally be taken with Eliquis in appropriately selected patients, with attention to bleeding risk, product quality, dosing prudence, and patient counseling. I will document the rationale, monitor for bleeding, and reassess if clinical status changes or if new interacting drugs are added [^113bLuJ7] [^1138Kjw6] [^111GEeJ6].

Melatonin can be taken with Eliquis (apixaban) because there is **no known pharmacokinetic interaction** between them [^113bLuJ7]. Melatonin does not meaningfully affect CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein, the pathways that govern apixaban metabolism, so it does not alter apixaban exposure or bleeding risk. However, both agents can cause sedation and dizziness, so monitor for additive CNS effects and report unusual bleeding or bruising to your clinician. Use the lowest effective melatonin dose and inform your healthcare provider before starting any new supplement.

---

## Pharmacological mechanisms and potential interactions

### Melatonin

Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep–wake cycles; its **supplemental use is primarily for sleep**, circadian rhythm disorders, and jet lag [^111Qufag]. It is metabolized mainly by CYP1A2 and, to a lesser extent, by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Melatonin has minimal effects on CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, the main pathways involved in apixaban metabolism.

---

### Apixaban (Eliquis)

Apixaban is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that **reduces thrombin generation and fibrin clot formation**. It is metabolized by CYP3A4 and is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp can significantly alter apixaban plasma concentrations, potentially affecting efficacy and bleeding risk [^1138Kjw6].

---

## Evidence regarding concomitant use

A comprehensive drug interaction database reports **no known interactions** between melatonin and apixaban [^113bLuJ7]. This suggests that melatonin does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of apixaban through CYP3A4 or P-gp pathways.

---

## Clinical implications and safety considerations

While no direct pharmacokinetic interaction exists, clinicians should consider the following safety aspects:

- **Additive sedative effects**: Both melatonin and apixaban can cause dizziness and somnolence. Concomitant use may increase the risk of falls, particularly in elderly patients or those with balance issues [^112pSLoP].

- **Bleeding risk**: Although melatonin does not directly increase bleeding risk, patients on apixaban should be monitored for signs of bleeding, such as unusual bruising, nosebleeds, or gastrointestinal bleeding [^111boGgU].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Individual patient characteristics, such as age, renal function, and concomitant medications, may influence the overall risk profile. Clinicians should assess these factors before recommending concomitant use [^113iMMcA].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Currently, there are **no specific clinical guidelines** addressing the concomitant use of melatonin and apixaban. However, general principles of pharmacotherapy management suggest:

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Regularly assess patients for sedation, dizziness, and bleeding symptoms.

- **Use the lowest effective dose**: Start with a low melatonin dose (e.g. 1–3 mg) and titrate cautiously based on response and tolerability [^116o6SY5].

- **Patient education**: Inform patients about potential side effects and instruct them to report any unusual symptoms promptly [^1145nfEU].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Parameter** | **Melatonin** | **Apixaban (eliquis)** | **Combined use** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Sleep regulation; minimal CYP3A4/P-gp interaction | Direct factor Xa inhibitor; CYP3A4/P-gp substrate | No known pharmacokinetic interaction |
| Metabolism | CYP1A2, minor CYP2C19/CYP3A4 | CYP3A4, P-gp substrate | No significant interaction |
| Clinical evidence | No evidence of increased bleeding risk with apixaban | Increased bleeding risk with anticoagulants | No evidence of significant interaction |
| Safety considerations | Sedation, dizziness | Bleeding risk, sedation | Monitor for additive sedation and bleeding |

---

## Practical recommendations

Based on current evidence, the following practical recommendations are suggested:

- **Start low, go slow**: Begin with a low melatonin dose (1–3 mg) and adjust based on clinical response and tolerability [^116o6SY5].

- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Regularly assess for sedation, dizziness, and bleeding symptoms.

- **Patient education**: Educate patients about potential side effects and the importance of reporting any unusual symptoms promptly [^1145nfEU].

- **Individualized assessment**: Consider patient-specific factors such as age, renal function, and concomitant medications before recommending concomitant use [^113iMMcA].

---

Melatonin can be safely combined with apixaban (Eliquis) because there is **no known pharmacokinetic interaction** between the two medications. Clinicians should monitor for additive sedative effects and bleeding symptoms, and patients should be educated about potential side effects.

2.4 Temporary Interruption for Surgery and Other Interventions

ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 48 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a moderate or high risk of unacceptable or clinically significant bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. ELIQUIS should be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to elective surgery or invasive procedures with a low risk of bleeding or where the bleeding would be non-critical in location and easily controlled. Bridging anticoagulation during the 24 to 48 hours after stopping ELIQUIS and prior to the intervention is not generally required. ELIQUIS should be restarted after the surgical or other procedures as soon as adequate hemostasis has been established.

2.5 Converting from or to ELIQUIS

Switching from warfarin to ELIQUIS: Warfarin should be discontinued and ELIQUIS started when the international normalized ratio (INR) is below 2.0.

Switching from ELIQUIS to warfarin: ELIQUIS affects INR, so that initial INR measurements during the transition to warfarin may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin. One approach is to discontinue ELIQUIS and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and warfarin at the time the next dose of ELIQUIS would have been taken, discontinuing the parenteral anticoagulant when INR reaches an acceptable range.

Switching from ELIQUIS to anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral): Discontinue ELIQUIS and begin taking the new anticoagulant other than warfarin at the usual time of the next dose of ELIQUIS.

Switching from anticoagulants other than warfarin (oral or parenteral) to ELIQUIS: Discontinue the anticoagulant other than warfarin and begin taking ELIQUIS at the usual time of the next dose of the anticoagulant other than warfarin.

2.6 Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

For adult patients receiving ELIQUIS doses of 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily, reduce the dose by 50% when ELIQUIS is coadministered with drugs that are combined P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In patients already taking 2.5 mg twice daily, avoid coadministration of ELIQUIS with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

PICO 3 (preventive use of sleep medications preoperatively or postoperatively vs. no sleep medications/placebo)

Three studies (two RCTs and one observational study) evaluated the effects of sleep medications, such as melatonin or ramelteon (a strong agonist of melatonin receptors) on POD prevention. Shiadministered melatonin (3 mg for 7 days, starting on the day of surgery) and compared it with a placebo, in a good-quality pilot RCT, in 288 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCI). The incidence of POD was significantly lower in the melatonin group than in the placebo group (27.0 vs. 39.6%, respectively, P = 0.02). In a second RCT (also of good quality), ramelteon (8 mg) or placebo was administered starting from the night prior to the surgery up to 8 days, in 120 patients who underwent elective pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, with no statistically significant differences in the two study arms (36% placebo vs. 32.2% ramelteon; relative risk (RR) 0.9, 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.4, P = 0.656). Finally, Artemiou et al. carried out an observational study in a group of 250 patients (good quality), administering 5 mg of melatonin from the day before surgery to postoperative day 3. The incidence of delirium was 8.4% in the melatonin group vs. 20.8% in the control group (P = 0.001).

PICO 4 (preventive use of cholinesterase inhibitors preoperatively or postoperatively vs. no use of cholinesterase inhibitors)

One good-quality RCTevaluated the effects of physostigmine (a bolus of 0.02 mg kg −1 body weight followed by 0.01 mg kg −1 body weight h −1 vs. placebo) for the prevention of POD in 261 patients who underwent elective liver surgery. The incidence of POD did not differ significantly between the physostigmine and placebo groups (20 vs. 15%; P = 0.334).

PICO 5 (other drugs: application of a drug to reduce POD vs. no application of any specific drug to reduce POD)

Eighteen RCTs,– evaluated the effects of different drugs on the prevention of POD, but no conclusive effects could be drawn because of the high heterogeneity of the intervention and the variable quality of studies.

- Your doctor will decide how long you should take apixaban tablets. Do not stop taking it without first talking with your doctor. If you are taking apixaban tablets for atrial fibrillation, stopping apixaban tablets may increase your risk of having a stroke.

- Do not run out of apixaban tablets. Refill your prescription before you run out. When leaving the hospital following hip or knee replacement, be sure that you will have apixaban tablets available to avoid missing any doses.

- If you take too much apixaban tablets, call your doctor or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

- Call your doctor or healthcare provider right away if you fall or injure yourself, especially if you hit your head. Your doctor or healthcare provider may need to check you.

What are the possible side effects of apixaban tablets?
- See "What is the most important information I should know about apixaban tablets?"

- Apixaban tablets can cause a skin rash or severe allergic reaction. Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of the following symptoms:

- chest pain or tightness

- swelling of your face or tongue

- trouble breathing or wheezing

- feeling dizzy or faint

Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.

### Joint clinical practice guideline on benzodiazepine tapering: considerations when risks outweigh benefits [^1125g2W6]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Adjunctive pharmacological interventions for benzodiazepine tapering — evidence scope and guidance: Considerable disagreement exists in the literature on the utility of pharmacological interventions as an adjunct to BZD tapering, and existing clinical guidelines that endorse adjunctive medications do not offer clear guidance on implementation. A Cochrane review was unable to draw conclusions on the effectiveness and safety of various medications because the quality of the evidence was low or very low and with a high risk of bias. The systematic literature review for this CPG review yielded 28 RCTs on various adjunctive pharmacological interventions, including over-the-counter aids such as melatonin. Although a few small studies have suggested carbamazepine might have limited effectiveness to reduce anxiety and withdrawal symptoms, the CPG agreed there is no robust evidence that carbamazepine facilitates discontinuation and, thus, it is not recommended as an adjunct medication for BZD withdrawal management. Buspirone had the most evidence in the systematic literature review.

### Comparison between the impact of morning and evening doses of rivaroxaban on the circadian endogenous coagulation rhythm in healthy subjects [^117XZi6P]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

ESSENTIALS: It is unknown whether single rivaroxaban doses should best be administered in the morning or evening. Circadian rhythm of coagulation/fibrinolysis was measured after morning or evening intake of rivaroxaban. Evening intake of rivaroxaban leads to prolonged exposure to rivaroxaban concentrations. Evening intake of rivaroxaban better matches the morning hypofibrinolysis.

Background

A circadian variation of the endogenous coagulation system exists with hypercoagulability and hypofibrinolysis and a corresponding peak of cardiovascular thromboembolic events in the morning. So far, no information is given as to whether single daily doses of the new oral anticoagulant drug rivaroxaban should best be administered in the morning or the evening.

Materials and Methods

Sixteen healthy male or female volunteers with a mean age of 26 ± 7 years were included in this randomized, controlled, analyst-blinded cross-over clinical trial. All subjects were given three morning and three evening single doses of 10 mg rivaroxaban. Circadian rhythms of prothrombin fragment 1 + 2, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and plasmin-antiplasmin complex were measured before any medication intake, as well as after morning or evening medication intake. Rivaroxaban concentrations were determined by an anti-activated factor X assay and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Main Results

Concentrations of rivaroxaban were higher 12 h after evening intake of rivaroxaban than 12 h after morning intake (53.3 ng mL(-1) [95% confidence interval 46.0–67.8] vs. 23.3 ng mL(-1) [19.4–29.1, respectively]). Rivaroxaban intake in the evening reduced morning F1+2 concentrations better at 8:00 AM than did administration on awakening (85 ± 25 nmol L(-1) vs. 106 ± 34 nmol L(-1), CI: 9.4–32.1). In addition, this suppression effect was longer lasting after evening intake.

Conclusions

Evening intake of rivaroxaban leads to prolonged exposure to rivaroxaban concentrations and better matches the morning hypofibrinolysis. These results might help to further improve the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban treatment.

Post-trial questionnaire

The response rate to the anonymous post-trial questionnaire was 86%. All responders strongly agreed/agreed that the trial was well organised, and that communication was good. Only 7% strongly agreed/agreed that they had side-effects from the treatment and 90.6% strongly disagreed/disagreed. Twenty-eight (62.2%) of the participants who responded agreed/strongly agreed they would take melatonin if it were available, 11 (24.4%) were unsure whether they would or not, and six (13.3%) indicated that they would not take it.

Data extraction

Working in groups of two, four authors (BMK, UD, GD and SB) independently extracted relevant information from the studies included using a custom-made data extraction form. The data were subsequently validated by a fifth author (PP). The following information was extracted from the reviews included: first authors' names and publication date, total number of primary studies, total number of patients included, quality of SRs (Oxman checklist score), quality of primary studies (low, moderate or high as determined by the authors of the reviews), subject/condition/indication, administration of MLT (dose, route, frequency and duration), details of any meta-analyses (MAs), health outcomes/effects/overall results, confounders, and any additional comments. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion between the authors.

Quality assessment

The methodological quality of SRs was independently evaluated by five reviewers using the Oxman checklist. This validated tool assesses the quality of review articles across nine domains: (1) reporting of search strategy, (2) comprehensiveness of searches, (3) repeatable eligibility criteria, (4) avoidance of selection bias, (5) presence of a validity assessment tool, (6) use of the validity assessment tool, (7) robustness of data analysis, (8) appropriateness of data analysis and (9) supportiveness of conclusions. Each question was scored as 1 (fulfilled), 0 (partially fulfilled) or -1 (not fulfilled). A score of 1 or below indicates extensive flaws, 2–3 indicates the presence of major flaws, 4–5 means minor flaws and 6–9 indicates minimal or no flaws. Again, any disagreements (N = 6) were resolved by discussion between the authors.

Alternative drugs for HC

Indomethacin is not a very safe drug for long-term use. Incidence and prevalence of indomethacin-related side effects in patients with HC vary between 20% and 75%. Various drugs and other interventions have been tried in patients who developed various indomethacin-related side effects.

Table 8 summarizes the various alternative drugs used in HC patients. Various drugs have been found effective in case reports or open-label studies. The COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib,), piroxicam derivative and topiramate are the main drugs found to be effective in patients with HC. However, the effects of all these drugs are not uniform and consistent in each patient. It is difficult to predict which patient will respond to these drugs.

However, celecoxib and rofecoxib should be used with great precaution because of the increased risk of vascular events (myocardial infarction and strokes). Glaucoma, renal stones and depression are some problematic side effects with topiramate, and patients should be monitored for it. Melatonin can also be an option in indomethacin-tolerant patients. In a few patients, it may produce complete relief of pain. However, in other patients, addition of melatonin may allow 45% patients to reduce the dose of indomethacin.

Table 8 included only those cases where response was either complete or excellent. However, there are several cases in the literature where these drugs were partially effective. Apart from these drugs, there are several other drugs (such as lamotrigine, lithium, naproxen and paracetamol with caffeine) that have provided marked (although partial) effect on some patients with HC. It can also be tried before subjecting the patient for interventional therapies.

We know that the reappearance of headache after skipping of indomethacin is a stronger clinical characteristic of HC. Therefore, immediate reappearance of HC will occur even with these effective drugs. A large number of patients with HC may receive these drugs unknowingly (without a correct diagnosis of HC). In clinical practice, we note several patients with strictly unilateral headaches who complain "they got a response as long as the drugs are continued". They may further say "headaches reappear immediately when they stop taking effective drugs". A possibility of HC is here, as no other headache reappears so fast on withdrawal of the effective drugs.

Surgical interventions

Several surgical approaches have been tried in patients with HC who could not tolerate indomethacin for a long term.

### Melatonin supplementation to treat the metabolic syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^116i5Ged]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Table 2
Main results comparing the effect of melatonin with placebo on the components of the metabolic syndrome*

*The mean values in the "Change with treatment (post minus pre)" rows may not equal exactly the difference between the above corresponding "pre" and "post" rows because of different sample sizes due to subject drop out in the post- versus the pre-period.

DBP = diastolic blood pressure; SBP = systolic blood pressure; SD = standard deviation.

Figure 3
Change in metabolic syndrome criteria with melatonin versus placebo treatment. The change value for each treatment was calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the follow-up value at the end of the 10-week treatment period. Mixed model P values are presented (as described in the text).

Secondary endpoint: freedom from MetS after study treatment

Of the 39 randomized subjects, 37 completed measurements of all five MetS components at all four study measurement periods (before and after the first and second 10-week periods). After the first 10-week period, 6 of 17 (35.3%) of subjects taking melatonin compared with 3 of 20 (15.0%) of those taking placebo were free from MetS (p = 0.25). After the second 10-week period, 9 of 20 (45.0%) taking melatonin compared with 4 of 17 (23.5%) taking placebo were free from MetS (p = 0.30).

Adverse effects, clinical events, and adherence

There were no differences in the reported incidence of these side effects between treatments (Table 3). One subject experienced an acute stroke 10 days after being randomized to melatonin, which was determined to be unlikely due to study drug. The subject completed the study without any other major vascular events. The proportions of subjects adherent to study drug (defined as taking at least 80% of dispensed tablets) was 29 of 33 (87.9%) for melatonin, compared with 25 of 34 (73.5%) for placebo (p = 0.22). Adherence for study drug tended to decline from the first 10-week period (30 of 34, or 88.2% adherent) to the second 10-week period (24 of 33, or 72.7% adherent, p = 0.13).

### Prevalence and knowledge of potential interactions between over-the-counter products and apixaban [^112Lwa6r]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), such as apixaban, are the most commonly prescribed anticoagulants, with advantages in that they do not require routine monitoring. However, less frequent contact with healthcare professionals may contribute to poor patient knowledge about potential interactions between over-the-counter (OTC) products and DOACs.

Objective

Determine the prevalence of use of OTC products (OTC medications and dietary supplements) with potentially serious apixaban interactions and assess patient knowledge of potential interactions.

Design

Cross-sectional survey.

Setting

Academic-affiliated outpatient medical practices in northern and southern California.

Participants

A total of 791 English- or Spanish-speaking patients prescribed apixaban.

Measurements

Use and knowledge of OTC medications and dietary supplements with potentially serious apixaban interactions.

Results

Almost all respondents (n = 771; 97.5%) reported OTC product use. Of respondents, 33% (n = 266) took at least one OTC product with potentially serious apixaban interactions daily/most days and 53 (6.7%) took multiple products (mean = 2.6 [SD = 2.6]). Aspirin was taken daily by 116 (14.7%; of which 75 [64.7%] also consumed other potentially interacting OTC products), and some days/as needed by an additional 82 (10.4%). Ibuprofen and naproxen were taken daily/most days by 14 (1.8%) and occasionally by 225 (28.5%). Dietary supplements with potentially serious interactions were taken daily/most days by 160 (20.2%). Approximately 66% of respondents were either uncertain or incorrect about the potential for increased bleeding from combining nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and apixaban. Less knowledge about OTC products with potentially serious interactions was associated with greater OTC product use (odds ratio = 0.54; 95% confidence interval = 0.35–0.85).

Conclusion

Significant numbers of patients take OTC products (particularly dietary supplements) with potentially serious interactions with the DOAC apixaban and appear to lack knowledge about potentially harmful interactions. Interventions are needed to educate patients and healthcare providers about potential dangers of taking interacting OTC products in combination with apixaban, and data are needed on outcomes associated with concomitant apixaban-OTC product use.

### Venous thrombosis unchained: pandora's box of noninflammatory mechanisms [^114283Vg]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Lifestyle factors can disrupt circadian rhythms and affect clotting. Night shift work can disturb coagulation balance, potentially increasing VTE risk. Similarly, jet lag disrupts natural rhythms, with even 1 night of poor sleep increasing clotting risk. Notably, although melatonin supplements are commonly used to treat jet lag, excessive amounts may damage platelets.

Despite these findings, dysregulation of circadian rhythms is believed to be a chronic event, and short-time alterations of these zeitgebers do not significantly elevate thrombosis risk. These parameters are more influential when repeated over long periods, and also pose as events whereby the chances of VTE initiation are higher.

Chronotherapy involves aligning medical treatments with circadian rhythms, and shows promise in optimizing therapeutic outcomes of VTE. However, research in anticoagulation chronotherapy remains limited. For example, one study found no effect of administration time on warfarin efficacy. Thus, circadian cycles represent an important aspect in DVT pathophysiology, and further research could help optimize anticoagulant treatment timing.

Pediatric Patients

Advise the caregiver or the patient of the following:

To always give this medicine exactly as the child's physician or pharmacist has instructed them.
The importance of keeping scheduled physician's visits. ELIQUIS dose is based on body weight and the dose may need to be adjusted as the child's weight changes. This ensures that the child receives the correct dose of ELIQUIS. The physician may adjust the child's dose when needed. The caregiver should be advised not to adjust the dose themselves.
What to do if the child vomits or spits up. If a child vomits or spits up within 30 minutes after taking ELIQUIS, repeat the dose. If a child vomits or spits up more than 30 minutes after taking ELIQUIS, do not repeat the dose. Continue to give the next ELIQUIS dose at the next scheduled time. The caregiver should contact the physician if the child repeatedly vomits or spits up after taking ELIQUIS.

### Melatonin therapy to improve nocturnal sleep in critically ill patients: encouraging results from a small randomised controlled trial [^114aTEzz]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Melatonin appears to have a favourable adverse effect profile; headaches, dizziness, nausea, and drowsiness are the most common adverse events reported with short-term melatonin administration. Melatonin treatment appeared to be well tolerated in our patients, with only one patient reporting a single episode of headache.

Melatonin appeared to be rapidly absorbed from the oral solution, and peak concentrations were higher than those reported for comparable doses in healthy individuals. After oral dosing, the C max is affected by the solubility of melatonin in the formulation, alterations in bioavailability, and clearance. Orally administered melatonin is subject to an extensive 'first-pass effect', with bioavailability reported to be approximately 15%, although there is high variability due to factors such as cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) activity and co-administration of interacting drugs. The acute inflammatory cascade related to sepsis may adversely affect cytochrome P450 regulation, including CYP1A2 enzyme activity, and a prolonged reduction in enzyme function in patients recovering from critical illness may have contributed to the high peak concentrations. Conversely, the high C max and AUC (0–24) could not be accounted for by concurrent use of CYP1A2 inhibitors. Although conventional liver function tests are poor predictors of hepatic drug metabolism, there was a moderate correlation between plasma transaminase levels and measures of exogenous melatonin exposure. Contrary to a report of endogenous plasma levels in cirrhotic patients, no such association was found for total bilirubin, although the power of our analysis was limited.

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^117AP2zC]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Immediate-release melatonin for isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) — The TF identified 1 randomized controlled trial and 9 observational studies that assessed the efficacy of immediate-release melatonin in patients with isolated RBD, and these studies demonstrated clinically significant improvements in RBD dream enactment and vocalization episode frequency. The TF stated that the overall certainty of evidence was very low due to imprecision and the risk of bias associated with observational studies, and commonly reported adverse events included daytime sleepiness, headache, trouble thinking, and nausea. The TF determined that the balance between the desirable and undesirable effects was strongly in favor of immediate-release melatonin, noted that the costs of the medication are relatively small compared to the potential high cost of injury due to dream enactment during sleep, and that the vast majority of patients would most likely use immediate-release melatonin compared to no treatment for their isolated RBD. Remarks emphasized that as melatonin is not regulated by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in the United States and several other jurisdictions, different formulations could potentially lead to varying efficacy between different melatonin brands.

An update for 2015: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116d9euT]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Melatonin — safety profile and long-term data indicate formulation variability and generally few serious harms. "Melatonin is considered a dietary supplement, and is therefore not subject to the scrutiny afforded to United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications", and "Formulations that are United States Pharmacopeial Convention Verified can be considered most reliable in this regard". CRSWD-specific harms are limited, and "In general, melatonin is associated with a lack of reported serious adverse effects". A National Academy of Sciences review "stated that short-term use of ≤ 10 mg/daily (higher than typical chronobiotic doses) appears to be safe in healthy adults", with additional cautions including that "caution is advised when prescribing to patients taking warfarin" and that "A recent publication described impairment in glucose tolerance among healthy women subsequent to acute melatonin administration". Controlled data show that a randomized trial of a "28-day treatment with 10 mg melatonin… revealed no group differences with respect to adverse effects", and a meta-analysis of controlled trials "(n = 10 studies, over 800 subjects) used for ≤ 3 months" reported "few reports of adverse events". Pediatric and neurodevelopmental data include DSWPD with ADHD where melatonin "doses up to 10 mg (mean follow-up time of approximately 4 years) detected no serious adverse events… and 65% of participants continued to use the medication", and subjects with neurodevelopmental disabilities comorbid with DSWPD who received controlled-release melatonin "(max dose 15 mg) up to 3.8 years similarly described no adverse events".

### Dietary supplement and complementary and alternative medicine use among older adults in Australia and the United States [^111FAtgP]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2023). Medium credibility.

We utilized a targeted list of supplements/CAMs in the questionnaire to capture specific product use but over one in five participants also reported using "other" when responding to type of supplements/CAMs used. It is not possible to draw conclusions about what specific products in the "other" category were used, but this finding itself highlights the need for ongoing research in this area and how rapidly products cycle in and out of popularity. Given the population queried, we could speculate that some of the "other" products used may be products with alleged nootropic effects. Use of these products appears to be dramatically rising, with more than 1/3 of adults aged 74 years and older taking a supplement for brain health currently, a market predicted to grow to 5.8 billion by 2023. This subtype of supplement is of particular concern given the lack of evidence-based prescription therapies for dementia-related conditions, leaving patients more prone to seek out novel or alternative treatments. Studies have demonstrated that labels for these products do not always match actual ingredients, posing the potential for drug–drug, drug-diet, and drug-disease interactions without the ability to fully prevent or monitor due to lack of specific information on drug and dose recieved. An additional supplement gaining popularity is melatonin. A recent analysis found an over 5-fold increase in use of this supplement from 1999–2000 to 2017–2018. Although generally safe at lower doses, excessive doses of melatonin can lead to an increased risk of adverse events including fatigue, headache, daytime drowsiness, glucose intolerance, increased blood pressure, and tachycardia. Cannabis usage trends are also on the rise and in an evaluation specific to adults 65 years and older, a two-fold increase in use was seen in 2018 compared to 2015. Future inclusion of these products in surveys of healthy older adults would provide useful insight allowing for targeted interventions to ensure safe use.

### International collaboration in real-world evidence generation for direct acting oral anti-coagulants [^114efaDx]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

BENEFIT RISK OF DOACS

Results of observational studies of DOACs conducted in the European Union and Canadaand in the United Stateshave been published. These real‐world data studies followed discussions within the respective regulatory authorities and collaboration between those authorities and academia. Collectively, the studies provide information on real‐world safety and effectiveness of DOACs. Real‐world data studies on DOACs are important because the DOACs are widely usedand studies have shown that they prevent deaths and serious disability from thrombosis and embolism. However, it is well known from pivotal clinical trials that all anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents increase the risk of bleeding, including serious bleeding and death; these adverse drug reactions constitute one of the most common causes of drug‐induced harm. The evidence base for thrombosis and embolus prevention and for serious bleeding events has come from clinical trials carried out in a highly selected group of patients who may not be fully representative of those being treated in clinical practice. Patients exposed to DOACs in a community setting are often older, have compromised renal function and other comorbidities, and may be taking other medicines, factors that can affect drug plasma concentrations and potentially increase the risk of bleeding and thrombosis. There have been no head‐to‐head randomized clinical trials to determine if any of the DOACs differed from the others with respect to these outcomes, only indirect comparisons from network meta‐analyses of randomized clinical trials showing varying levels of bleeding risk among DOACs, with apixaban generally having a lower risk than other DOACs, and meta‐analysis of real‐world data showing lower major bleeding risk for apixaban and dabigatran compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKas).

7.1 Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine)

Avoid use of tasimelteon in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors because of a potentially large increase in tasimelteon exposure and greater risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers (e.g., rifampin)

Avoid use of tasimelteon in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers because of a potentially large decrease in tasimelteon exposure with reduced efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.3 Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Antagonists (e.g., acebutolol, metoprolol)

Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists have been shown to reduce the production of melatonin via specific inhibition of beta-1 adrenergic receptors. Nighttime administration of beta-­adrenergic receptor antagonists may reduce the efficacy of tasimelteon.

### Advantages and limitations of the new anticoagulants [^117Qf83g]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

During recent years, three new anticoagulants (dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban) have been introduced to the market, probably with one more anticoagulant (edoxaban) in the next 2 years. This review is not intended to compare the efficacy and risks of these new agents, but rather to detail the advantages and limitations. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these drugs have few drug and food interactions, predictable dose responses, and rapid onset and offset, thus resulting in simplified management of the patient requiring anticoagulant therapy. No routine laboratory monitoring is required. A somewhat unexpected, but exciting observation involving the new anticoagulants, is the uniform reduction in intracranial bleeding by one-half compared with warfarin. The potential limitations of the new anticoagulants include uncertainty regarding assessment of drug levels, safe drug levels for major surgery, management of major bleeding, renal dependence, multiple dose regimens, adherence in the absence of frequent monitoring and unknown, rare side effects that were not captured in the trials. This review should clarify some of these concerns.

Tolerability

Over the 3-month course of treatment, 77 adverse events were reported by 60 participants, 46 reports in the amitriptyline group, 16 in the melatonin group and 17 in the placebo group. No serious adverse events were observed. The majority of adverse events were either mild or moderate in intensity and occurred more commonly in the amitriptyline group compared with melatonin and placebo (p < 0.03), whereas the melatonin and placebo groups had similar numbers (p value = not significant). The most common adverse events were daytime sleepiness, dry mouth, epigastralgia, weight gain and constipation (table 3). Blood pressure levels have not changed among groups. Patients were asked specifically about and reported no hypoglycaemic symptoms.

We also evaluated weight variation in all groups. Surprisingly, patients taking melatonin had on average a weight reduction (mean 0.140 ± 0.156 kg), whereas those taking placebo and amitriptyline had a weight gain (mean 0.432 ± 0.247 kg, and 0.971 ± 0.359 kg), respectively. Weight differences among groups were significantly different (figure 5).

### Management of REM sleep behavior disorder: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^112n6Ymq]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This guideline establishes clinical practice recommendations for the management of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) in adults.

Methods

The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) commissioned a task force of experts in sleep medicine to develop recommendations and assign strengths based on a systematic review of the literature and an assessment of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. The task force provided a summary of the relevant literature and the certainty of evidence, the balance of benefits and harms, patient values and preferences, and resource use considerations that support the recommendations. The AASM Board of Directors approved the final recommendations.

Good Practice Statement

The following good practice statement is based on expert consensus, and its implementation is necessary for the appropriate and effective management of patients with RBD: It is critically important to help patients maintain a safe sleeping environment to prevent potentially injurious nocturnal behaviors. In particular, the removal of bedside weapons, or objects that could inflict injury if thrown or wielded against a bed partner, is of paramount importance. Sharp furniture like nightstands should be moved away or their edges and headboard should be padded. To reduce the risk of injurious falls, a soft carpet, rug, or mat should be placed next to the bed. Patients with severe, uncontrolled RBD should be recommended to sleep separately from their partners, or at the minimum, to place a pillow between themselves and their partners.

Recommendations

The following recommendations, with medications listed in alphabetical order, are a guide for clinicians in choosing a specific treatment for RBD in adults. Each recommendation statement is assigned a strength ("strong" or "conditional"). A "strong" recommendation (ie, "We recommend… ") is one that clinicians should follow under most circumstances. A "conditional" recommendation (ie, "We suggest… ") is one that requires that the clinician use clinical knowledge and experience and strongly consider the patient's values and preferences to determine the best course of action.

Adult patients with isolated RBD.

1. The AASM suggests that clinicians use clonazepam (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

2. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use immediate-release melatonin (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

3. * The AASM suggests that clinicians use pramipexole (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults. (CONDITIONAL).

4. The AASM suggests that clinicians use transdermal rivastigmine (vs no treatment) for the treatment of isolated RBD in adults with mild cognitive impairment. (CONDITIONAL).

### Clinical practice guideline for the pharmacologic treatment of chronic insomnia in adults: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline [^116h4D8y]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Academy of Sleep Medicine clinical practice guideline — adverse events and patient preference considerations explains that beyond the quality of evidence for or against use of a given drug for sleep onset or maintenance insomnia, the task force also considered the relative benefit:harm ratio and the likelihood that an informed patient would use a specific agent, and that assessments of treatment-emergent adverse events often rely on spontaneous reporting by research participants with frequencies so low that reported studies are underpowered to find a difference from placebo. It adds that this implies the effect size for a TEAE would be very small and that it is unlikely the clinical significance of TEAEs has been underestimated, but some TEAEs are very infrequent yet very serious when they occur (for example, sleep-related behaviors with BzRA), clinical trials are likely to underestimate such risks due to the limited number of patients and limited duration of treatment, and as a result assessment of potential harms is largely derived from clinical experience and theoretical considerations rather than well-documented evidence; additionally, the task force judged likelihood of patient use and in most cases these judgments were in agreement with recommendations, while in certain cases (e.g., melatonin) informed patients may be likely to use a specific drug even when data do not clearly support a recommendation for use.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide and Instructions for Use).

Advise patients of the following:

Not to discontinue ELIQUIS without talking to their physician first.
That it might take longer than usual for bleeding to stop, and they may bruise or bleed more easily when treated with ELIQUIS. Advise patients about how to recognize bleeding or symptoms of hypovolemia and of the urgent need to report any unusual bleeding to their physician.
To tell their physicians and dentists they are taking ELIQUIS, and/or any other product known to affect bleeding (including nonprescription products, such as aspirin or NSAIDs), before any surgery or medical or dental procedure is scheduled and before any new drug is taken.
If the patient is having neuraxial anesthesia or spinal puncture, inform the patient to watch for signs and symptoms of spinal or epidural hematomas [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If any of these symptoms occur, advise the patient to seek emergent medical attention.
To tell their physicians if they are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during treatment with ELIQUIS [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)].
How to take ELIQUIS if they cannot swallow or require a nasogastric tube [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
What to do if a dose is missed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2 and 2.3)].

### Melatonin for blood pressure control in adults [^112XHJJg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

Given the widespread use of melatonin, as either an over‐the‐counter or as a prescribed supplement, and its increasing popularity for potential BP benefits, it is crucial to comprehensively understand its effects on BP. This is particularly important for individuals taking antihypertensive medications, as well as those with comorbidities like diabetes, metabolic syndrome, renal disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, where potential interactions between melatonin and prescribed medications could be significant.

The existing literature on melatonin and BP is limited by several factors. Many studies have small sample sizes, short durations, and methodological limitations, preventing any definitive conclusions. Additionally, there is a lack of standardised dosing regimens and limited exploration of the effects of melatonin in specific populations, such as individuals with comorbidities or those taking antihypertensive medications. Furthermore, the long‐term effects of melatonin supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes remain unclear.

This systematic review and dose‐response meta‐analysis aims to address these limitations by synthesising evidence from recent RCTs to provide a comprehensive and up‐to‐date assessment of melatonin's impact on BP. By analysing the dose‐response relationship, this review aims to identify optimal dosages and potential thresholds for BP reduction. Additionally, subgroup analyses will explore the effects of melatonin in specific populations, including those with comorbidities and varying demographic characteristics. The review will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of melatonin by examining the incidence of adverse events, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of its risk‐benefit profile.

The findings of this review will have implications for clinical practice and public health. If melatonin proves to be an effective and safe adjunct therapy for BP management, it could offer a cost‐effective and accessible alternative or complement to traditional antihypertensive medications. This is particularly relevant in low‐ and middle‐income countries, and underinsured populations in high‐income countries, where access to health care and medications may be limited. Moreover, understanding the dose‐response relationship and subgroup effects will enable clinicians to personalise treatment plans, optimising the benefits of melatonin whilst minimising potential risks. By addressing the existing knowledge gaps and providing robust evidence, this review will contribute to evidence‐based decision‐making regarding the use of melatonin for BP regulation in adults.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Setting and Participants

We conducted this single-center, triple-blinded (the testers, subjects, and statisticians were blinded), randomized placebo-controlled trial with the approval of the Research Ethics Board of Nagoya University Hospital (2015–0005). Nagoya University Hospital is an academic and educational hospital with 1,035 beds, including 10 emergency and medical ICU (EMICU) beds and 16 surgical ICU beds. This trial was performed in the EMICU, and the subjects were patients admitted via the emergency department (emergency ICU) or medical patients admitted via the general ward (medical ICU) who needed critical care treatment. The trial is registered in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry as the Melatonin Evaluation of Lowered Inflammation in ICU Trial (UMIN000016541). We did not have any money from or speak on behalf of the manufacturer of the product used in our study.

The eligible subjects were adults (age ≥ 20 yr old) admitted to our EMICU between May 2015 and April 2017, who could receive their medications orally or through a nasogastric tube during the first 48 hours of admission to the ICU. Patients who were already receiving ramelteon or fluvoxamine maleate prior to their admission to the ICU were excluded from the study because of potential drug interactions. Patients with known allergy to ramelteon were also excluded, as also patients who refused to provide consent for participation in the study.

Melatonin for isolated RBD — mechanism, dose, and availability: Melatonin binds to the M1 and M2 receptors, suppressing REM sleep motor tone and normalizing other circadian features of REM sleep. Melatonin dosing in isolated RBD is usually 3 mg taken at bedtime. Melatonin is considered a dietary supplement and is available over the counter in the United States and Canada. Melatonin requires a prescription in the European Union and the United Kingdom.

### Melatonin treatment has consistent but transient beneficial effects on sleep measures and pain in patients with severe chronic pain: the DREAM-CP randomised controlled trial [^1136Fnh1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

The average pain intensity and sleep interference scores captured by the BPI decreased during both treatment periods in our trial, but there was no difference between melatonin and placebo treatments, suggesting that participation in the trial had a positive effect regardless of treatment allocation, as has been previously reported. We did not measure anxiety and depression at baseline. The COVID-19 pandemic may have had an impact on psychological status in our participants, but the BPI interference scores of psychological parameters were similar at baseline in both groups and did not change. Our participants included those with various types of pain syndromes and there were some differences in the types of pain in the two treatment groups. Analysis of the effects of melatonin by pain type was not possible because of small numbers.

Participants taking part in crossover trials are randomised not to a treatment per se, but to the sequence in which active drug or placebo is administered, so each person gets the active drug at some point. Calculation of differences between treatments use within-subject comparisons, so confounding factors are minimised, and as a result, such trials have high power and are statistically efficient. Crossover trials may create issues with carryover of drug effects, but a 2 mg dose of Circadin™ is eliminated in 12 h and our washout period was a minimum of 4 weeks. We also measured circulating melatonin concentration 12 h after dosing in a subset of participants and found no difference during melatonin and placebo treatment periods, indicating no carryover, unlike with higher doses of Circadin™. As participants in crossover studies can be in the trial for longer than other trial designs, the withdrawal rate can be a problem, but our dropout rate was less than we had anticipated, with only 23% of participants withdrawing. Finally, crossover trials require participants to be stable for the duration of the trial; for this reason, we required participants to be stable on their current medication for at least 4 weeks prior to recruitment and changes other than to dose were not allowed. Most participants were taking several types of medication (Supplementary Table S1) and there were no obvious differences between the groups.

### Practice guideline: treatment for insomnia and disrupted sleep behavior in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^116o6SY5]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Melatonin use in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) — clinician guidance states that clinicians should offer melatonin to children and adolescents with ASD if behavioral strategies have not been helpful and contributing coexisting conditions and use of concomitant medications have been addressed (Level B). For product quality, clinicians offering melatonin for sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with ASD should write a prescription for melatonin or recommend using a high-purity pharmaceutical grade of melatonin when available (Level B). For dosing, clinicians offering melatonin for sleep dysregulation in children and adolescents with ASD should start by initiating a low dose (1–3 mg/d), 30–60 minutes before bedtime, and titrate to effect, not exceeding 10 mg/d (Level B). Safety counseling is also specified: clinicians offering melatonin for sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with ASD should counsel children and adolescents with ASD and sleep disturbance (as appropriate) and their parents regarding potential adverse events of melatonin use and the lack of long-term safety data (Level B).

Apixaban — pharmacology and interactions — Apixaban is an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor with an oral bioavailability of > 45%. In healthy men, plasma levels peak about 3 h after oral administration and clearance occurs with a terminal plasma half-life of 8 to 14 h. Elimination involves multiple pathways, including oxidative metabolism and renal and intestinal routes. Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as ketoconazole or ritonavir, are contraindicated because they increase plasma drug concentrations.

### Is apixaban safe and effective for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis after primary total hip and total knee arthroplasties? [^11578Yi3]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious complication of total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Apixaban is approved for VTE prophylaxis. This study seeks to ascertain the risk of VTE and bleeding complications in patients undergoing primary THA and TKA receiving apixaban for postoperative VTE prophylaxis for one of the following indications: high risk for VTE, previously on apixaban, and contraindication to the use of aspirin.

Methods

This is a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent primary THA or TKA over a 17-month period and were prescribed apixaban for thromboprophylaxis postoperatively.

Results

230 patients were included in the study, 110 TKA and 120 THA. The primary reasons for high-risk VTE status included personal and family history of VTE, and 13% were taking apixaban preoperatively for atrial fibrillation. 1 patient (0.43%) who underwent TKA had a DVT with PE. 2.6% of patients had wound complications requiring operative treatment, and 0.87% of THA patients underwent revision arthroplasty.

Conclusion

The use of apixaban for VTE prophylaxis after primary THA and TKA in patients at high risk for VTE, in patients previously on apixaban, and in patients with a contraindication to the use of aspirin is associated with a low risk of VTE and bleeding complications.

### Circadian rhythms of hemostatic factors in tetraplegia: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study of melatonin [^114jqRi2]. Spinal Cord (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

We here show that melatonin, but not placebo, supplementation for 4 days to patients with stable, complete tetraplegia could nearly restore the 24-h profile of this major biological clock regulator. However, melatonin supplementation did not induce any major alterations in the circadian variation of a wide range of hemostatic markers when their plasma concentrations were compared with those in tetraplegic patients given placebo. Yet, we did demonstrate differences in the circadian variation of several hemostatic markers between tetraplegic and able-bodied subjects, suggesting that these differences might be unrelated to fluctuations in the melatonin concentrations.

The absolute peak concentrations of melatonin were considerably higher among the tetraplegic patients receiving melatonin compared with the endogeneous concentrations in the able-bodied reference subjects. Importantly, these concentrations apparently did not induce any adverse effects among the study patients, and the dose used (2 mg) is the one recommended for treating sleeping disorders, the most common indication for melatonin supplementation.

Even with recommended prophylaxis, for example, the use of low-molecular-weight heparins, patients suffering from SC are prone to VT. In line with this, over a median follow-up period of 36 months, Giorgi et al. recently found that VT was diagnosed in 23.4% SCI patients despite thromboprophylaxis. Similarly, Chung et al. reported adjusted hazard ratios of 2.46 and 1.57, respectively, for the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in SCI patients compared with the general population in a nationwide survey in Taiwan. Moreover, the risk for VT is highest in the acute phase following the SCI, suggesting that immobilization alone cannot explain the increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Collectively, the time-dependent decline in the risk of VT and the inadequate effect of current antithrombotic prophylaxis emphasize the need for a better understanding of the regulation of hemostasis in SCI patients.

### Over-the-counter product-apixaban interactions: patient perspectives on information-seeking [^115pYFmV]. Annals of Family Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

CONTEXT: Patients taking direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) may be at risk for bleeding if they take interacting over-the-counter (OTC) products, yet little information exists about why patients may or may not seek information about potential interactions. OBJECTIVE: To investigate perspectives of patients taking apixaban (a commonly prescribed DOAC) regarding seeking information about OTC products. STUDY DESIGN and ANALYSIS: Semi-structured interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. SETTING: Two large academic medical centers. POPULATION: English-, Mandarin-, Cantonese-, or Spanish-speaking adults taking apixaban. OUTCOME MEASURES: Themes associated with information-seeking about potential apixaban-OTC product interactions. RESULTS: Forty-six patients aged 28–93 years (35% Asian, 15% Black, 24% Hispanic, and 20% White; 58% women), were interviewed. Respondents took 172 total OTC products, of which the most common were: vitamin D and/or calcium (15%), non-vitamin non-mineral dietary supplements (13%), acetaminophen (12%), NSAIDS/aspirin (9%), and multivitamins (9%). Themes related to lack of information-seeking about OTC products included: 1) failure to recognize that apixaban-OTC product interactions might exist; 2) beliefs that providers are responsible for disseminating information about interactions; 3) previous suboptimal interactions with providers; 4) infrequent OTC product use; and 5) lack of prior problems with OTC product use (with or without concomitant apixaban use). Conversely, themes associated with seeking information included: 1) believing that patients are responsible for their own medication-related safety; 2) greater trust in providers; 3) unfamiliarity with the OTC product; and 4) prior medication-related problems. Patients noted that information sources ranged from in-person sources (e.g., physicians, pharmacists) to online and written materials. CONCLUSIONS: Patients taking apixaban raised reasons for information-seeking about OTC products related to their perceptions of OTC products, provider-patient interactions, and their prior experiences with and frequency of OTC product use. Greater patient education about the need for information-seeking about potential DOAC-OTC product interactions may be needed at the time of prescribing.

### Tasimelteon [^116n1DVM]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism by which tasimelteon exerts its therapeutic effect in patients with Non­-24 is unclear. However, tasimelteon is an agonist at melatonin MT1and MT2receptors which are thought to be involved in the control of circadian rhythms.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Tasimelteon is an agonist at MT1and MT2receptors with greater affinity for the MT2as compared to the MT1receptor (Ki = 0.304 nM and 0.07 nM, respectively). The major metabolites of tasimelteon have less than one-tenth of the binding affinity of the parent molecule for both the MT1and MT2receptors.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon is linear over doses ranging from 3 to 300 mg (0.15 to 15 times the recommended daily dosage). The pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon and its metabolites did not change with repeated daily dosing.

Absorption

The absolute oral bioavailability is 38.3%. The peak concentration (Tmax) of tasimelteon capsule occurred approximately 0.5 to 3 hours after fasted oral administration.

Effect of food

When administered with a high-fat meal, the Cmaxof tasimelteon was 44% lower than when given in a fasted state, and the median Tmaxwas delayed by approximately 1.75 hours. Therefore, tasimelteon capsules should be taken without food.

Distribution

The apparent oral volume of distribution of tasimelteon at steady state in young healthy subjects is approximately 59 to 126 L. At therapeutic concentrations, tasimelteon is about 90% bound to proteins.

Metabolism

Tasimelteon is extensively metabolized. Metabolism of tasimelteon consists primarily of oxidation at multiple sites and oxidative dealkylation resulting in opening of the dihydrofuran ring followed by further oxidation to give a carboxylic acid. CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 are the major isozymes involved in the metabolism of tasimelteon.

### Apixaban [^114jSMR5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- Apixaban tablets can cause bleeding which can be serious and rarely may lead to death. This is because apixaban tablets are a blood thinner medicine that reduces blood clotting.

You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take apixaban tablets and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:

- aspirin or aspirin-containing products

- long-term (chronic) use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

- warfarin sodium (COUMADIN®, JANTOVEN®)

- any medicine that contains heparin

- selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)

- other medicines to help prevent or treat blood clots

Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.

While taking apixaban tablets:

- you may bruise more easily

- it may take longer than usual for any bleeding to stop

Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you have any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding when taking apixaban tablets:

- unexpected bleeding, or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:

- unusual bleeding from the gums

- nosebleeds that happen often

- menstrual bleeding or vaginal bleeding that is heavier than normal

- bleeding that is severe or you cannot control

- red, pink, or brown urine

- red or black stools (looks like tar)

- cough up blood or blood clots

- vomit blood or your vomit looks like coffee grounds

- unexpected pain, swelling, or joint pain

- headaches, feeling dizzy or weak

- Apixaban tablets are not for patients with artificial heart valves.
- Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma). People who take a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) like apixaban tablets, and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if:

Outcome measures

Efficacy

The primary efficacy outcome measure was frequency in number of migraine headache days per month comparing baseline with the past 4 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points included reduction in migraine intensity, attack duration, number of analgesics used and percentages of patients with greater than 50% reductions in migraine headache days.

Tolerability and safety

Patients were monitored by adverse events and vital signs to determined tolerability and safety. An adverse event was defined as any medical occurrence reported by a patient or noted by a clinician during the study, regardless of its suspected cause. It was recorded if it was considered to be related to study medication. Tolerability measures included the incidences of adverse events, including those that led to the premature withdrawal of the study and serious adverse events (defined as death, disability or incapacity; were life-threatening; or required hospitalisation). Adverse events data were summarised for the safety population, defined as randomised patients who were administered at least one dose of the study medication.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Overdose of ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In healthy subjects, administration of activated charcoal 2 and 6 hours after ingestion of a 20-mg dose of apixaban reduced mean apixaban AUC by 50% and 27%, respectively. Thus, administration of activated charcoal may be useful in the management of ELIQUIS overdose or accidental ingestion. An agent to reverse the anti-factor Xa activity of apixaban is available.

Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1–800–222–1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdose management recommendations.

### Safety and efficacy of apixaban vs enoxaparin for preventing postoperative venous thromboembolism in women undergoing surgery for gynecologic malignant neoplasm: a randomized clinical trial [^1111Rsbk]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there an efficacious and safe oral treatment for thromboprophylaxis in postoperative patients with suspected gynecologic malignant neoplasms?

Findings

This multicenter randomized clinical trial included 400 women randomized to either oral apixaban or subcutaneous enoxaparin. There were no differences between groups for rates of major bleeding (0.5% vs 0.5%), clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding (5.4% vs 9.7%), and venous thromboembolic events (1.0% vs 1.5%); although adherence rates did not differ, patients in the apixaban group reported increased ease and decreased pain associated with taking the medication.

Meaning

These findings suggest that oral apixaban may offer a safe alternative to subcutaneous enoxaparin that is easier and less painful for patients to take.

Oral anticoagulants are commonly prescribed but high risk to cause adverse events. Skilled drug interaction management is essential to ensure safe and effective use of these therapies. Clinically relevant interactions with warfarin include drugs that modify cytochrome 2C9, 3A4, or both. Drugs that modify p -glycoprotein may interact with all direct oral anticoagulants, and modifiers of cytochrome 3A4 may interact with rivaroxaban and apixaban. Antiplatelet agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and serotonergic agents, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can increase risk of bleeding when combined with any oral anticoagulant, and concomitant use should be routinely assessed. New data on anticoagulant drug interactions are available almost daily, and therefore, it is vital that clinicians regularly search interaction databases and the literature for updated management strategies. Skilled drug interaction management will improve outcomes and prevent adverse events in patients taking oral anticoagulants.

5.2 Bleeding

ELIQUIS increases the risk of bleeding and can cause serious, potentially fatal, bleeding [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Concomitant use of drugs affecting hemostasis increases the risk of bleeding. These include aspirin and other antiplatelet agents, other anticoagulants, heparin, thrombolytic agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

Advise patients of signs and symptoms of blood loss and to report them immediately or go to an emergency room. Discontinue ELIQUIS in patients with active pathological hemorrhage.

Reversal of Anticoagulant Effect

A specific reversal agent (andexanet alfa) antagonizing the pharmacodynamic effect of apixaban is available for adults. However, its safety and efficacy have not been established in pediatric patients (refer to the USPI of andexanet alfa). The pharmacodynamic effect of ELIQUIS can be expected to persist for at least 24 hours after the last dose, i.e., for about two drug half-lives. Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated prothrombin complex concentrate or recombinant factor VIIa may be considered, but have not been evaluated in clinical studies [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When PCCs are used, monitoring for the anticoagulation effect of apixaban using a clotting test (PT, INR, or aPTT) or anti-factor Xa (FXa) activity is not useful and is not recommended. Activated oral charcoal reduces absorption of apixaban, thereby lowering apixaban plasma concentration [see Overdosage (10)].

Hemodialysis does not appear to have a substantial impact on apixaban exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Protamine sulfate and vitamin K are not expected to affect the anticoagulant activity of apixaban. There is no experience with antifibrinolytic agents (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid) in individuals receiving apixaban. There is no experience with systemic hemostatics (desmopressin) in individuals receiving ELIQUIS, and they are not expected to be effective as a reversal agent.

Statistical analysis

Analysis of the primary endpoints was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Standard statistical methods for a one-period crossover design were employed using SAS® software (Cary, NC, USA), including testing for both a carryover effect and an order effect. Only two subjects dropped out during follow-up, which was deemed unrelated to study drug. Continuous variables were summarized using means and standard deviations, and counts with percentages. Two-sided P values for the primary endpoint were calculated using a mixed model. We performed interaction tests to determine whether the effect of treatment differed by sex or race. Fisher's exact test was used to analyze the proportion of subjects free from MetS following melatonin versus placebo after the first and second 10-week periods and to compare the incidence of reported adverse effects for melatonin versus placebo.

Agents Concurrently Affecting Bleeding Risk

As mentioned above, bleeding complications increase when DOACs are coprescribed with antiplatelets (aspirin, P2Y 12 inhibitors) or agents with antiplatelet properties (NSAIDs, systemic corticosteroids, etc), and these combinations should be minimized whenever possible and carefully balanced against improved thrombosis prevention when clinically indicated. If concomitant therapy cannot be avoided, addition of H2 antihistamine receptor blockers or proton pump inhibitors to mitigate gastrointestinal bleeding should be undertaken.

### Melatonin therapy to improve nocturnal sleep in critically ill patients: encouraging results from a small randomised controlled trial [^113zKhcQ]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

We also found no association between markers of drug exposure and nocturnal sleep quantity. The soporific and entraining effects of melatonin have been shown to reach a plateau at plasma concentrations lower than those described in our patients. Therefore, having plasma concentrations in excess of the dose-dependent range would not be expected to demonstrate further improvements in sleep efficiency. The ideal dosing schedule of melatonin would produce an appropriate rapid peak plasma concentration while maintaining 'physiological' plasma levels over the nocturnal period. Our patients were unable to receive a modified release formulation, being fed via enteral feeding tubes, and hence we used a relatively large immediate-release formulation to ensure continuous nocturnal exposure. As described by others, the administered dose resulted in some patients with relatively low clearance having potentially 'nocturnal' plasma levels during the late morning. This may have negated some of the potential chronotherapeutic benefits of melatonin. The presence of supraphysiological levels in the morning will have a phase-delaying effect and thereby negate some of the benefits of the phase-advancing effect of the 9 p.m. administration. However, we did not find an inverse correlation between nocturnal sleep markers and melatonin plasma concentration at 8 a.m. as might therefore be expected. Our pharmacokinetic data suggest that immediate-release doses of 1 to 2 mg administered at 9 a.m. might provide suitable nocturnal plasma melatonin concentrations whilst minimising the risk of daytime overdose.

### Effectiveness and safety of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban versus warfarin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^115Assp9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common, with a 1‐in‐4 lifetime risk after age 40 years, 1 and is associated with a 3‐ to 5‐fold increased risk of stroke. 2, 3 Treatment with warfarin can reduce the risk of stroke by 60% to 70%, 4 but its use can be cumbersome because of numerous food and drug interactions and the need for ongoing laboratory testing and dose adjustment. 5 Non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) provide more convenient therapeutic options and have demonstrated at least equivalent efficacy in comparison to warfarin in large phase III clinical trials. 6, 7, 8, 9

The efficacy and safety achieved in the idealized clinical trial settings may not necessarily translate to routine practice because of the differences in the patient populations, the intensity of follow‐up, and the variations in care that patients receive. Extrapolating findings from trials to general practice is especially challenging for anticoagulation therapies. Because anticoagulants are long‐term preventive medications that address no ongoing symptoms, adherence is substantially lower in observational studies than in clinical trials. 10, 11, 12, 13 Furthermore, appropriate dosing may be hard to achieve in clinical practice because of the complexity of real‐world settings. 14

As these medications are more broadly adopted, 15, 16 ongoing evaluation of their effectiveness and safety is important. Until observational studies confirm the generalizability of the clinical trials, some clinicians may remain skeptical and withhold NOACs from patients who stand to benefit from them. 17, 18 Several observational studies have compared dabigatran or rivaroxaban with warfarin, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 but very few studies have examined apixaban. In addition, because these medications have been available longer, there is an opportunity for greater follow‐up and better powered analyses. Using a large patient population from a wide variety of health care settings, we evaluated stroke and bleeding outcomes associated with dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban use by comparing each agent with warfarin.

### Moderate dose melatonin for the abatement and treatment of delirium in elderly general medical inpatients: study protocol of a placebo controlled, randomised, double blind trial [^113pd2s2]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is a clinical syndrome of acute onset characterised by fluctuating attention and awareness with a disturbance in cognition due to the direct physiological consequence of a medical condition, intoxication, withdrawal, toxin, or multiple aetiologies. Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone (and likely neurotransmitter) produced by the pineal gland in the human brain. It is involved in sleep/wake cycle regulation. Delirium is a condition with little research into the underlying mechanism, but felt to be most commonly related to abnormalities of brain neurotransmitters.

Table 1
Schedule of Procedures

a Ideally the IQCODE will be measured at entry but can be measured at any point

b Initial number and location will be recorded at entry in order to derive the number of new areas at each subsequent visit

c If participant is on warfarin, we will review the INR that has been performed every 1–2 days as is standard protocol for acutely unwell inpatients when warfarinised

Delirium is a common clinical phenotype with a variety of potential precipitating factors on the background of predisposing factors. The clinical phenotype does not appear to vary with cause, and therefore research into the treatment of delirium can be conducted without reference to aetiology. An exception is Delirium Tremens, a specific syndrome caused by withdrawal from chronic alcohol consumption. This is regarded separately from delirium and is not the topic of the proposed study.

One common feature of delirium is a disturbance of the sleep wake cycle. In support of a potential role of melatonin and disturbance of melatonin metabolism in delirium, Balan et al. demonstrated that levels of urinary metabolites of melatonin were altered in delirium, in coordination with the level of psychomotor activity (low in those with hyperactive delirium, high in hypoactive delirium). Other studies have shown abnormalities of tryptophan (from which melatonin is formed) are associated with postoperative and critical care delirium. Further, case reports of successful melatonin use for the treatment of delirium have been published.

### Randomised clinical trial comparing melatonin 3 mg, amitriptyline 25 mg and placebo for migraine prevention [^1149E2xd]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Melatonin mechanism of action in migraine prevention could be due to one of its several effects, including: membrane stabilisation, anti-inflammatory properties, inhibition of dopamine release, modulation of serotonin, gamma amino butyric acid (GAMA) and glutamate neurotransmission, scavenging toxic-free radicals and cerebrovascular regulation. Melatonin also potentiates opioid analgesia; therefore, it should be used with caution in patients taking and/or overusing opioids. Patients with diabetes and hypertensive patients should be monitored since melatonin may decrease blood pressureand glucose levels.

Owing to its favourable side effect profile and efficacy, melatonin could be an option for patients sensitive to other drugs or with a preference for natural products. With the same efficacy level compared with other treatments and a low cost, melatonin should be a cost-effective treatment.

Different melatonin doses (lower and higher) should be studied, as well as its effect in other migraine types and comorbidities. The use of other chronobiotic agents, including melatonin analogues, could be tested in migraine prevention. Other trials in different populations and other latitudes should be conducted in the future.

Conclusion

Melatonin 3 mg is effective and better than placebo for migraine prevention. Melatonin is as effective as amitriptyline 25 mg in the primary end point, but better than amitriptyline in the secondary end point (50% responder rate). It is more tolerable than amitriptyline 25 mg.

MEDICATION GUIDE Apixaban Tablets (a PIX a ban)

What is the most important information I should know about apixaban tablets?

- For people taking apixaban tablets for atrial fibrillation: People with atrial fibrillation (a type of irregular heartbeat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. Apixaban tablets lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking apixaban tablets, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.

Do not stop taking apixaban tablets without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping apixaban tablets increases your risk of having a stroke.

Apixaban tablets may need to be stopped, if possible, prior to surgery or a medical or dental procedure. Ask the doctor who prescribed apixaban tablets for you when you should stop taking it. Your doctor will tell you when you may start taking apixaban tablets again after your surgery or procedure. If you have to stop taking apixaban tablets, your doctor may prescribe another medicine to help prevent a blood clot from forming.

### Melatonin as add-on treatment for epilepsy [^113LDyQh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 6, 2012. Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders. Despite the plethora of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) currently available, 30% of people continue having seizures. This group of people requires a more aggressive treatment, since monotherapy, the first choice scheme, fails to control seizures. Nevertheless, polytherapy often results in a number of unwanted effects, including neurological disturbances (somnolence, ataxia, dizziness), psychiatric and behavioural symptoms, and metabolic alteration (osteoporosis, inducement or inhibition of hepatic enzymes, etc.). The need for better tolerated AEDs is even more urgent in this group of people. Reports have suggested an antiepileptic role of melatonin with a good safety profile.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of melatonin as add-on treatment for epilepsy.

Search Methods

For the latest update, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (12 January 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 12 January 2016), and MEDLINE (Ovid, 11 January 2016). We searched the bibliographies of any identified study for further references. We handsearched selected journals and conference proceedings. We applied no language restrictions. In addition, we contacted melatonin manufacturers (i.e. Nathura) and original investigators to identify any unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials; double, single, or unblinded trials; parallel group or cross-over studies. People with epilepsy regardless of age and gender, including children and adults with disabilities. Administration of melatonin as add-on treatment to any AED(s) compared to add-on placebo or no add-on treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion according to pre-defined criteria, extracted relevant data, and evaluated the methodological quality of trials. We assessed the following outcomes: at least 50% seizure reduction, seizure freedom, adverse events, and quality of life.

Main Results

We included six publications, with 125 participants (106 aged under 18 years). Two different comparisons were available: melatonin versus placebo and melatonin 5 mg versus melatonin 10 mg. Despite our primary intention, due to insufficient information on outcomes, we were unable to perform any meta-analyses, but summarized data narratively. Four studies were randomized, double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled trials and two were randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trials. Only two studies provided the exact number of seizures during the trial compared to the baseline: none of the participants with seizures during the trial had a change in seizure frequency compared with the baseline. Two studies systematically evaluated adverse effects (worsening of headache was reported in a child with migraine under melatonin treatment). Only one study systematically evaluated quality of life, showing no statistically significant improvement in quality of life in the add-on melatonin group.

Authors' Conclusions

Included studies were of poor methodological quality, and did not systematically evaluate seizure frequency and adverse events, so that it was impossible to summarize data in a meta-analysis. It is not possible to draw any conclusion about the role of melatonin in reducing seizure frequency or improving quality of life in people with epilepsy.

Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWDs) pharmacotherapy — melatonin dosing range, variability, and oversight are outlined: Inter-study medication comparisons will require equivalent dosing, with analyzed melatonin study doses ranged from 0.3–10.0 mg, and this guideline does not address specific medication/supplement doses. Optimal dosing may vary between CRSWDs, and inter-individual differences may exist within singular CRSWDs, including a study of N24SWD subjects that showed a tenfold variation in entraining doses. Melatonin supplements are not subject to FDA oversight, and safety concerns are noted particularly among children and those of reproductive age.

### Apixaban dosing in hemodialysis-can drug level monitoring mitigate controversies? [^112g1uki]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Apixaban has emerged as a safe and practicable alternative to vitamin K antagonists. In patients on hemodialysis however, use and dosing of apixaban are controversial.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved apixaban for use in patients on hemodialysis. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) vote against its use in this population. Other authorities like the American College of Cardiology and the Heart Rhythm Society (AHA/ACC/HRS) or the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies of Germany (AWMF) take intermediate positions refraining from a contraindication but referring to the moderate quality of evidence.

Pharmacokinetic properties that encourage the use of apixaban in patients on hemodialysis are considerable non-renal excretion (73%) lack of active metabolites and partial removal by hemodialysis. However, high plasma protein binding (87%) and a large volume of distribution (21 L) limit effective clearance increasing the risk of accumulation.

Results from cohort studies and from the AXADIA-AFNET 8 trial showed superiority and non-inferiority respectively, comparing apixaban to vitamin K antagonists in patients on hemodialysis. However, the evidence regarding appropriate dosing is contradictory with suggestions of 5 mg twice daily, 2.5 mg twice daily, or no respective difference. In addition, even 2.5mg once daily might be considered, as inter-individual variability of drug level is high, serious bleedings do occur with 2.5 mg twice-daily and prophylactic indications (e.g. access flow difficulties) are known challenges.

As a result, clinicians are faced with the conundrum of implementing a promising therapy without indubitable evidence regarding efficacy, dosing and safety. This is reflected by frequent off-label under-dosing making investigations regarding appropriate dosing and risk of accumulation an unmet need.

Drug monitoring is a legitimate approach to approximate a patient's risk of an overtly strong or rather weak exposure to anticoagulant effect under a given dose. However, only three studies with very few patients have been providing apixaban trough levels in patients on hemodialysis so far with none of them investigating a dose of 2.5 mg once daily.

Here we provide results from a 5 years apixaban drug-monitoring program. We investigated drug levels from different dosing regimens, associated factors, risk factors for accumulation, bleeding risk and we provide comparative data from non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) reference populations.

### Fear of the dark: concomitant use of direct oral anticoagulants and antiseizure medications [^112T8XeF]. Epilepsy Currents (2024). Medium credibility.

Commentary

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been introduced to the market in 2010. These are either direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran) or FXa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban). Compared to heparin and vitamin K antagonists, DOACs have demonstrated (at least) equal efficacy, favorable safety profile, and ease of use due to their rapid onset of action, acceptable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, fixed dosing, no monitoring requirement, and fewer drug/disease/dietary interactions. Hence, they have largely replaced such traditional therapeutic options for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF) and venous thromboembolism. That is particularly relevant to persons with epilepsy (PWE), since arterial and venous strokes are frequent culprits of seizures, and the risk of venous thromboembolism is higher in PWE compared to the general population. Such patients are also at higher risk of falls, which could result in detrimental hemorrhages, particularly in the case of supratherapeutic anticoagulant plasma concentrations (PCs).

### Nightly treatment of primary insomnia with prolonged release melatonin for 6 months: a randomized placebo controlled trial on age and endogenous melatonin as predictors of efficacy and safety [^11348JXK]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group clinical trial comprising a 2-week, single-blind, placebo run-in period (Baseline), a 3-week double-blind treatment period (treatment weeks 1–3) followed by a 26- week double-blind extension period (treatment weeks 4 to 29) in which patients were randomized to receive PRM (Circadin ® 2 mg, Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Tel Aviv, Israel) or placebo, given orally as one tablet per day 2 h before bedtime, and a 2-week single-blind placebo run-out period (withdrawal). The study protocol and relevant documents were approved by Huntingdon Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee, Cambridge, UK. Participants provided written informed consent.

Study subjects

Patients were recruited from Glasgow and the surrounding areas (West of Scotland) and were pre-screened by telephone using the Sleep History Questionnaire (SHQ) within 1 month of the baseline screening visit. The SHQ was adapted from The Management of Insomnia Guidelines for Clinical Practice and resembled that recommended by Clinical Practice Guideline - Adult Insomnia. Suitable patients were invited to Visit 1 during which they were consented and assessed for inclusion.

Men and women aged between 18 and 80 years suffering from primary insomnia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria with sleep latency longer than 20 min were included in the study.

The major exclusion criteria for the study included the use of benzodiazepine or non-benzodiazepine hypnotics within the previous 2 weeks or any psychoactive treatment within the previous 3 months, sleep disorders associated with a psychiatric disorder (for example, depression, anxiety, dementia), sleep disorders secondary to another medical condition (for example, sleep apnoea, circadian rhythm sleep disorder), use of prohibited concomitant medication [psychotropic treatments - neuroleptics, antiepileptics, barbiturates, antidepressants, anxiolytics and lithium, first generation antihistamines, hypnotics or treatments used as a hypnotic (for example, all benzodiazepines, zopiclone, zolpidem and zaleplon, barbiturates, buspirone and hydroxyzine)] or excessive alcohol consumption, any chronic medical condition that was likely to be the cause of the sleep problem (for example, chronic pain, benign prostatic hypertrophy) or might interfere with the conduct of the study or a lifestyle likely to interfere with sleep patterns (for example, shift work, jet-lag).

5.1 Increased Risk of Thrombotic Events after Premature Discontinuation

Premature discontinuation of any oral anticoagulant, including ELIQUIS, in the absence of adequate alternative anticoagulation increases the risk of thrombotic events. An increased rate of stroke was observed during the transition from ELIQUIS to warfarin in clinical trials in atrial fibrillation patients. If ELIQUIS is discontinued for a reason other than pathological bleeding or completion of a course of therapy, consider coverage with another anticoagulant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Melatonin for blood pressure control in adults [^116tQxyV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

We will assess the impact of oral melatonin supplementation (IR and CR/SR) on BP‐related and patient‑important outcomes. These outcomes are categorised as 'critical' or 'important' based on their relevance to clinical decision‐making regarding melatonin's impact on BP. Unless otherwise specified, outcomes will be measured as the change from baseline at the end of the intervention period (end‐of‐treatment). We will extract data as the mean change from baseline to end‐of‐treatment.

Critical outcomes

The critical outcomes of this review are changes from baseline at the end of treatment in the following: SBP in mmHg, DBP in mmHg, and incidence of adverse events (SAEs; common non‑serious AEs such as headache, dizziness, nausea).

Important outcomes

Important outcomes include relevant physiological measures, patient‐reported outcomes, safety data, and longer‐term effects, as follows.

Change in MAP (mmHg)
Change in PP (mmHg)
Nocturnal BP dipping (assessed as percentage or absolute change from baseline to end‐of‐treatment)
Quality of life (QoL) (assessed using validated generic questionnaires (e.g. 36‐Item Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36), EQ‐5D), measured as mean change from baseline score at end‐of‐treatment)
Sleep quality (assessed using validated questionnaires (e.g. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)), measured as mean change from baseline score at end‐of‐treatment)
Heart rate (measured in beats per minute at end‐of‐treatment)
24‑hour BP variability metrics
Long‐term outcomes: assessed as incidence of events or survival at follow‐up exceeding 13 weeks (> 13 weeks post‐intervention start): incident heart disease (e.g. heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease); incident comorbid conditions (e.g. renal failure); all‐cause mortality/survival.

Timing of outcome assessment: we will assess outcomes (BP changes, adverse events, QoL, sleep) at the final time point reported during the intervention period (end‐of‐treatment). We will define follow‐up as short‐term (≤ 6 weeks), mid‐term (> 6 weeks to ≤ 13 weeks), and long‐term (> 13 weeks). Long‐term outcomes (incident CVD, etc.) will be extracted if reported at long‐term follow‐up (i.e. > 13 weeks post‐intervention start).

### Melatonin for blood pressure control in adults [^112nRDAG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk of bias assessment in included studies

Two review authors will independently assess risk of bias in included RCTs using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, which will be complemented by the ROB‐ME tool. Any disagreements will be resolved through discussion or in consultation with a third review author. The risk of bias assessment will inform the GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence.

In line with the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, the effect of interest in this review is defined as the effect of assignment to the intervention at baseline, irrespective of adherence to the intervention protocol. Accordingly, the RoB 2 tool will be applied to assess risk of bias for the intention‐to‐treat effect. This approach is consistent with the review's objective to assess the effectiveness of oral melatonin supplementation under real‐world conditions.

We will assess risk of bias using the RoB 2 tool for all critical and important outcomes that contribute to the summary of findings table (see Certainty of the evidence assessment). We will also assess risk of bias for long‐term cardiovascular outcomes where applicable.

The RoB 2 tool evaluates bias across the following five domains.

Bias arising from the randomisation process
Bias due to deviations from the intended interventions
Bias due to missing outcome data
Bias in measurement of the outcome
Bias in selection of the reported result

For each domain and for the overall risk of bias, we will assign one of the following judgements: low risk of bias, some concerns, or high risk of bias. These judgements will be based on responses to the signalling questions within each domain, using the tool's decision algorithms. We will determine the overall risk of bias for each outcome as follows:

low risk of bias: all domains are judged to be at low risk of bias;
some concerns: at least one domain raises some concerns, and none are at high risk of bias;
high risk of bias: one or more domains are rated as at high risk of bias, or if multiple domains raise some concerns.

### Managing cluster headache [^1167mHjp]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Melatonin

There are many plausible theories to explain the potential link between melatonin and cluster headache attacks. Melatonin 10 mg at night can help to prevent attacks of episodic cluster headache, however, a trial of melatonin in chronic cluster headachecould not reproduce that positive effect. However, one might argue that the formulation used or the timing of dosing might have been confounding factors.

Due to its tolerable side effect profile, melatonin is still widely used in preventing cluster headache, at doses between 10 and 25 mg in the evening.

Topiramate

The evidence for efficacy of topiramate in preventing cluster headache is limited to an open-label study using high doses (100–200 mg/day) with reported good efficacy in up to more than two thirds of patients.

Side effects are major hurdle for topiramate use, in particular cognitive slowing, teratogenicity, nephrolithiasis and low mood as well as its potential effect on oral contraceptive efficacy, which can be a significant factor on preventive choice.

When to stop preventive therapy

There is no clear guideline on how long to continue oral preventive therapy; it is generally accepted that preventive therapy should continue for up 4 weeks after attacks have settled, as evidenced by lack of 'shadows' or response to triggers, or after the usual length of the bout.

Patients' experience with their previous bouts can guide the decision to stop preventive therapy in episodic cluster headache. It is important to stop preventive treatment after each bout and not to have patients simply continue, given the wide range of side effects as well as the possibility of losing efficacy. When restarting a preventive such as verapamil for future bouts, there is usually no need to retitrate; provided the baseline ECG is normal, patients can be restarted at the dose that was effective for the last bout.
