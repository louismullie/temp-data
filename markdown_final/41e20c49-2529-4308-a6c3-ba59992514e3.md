## Question

How do I monitor INR levels in patients taking Coumadin?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to monitor INR levels in patients on warfarin (Coumadin). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about establishing the therapeutic INR target by indication. Then, I should verify the initial monitoring cadence during dose titration. Next, I will review maintenance-phase monitoring intervals and when to shorten or extend them. After that, I need to check special populations and high-risk scenarios that require intensified surveillance. I will then examine patient self-testing and self-management options. I should also confirm how to handle out-of-range INRs, including when to use vitamin K and reversal strategies. Finally, I will integrate quality metrics like time in therapeutic range and summarize a practical algorithm with key safety checks and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic INR targets by indication, because dosing adjustments hinge on this. For most indications, including venous thromboembolism and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, the target INR is 2.5 with a therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0, and an INR above 4.0 generally adds bleeding risk without added benefit, so I should keep that upper bound in mind when interpreting results [^113BLMww] [^1118gs1J] [^117Dzg8L]. For mechanical heart valves, higher targets may be required depending on valve type and patient factors, but I need to ensure I am aligning with cardiology guidance rather than assuming a one-size-fits-all number here [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the initiation monitoring cadence, because early INR kinetics can be misleading. The FDA labeling advises checking INR daily after the first dose until the INR stabilizes within the therapeutic range, which typically takes several days to a week depending on patient factors and concomitant therapies, and I should not jump to conclusions about steady state before at least 3 to 5 days of consistent results in range [^115DmFRV] [^117EdQWf]. Hold on, I should also remember that early INR changes largely reflect factor VII depletion, so I need to be cautious interpreting early values and correlate with clinical context and overlapping anticoagulation if used [^112ML7w1].

> Next, I should review the maintenance-phase monitoring intervals. Once INR is stable, periodic INR checks every 1 to 4 weeks are generally acceptable, but I need to ensure I tailor frequency to clinical stability and risk of fluctuation, with more frequent checks if the patient is unstable or interacting medications change [^115DmFRV] [^117EdQWf]. I should double-check whether longer intervals are safe in truly stable patients; ACCP suggests that in patients with consistently stable INRs, extending to every 12 weeks can be reasonable, and a randomized trial showed noninferior time in therapeutic range with 12-week dosing assessments compared with 4-week assessments, though patients were still contacted every 4 weeks in that study, so I should not overgeneralize without structured follow-up in place [^116Fi8pZ] [^1179VRtY] [^113YjVYh].

> I need to ensure I identify scenarios that mandate more frequent monitoring, and I should verify each against labeling and guidelines. Let me consider high-risk populations first: patients aged 60 years or older often have greater INR sensitivity, so I should monitor more frequently and consider lower initiation and maintenance doses, and the same applies to hepatic impairment where warfarin effect is potentiated and INR lability is common [^111CAbSX] [^116Lrhia]. Renal impairment does not require dose adjustment, but I should still increase INR monitoring frequency because of overall bleeding risk and comorbidity burden, and I should also intensify checks during initiation or changes of interacting drugs, with botanicals, antibiotics, and amiodarone being frequent culprits [^115DmFRV] [^111eVQ47] [^112R6hHv]. But wait, what if the patient is hospitalized and doses are changing rapidly? Daily INR monitoring is prudent in inpatients until stable, and missing INR checks has been associated with supratherapeutic INRs and adverse events, so I should not skip days early in the course [^116aPtzG] [^1138q14k].

> Let me think about patient self-testing and self-management, because these can improve time in therapeutic range and reduce adverse events when implemented correctly. I should confirm that guidelines support patient self-management for motivated, competent patients, and that structured training and validated algorithms are essential to success; randomized data show improved outcomes with self-management, though uptake and dropout can be barriers in real-world settings [^111HxQxc] [^113qPFxy] [^115WzQLR]. I should also verify device considerations: FDA-cleared INR meters are available for home use, but quality control, correlation with laboratory INR, and clear dosing protocols are critical to safe implementation, and I need to ensure patients know when to escalate concerns despite home results [^115NWhkq] [^114cRU6Q].

> Hold on, I should verify how to handle out-of-range INR results, because this is where errors often occur. For a single subtherapeutic INR in an otherwise stable patient, I should avoid knee-jerk dose increases and instead recheck within 1 to 2 weeks, and I should not routinely bridge with heparin unless there is a compelling short-term indication, as bridging can increase bleeding without clear benefit in this scenario [^116Fi8pZ]. For supratherapeutic INR without bleeding, I should withhold 1 to 2 doses and reduce the maintenance dose, and if INR is above 5.0, I should consider oral vitamin K to expedite correction, recognizing that vitamin K may blunt subsequent warfarin response and that dose choice should reflect urgency and bleeding risk [^113F3oUj] [^1174t4EA]. If there is major bleeding or a need for rapid reversal, I should confirm that 4-factor PCC is preferred over FFP in most settings, with vitamin K co-administration, and reserve FFP or activated factor VII for exceptional circumstances given thrombosis and infection risks [^113NHhBh] [^1168hT6z].

> I should double-check the quality metrics that correlate with outcomes, because they guide how aggressively I chase lability. Time in therapeutic range of at least 70 percent is associated with lower risks of stroke, major bleeding, and mortality, and INR variance and maximum INR also track with bleeding risk, so I need to monitor TTR over rolling intervals and intervene when control deteriorates, including considering a switch to DOACs if warfarin control remains poor despite best practices [^115cfcR4] [^112k6c2H] [^112TxVtd]. Let me reconsider whether I am documenting TTR consistently in clinic notes; failing to track TTR can mask deteriorating control and delay necessary adjustments or transitions [^115cfcR4].

> Next, I should review practical operational steps that reduce errors and delays. I need to ensure a standardized process for ordering, reporting, and acting on INR results, with clear dose-adjustment algorithms and timely communication to patients, because delays in dose changes increase time outside range and adverse events; anticoagulation management services and decision-support tools can improve TTR and reduce clinician burden, and I should leverage them when available [^113qPFxy] [^111CUrYM]. I should confirm that patients receive education on adherence, diet consistency with vitamin K intake, and recognition of bleeding signs, and I should reconcile medications at every visit to catch new interactions early [^115DmFRV] [^111eVQ47].

> Let me synthesize a concise clinical algorithm and sanity-check each step. Establish indication-specific INR targets, typically 2.0 to 3.0, and document the goal clearly; during initiation, check INR daily until stable in range for at least 2 consecutive days; in maintenance, check every 1 to 4 weeks, extending to 12 weeks only in highly stable patients with structured follow-up; intensify to weekly or more often in older adults, hepatic or renal impairment, interacting drugs, dietary changes, or labile INRs; consider patient self-testing or self-management for motivated patients with appropriate training; manage out-of-range INRs with rechecks, dose holds, and vitamin K as indicated, escalating to PCC-based reversal for bleeding; and track TTR with a goal of at least 70 percent, intervening when control worsens or remains suboptimal despite optimization [^113BLMww] [^115DmFRV] [^116aPtzG] [^116Fi8pZ] [^111HxQxc] [^113NHhBh] [^115cfcR4].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan aligns with contemporary guideline direction and acknowledge trade-offs. While DOACs are often preferred for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation due to fewer interactions and no routine monitoring, warfarin remains essential for mechanical valves, valvular AF, antiphospholipid syndrome, severe renal failure, cost constraints, and certain drug–drug interaction profiles; in these settings, meticulous INR monitoring and quality-improvement infrastructure are indispensable to safe and effective care [^116xQZ8f].

Monitor INR in Coumadin patients by checking **INR every 2–3 days initially** until stable, then **every 1–4 weeks** once stable, and **daily if INR is > 4.0 or if bleeding occurs** [^115DmFRV] [^117EdQWf]. Use **point-of-care or laboratory INR testing**, and increase frequency with **diet changes, new medications, or illness** [^115NWhkq] [^115DmFRV]. Target INR is 2.0–3.0 for most indications; adjust dose based on INR and clinical context, and educate patients on signs of bleeding and when to seek care [^1118gs1J] [^113BLMww] [^115GCbiu].

---

## Initial INR monitoring frequency

During initiation, **daily INR checks** are recommended after the first dose until the INR stabilizes within the therapeutic range [^115DmFRV] [^117EdQWf]. Once stable, **every 1–4 weeks** is appropriate, tailored to clinical context and patient stability [^115DmFRV] [^117EdQWf].

---

## Factors influencing INR monitoring frequency

Several factors necessitate **more frequent INR monitoring**:

- **Dietary changes**: Inconsistent vitamin K intake can alter INR [^111eVQ47] [^112R6hHv].
- **Medication changes**: New or discontinued drugs (e.g. antibiotics, antifungals, NSAIDs) can interact with warfarin [^115DmFRV] [^114QQLNE].
- **Illness or infection**: Acute illness, diarrhea, or liver dysfunction can affect INR [^111T4NVD].
- **Alcohol consumption**: Excess alcohol increases bleeding risk and INR variability [^notfound].

---

## Target INR ranges

The therapeutic INR range **varies by indication**:

| **Indication** | **Target inr range** |
|-|-|
| Atrial fibrillation | 2.0–3.0 [^1118gs1J] [^117Dzg8L] |
| Venous thromboembolism (VTE) | 2.0–3.0 [^113BLMww] [^112yVtAk] |
| Mechanical heart valves | 2.5–3.5 (varies by valve type) [^notfound] |

---

## INR testing methods

INR can be measured by **laboratory INR testing** — the gold standard using venous blood sent to a certified laboratory — or by **point-of-care (POC) testing** using fingerstick capillary blood, providing rapid results and enabling home monitoring [^115NWhkq] [^114cRU6Q].

---

## Management of out-of-range INR values

### INR above therapeutic range (supratherapeutic)

- **INR 3.0–4.5**: Hold or reduce next dose; recheck INR within 1–3 days [^notfound].
- **INR 4.5–10.0**: Hold warfarin; consider oral vitamin K (1–2.5 mg) if bleeding risk is high [^notfound].
- **INR > 10.0**: Hold warfarin; administer oral vitamin K (2.5–5 mg); monitor closely [^notfound].

---

### INR below therapeutic range (subtherapeutic)

For subtherapeutic INR, **increase dose** based on current INR and clinical context, then **recheck INR** within 2–4 days after the adjustment [^113BLMww].

---

## Patient education and self-monitoring

Patient education should cover **signs of bleeding** (bruising, nosebleeds, hematuria, melena) and when to seek care [^115GCbiu] [^1168hT6z]. Self-monitoring with POC devices can improve time in therapeutic range and reduce adverse events in appropriately selected and trained patients [^113NHhBh] [^115WzQLR].

---

## Documentation and communication

Documentation should record **INR results, dose changes, and patient counseling** at each visit [^113qPFxy]. Communication with the healthcare team should be **clear and timely**, especially during medication or dietary changes [^113qPFxy] [^115DmFRV].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with INR monitoring

Effective INR monitoring is associated with **reduced thromboembolic events** — maintaining therapeutic INR lowers stroke and VTE recurrence [^116xQZ8f] [^1118gs1J]. It also reduces bleeding complications, as regular monitoring and dose adjustment lower major bleeding risk [^112k6c2H] [^115cfcR4].

---

## Challenges and limitations

Key challenges include **patient adherence** — inconsistent testing and dosing reduce time in range — and **resource constraints**, as frequent monitoring requires infrastructure and trained personnel [^116aPtzG] [^115DmFRV].

---

Effective Coumadin management requires **regular INR monitoring**, patient education, and coordinated care to balance thromboembolic protection with bleeding risk.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

Warfarin sodium has a narrow therapeutic range (index), and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during warfarin sodium therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with warfarin sodium, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of warfarin sodium therapy.

2.5 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.6 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of warfarin sodium persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of warfarin sodium at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.7 Treatment During Dentistry and Surgery

Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of warfarin sodium therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing warfarin sodium even for a short period of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of warfarin sodium to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis, 1885 patients (24.4%) were 65 years and older, while 185 patients (2.4%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Warfarin sodium is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with senility. Conduct more frequent monitoring for bleeding with administration of warfarin sodium to elderly patients in any situation or with any physical condition where added risk of hemorrhage is present. Consider lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin sodium in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Renal clearance is considered to be a minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment. Instruct patients with renal impairment taking warfarin to monitor their INR more frequently [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Hepatic impairment can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin. Conduct more frequent monitoring for bleeding when using warfarin sodium in these patients.

2.3 Initial and Maintenance Dosing

The appropriate initial dosing of warfarin sodium varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by:

Clinical factors including age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities
Genetic factors (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]

Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.

Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype

If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of warfarin sodium is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient's dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily.

Dosing Recommendations with Consideration of Genotype

Table 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance warfarin sodium doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. If the patient's CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/✱3, *2/✱2, *2/✱3, and *3/✱3 may require more prolonged time (> 2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants.

### Home prothrombin time monitoring: a literature analysis [^114cRU6Q]. American Journal of Hematology (2004). Low credibility.

The anticoagulant activity of warfarin sodium is monitored by the prothrombin time (PT) using the international normalized ratio (INR). Standard oral anticoagulant therapy monitoring requires frequent patient visits to physicians' offices and/or laboratories to optimize warfarin dosage. Home PT monitoring by patients can increase testing frequency and may thus decrease complications associated with oral anticoagulant therapy. Clinical studies suggest that home PT monitoring is more effective than uncoordinated management and is as effective as care through specialized anticoagulation clinics for keeping INRs within a therapeutic range. There are accurate and reliable instruments available, but paramount to the success of home PT monitoring is sound patient selection, appropriate patient training, and consistent quality control.

2.1 Individualized Dosing

The dosage and administration of COUMADIN must be individualized for each patient according to the patient's INR response to the drug. Adjust the dose based on the patient's INR and the condition being treated. Consult the latest evidence-based clinical practice guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) to assist in the determination of the duration and intensity of anticoagulation with COUMADIN [see References (15)].

2.2 Recommended Target INR Ranges and Durations for Individual Indications

An INR of greater than 4.0 appears to provide no additional therapeutic benefit in most patients and is associated with a higher risk of bleeding.

Venous Thromboembolism (including deep venous thrombosis [DVT] and PE)

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0–3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

Adjust the warfarin dose to maintain a target INR of 2.5 (INR range, 2.0 to 3.0) for all treatment durations. The duration of treatment is based on the indication as follows:

For patients with a DVT or PE secondary to a transient (reversible) risk factor, treatment with warfarin for 3 months is recommended.
For patients with an unprovoked DVT or PE, treatment with warfarin is recommended for at least 3 months. After 3 months of therapy, evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of long-term treatment for the individual patient.
For patients with two episodes of unprovoked DVT or PE, long-term treatment with warfarin is recommended. For a patient receiving long-term anticoagulant treatment, periodically reassess the risk-benefit ratio of continuing such treatment in the individual patient.

2.3 Initial and Maintenance Dosing

The appropriate initial dosing of COUMADIN varies widely for different patients. Not all factors responsible for warfarin dose variability are known, and the initial dose is influenced by:

Clinical factors including age, race, body weight, sex, concomitant medications, and comorbidities
Genetic factors (CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]

Select the initial dose based on the expected maintenance dose, taking into account the above factors. Modify this dose based on consideration of patient-specific clinical factors. Consider lower initial and maintenance doses for elderly and/or debilitated patients and in Asian patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Routine use of loading doses is not recommended as this practice may increase hemorrhagic and other complications and does not offer more rapid protection against clot formation.

Individualize the duration of therapy for each patient. In general, anticoagulant therapy should be continued until the danger of thrombosis and embolism has passed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Dosing Recommendations without Consideration of Genotype

If the patient's CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes are not known, the initial dose of COUMADIN is usually 2 to 5 mg once daily. Determine each patient's dosing needs by close monitoring of the INR response and consideration of the indication being treated. Typical maintenance doses are 2 to 10 mg once daily.

Dosing Recommendations with Consideration of Genotype

Table 1 displays three ranges of expected maintenance COUMADIN doses observed in subgroups of patients having different combinations of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. If the patient's CYP2C9 and/or VKORC1 genotype are known, consider these ranges in choosing the initial dose. Patients with CYP2C9 *1/✱3, *2/✱2, *2/✱3, and *3/✱3 may require more prolonged time (> 2 to 4 weeks) to achieve maximum INR effect for a given dosage regimen than patients without these CYP variants.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

COUMADIN is a narrow therapeutic range (index) drug, and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during COUMADIN therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with COUMADIN, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of COUMADIN therapy.

2.5 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of COUMADIN persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of COUMADIN at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.6 Intravenous Route of Administration

The intravenous dose of COUMADIN is the same as the oral dose. After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection should be administered as a slow bolus injection into a peripheral vein over 1 to 2 minutes. COUMADIN for injection is not recommended for intramuscular administration.

Reconstitute the vial with 2.7 mL of Sterile Water for Injection. The resulting yield is 2.5 mL of a 2 mg per mL solution (5 mg total). Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is noted.

After reconstitution, COUMADIN for injection is stable for 4 hours at room temperature. It does not contain any antimicrobial preservative and, thus, care must be taken to assure the sterility of the prepared solution. The vial is for single use only, and any unused solution should be discarded.

2.4 Monitoring to Achieve Optimal Anticoagulation

JANTOVEN has a narrow therapeutic range (index), and its action may be affected by factors such as other drugs and dietary vitamin K. Therefore, anticoagulation must be carefully monitored during JANTOVEN therapy. Determine the INR daily after the administration of the initial dose until INR results stabilize in the therapeutic range. After stabilization, maintain dosing within the therapeutic range by performing periodic INRs. The frequency of performing INR should be based on the clinical situation but generally acceptable intervals for INR determinations are 1 to 4 weeks. Perform additional INR tests when other warfarin products are interchanged with JANTOVEN, as well as whenever other medications are initiated, discontinued, or taken irregularly. Heparin, a common concomitant drug, increases the INR [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Determinations of whole blood clotting and bleeding times are not effective measures for monitoring of JANTOVEN therapy.

2.5 Renal Impairment

No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal failure. Monitor INR more frequently in patients with compromised renal function to maintain INR within the therapeutic range [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

2.6 Missed Dose

The anticoagulant effect of JANTOVEN persists beyond 24 hours. If a patient misses a dose of JANTOVEN at the intended time of day, the patient should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day. The patient should not double the dose the next day to make up for a missed dose.

2.7 Treatment during Dentistry and Surgery

Some dental or surgical procedures may necessitate the interruption or change in the dose of JANTOVEN therapy. Consider the benefits and risks when discontinuing JANTOVEN even for a short period of time. Determine the INR immediately prior to any dental or surgical procedure. In patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures who must be anticoagulated prior to, during, or immediately following these procedures, adjusting the dosage of JANTOVEN to maintain the INR at the low end of the therapeutic range may safely allow for continued anticoagulation.

### Warfarin sodium [^111DZx4b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Hemorrhage

Warfarin sodium can cause major or fatal bleeding. Bleeding is more likely to occur within the first month. Risk factors for bleeding include high intensity of anticoagulation (INR > 4.0), age greater than or equal to 65, history of highly variable INRs, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, anemia, malignancy, trauma, renal impairment, certain genetic factors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)], certain concomitant drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)], and long duration of warfarin therapy.

Perform regular monitoring of INR in all treated patients. Those at high risk of bleeding may benefit from more frequent INR monitoring, careful dose adjustment to desired INR, and a shortest duration of therapy appropriate for the clinical condition. However, maintenance of INR in the therapeutic range does not eliminate the risk of bleeding.

Drugs, dietary changes, and other factors affect INR levels achieved with warfarin sodium therapy. Perform more frequent INR monitoring when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Instruct patients about prevention measures to minimize risk of bleeding and to report signs and symptoms of bleeding [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.2 Tissue Necrosis

Warfarin sodium can cause necrosis and/or gangrene of skin and other tissues, which is an uncommon but serious risk (< 0.1%). Necrosis may be associated with local thrombosis and usually appears within a few days of the start of warfarin sodium therapy. In severe cases of necrosis, treatment through debridement or amputation of the affected tissue, limb, breast, or penis has been reported.

Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine whether necrosis is caused by an underlying disease. Although various treatments have been attempted, no treatment for necrosis has been considered uniformly effective. Discontinue warfarin sodium therapy if necrosis occurs. Consider alternative drugs if continued anticoagulation therapy is necessary.

5.3 Calciphylaxis

Warfarin sodium can cause fatal and serious calciphylaxis or calcium uremic arteriolopathy, which has been reported in patients with and without end-stage renal disease. When calciphylaxis is diagnosed in these patients, discontinue warfarin sodium and treat calciphylaxis as appropriate. Consider alternative anticoagulation therapy.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^111eVQ47]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods

More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals.

Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation.

Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g., garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q10, St. John's wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John's wort).

The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.

### Warfarin dose assessment every 4 weeks versus every 12 weeks in patients with stable international normalized ratios: a randomized trial [^113YjVYh]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Guidelines recommend that patients receiving warfarin undergo international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring every 4 weeks.

Objective

To investigate whether assessment of warfarin dosing every 12 weeks is as safe as assessment every 4 weeks.

Design

Noninferiority randomized trial. The randomization schedule (in a 1:1 ratio) was computer-generated, and allocation was concealed until the database was locked by using a centralized schedule. Patients, study and clinical personnel, adjudicators of clinical events, and the study statistician were blinded to treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov registration number: NCT00356759) SETTING: Single center in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

Patients

250 patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, whose dose was unchanged for at least 6 months; 226 completed the study.

Intervention

Dosing assessment every 12 weeks (n = 124) compared with every 4 weeks (n = 126) for 12 months. Patients in the 12-week group were tested every 4 weeks; sham INRs within the target range were reported for two of the three 4-week periods.

Measurements

Percentage of time in the therapeutic range (primary outcome) and number of extreme INRs, changes in maintenance dose, major bleeding events, objectively verified thromboembolism, and death (secondary outcomes).

Results

The percentage of time in the therapeutic range was 74.1% (SD, 18.8%) in the 4-week group compared with 71.6% (SD, 20.0%) in the 12-week group (absolute difference, 2.5 percentage points [1-sided 97.5% upper confidence bound, 7.3 percentage points]; noninferiority P = 0.020 for a 7.5-percentage point margin). Fewer patients in the 12-week group than in the 4-week group had any dose changes (37.1% vs. 55.6%; absolute difference, 18.5 percentage points [95% CI, 6.1 to 30.0 percentage points]; P = 0.004). Secondary outcomes did not differ between groups.

Limitations

Patients in the 12-week group had testing and contact with clinic staff every 4 weeks. The study was conducted at a single center and used surrogate outcomes.

Conclusion

Assessment of warfarin dosing every 12 weeks seems to be safe and noninferior to assessment every 4 weeks. A comparison of INR testing, patient contact, and warfarin dose assessment every 12 weeks versus every 4 weeks is necessary before INR testing every 12 weeks can be routinely recommended for practice.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency is outlined for inpatient and outpatient care, with randomized and observational data on testing intervals: In hospitalized patients, INR monitoring is usually performed daily until the therapeutic range has been achieved and maintained for at least 2 consecutive days, and in outpatients starting VKA therapy, initial monitoring may be reduced to once every few days until a stable dose response has been achieved. When the INR response is stable, the frequency of testing can be reduced to intervals as long as every 4 to 6 weeks (or possibly longer in particularly stable patients). In a randomized comparison of monitoring intervals in stable mechanical valve patients, there were no differences of time in, above, or below range between 6‑week and 4‑week groups, with actual monitoring intervals of 24.9 days vs 22.5 days (P < .0003). In a retrospective cohort of > 4,000 patients with chronic AF and > 250,000 INRs, time in range increased as the interval decreased from every 5 weeks or more to every 3 weeks (41% to 45%, P < .0005), and investigators suggested that patients should be monitored at time intervals no longer than every 3 weeks; however, the strength of this recommendation is reduced by the very poor TTR reported in both arms of the study.

### Apixaban monitoring: the jury is still Out [^114JLzB2]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines recommend using a direct-acting oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in preference to warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and a CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score of 2 or higher. This recommendation is based on consistent findings from a series of large randomized trials demonstrating equivalent or superior efficacy of DOACs relative to warfarin in preventing stroke coupled with a lower risk for major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage. Clinically, DOACs are more convenient than warfarin for both clinicians and patients because they do not require routine monitoring and they have far fewer interactions with other medications and foods.

Yet, despite the favorable risk-benefit profile of DOACs, patients taking these medications remain at risk for stroke and bleeding complications. In the ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction In Stroke and Other ThromboemboLic Events in Atrial Fibrillation) trial, for example, patients randomized to apixaban experienced an annual stroke rate of 1.19% and an annual rate of major bleeding of 2.13%. In patients taking warfarin, it is well established that a subtherapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) is associated with an increased risk for stroke, while the risk for major bleeding rises progressively as the INR exceeds the therapeutic range. This suggests that some stroke events in patients taking DOACs may be linked to inadequate anticoagulation and that some bleeding events may be associated with excess anticoagulation. This in turn invites the question of whether monitoring DOAC levels, at least in selected patients at high risk for stroke or bleeding, would translate to improved outcomes for patients with NVAF.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Adequate and well-controlled studies with COUMADIN have not been conducted in any pediatric population, and the optimum dosing, safety, and efficacy in pediatric patients is unknown. Pediatric use of COUMADIN is based on adult data and recommendations, and available limited pediatric data from observational studies and patient registries. Pediatric patients administered COUMADIN should avoid any activity or sport that may result in traumatic injury.

The developing hemostatic system in infants and children results in a changing physiology of thrombosis and response to anticoagulants. Dosing of warfarin in the pediatric population varies by patient age, with infants generally having the highest, and adolescents having the lowest milligram per kilogram dose requirements to maintain target INRs. Because of changing warfarin requirements due to age, concomitant medications, diet, and existing medical condition, target INR ranges may be difficult to achieve and maintain in pediatric patients, and more frequent INR determinations are recommended. Bleeding rates varied by patient population and clinical care center in pediatric observational studies and patient registries.

Infants and children receiving vitamin K-supplemented nutrition, including infant formulas, may be resistant to warfarin therapy, while human milk-fed infants may be sensitive to warfarin therapy.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of patients receiving warfarin sodium in controlled clinical trials for which data were available for analysis, 1885 patients (24.4%) were 65 years and older, while 185 patients (2.4%) were 75 years and older. No overall differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Patients 60 years or older appear to exhibit greater than expected INR response to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. COUMADIN is contraindicated in any unsupervised patient with senility. Observe caution with administration of COUMADIN to elderly patients in any situation or with any physical condition where added risk of hemorrhage is present. Consider lower initiation and maintenance doses of COUMADIN in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Renal clearance is considered to be a minor determinant of anticoagulant response to warfarin. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with renal impairment.

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

Hepatic impairment can potentiate the response to warfarin through impaired synthesis of clotting factors and decreased metabolism of warfarin. Use caution when using COUMADIN in these patients.

### Optimizing use of current anticoagulants [^113JMyLa]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Although warfarin has been the mainstay of oral anticoagulation therapy for decades, evidence-based methods for improving the quality of warfarin therapy remain underused. The arrival of new anticoagulants that do not require routine laboratory monitoring and lack the significant dietary and drug interaction potential that are seen with warfarin is an important evolutionary step in the management of thromboembolic disease. However, it will be years before the efficacy and long-term safety of these new agents are defined. Newer oral anticoagulants will be more expensive than generic warfarin. This article examines various approaches to optimize the clinical use of warfarin. For patients able to achieve stable anticoagulation control, warfarin remains an important therapeutic option, delivering similar clinical outcomes at a fraction of the cost to the health care system.

### Self-monitoring for patients on warfarin? [^112VVEzD]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2009). Low credibility.

One estimate suggests that at least 1 million people in the UK are on the anticoagulant warfarin.1 This number could increase as more people are treated with the drug for atrial fibrillation and as the elderly population increases.1 Careful control of anticoagulation is essential with warfarin therapy and, traditionally, patients on the drug have had to travel to a clinic to have their blood coagulation time tested. However, the availability of portable self-testing machines makes it possible for some patients to monitor their blood coagulation time at home. Here we examine the evidence on the efficacy and safety of such self-monitoring and consider which patients it most suits and whether more widespread use of the approach is justified.

### Role of the anticoagulant monitoring service in 2018: beyond warfarin [^1138h2jj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have a wide therapeutic index, few drug interaction, no dietary interactions and do not require dose adjustment according to the results of routine coagulation testing. Despite these advantages over warfarin, the DOACs remain high risk medications. There is evidence that non-adherence, off-label dosing and inadequate care transitions during DOAC therapy increase the risk of bleeding and thromboembolic complications. Although DOACs are approved for a growing number of indications, there remain patient populations who are not good candidates. Existing expertise within an Anticoagulation Management Service (AMS) should be leveraged to optimize all anticoagulant therapies including the DOACs. The AMS can facilitate initial drug therapy selection and dose management, reinforce patient education and adherence as well as managing drug interactions and invasive procedures. In the event that a transition to warfarin is warranted, the AMS is already engaged which limits the risk of fragmented patient care and ensures that therapeutic anticoagulation is re-established in a timely manner. The AMS of the future will provide comprehensive management for all patients receiving anticoagulant medications and continue to provide anticoagulation expertise to the healthcare team.

### Association between warfarin control metrics and atrial fibrillation outcomes in the outcomes registry for better informed treatment of atrial fibrillation [^112k6c2H]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Bleeding and thrombotic events (eg, stroke and systemic embolism) are common in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) taking warfarin sodium despite a well-established therapeutic range.

Objective

To evaluate whether history of therapeutic warfarin control in patients with AF is independently associated with subsequent bleeding or thrombotic events.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this multicenter cohort study of 176 primary care, cardiology, and electrophysiology clinics in the United States, data were obtained during 51 830 visits among 10 137 patients with AF in the Outcomes Registry for Better Informed Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (ORBIT-AF) Registry; 5545 patients treated with warfarin were included in the bleeding analysis, and 5635 patients were included in the thrombotic event analysis. Patient follow-up was performed from June 29, 2010, to November 30, 2014. Data analysis was performed from August 4, 2016, to February 15, 2019.

Exposures

Multiple measures of warfarin control within the preceding 6 months were analyzed: time in therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0, most recent international normalized ratio (INR), percentage of time that a patient had interpolated INR values less than 2.0 or greater than 3.0, INR variance, INR range, and percentage of INR values in therapeutic range.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Association of INR measures, alone or in combination, with clinical factors and risk for thrombotic events and bleeding during the subsequent 6 months was assessed post hoc using logistic regression models.

Results

A total of 5545 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [9.8] years; 3184 [57.4%] male) with AF were included in the major bleeding analysis and 5635 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.5 [9.8] years; 3236 [57.4%] male) in the thrombotic event analysis. During a median follow-up of 1.5 years (interquartile range, 1.0–2.5 years), there were 339 major bleeds (6.1%) and 51 strokes (0.9%). Multiple metrics of warfarin control were individually associated with subsequent bleeding. After adjustment for clinical bleeding risk, 3 measures-time in therapeutic range (per 1-SD increase ≤ 55: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.16; 95% CI, 1.02–1.32), variation in INR values (aOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.19–1.47), and maximum INR (aOR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10–1.31)-remained associated with bleeding risk. Adding INR variance to a clinical risk model slightly increased the C statistic from 0.68 to 0.69 and had a net reclassification improvement index of 0.028 (95% CI, -0.029 to 0.067). No INR measures were associated with subsequent stroke risk.

Conclusions and Relevance

Three metrics of prior warfarin control were associated with bleeding risk but only marginally more so than traditional clinical factors. This study did not identify any measures of INR control that were significantly associated with stroke risk.

Monitoring Parameters

There are no FDA‐approved method to monitor the anticoagulant effect of DOACs. Qualitative coagulation assays such as activated partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and prothrombin time can be used as first‐line tests if evaluation for medication compliance is clinically important. However, these tests are insufficient to assess the degree of anticoagulant effect as seen with INR for management of VKA therapy. Quantitative measures exist such as anti–factor Xa levels, plasma drug concentrations, dilute thrombin time, and ecarin thrombin time to directly assess anticoagulation effects. 90, 91 However, quantitative tests do not have an established clinical role, since standardized therapeutic ranges have not been established and quantitative test results have not been correlated with clinical outcomes. Other general monitoring parameters include signs and symptoms of bleeding, complete blood count, and a comprehensive metabolic panel specifically evaluating liver function tests, albumin, total bilirubin, and serum creatinine (see Table 5). These monitoring parameters should be performed in all patients before initiation of a DOAC and routinely monitored 1 to 3 months after initiation and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or more frequent follow‐ups based on patient‐specific characteristics is recommended in provider plans.

DOAC Laboratory Monitoring

In addition to laboratory monitoring parameters, a comprehensive DOAC monitoring approach should include the following items assessed at each follow‐up:
Current health status.
Adherence and cost.
Bleeding/thromboembolic events.
Adverse effects.
Complete medication review for drug interactions.
Reassessment of appropriateness of therapy.

### Point of care testing for INR monitoring: where are we now? [^115fXx9N]. British Journal of Haematology (2004). Low credibility.

Point of care (POC, or near patient) testing for measurement of the international normalized ratio (INR) has facilitated the devolution of service delivery from the traditional hospital outpatient setting. However it must be undertaken within the confines of safe practice involving quality control procedures. The evaluation of INR POC tests should be closely related to the clinical issues of management and, specifically, improving the quality of care. One benefit of POC testing is in the increased motivation that some practitioners feel, being able to perform diagnostic tests without sending samples to a laboratory. POC for INR testing within primary care eliminates the delay in waiting for the result to be processed by the hospital laboratory, and the subsequent delay in informing the patient of their dosing advice. This review describes the utilization of POC testing outside the laboratory setting to develop models of care for oral anticoagulation management.

### Pharmacology and management of the vitamin K antagonists: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (8th edition) [^113NHhBh]. Chest (2008). Low credibility.

This article concerning the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is part of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th Edition). It describes the antithrombotic effect of the VKAs, the monitoring of anticoagulation intensity, and the clinical applications of VKA therapy and provides specific management recommendations. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do or do not outweigh the risks, burdens, and costs. Grade 2 recommendations suggest that the individual patient's values may lead to different choices. (For a full understanding of the grading, see the "Grades of Recommendation" chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133:123S-131S.) Among the key recommendations in this article are the following: for dosing of VKAs, we recommend the initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy, with doses between 5 mg and 10 mg for the first 1 or 2 days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on the international normalized ratio (INR) response (Grade 1B); we suggest against pharmacogenetic-based dosing until randomized data indicate that it is beneficial (Grade 2C); and in elderly and other patient subgroups who are debilitated or malnourished, we recommend a starting dose of ≤ 5 mg (Grade 1C). The article also includes several specific recommendations for the management of patients with nontherapeutic INRs, with INRs above the therapeutic range, and with bleeding whether the INR is therapeutic or elevated. For the use of vitamin K to reverse a mildly elevated INR, we recommend oral rather than subcutaneous administration (Grade 1A). For patients with life-threatening bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, we recommend the use of prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant factor VIIa to immediately reverse the INR (Grade 1C). For most patients who have a lupus inhibitor, we recommend a therapeutic target INR of 2.5 (range, 2.0 to 3.0) [Grade 1A]. We recommend that physicians who manage oral anticoagulation therapy do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dose adjustments [Grade 1B]. In patients who are suitably selected and trained, patient self-testing or patient self-management of dosing are effective alternative treatment models that result in improved quality of anticoagulation management, with greater time in the therapeutic range and fewer adverse events. Patient self-monitoring or self-management, however, is a choice made by patients and physicians that depends on many factors. We suggest that such therapeutic management be implemented where suitable (Grade 2B).

Oral anticoagulants — vitamin K antagonists — note that "Since the 1950s, warfarin was used as a first-line therapy until DOACs came into practice", but its "narrow therapeutic window" with INRs, monitoring, drug interactions, dietary restrictions, and "low clinical safety profile affected the routine use of warfarin in practice". Due to affordability barriers to DOACs, "warfarin is still an appropriate OAC due to its lower cost for patients who cannot afford DOACs", and utilization data show "About 21% of patients with nonvalvular AF were still receiving warfarin, while the rest received DOACs in the first quarter of 2017".

Warfarin interaction mitigation — The most effective method to avoid adverse outcomes associated with drug interactions is to try to avoid, when feasible, concurrent use of potentially interacting drugs and to use noninteracting alternatives instead; when noninteracting alternatives are not available, adverse outcomes can be avoided by increasing the frequency of monitoring and adjusting warfarin doses based on INR response, and prospective dosing adjustments are inappropriate because of the unpredictable nature of patient response to drug interactions.

Vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — monitoring anticoagulant intensity by the international normalized ratio (INR) relies on PT-based calibration and has early-therapy caveats: The PT test is the most common test used to monitor VKA therapy, and during the first few days of warfarin therapy the PT reflects mainly a reduction of factor VII, the half-life of which is approximately 6 h. PT monitoring of VKA treatment is not standardized when expressed in seconds, or as a simple ratio or percentage, so a calibration model adopted in 1982 converts the local PT ratio into an INR, calculated as follows: INR = [(patient PT)/(mean normal PT)]ᴵˢᴵ or log INR = ISI(log observed PT ratio). For calibration, patients' samples should be selected by rejecting samples beyond the 1.5 to 4.5 INR range, and outliers with a perpendicular distance greater than three residual SDs from the line of relationship should be rejected. Because the half-life of prothrombin is about 60 to 72 h, at least 5 days of overlap is necessary, and the INR is based on ISI values derived from the plasma of patients who had received stable anticoagulant doses for at least 6 weeks; as a result, the INR has not been validated and should be viewed with some skepticism early in the course of warfarin therapy, particularly when results are obtained from different laboratories.

Atrial fibrillation — recommendations for managing anticoagulants emphasize interaction management, appropriate warfarin intensity, and avoiding off‑label DOAC dosing: For patients with AF receiving direct oral anticoagulants, optimal management of drug interactions is recommended for those on concomitant interacting drugs; for patients with AF receiving warfarin, a target international normalized ratio (INR) between 2 and 3 is recommended along with interaction management, consistent vitamin K intake, and routine INR monitoring to improve time in therapeutic range and minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding; for patients with AF, non–evidence‑based doses of DOACs should be avoided to minimize preventable thromboembolism or major bleeding and to improve survival.

Why assess anticoagulant activity?

When a patient presents in the ED, and is known or suspected to be on OAC therapy, it is often helpful to be able to measure the level of anticoagulation.
The patient has unintentionally or intentionally overdosed on the OAC, but there are no related symptoms; for example, in the case of warfarin, the patient's routine monitoring could have given an overly elevated INR value, which might be owing to an overdose or a pharmacological interaction.
The patient is experiencing a spontaneous episode of external or internal bleeding, or the latter may be suspected.
The patient has suffered an injury causing external or internal bleeding.
An urgent surgical or other invasive procedure is deemed necessary because of trauma or acute illness, and it is essential for the surgical team to know the level of anticoagulation in the patient.

### Progress in the monitoring of direct oral anticoagulant therapy [^1155agDb]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

The availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) has led to a paradigm shift in the field of anticoagulation, with DOACs increasingly being prescribed for patients in preference to vitamin K antagonists and low molecular weight heparin. Despite good experience with the use of these agents at fixed doses, there are clinical scenarios where monitoring is recommended. Data from phase III studies of the DOACs and small real-world studies suggest a relationship between DOAC concentration and clinical events. The DOACs have differing impacts on the common tests of haemostasis and it is important that clinicians are familiar with the sensitivity of the reagents used in their laboratory to individual DOACs. The specific DOAC drug concentrations can be assayed in the laboratory, when required, to guide appropriate clinical decision-making. Studies from the real world with sufficient numbers evaluating the association of DOAC concentrations with outcomes should be a research priority in order to understand if we could do better through dose individualisation.

Oral anticoagulation management systems and self-testing include the following: We suggest that health-care providers who manage oral anticoagulation therapy should do so in a systematic and coordinated fashion, incorporating patient education, systematic INR testing, tracking, follow-up, and good patient communication of results and dosing decisions. For patients treated with VKAs who are motivated and can demonstrate competency in self-management strategies, including the self-testing equipment, we suggest patient self-management (PSM) rather than usual outpatient INR monitoring (Grade 2B), and for all other patients, we suggest monitoring that includes the safeguards in our best practice statement 3.5. For dosing decisions during maintenance VKA therapy, we suggest using validated decision support tools (paper nomograms or computerized dosing programs) rather than no decision support (Grade 2C). Remarks: Inexperienced prescribers may be more likely to improve prescribing with use of decision support tools than experienced prescribers.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: optimal management of anticoagulation therapy [^1149ARZf]. Blood Advances (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Clinicians confront numerous practical issues in optimizing the use of anticoagulants to treat venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians and other health care professionals in their decisions about the use of anticoagulants in the management of VTE. These guidelines assume the choice of anticoagulant has already been made.

Methods

ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The McMaster University GRADE Centre supported the guideline development process, including updating or performing systematic evidence reviews. The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess evidence and make recommendations, which were subject to public comment.

Results

The panel agreed on 25 recommendations and 2 good practice statements to optimize management of patients receiving anticoagulants.

Conclusions

Strong recommendations included using patient self-management of international normalized ratio (INR) with home point-of-care INR monitoring for vitamin K antagonist therapy and against using periprocedural low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) bridging therapy. Conditional recommendations included basing treatment dosing of LMWH on actual body weight, not using anti-factor Xa monitoring to guide LMWH dosing, using specialized anticoagulation management services, and resuming anticoagulation after episodes of life-threatening bleeding.

Anticoagulant Transitioning

As with any high‐risk medication such as anticoagulants, clinical situations may arise that require transitioning to or off of DOAC therapy. Two common transition scenarios include (1) switching between anticoagulants and (2) periprocedural management.

Switching Between Anticoagulants

It is not uncommon to require transition from one anticoagulant to another because of either cost, comorbid conditions, patient preference, hospitalization, thrombotic complications, bleeding complications, or procedures. Five scenarios exist that comprise DOAC therapy switching from/to another anticoagulant:
VKA to DOAC
DOAC to VKA
DOAC to DOAC
DOAC to parenteral anticoagulant
Parenteral anticoagulant to DOAC

For all scenarios, assessment of each drug's pharmacokinetic profile (ie, half‐life), pharmacodynamics profile (INR for VKA or activated partial thromboplastin time for unfractionated heparin, etc), as well as patients' renal function, must be taken into account. The ultimate goal is to limit interruption of the therapeutic anticoagulation during the transition to minimize the risk of atherothrombosis. In certain cases, this requires overlap of the 2 anticoagulants. See Table 6. 92

Table 6
Algorithm for Switching Between Anticoagulants

Transitioning between VKA and DOAC and vice versa requires additional explanation that takes into account the INR measurement. When transitioning from a VKA to a DOAC, the half‐life of the VKA compound is imperative to guide therapy. Since warfarin is the principle VKA utilized in the United States, with a half‐life of ≈36 to 48 hours, it is advisable to stop warfarin and check INR at least 3 days later. DOACs can be initiated once the INR is ≤ 2; see Table 7 for management strategies based on INR values. 38 When converting from a DOAC to a VKA, providers should administer DOACs concomitantly with VKAs because of the VKAs' known slow onset of action (≈5–10 days). 38 An INR should be rechecked between days 3 and 5 of warfarin therapy. INRs should be checked just before the dose of the DOAC because of their ability to elevate INR values. The INRs should be monitored frequently for at least the first month until INR stability has been achieved (ie, ≥ 3 consecutive INR readings at goal).

5.8 Other Clinical Settings with Increased Risks

In the following clinical settings, the risks of warfarin sodium therapy may be increased:

Moderate to severe hepatic impairment
Infectious diseases or disturbances of intestinal flora (e.g., sprue, antibiotic therapy)
Use of an indwelling catheter
Severe to moderate hypertension
Deficiency in protein C-mediated anticoagulant response: warfarin sodium reduces the synthesis of the naturally occurring anticoagulants, protein C and protein S. Hereditary or acquired deficiencies of protein C or its cofactor, protein S, have been associated with tissue necrosis following warfarin administration. Concomitant anticoagulation therapy with heparin for 5 to 7 days during initiation of therapy with warfarin sodium may minimize the incidence of tissue necrosis in these patients.
Eye surgery: In cataract surgery, warfarin sodium use was associated with a significant increase in minor complications of sharp needle and local anesthesia block but not associated with potentially sight-threatening operative hemorrhagic complications. As warfarin sodium cessation or reduction may lead to serious thromboembolic complications, the decision to discontinue warfarin sodium before a relatively less invasive and complex eye surgery, such as lens surgery, should be based upon the risks of anticoagulant therapy weighed against the benefits.
Polycythemia vera
Vasculitis
Diabetes mellitus

5.9 Endogenous Factors Affecting INR

The following factors may be responsible for increased INR response: diarrhea, hepatic disorders, poor nutritional state, steatorrhea, or vitamin K deficiency.

The following factors may be responsible for decreased INR response: increased vitamin K intake or hereditary warfarin resistance.

### American Society of Hematology / International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis 2024 updated guidelines for treatment of venous thromboembolism in pediatric patients [^117GgJid]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

VKAs have a very narrow therapeutic index, and patients require frequent blood monitoring to ensure therapeutic anticoagulation and to minimize the risk of bleeding. The blood monitoring test for warfarin therapy is the INR. Decisions around frequency of INR monitoring are informed by the child's age, length of time on treatment, changes in medication and food, and the presence of infections or comorbidities. The age group found to be most susceptible to fluctuations in INR are children aged < 1 year. This susceptibility has been attributed to low concentrations of vitamin K in breast milk and high concentrations of vitamin K in most formula. Infants and small children require very regular INR tests (on average, 2 tests per week) compared with once-a-month testing in most adult patients.

### Comparative effectiveness of warfarin management strategies: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117Du8h3]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin K antagonists are one of the main anticoagulants used in the treatment and prevention of thrombosis in various medical conditions, such as venous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, and mechanical heart valve replacement. Warfarin is the most widely used VKA in many countries globally, although there has been a declining trend in its use following the availability of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) since 2010. However, warfarin continues to be a vital therapeutic option worldwide. In addition to its relatively low cost, warfarin is associated with lower risk of gastrointestinal bleedingand all-cause mortalitycompared to some DOACs. Furthermore, warfarin is superior to DOACs in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, mechanical heart valves, and valvular AF. However, to achieve the benefits of warfarin, patients require careful and frequent monitoring with dose adjustment due to warfarin's narrow therapeutic index.

Warfarin management encompasses several approaches tailored to optimize treatment outcomes and ensure patient safety. Usual care typically involves regular in person clinic visits for International Normalized Ratio (INR) monitoring, with dose adjustments made by healthcare providers based on test results and patient factors. Anticoagulation management services (AMS), or anticoagulation clinics, offer a more specialized approach where trained healthcare professionals (often nurses and/or pharmacists) provide comprehensive management, including INR testing, education, and dose adjustments using a systematic approach. Patient self-testing (PST) empowers patients to conduct their own INR tests, with results reported to healthcare providers for dose advice. To ensure successful self-monitoring, appropriate patient education on how to accurately perform and interpret these tests is essential. Patient self-management (PSM) goes a step further, enabling patients to adjust their own warfarin dose based on self-testing results and dosing decision aids, which requires further education on effectively managing dosages. The proportion of patients receiving different types of warfarin management varies by region, healthcare system, and patient preference. Generally, most patients are managed by usual care or AMS, with about 4% managed by PST. The proportion of patients managed by PSM is expected to be significantly smaller than those managed by PST.

Oral anticoagulants

Warfarin

The coumarin-derived racemic mixture, warfarin, at peak usage was estimated to be taken by at least 1% of the whole UK population, and by 8% of those aged over 80 years. However, warfarin usage has decreased in many European countries and in the US, with a concomitant increase in the use of DOACs. Nevertheless, warfarin is still widely used especially in some of the lower-middle income countries, where affordability is a major issue.

Warfarin inhibits hepatic vitamin K 2,3 epoxide reductase complex 1 (VKORC1). VKORC1 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the warfarin sensitive vitamin K-dependent gamma carboxylation system, and inhibition of VKORC1 reduces the production of functional clotting factors II, VII, IX and X, proteins C, S and Z, and leads to anticoagulation (Fig. 2). Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic window and large inter-individual variability with up to 20-fold difference in stable dose requirements between individuals. Therefore, warfarin treatment is closely monitored via the international normalised ratio (INR); for most indications, the recommended therapeutic INR range is 2.0–3.0. An overview of warfarin pharmacokinetics is provided in Table 2.

Patients with AF on warfarin are unsettlingly outside the therapeutic INR range 30–50% of the time. Importantly, bleeding is the most common warfarin ADR occurring in up to 41% of treated patients, with major bleeding frequencies as high as 10–16%. The risk of adverse events is highest during the initial dose-titration period within the first few weeks to months of warfarin therapy, and so strategies to individualise the initial warfarin doses have been sought.

### Optimal loading dose of warfarin for the initiation of oral anticoagulation [^112P542H]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Warfarin is used as an oral anticoagulant. However, there is wide variation in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, as well as the necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time in-range, time to INR in-range and effect on serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012).

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies.

Main Results

We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR in-range by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.77, P = 0.46, I(2) = 83%). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs in-range as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19, P = 0.37, I(2) = 22%); two other studies used a single INR in-range as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.21, P = 0.05, I(2) = 72%). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2.5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2.7 versus 2.0 days; P < 0.0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4.2 days versus 5 days, P = 0.007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time in-range (P < 0.001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion.

Authors' Conclusions

The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, there is some evidence that lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation.

Introduction

The use of vitamin K antagonists (mainly warfarin) is characterized by frequent visits to the clinic for monitoring the international normalized ratio (INR) to assess therapeutic efficacy, in addition to concurrent heparin use for bridging, and the disadvantage of drug-drug and drug-food interactions requiring dose adjustments. Given these drawbacks, the use of warfarin is cumbersome and can lead to low adherence. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have the distinct advantage of fixed dosing and do not require continuous laboratory monitoring. These features, combined with the availability of FDA-approved reversal agents, have made them desirable anticoagulants.

Several studies have shown equivalent therapeutic efficacy of DOACs compared with warfarin in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, there are few specific guidelines available to guide physicians about the individualized use of a particular DOAC for patients. Most choices rely on healthcare providers' preference, the patient's risk status, and the cost of the drugs, through a shared decision-making process.

In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the overall safety profile of DOACs, emphasizing overall risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) and, more specifically, risk of fatal GIB. In addition, we compared individual DOACs to warfarin regarding the risk of GIB and safety in light of the variability of INR controls, i.e. the time in therapeutic range (TTR).

### Geographic variations in the quality of oral anticoagulation with vitamin k antagonists in the era of new anticoagulants [^116dGgQW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

To what extent does less frequent monitoring account for lower iTTR? More frequent testing allows more rapid dose adjustment and this may explain why higher mean iTTR values correlate with more frequent testing. – Such variations are commonly seen in a general population, but are less likely in a study like the ROCKET‐AF trial with close and regular management. The authors do not provide the information that the monitoring was significantly less frequent in some regions and/or the reason for different frequencies of INR testing, but one may assume that support mechanisms to respond to out‐of‐range values and patient barriers to visiting the medical centers once again play a role in addition to clinical features.

Exploring these different patterns of anticoagulation management would be a logical next step. Key points to improve the quality of anticoagulation include avoiding the loss of follow‐up and poor patient adherence to therapy, as well as the promotion of patient education, the use of standard target INR ranges, timely follow‐up after deranged INR values, the occasional use of anticoagulation clinic, and a wider adoption of dose support algorithms. The algorithm‐based systems facilitating warfarin dosing optimize anticoagulation quality and may improve clinical outcomes in AF. Such a specific treatment algorithm for anticoagulation management was not provided in the ROCKET‐AF and this may explain why TTR was lower than in other trials. In addition, a recent analysis of data from the RE‐LY trial found that adherence — ‐intentional or not — to a simple warfarin dosing algorithm predicts improved TTR and accounts for considerable TTR variation between centers and countries. Consequently, changing the dose of warfarin for any (even slightly) out‐of range INR is probably the best option. Taken together, it appears that a precise, easy, and well‐followed scheme is a preeminent way to improve the quality of anticoagulation in AF patients. As in many aspects of medicine, this reinforces the conviction that there is no need for each physician to reinvent the wheel in each care system.

Asian Patients

Asian patients may require lower initiation and maintenance doses of warfarin. A non-controlled study of 151 Chinese outpatients stabilized on warfarin for various indications reported a mean daily warfarin requirement of 3.3 ± 1.4 mg to achieve an INR of 2 to 2.5. Patient age was the most important determinant of warfarin requirement in these patients, with a progressively lower warfarin requirement with increasing age.

12.5 Pharmacogenomics

CYP2C9 and VKORC1 Polymorphisms

The S -enantiomer of warfarin is mainly metabolized to 7-hydroxywarfarin by CYP2C9, a polymorphic enzyme. The variant alleles, CYP2C9✱2 and CYP2C9✱3, result in decreased in vitro CYP2C9 enzymatic 7-hydroxylation of S-warfarin. The frequencies of these alleles in Caucasians are approximately 11% and 7% for CYP2C9✱2 and CYP2C9✱3, respectively.

Other CYP2C9 alleles associated with reduced enzymatic activity occur at lower frequencies, including *5, *6, and *11 alleles in populations of African ancestry and *5, *9, and *11 alleles in Caucasians.

Warfarin reduces the regeneration of vitamin K from vitamin K epoxide in the vitamin K cycle through inhibition of VKOR, a multiprotein enzyme complex. Certain single nucleotide polymorphisms in the VKORC1 gene (e.g., –1639G > A) have been associated with variable warfarin dose requirements. VKORC1 and CYP2C9 gene variants generally explain the largest proportion of known variability in warfarin dose requirements.

CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotype information, when available, can assist in selection of the initial dose of warfarin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Development of a clinical prediction model for an international normalised ratio ≥ 4. 5 in hospitalised patients using vitamin K antagonists [^112WHCAC]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are frequently used medications in the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disease (Wysowski et al, 2007; Ansell et al, 2008). However, the benefit of their use is partially offset by the increased risk of bleeding complications. The reported overall risk of major bleeding complications is 1·4–2·1 per 100‐person years of VKA treatment (Palareti et al, 1996; Schulman et al, 2008; Roskell et al, 2012).

The risk of bleeding is related to the international normalised ratio (INR) and is influenced by many factors, such as dietary intake of vitamin K, concomitant medication, comorbidities and genetic factors (Schulman et al, 2008). Although numerous risk factors have been linked to a higher bleeding risk, it is difficult for physicians to assess the risk of bleeding by VKAs for an individual patient. Prediction models could help physicians to predict VKA‐associated bleeding complications and make more accurate assessments, which may lead to adjustments in therapy or closer monitoring.

### Warfarin (warfarin sodium) [^1168hT6z]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.

10.2 Treatment

The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.

The use of vitamin K1reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with ACS, EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider regulating VKA dosing carefully with a target INR of 2.0–2.5 and time in therapeutic range > 70% when combined with antiplatelet therapy in patients with AF to mitigate bleeding risk.

### Anticoagulation in chronic kidney disease: from guidelines to clinical practice [^111ktmiz]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Anticoagulation monitoring mandatorily requires optimal methods and an adequate monitoring calendar. The use of INR is the common method for VKAs, but its values are frequently unstable, rendering anticoagulation control quite challenging. The "start‐low go‐slow" rule for dosing VKAs and a 10%‐20% lower dose according to eGFR level is the logical and necessary approach. Weekly monitoring is yet another recommendation, but it proves difficult to implement in practice. 13 However, frequent monitoring does allow to optimize the time in which INR values are within therapeutic range (TTR). 9 Although TTR ≥ 70% is an independent predictor of lower risk of thromboembolism, major hemorrhage and mortality, in CKD its values are frequently suboptimal.

For DOACs, main issue is how to define kidney dysfunction for a correct dose adjustment. Landmark trials use CrCl calculated via the Cockroft‐Gault equation, which can overestimate renal function, particularly in advanced CKD and in patients weighing > 100 kg. 16 European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) believes that using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD‐EPI) equation is safer and concurrently the method recommended by nephrologists. 20 Note that the recommendations for use of the Cockroft‐Gault formula would be maintained for drugs with a relatively low safety factor. 16 This aspect could create confusions in clinical practice, as it entails a reinterpretation of trial‐based evidence. However, reanalyzing the data from RE‐LY and ARISTOTLE trials did not reveal diminished safety and efficacy of DOACs. Clinical reality brings into discussion another essential issue, namely the low level of knowledge and application of the recommendations by practitioners. A recent real‐world study in the United States showed that in 43% of the patients the medication was overdosed, being associated with a 2.19 times increase in hemorrhagic risk, while in 13.3% of the patients the medication (apixaban) was underdosed, being associated with a 4.87 times increase in the risk of stroke. 32 A prudent approach is renal function to be checked upon initiation of treatment with DOACs, after 3 months, and then every year, except for the high‐risk patients (elderly > 75 years, women, patients with low body mass, frail or on dabigatran) who require monitoring at least every 6 months. 14 The current position of EHRA is for the individualized estimation of recheck intervals using a simple calculation — if CrCl ≤ 60 mL/min: recheck interval in months is CrCl:10. 21 Any condition worsening the renal function (infections, acute heart failure, potentially nephrotoxic medication, etc.) requires additional assessment. Regarding the optimal monitoring method, there are precise but less commonly used tests (for dabigatran — dilute thrombin time, for xabans — ecarin chromogenic assay). 20

### Vitamin K for improved anticoagulation control in patients receiving warfarin [^111CPwot]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Effective use of warfarin involves keeping the international normalised ratio (INR) within a relatively narrow therapeutic range. However, patients respond widely to their dose of warfarin. Overcoagulation can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding, while undercoagulation can lead to increased clot formation. There is some evidence that patients with a variable response to warfarin may benefit from a concomitant low dose of vitamin K.

Objectives

To assess the effects of concomitant supplementation of low-dose oral vitamin K for anticoagulation control in patients being initiated on or taking a maintenance dose of warfarin.

Search Methods

To identify previous reviews, we searched the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2011). To identify primary studies, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014), Ovid MEDLINE (R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations database and Ovid MEDLINE (R) (OvidSP) (1946 to 25 February 2014), Embase (OvidSP) (1974 to week 8 of 2014), Science Citation Index Expanded™ & Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (Web of Science™) (1945 to 27 February 2014), and the NHS Economics Evaluations Database (NHS EED) (via The Cochrane Library, Wiley) (Issue 2, 2014). We did not apply any language or date restrictions. We used additional methods to identify grey literature and ongoing studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of vitamin K versus placebo in patients initiating warfarin or already taking warfarin.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and extracted data from included studies. When disagreement arose, a third author helped reached a consensus. We also assessed risk of bias.

Main Results

We identified two studies with a total of 100 participants for inclusion in the review. We found the overall risk of bias to be unclear in a number of domains. Neither study reported the time taken to the ﬁrst INR in range. Only one study (70 participants) reported the mean time in therapeutic range as a percentage. This study found that in the group of participants deemed to have poor INR control, the addition of 150 micrograms (mcg) oral vitamin K significantly improved anticoagulation control in those with unexplained instability of response to warfarin. The second study (30 participants) reported the effect of 175 mcg oral vitamin K versus placebo on participants with high variability in their INR levels. The study concluded that vitamin K supplementation did not significantly improve the stability of anticoagulation for participants on chronic anticoagulation therapy. However, the study was only available in abstract form, and communication with the lead author confirmed that there were no further publications. Therefore, we interpreted this conclusion with caution. Neither study reported any thromboembolic events, haemorrhage, or death from the addition of vitamin K supplementation.

Authors' Conclusions

Two included studies in this review compared whether the addition of a low dose (150 to 175 mcg) of vitamin K given to participants with a high-variability response to warfarin improved their INR control. One study demonstrated a significant improvement, while another smaller study (published in abstract only) suggested no overall benefit. Currently, there are insufficient data to suggest an overall benefit. Larger, higher quality trials are needed to examine if low-dose vitamin K improves INR control in those starting or already taking warfarin.

Laboratory measurement — clinically relevant bleeding or urgent procedures: In anticoagulated patients with clinically relevant bleeding or needing an urgent unplanned procedure, measurement of anticoagulant activity is a key step, and a prothrombin time (PT) and/or activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) should be requested in all such patients; patients taking a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) may be evaluated with the PT/international normalized ratio (INR), and the INR may be used to guide perioperative or bleeding management; for direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the minimum level that may contribute to bleeding risk is unknown, and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis recommends consideration of anticoagulant reversal for serious bleeding with a DOAC level > 50 ng/mL and for invasive procedures with high bleeding risk with a DOAC level > 30 ng/mL.

### Interpretation and management of INR results: a case history based survey in 13 countries [^115hcsbz]. Thrombosis Research (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Standardisation of treatment with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is still an issue after 60 years of use. The study aimed to explore aspects of VKA monitoring in primary and secondary care.

Methods

Two case histories were distributed to physicians in 13 countries. Case history A focused on a patient with atrial fibrillation on stable anticoagulation (latest INR 2.3). Physicians were asked about frequency of INR measurement, when to change the VKA dose, and the patient's annual risk of ischemic stroke and bleeding. Case history B focused on a patient with an unexpected INR of 4.8, asking for the patient's 48-hour bleeding risk, the immediate dose reduction and time until a repeat INR.

Results

Altogether, 3016 physicians responded (response rate 8–38%), of which 82% were from primary care and 18% from secondary care. Answers varied substantially within and between countries regardless of level of care and VKA used. Median number of weeks between INR measurements was 4–6 weeks. Median threshold INR for increasing or decreasing the VKA dose was 1.9 and 3.1, respectively. Risk of ischemic stroke and bleeding were overestimated 2–3 times. In case history B, the median dose reduction the two first days was 75% for GPs and 55% for specialists, irrespective of estimates of bleeding risk; with one week to a repeat INR.

Conclusion

Variation in VKA monitoring is substantial implying clinical consequences. Guidelines seem either unknown or may be considered impracticable. Further efforts towards standardisation of VKA management are needed.

Direct thrombin inhibitor monitoring and transition to vitamin K antagonists note that although the aPTT is used to monitor therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors, this test is not ideal, and the ecarin clotting time yields a more linear dose-response but is not widely available and has not been standardized. All of the direct thrombin inhibitors increase the international normalized ratio (INR), and when given in therapeutic doses, argatroban has the greatest effect on the INR, which complicates transition from argatroban to vitamin K antagonists; to overcome this problem, the INR can be measured after stopping the argatroban infusion for several hours. Because holding argatroban may expose patients to a risk of thrombosis, another option is to monitor the vitamin K antagonist with a chromogenic factor X assay, and in this setting, factor X levels < 45% have been associated with INR values > 2 when the effect of argatroban has been eliminated. Monitoring factor X levels may be safer than aiming for an INR ≥ 4 when vitamin K antagonists are given in conjunction with argatroban.

### Self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation: does it work outside trial conditions? [^116AWaNk]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Background:

Patient self-monitoring (PSM) of oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) can improve anticoagulant control, but poor uptake and high dropout rates have prompted suggestions that PSM is suitable for only a minority of patients in the UK.

Aims:

To determine whether PSM could be a viable alternative to regular hospital anticoagulant clinic attendance, if offered from the start of treatment.

Methods:

318 consecutive patients referred, for the first time, to an anticoagulation clinic were assessed for eligibility using established criteria. Patients electing for PSM attended training and, following successful assessment, performed a capillary blood INR every two weeks or more frequently if directed to do so by the anticoagulation clinic. Primary outcome measures were uptake of PSM and the percentage time in target therapeutic INR range (TIR) compared to patients electing for routine clinic care.

Results:

Of 318 patients referred for OAT, 188 were eligible for PSM. 84 (26%) elected to self-monitor, of whom 72 (23%) remained self-monitoring or had completed their course of treatment at the end of the audit. Self-monitoring patients had significantly better anticoagulant control than those receiving routine hospital anticoagulation clinic care (TIR 71% vs 60%, p = 0.003) and significantly less time outside critical limits, ie, INR < 1.5 or > 5.0 (0.45% vs 2.04%, p = 0.008).

Conclusions:

Patients offered PSM from the start of treatment show increased uptake compared to previous UK studies and a level of oral anticoagulation control comparable to that reported in previous clinical trials.

### Warfarin prescription and administration: reducing the delay, improving the safety [^114MkmGB]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Warfarin is the most commonly used oral anticoagulant and it is a frequently prescribed medication in the hospital setting. Given its narrow therapeutic index and need for regular INR monitoring it is often susceptible to medication incidents. NICE guidelines state that warfarin should be given at the same time every day and the Bristol Royal Infirmary guidelines are warfarin to be given at 14:00. Traditionally warfarin is given at 18:00 as per community dosing times, however our trust found the 14:00 dosing ensures standardisation of administration and ensures that doses are given at a time of maximal staffing to ensure prescriptions aren't missed. Furthermore a previous quality improvement project carried out at another trust showed that changing the time of administration from 18:00 to 14:00 was associated with a reduction in the number of warfarin doses given out of hours.

Warfarin doses are prescribed individually, requiring a doctor's signature for each one. In the hospital setting warfarin dosing may require continuous adjustment to achieve a stable INR within the target range, for example due to catabolic illness status and new medications prescribed. This means that often only one to three doses of warfarin are prescribed at a time for in-patients.

Dosing is based on the INR result, generated by the hospital laboratory technicians from a "clotting tube" blood sample (result usually received within a couple of hours of arriving at the lab, unless sent in an "urgent" bag).

### Search for predictors of nontherapeutic INR results with warfarin therapy [^112eLeus]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The effectiveness and safety of warfarin require maintaining an international normalized ratio (INR) within the therapeutic range.

Objective

To identify predictors of nontherapeutic INR results in patients receiving warfarin.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted using 350 ambulatory care patients from a broad geographic region, all receiving long-term warfarin therapy and followed in a tertiary-care cardiology clinic. Possible predictors of nontherapeutic INR results (gender, age, body weight, body mass index, height, race, tobacco use, alcohol use, warfarin dose, therapeutic indication, regimen intensity, INR monitoring frequency/category, interacting medications, adverse events) were assessed with logistic regression models. Subset analysis involved 146 patients concurrently monitored with capillary whole blood INR (CoaguChek).

Results

As measured on venous specimens, 52% (182/350) of the patients had subtherapeutic INR results and 13% (44/350) had supratherapeutic INR results despite frequent (≤ 4 wk) monitoring in 75% of the patients. Due to the small sample size, supratherapeutic INR results could not be further analyzed. Of 19 predictors tested, only daily warfarin dose (p < 0.02) and regimen intensity (p < 0.03) were significant independent and additive predictors of subtherapeutic results. Patients on the high-intensity regimen (INR 2.5–3.5) and receiving warfarin ≤ 6 mg/day had > 50% risk of having subtherapeutic INR results. Subtherapeutic CoaguChek results were independent predictors of subtherapeutic venipuncture INR results in the subset (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

In the absence of readily identifiable predictors, only higher warfarin dosing and/or more frequent monitoring (possibly with point-of-care/home monitoring devices) may minimize the time that INRs are subtherapeutic, especially in patients receiving low-dose and/or high-intensity anticoagulation therapy.

### Warfarin sodium [^113CQ5sD]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

10.1 Signs and Symptoms

Bleeding (e.g., appearance of blood in stools or urine, hematuria, excessive menstrual bleeding, melena, petechiae, excessive bruising or persistent oozing from superficial injuries, unexplained fall in hemoglobin) is a manifestation of excessive anticoagulation.

10.2 Treatment

The treatment of excessive anticoagulation is based on the level of the INR, the presence or absence of bleeding, and clinical circumstances. Reversal of warfarin sodium anticoagulation may be obtained by discontinuing warfarin sodium therapy and, if necessary, by administration of oral or parenteral vitamin K1.

The use of vitamin K1reduces response to subsequent warfarin sodium therapy and patients may return to a pretreatment thrombotic status following the rapid reversal of a prolonged INR. Resumption of warfarin sodium administration reverses the effect of vitamin K, and a therapeutic INR can again be obtained by careful dosage adjustment. If rapid re-anticoagulation is indicated, heparin may be preferable for initial therapy.

Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), fresh frozen plasma, or activated Factor VII treatment may be considered if the requirement to reverse the effects of warfarin sodium is urgent. A risk of hepatitis and other viral diseases is associated with the use of blood products; PCC and activated Factor VII are also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, these preparations should be used only in exceptional or life-threatening bleeding episodes secondary to warfarin sodium overdosage.

### The decision to anticoagulate: assessing whether benefits outweigh the risks for patients with atrial fibrillation [^113AcStW]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

In a review of relevant articles from the Medline database on stroke risk in atrial fibrillation (AF) and adverse events related to anticoagulation treatment, we found that research to date shows a major potential benefit of warfarin therapy (International Normalized Ratio [INR] 2.0–3.0) for patients with AF (68% risk reduction in primary stroke prevention with warfarin vs. placebo). Despite this highly significant reduction in stroke risk, fewer than 50% of eligible patients are treated, in many cases because of fears of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). The decision to implement anticoagulant therapy to improve outcome requires balancing the decreased risk for stroke against the increased risk for ICH. Various methods have been developed to define patient-specific stroke risk. In contrast, risk for ICH strongly correlates with the intensity of anticoagulation, which is an unpredictable but controllable variable requiring frequent dose adjustments. Recent studies have also identified subgroups of patients with neurologic pathologies who are at increased risk for ICH. However, when the INR is properly controlled, the benefit from anticoagulation therapy for patients with AF and other risk factors for stroke exceeds the risk for ICH. Careful monitoring of anticoagulation and warfarin dose titration to maintain the INR between 2.0 and 3.0 is critical for reducing the risk for ICH, as is excluding patients with neurologic conditions that increase the likelihood of ICH. Future developments, such as the introduction of oral direct thrombin inhibitors with more predictable pharmacokinetics than warfarin, may further improve the benefit-to-risk ratio of anticoagulation therapy for patients with AF.

### Potential inaccuracy of point-of-care INR in dabigatran-treated patients [^113VV4vX]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report 2 cases in which point-of-care international normalized ratios (INRs) in dabigatran-treated patients were inaccurate.

Case Summary

A 59-year-old woman with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was started on warfarin. After 3 days, warfarin was discontinued, and the decision was made to switch to dabigatran 150 mg twice a day, which was started 2 days after the warfarin was discontinued. As treatment was being converted from warfarin to dabigatran therapy, the woman's primary care physician referred her to our anticoagulation clinic, where her point-of-care INR was 7.2. A laboratory INR performed approximately 30 minutes later was 1.7. Several repeat point-of-care INRs were elevated and discordant with the laboratory INRs. A second patient, a 52-year-old man, was started on dabigatran after an ablation procedure, as a bridge to warfarin. Approximately 16 hours after a single dose of dabigatran etexilate 150 mg, the point-of-care INR was 1.6.

Discussion

Dabigatran etexilate is an oral direct thrombin inhibitor that is approved for use in thromboprophylaxis of atrial fibrillation and deep vein thrombosis. Dabigatran's predictable pharmacokinetic profile allows for a fixed-dose regimen without the need for coagulation monitoring. In certain clinical situations (eg, switching treatment between dabigatran and warfarin), INR testing is performed as part of routine clinical care. During the development program for dabigatran, laboratory testing of INR was performed, with INRs at therapeutic concentrations of dabigatran ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. Supratherapeutic concentrations of dabigatran elevated the INR to slightly higher levels, between 1.7 and 2.4. Even at extremely high dabigatran concentrations, the INR was generally in the range of 2.3–3.5.

Conclusions

We advocate laboratory INR testing with simultaneous assessment of the activated partial thromboplastin time in patients who are receiving or who have recently received dabigatran. A prospective evaluation assessing the accuracy of the commonly used point-of-care INR devices in patients receiving dabigatran would confirm our findings with respect to this device and determine whether our findings extend to other commonly used devices.

### Outcomes of warfarin home INR monitoring vs office-based monitoring: a retrospective claims-based analysis [^112LRoGG]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Warfarin was the mainstay of oral anticoagulation for over 60 years until the introduction of direct oral anticoagulants in 2010. Around 2 million Americans still receive warfarin with many more worldwide, and warfarin remains the primary anticoagulant of choice for several medical indications. However, warfarin therapy presents many challenges with numerous factors influencing its effectiveness. Frequent INR testing is needed to ensure optimal dosing, and to minimize the risk of bleeding or thromboembolic events. High-quality warfarin management has been shown to improve the safety and efficacy of the medication, leading to improved patient outcomes.

Warfarin management is complex and labor intensive. Historically, patients had INR testing performed in a physician's office or laboratory. This required that patients travel to testing sites, which can be challenging for patients who live in rural settings, have mobility or transportation issues, travel often, and/or have extended working hours. Limited access to care during the COVID pandemic added to these challenges.

Point of care coagulometers allow for INR measurement at home. This is done through patient self-testing (PST) programs, which provide education and testing equipment. In PST programs, participants' INR results are interpreted by clinicians who provide recommendations for dose adjustment via telephone or video visit, without requiring an in-person office encounter.

PST has been shown to improve the quality of care by engaging patients in their healthcare, resulting in an improvement in their quality of life. Additionally, home INR monitoring allows for more frequent monitoring and has been shown to reduce adverse events (AEs), such as bleeding and clotting. –

Although PST is recommended by clinical guidelines, it has faced limited acceptance by physicians and limited reimbursement by third-party payers, especially Medicare. To further assess the value of home INR monitoring, we evaluated outcomes of warfarin therapy from a large database of third-party/administrative claims (Medicare and commercial insurance) and compared the safety and efficacy of warfarin therapy with INR measurements obtained by PST versus office-based monitoring of therapy.

### Evidence-based management of anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1174t4EA]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Bleeding risk and management context with elevated international normalized ratio (INR) on warfarin: "The risk of bleeding increases significantly when the INR exceeds 4.5". In patients with mechanical heart valves, adverse events increased from "two per 100 patient-years at INR 2.5 to 4.9, to 4.8 per 100 patient-years for INR 5 to 5.5, then to 7.5 per 100 patient-years for INR ≥ 6.5", and intracerebral bleeding doubled "for every 0.5-s increment in prothrombin time". When supratherapeutic INR occurs without bleeding, strategies include withholding VKA, adjusting VKA dose, or giving vitamin K, and a 2006 meta-analysis found vitamin K "was more likely to reverse overanticoagulation (INR > 4) at 24 h compared with simply withholding VKA".

### International normalized ratio versus plasma levels of coagulation factors in patients on vitamin K antagonist therapy [^113BG1iE]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Context

The key question when managing patients on warfarin therapy who present with life-threatening bleeding is how to use the international normalized ratio (INR) to best direct corrective therapy. The corollary question for the clinical laboratory is at what level will the INR reflect a critical value that requires notifying the clinician.

Objective

To determine the levels of vitamin K-dependent factors over a range of INR values.

Design

Evaluation of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor levels on plasma remnants from patients in whom a prothrombin time and INR was ordered to monitor warfarin therapy. There were a total of 83 specimens evaluated with an INR range from 1.0 to 8.26.

Results

The mean activity levels of all 4 factors remained near or above 50% when the INR was less than 1.5. The average factor X level was 23% when the INR range was 1.6 to 2.5, but levels of factors II, VII, and IX did not drop below the hemostatic range until the INR was greater than 2.5. At an INR of 3.6 or more, the activity levels of all 4 factors were less than 30% in more than 90% of the specimens.

Conclusion

Levels of factors II, VII, IX, and X declined with increasing INR but not at the same rate and not to the same level at a given INR. However, most of the values were below the hemostatic value once the INR was 3.6 or more, the level that was also considered critical for physician notification.

### Perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^1179mJJf]. Chest (2022). High credibility.

Patients receiving vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy — elective surgery interruption timing — is informed by elimination half-lives and expected international normalized ratio (INR) kinetics: values are 36 to 42 hours for warfarin, 8 to 11 hours for acenocoumarol, and 96 to 104 hours for phenprocoumon; typically 5 days of interruption are needed to normalize INR, while 6 or more days may be required in selected patients, including those with an elevated INR (> 3.5). After resumption, a full anticoagulant effect (INR ≥ 2.0) occurs 4 to 8 days after VKA resumption. Routine INR measurement in the immediate pre-operative (day before) and post-operative (1–2 days after) period would not be needed, but may be warranted when the pre-operative INR is high (> 3.5).

Significance of nontherapeutic INRs — causes and clinical risk — includes that fluctuations may result from inaccuracy in testing, vitamin K intake or absorption/metabolism changes, other drug effects, or noncompliance, and that adverse event rates rise sharply as INR moves outside target range; in a retrospective analysis of 3,000 atrial fibrillation patients, the poorest control group (48% of time in range) had twice the rates of stroke, myocardial infarction, major bleeding, and death compared with the best control group (83% of time in range); although excessively elevated INRs, particularly > 5.0, increase bleeding risk, registry data suggest short-term major bleeding risk is low for a single INR between 5.0 and 9.0, and in a matched cohort of 2,597 warfarin patients a single significant supratherapeutic INR had low 3 months thromboembolism risk (0.4%), with similar rates reported in 294 mechanical heart valve patients.

Computerized warfarin dosing and monitoring — Computer assistance by dedicated programs may improve dose management and time in therapeutic range (TTR). In randomized studies, three contemporary computer programs performed as well as the experienced medical staff of an anticoagulation management service in achieving a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 and achieved significantly better control when intensive therapy was required (ie, INR, 3.0–4.5). In another randomized study of 101 patients, computerized dose adjustment required 50% fewer changes of dose while maintaining comparable regulation. The first multicenter randomized trial, in 285 patients, showed a 22% overall improvement of control with a computerized program. Using a different program in > 1,200 randomized patients, 71.6% of patients were in range with computer dosing and 68.2% were in range by manual dosing during maintenance. In the European Concerted Action on Anticoagulation international, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, 13,052 patients were followed for 18,617 patient-years, with a trend toward fewer clinical events overall and a statistically significant reduction in clinical events in the subgroup treated for VTE; a subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis found computer-assisted dosing cheaper than manual dosing. During initiation, two small clinical trials suggest computerized dose management can be at least as effective as manual dosing by trained clinicians, although some computerized programs are unable to manage dosing during the induction phase.

### Alternative calculations of individual patient time in therapeutic range while taking warfarin: results from the ROCKET AF trial [^115jaYPf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Statistical Analysis

The current analysis was restricted to patients in the warfarin arm of the ROCKET AF trial and who, in fact, received ≥ 1 dose and who had ≥ 2 INR measurements while taking warfarin. We did not include INR measurements made during drug interruptions or after permanent discontinuation. As a result, 150 of the original 7133 individuals randomly assigned to warfarin were not included in the current analysis. All study‐related INR tests were recorded.

### An updated review of target-specific oral anticoagulants used in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolic disease, and acute coronary syndromes [^115cfcR4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

Warfarin and Time in Therapeutic Range

Time in the therapeutic range (TTR) is a significant risk factor for stroke, major bleeding, and mortality. Data from the warfarin arms of the Stroke Prophylaxis using an ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in atrial Fibrillation (SPORTIF) III and V trials concluded significantly higher rates of major hemorrhage in the poor INR control group (TTR < 60%) compared with the moderate INR control group (TTR 60% to 75%) and good INR control group (TTR > 75%) (major bleeding rates 3.85% versus 1.96% versus 1.58%, respectively; P < 0.01). It has therefore been difficult to translate safety outcomes from clinical trials into general practice, when outcomes vary by TTR, and TTR varies by population. In a meta‐analysis investigating a study setting's influence on TTR, trial study populations had a significantly higher mean TTR compared with community‐based cohort study populations (66.4% versus 56.7%; P < 0.001). Because there is conflicting evidence on the safety of warfarin, clinicians have been shown to underuse anticoagulant therapy, especially in the elderly — a population typically with greater risk for stroke in AF.

The challenges to optimal warfarin use and achieving adequate INR control are complex and multifactorial. Genetic mutations have been described that alter the pharmacodynamics of warfarin, and environmental factors such as various drugs (through the cytochrome P450 [CYP] system), herbal supplements, dietary changes in vitamin K, and certain disease states (ie, liver dysfunction) can affect warfarin's pharmacokinetics. Due to the variable dose response of warfarin, frequent monitoring is required, which creates a significant barrier to its use. There has subsequently been a demand for oral anticoagulant drugs with a wider therapeutic window, that do not require frequent monitoring, that are easier to administer for the patient, and that exhibit fewer drug–drug and diet–drug interactions.

### Recommendations for clinical warfarin genotyping allele selection: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology and the college of American pathologists [^113VBnZq]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2020). High credibility.

Discussion — Warfarin has been widely used for the past six decades and interindividual dose variability mandates frequent international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring after initiation; since 2010, clinicians have been able to obtain CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes and use either the FDA prescribing label or PGx dosing algorithms to define dose requirements. The diversity of available testing platforms and variants interrogated can lead to inconsistencies in results among laboratories, and content differences between testing panels and laboratories may result in patients receiving discordant genotyping results and dosing recommendations. The updated 2017 CPIC guideline incorporated additional variants predictive of normal dose requirements in patients of African descent, and to implement these recommendations both the availability of self-reported ancestry and interrogation for specific alleles are essential. This document offers a two-tier categorization of variants to aid assay design, defining a tier 1 minimum target list and identifying tier 2 variants with gaps requiring additional evidence or RMs before routine clinical PGx testing.

### Pharmacogenetic labeling of FDA-approved drugs: a regulatory retrospective [^111XNbuS]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

Incremental accumulation of pharmacogenomic evidence on the relationship between CYP2C9 and VKORC1 gene variants, warfarin dosing requirements, stability of anticoagulant response, and clinical outcomes stimulated a second pharmacogenomic labeling revision in 2010. Published literature was extensively evaluated, including data from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium. Continued discussions with external subject matter experts in conjunction with FDA research collaborations further informed the assessment of the evidence. The data and various approaches to address this pharmacogenetic interaction were extensively vetted; again, mixed opinions were articulated about the lack of prospective randomized clinical trials, issues with availability of approved/cleared tests, merits of testing beyond INR monitoring, and actual feasibility of genetic testing.

We deliberated over 2 key issues that have become germane to the evaluation of most pharmacogenetic interactions identified in the post-marketing setting: 1) how prescriptive to be in terms of pharmacogenetic testing; and 2) the most useful way to convey the various dose requirements among patients with different compound genotypes. Making pharmacogenetic testing a condition of prescribing warfarin (i.e. as a companion diagnostic) was not seen as a viable option given the widespread need for warfarin and the potential barriers to testing in the clinic, including the turnaround time for genotype results. As such, the decision was made to be explicit about likely maintenance dose requirements in patients whose genotypes were known. The revised labeling also reflected that prescribers should consider these variable dosing requirements in the selection of an initial warfarin dose and bear in mind that patients with certain genotypes (e.g. CYP2C9 variant carriers) may exhibit prolonged time to reach therapeutic INR.

### Self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation: does it work outside trial conditions? [^115T6m63]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

An estimated 950 000 people in the UK receive oral anticoagulant therapy (OAT) and the numbers are increasing at approximately 10% per year. The main driver for this expansion is the increasing use of OAT for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, where less than 25% of patients are thought to be receiving OAT.

Several studies in the UK have shown the quality of care achieved by patient self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation to be at least as good as that attained by hospital or primary care anticoagulation clinics. – However, these studies used only selected patients who were already established on warfarin and managed in anticoagulation clinics for several months prior to enrolment. Furthermore, the uptake of self-monitoring was highly variable (10–41%) and the dropout rate in most studies has been high (9–42%), prompting suggestions that self-monitoring of OAT is suitable for only a minority of patients. A recent review of studies performed in the UK suggested that only 14% of all eligible patients would conduct long-term self-monitoring of UK OAT. In the majority of studies, the total population from which patients were selected was not stated, making it difficult to assess uptake in absolute terms. In our previous studies, where, as was the case in other UK studies, self-monitoring was offered to patients established on oral anticoagulation, we found that many patients were discouraged by the clinical trial setting, rather than self-monitoring per se. Others were reassured by the familiarity of the hospital anticoagulation clinic, and were reluctant to change to self-monitoring for this reason. We also identified non-compliance as a cause of poor anticoagulation control and increased dropout rates.

In the UK, patients should expect to be within their own target therapeutic range for at least 60% of the timeand, therefore, this is also the standard that any alternative model of OAT management should achieve. It has been suggested that an improvement of 10% in time in therapeutic range over routine care is required if a method is to be considered superior. Previous studies conducted in the UK have demonstrated percentage time in therapeutic range (%TIR) of 61–71% for patients who were self-testing only, and 70–76% for patients who were self-testing and self-dosing (ie, patient self-management).

The aim of this audit was to determine whether self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation from the start of treatment and outside trial conditions, is acceptable to patients and a viable alternative to regular attendance at the anticoagulant clinic.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116xQZ8f]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — warfarin selection, INR targets, and interaction-related bleeding risk: Warfarin remains the preferred agent in patients with AF receiving CYP3A4/glycoprotein– inducing agents, or moderate-severe mitral stenosis or mechanical heart valve, and the optimal INR control, with a therapeutic INR goal of 2 to 3, needs to be achieved through drug–drug interaction management, vitamin K dietary education, and routine INR monitoring. Time in therapeutic INR range showed negative correlation with risks of thromboembolism (R, −0.59; P = 0.01) and major bleeding (R, −0.59; P = 0.002); a weekly vitamin K dietary modification achieved a therapeutic INR more frequently than a conventional group (74 versus 58%; P = 0.04) at 90 days; and concomitant use of APT (OR, 1.74 [95% CI, 1.56–1.94]), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.29–2.59]), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR, 1.62 [95% CI, 1.42–1.85]), or antimicrobial agents (OR, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.45–1.83]) was significantly associated with higher risks of clinically relevant bleeding.

### Dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin in management of non-valvular atrial fibrillation in UK context: quantitative benefit-harm and economic analyses [^11754VNg]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Implications for practice and future research

Dabigatran has advantages over warfarin; the most important are that monitoring is not needed, that anticoagulation for a given dose is more predictable, and that fewer drug-drug interactions are likely. However, it also has disadvantages. Firstly, the lack of monitoring provides little ability to objectively monitor adherence, which in the real world setting is likely to be worse with dabigatran given the need for twice daily dosing and its associated higher incidence of dyspepsia. Secondly, if the patient has a serious bleed, no proven antidotes exist. Thirdly, some uncertainty exists about dosing in certain clinical settings such as renal failure, old age, and concomitant intake of amiodarone, which may lead to either underdosing or overdosing given that no pharmacodynamic marker for monitoring exists. Fourthly, the safety and efficacy of thrombin inhibitors in the longer term (beyond two years) are uncertain, although the follow-up study of RE-LY patients should yield valuable information.

An important finding from the cost effectiveness analysis is that dabigatran is not cost effective when compared in patients whose INR is well controlled or in centres that achieve good INR control. Part of the reason for such variability in the time within the therapeutic range with warfarin is the presence of genetic polymorphisms in the CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genes. At least four randomised trials are running globally in which genotype guided prescribing of warfarin, which is predicted to improve the time within the therapeutic range, is being tested against current clinical care. Whether dabigatran would be cost effective against genotype guided prescribing of warfarin is unclear and needs further evaluation. Furthermore, other competitors to dabigatran are due to be evaluated for licensing soon, such as rivaroxaban and apixaban, which have shown similar clinical effectiveness to warfarin but have not been tested against dabigatran. Thus, although the arrival of new anticoagulants should be welcomed, their place in the prevention of strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation in comparison with warfarin (perhaps genotype guided) needs further evaluation. In the end, a stratified approach may represent the best approach to maximise both the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of anticoagulation in patients with atrial fibrillation.

### Comparative effectiveness of warfarin management strategies: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^117Luyy9]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Warfarin management strategies

Twenty-two trials compared usual care with other warfarin management strategies. The practice of usual care appeared similar across these trials, although some details of the protocols varied. These variations ranged from physicians adjusting the warfarin dose based on INR readings and dosing algorithms to practices where physicians managed INR monitoring and warfarin dosing adjustments without the support of an anticoagulation protocol (Appendix 3). Healthcare providers in the 12 AMS trials were pharmacists (6 trials), a multidisciplinary team (1 trial), nurses (1 trial), and unspecified healthcare providers (4 trials). In 9 PST trials, patients performed their own INR tests during the maintenance phase at the following frequencies: once a week (5 trials), every two weeks (3 trials), every month (1 trial), or at an unknown frequency (1 trial). Warfarin dosing instruction was received from various sources, including computer application/software guiding healthcare providers (4 trials), physicians (2 trials), and unspecified healthcare providers (3 trials). The frequency of INR measurements by patients in the 13 PSM trials were as follows: once a week (6 trials), every two weeks (4 trials), at patient's discretion (2 trials), or at unspecified intervals (1 trial).

Risk of bias of included trials

Since the risk of bias may vary for certain steps in RCTs across different outcomes, the risk of bias in the included trials was assessed and reported separately for each outcome (see Appendix 4). Among the 15 trials reporting all-cause mortality, 9 were justified as having a low risk of bias, 4 an unclear risk, and 2 a high risk of bias. For other outcomes, a higher proportion of trials exhibited an overall unclear risk of bias. This was attributed to the need for clearer reporting of outcome assessments. For example, 14 out of 18 trials, and 12 out of 17 trials were justified as having unclear risk of bias for major bleeding, and major TE.

### Predictors of warfarin-associated adverse events in hospitalized patients: opportunities to prevent patient harm [^1138q14k]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimum international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring frequency for hospitalized patients receiving warfarin is unknown.

Objective

Assess relationship between daily versus less frequent INR monitoring and overanticoagulation and warfarin-related adverse events.

Design

Retrospective cohort study using Medicare Patient Safety Monitoring System data.

Setting

Randomly selected acute care hospitals across the United States.

Patients

Patients hospitalized from 2009 to 2013 for pneumonia, acute cardiac disease, or surgery who received warfarin.

Interventions

None.

Measurements

(1) Association between frequency of INR monitoring and an INR ≥ 6.0 or warfarin-related adverse event. (2) Association between the rate of change of the INR and a subsequent INR ≥ 5.0 and ≥ 6.0.

Results

Among 8529 patients who received warfarin for ≥ 3 days, for 1549 (18.2%) the INR was not measured on 2 or more days. These patients had higher propensity-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of having a warfarin-associated adverse event (OR: 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–2.17) for cardiac patients and surgical patients (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.20–2.48), with no significant association for pneumonia patients. Cardiac and pneumonia patients with 1 day or more without an INR measurement had higher propensity-adjusted ORs of having an INR ≥ 6.0 (OR: 1.61, 95% CI: 1.07–2.41 and OR: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.36–2.71, respectively). A 1-day increase in the INR of ≥ 0.9 occurred in 621 patients (12.5%) and predicted a subsequent INR of ≥ 6.0 (positive likelihood ratio of 4.2).

Conclusion

Daily INR measurement and recognition of a rapidly rising INR might decrease the frequency of warfarin-associated adverse events in hospitalized patients.

### Warfarin INR test meters… [^115NWhkq]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

An INR test meter is a portable, battery-operated meter, used to monitor patient response to warfarin. The meter has a screen that displays results, and an opening for meter-specific test strips. A test strip is inserted into the meter, and then a lancet is used to obtain blood which is applied to the test strip. The meter reads the test strip, measures how long it takes the blood to clot, and provides the result based on a standardized calculation in the form of the International Normalized Ratio, or INR. The INR is used by patients and physicians to determine if warfarin dosing is appropriate. INR test meters and test strips are medical devices regulated by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA wants to ensure patients and health care providers use these devices safely. Please read on for more information. Monitoring Warfarin Warfarin must be monitored to ensure it is working effectively and being used safely.

Achieving the correct warfarin dosage can be difficult but is extremely important. If the dose of warfarin is too low, the patient is at risk of developing harmful blood clots. If the dose of warfarin is too high, the patient may be at risk of serious bleeding. It can be monitored by drawing blood from a vein and sending the blood to an accredited laboratory to test, or it can be monitored by testing blood from a fingerstick with an INR test meter outside of a laboratory. INR test meters may be prescribed to patients for use in the home, and they may also be used by health care providers at the point of care, such as a health care setting. How often an INR test meter is used to monitor warfarin, and the results a patient should expect, will be based on recommendations from the patient's health care provider. An INR target range is set by a health care provider. It is typically between 2. 0 and
3.

0 for basic blood-thinning needs, though the range may vary based on a patient's specific conditions. An INR above the patient-specific target range may increase the risk of bleeding, while an INR below the target range may increase the risk of developing a blood clot. What types of problems should be reported. The following are examples of some of the problems that may arise and should be reported:

### Self-monitoring and self-management of oral… [^115WzQLR]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer In patients taking warfarin for anticoagulation, there is moderate-quality evidence that both self-monitoring and self-management reduce thromboembolic events, and that self-management reduces all-cause mortality. There is low- to moderate-quality evidence that neither self-management nor self-monitoring reduces major or minor hemorrhage. Physicians should consider self-management or self-monitoring for patients who are willing and able to use these strategies. Portable point-of-care devices for monitoring long-term oral anticoagulation have been available since the 1990s. Self-monitoring is a strategy in which the patient can measure his or her international normalized ratio with a POC device, then adjust warfarin dosing by calling a clinic for advice.

Self-management strategies refer to patient use of a POC device to measure the INR and adjust warfarin dosage according to a predetermined schedule on physician-approved algorithms. Advantages of both strategies may include patient convenience, ease of monitoring, and fewer thromboembolic complications. A 2006 study suggested that self-monitoring and self-management are cost-effective strategies for those receiving long-term oral anticoagulation. 2 A previous version of this review found that use of POC devices by patients for self-monitoring or self-management of anticoagulation improved all-cause mortality, rates of venous thromboembolism, and rates of minor hemorrhage. Self-monitoring also improved rates of major hemorrhage. 3 In updating this Cochrane review, the authors found 10 new trials with 4, 227 additional patients to bring the aggregate to 28 randomized controlled trials including 8, 950 participants.

6 For many patients with atrial fibrillation, guidelines now recommend using a direct anticoagulant; however, for those with stage IV chronic kidney disease, a mechanical prosthetic valve, or rheumatic mitral stenosis, warfarin is still preferred. 7 Current guidelines from the U. K. 's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend using POC monitors for self-monitoring of anticoagulation by patients with atrial fibrillation or heart valve disease who can be suitably trained, 8 but NICE does not recommend self-monitoring or self-management for patients with venous thromboembolism. 9.
