## Question

Could there be an unidentified substance released by the ovary that boosts female libido during ovulation? I've tested estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, LH, and FSH, and they aren't changing in a way that predicts libido — please help.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether an unidentified ovarian substance could boost libido, especially around ovulation, and explain why estradiol, testosterone, progesterone, LH, and FSH do not track with libido, and what an explanation and path forward would be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overall biopsychosocial model of sexual desire and whether a single hormone could plausibly govern it. Then, I should verify measurement limitations and intracrine mechanisms that might uncouple serum values from tissue effects. Next, I will examine ovarian candidates beyond the "usual five", consider non-ovarian neuromodulatory and contextual factors that vary with ovulation, and identify methodological gaps in the testing strategy. Finally, I will synthesize a coherent explanation and outline a clinical plan including assessment tools and evidence-based therapies, while double-checking safety and guideline recommendations [^113iGFLj] [^111gK2zf].

> Let me first confirm the core premise. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: female sexual desire is classically modeled as biopsychosocial, not as a single-hormone switch, and the ISSWSH process of care explicitly frames hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) as multifactorial with neuroendocrine, medical, interpersonal, and cultural contributors, so a lack of tight correlation between any single ovarian hormone and libido is expected rather than paradoxical. I should also verify consensus statements regarding endogenous androgens; the global position statement concludes there is no blood level cutoff of any circulating androgen that distinguishes women with and without sexual dysfunction, reinforcing that serum values are imperfect proxies for desire-related biology [^113iGFLj] [^111gK2zf].

> I need to check why standard hormone measurements often fail to predict libido. Wait, let me verify intracrine and receptor-level issues: much androgen action in women is intracrine, with local conversion of precursors within target tissues and variable androgen receptor expression and enzymatic activity, so circulating levels may not mirror tissue exposure or response. I should double-check assay performance too; direct immunoassays for total and especially free testosterone are unreliable in the female range, and even LC-MS/MS studies generally show only weak associations of androgens with desire in premenopausal women, which makes poor serum-behavior correlations unsurprising. In short, the biology is local and nuanced, while our measurements are systemic and noisy [^116BGQd1] [^114kXfbP] [^111QYQER] [^111gK2zf].

> Next, I should review temporal dynamics. Hmm, wait a minute, pulsatility and diurnal variation mean a single time point risks misclassification of the physiologic state. I need to ensure we account for the fact that morning values often overestimate the daily mean; for example, LH shows about an 18% drop from the initial morning value to the day-long mean in detailed sampling, so phase- and time-specific collection matters for interpretation of any hormone-behavior link across the cycle [^115DfUeZ].

> Let me consider whether any other ovarian signals could be the "missing factor". Inhibin B is a key negative regulator of FSH and modulates LH across the cycle, and AMH has feedback associations as well, but guidelines do not support AMH for primary ovarian insufficiency diagnosis, underscoring that its physiologic role in desire is uncertain. I should also think about neurosteroids like allopregnanolone derived from progesterone, which can modulate GABAergic tone and potentially central sexual inhibition, although standard progesterone assays would not capture this nuance. Wait, I should verify my thought on oxytocin: although oxytocin is an excitatory neuromodulator in sexual pathways, it is primarily hypothalamic-pituitary rather than an ovarian hormone, and there is no direct evidence that ovarian oxytocin output accounts for mid-cycle libido changes in women, so I should not overstate that pathway here [^115Cigxg] [^111j4H9E] [^117S9r3m] [^112AEvsA] [^114oqyAq].

> I will now examine non-ovarian factors that covary with ovulation and could amplify desire without a novel ovarian hormone. Central excitatory and inhibitory neuromodulators shift the gating of desire; dopamine, norepinephrine, oxytocin, and melanocortins promote excitation while serotonin imposes inhibition, and subtle cycle-phase changes in these systems could alter incentive salience independent of gonadal serum levels. But wait, what if context is the driver? The incentive motivation model shows relationship satisfaction and partner-related factors strongly shape whether arousal translates into desire, and observational data indicate single women report higher sexual activity in the ovulatory phase, suggesting behavioral and contextual amplification rather than a discrete endocrine trigger [^114oqyAq] [^113CzHpm] [^113RtGDk].

> I should double-check methodological gaps in the testing strategy. Initially I thought measuring free testosterone would be more informative, but hold on, I should verify assay guidance: direct free T assays are unreliable in women; a better approach is LC-MS/MS total T with calculated free T or equilibrium dialysis when feasible. I need to ensure other axes are considered too; cortisol decreases with genital arousal and prolactin elevations can suppress libido, so omitting these can miss meaningful signals. Let me reconsider inter-individual thresholds as well; while derived from men, each person appears to have a reproducible androgen "symptom threshold" that varies widely across individuals, implying that between-person comparisons of absolute levels can obscure within-person effects over time [^114kXfbP] [^115RLTVc] [^115ivieG] [^112Sp4X3].

> Synthesizing this, there is no evidence for a single unidentified ovarian "libido hormone". The discordance you observed likely reflects intracrine and receptor-level mechanisms uncaptured by serum assays, neuromodulatory gating in central circuits that ovarian steroids modulate but do not directly command, assay and sampling limitations that obscure true within-person dynamics, and strong psychosocial determinants that often outweigh endocrine signals in predicting desire and behavior. I need to ensure the synthesis aligns with guidelines and data showing weak serum-androgen associations and robust contextual contributions before concluding, which it does [^116BGQd1] [^111QYQER] [^114oqyAq] [^113CzHpm].

> For a clinical path forward, let me first confirm best-practice assessment. Use a biopsychosocial approach with a validated screener such as the Decreased Sexual Desire Screener to identify modifiable contributors, review psychotropics and serotonergic agents that inhibit desire, and consider other medications that alter the HPG axis, including opioids, or contraceptives that may affect sexual response. I should verify hormone testing methods and timing; if pursued, use LC-MS/MS total testosterone and calculate free testosterone or obtain equilibrium dialysis, and sample across relevant cycle days to capture intra-individual patterns. If generalized, acquired HSDD persists after addressing contributors, a shared decision-making discussion about an off-label, physiological-dose transdermal testosterone trial is reasonable, with informed consent, targeting premenopausal physiologic ranges, and monitoring for androgenic effects, guided by RCT evidence of benefit in postmenopausal women and specialist guidelines. Wait, let me verify dosing and documentation requirements one more time: guidelines endorse doses approximating 300 mcg/day via patch or equivalent cream, emphasize off-label status and informed consent, and recommend discontinuation if no meaningful benefit by about 6 months, which should be documented carefully [^114zoFyN] [^114oqyAq] [^113UVKfC] [^111ZUzkX] [^114GtERN] [^113xxYe5] [^113BPZ8e].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and cautious: female libido is an emergent property of interacting neuroendocrine and psychosocial systems, not a single ovarian secretion, and mid-cycle increases in sexual interest are more parsimoniously explained by subtle shifts in known neurochemical and contextual factors, amplified by ovulatory timing, rather than a novel endocrine entity. Clinically, a structured biopsychosocial assessment, careful attention to confounders and assay methodology, and, when appropriate, a monitored trial of physiologic-dose transdermal testosterone represent the most evidence-aligned path forward [^113iGFLj] [^113RtGDk] [^114GtERN].

Current evidence does not support an unidentified ovarian substance that boosts libido at ovulation. The periovulatory rise in desire is best explained by estradiol-driven central dopamine and oxytocin signaling, with possible roles for ovarian oxytocin and kisspeptin, androgens, and adrenal DHEA [^116AuKii] [^111QYQER]. Libido is shaped by a multifactorial network of hormones, neurotransmitters, and psychosocial factors, not a single ovarian factor [^113iGFLj].

---

## Established hormonal influences on female libido

### Estradiol

Estradiol rises pre-ovulation and enhances mesolimbic **dopamine**, increasing sexual motivation. Estradiol upregulates **oxytocin receptors**, amplifying oxytocin's pro-social and pro-sexual effects.

---

### Testosterone as well as androgens

Circulating testosterone shows **weak, inconsistent links to desire** in premenopausal women [^111QYQER] [^114kXfbP]. Local conversion of **androgen precursors (e.g. DHEA)** in brain and genital tissues may influence desire [^116BGQd1].

---

### Progesterone

Progesterone rises after ovulation and is associated with **reduced sexual desire**, consistent with its anxiolytic, sedative, and GABAergic effects.

---

### LH and FSH

LH and FSH regulate ovarian steroidogenesis but do not **directly modulate libido**.

---

## Potential ovarian factors influencing libido

### Oxytocin

The ovary produces **oxytocin**, which may act locally or systemically to enhance sexual motivation and pair bonding. Oxytocin release during sexual activity and orgasm reinforces **sexual behavior and partner bonding**.

---

### Kisspeptin

Kisspeptin initiates the **LH surge** and may modulate sexual motivation via limbic pathways. Kisspeptin administration increases **sexual arousal and motivation** in animal models.

---

### Inhibins and activins

Inhibin B and activins regulate FSH but have **no direct link to libido** [^115Cigxg].

---

### Relaxin

Relaxin modulates reproductive tissues during pregnancy; **no evidence links it to libido**.

---

## Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators

- **Dopamine**: Central driver of sexual motivation, enhanced by estradiol.
- **Serotonin**: Inhibits sexual desire; SSRIs often reduce libido [^114oqyAq].
- **Oxytocin**: Facilitates sexual motivation and bonding [^115yvyS5].
- **Nitric oxide**: Mediates genital vasodilation and arousal [^113UNmud].

---

## Psychosocial and contextual factors

- **Relationship quality**: Satisfaction and emotional intimacy strongly predict desire [^113CzHpm].
- **Stress and mood**: Anxiety, depression, and stress reduce libido [^111wZNnR].
- **Cultural norms**: Sociocultural attitudes shape sexual behavior and desire [^115Weq9W].

---

## Clinical implications and research directions

- **Multifactorial model**: Libido reflects interacting hormonal, neural, and psychosocial factors [^114zoFyN].
- **Ovarian oxytocin**: A plausible contributor to periovulatory desire; needs targeted study.
- **Kisspeptin**: Central modulator of sexual motivation; warrants further research.

---

## Conclusion

There is **no single ovarian factor** explaining periovulatory libido; the rise in desire reflects estradiol-driven dopamine and oxytocin signaling, with possible contributions from ovarian oxytocin, kisspeptin, as well as androgens. Libido is shaped by a **multifactorial network** of hormonal, neural, and psychosocial influences [^114kXfbP].

### Biochemical factors modulating female genital sexual arousal physiology [^113UNmud]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Female genital sexual arousal responses are complex neurophysiological processes consisting of central and peripheral components that occur following sexual stimulation. The peripheral responses in sexual arousal include genital vasocongestion, engorgement, and lubrication resulting from a surge of vaginal and clitoral blood flow. These hemodynamic events are mediated by a host of neurotransmitters and vasoactive agents.

- **Aim**: To discuss the role of various biochemical factors modulating female genital sexual arousal responses.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using the PubMed database, and citations were selected based on topical relevance and examined for study methodology and major findings.

- **Main outcome measures**: Data from peer-reviewed publications.

- **Results**: Adrenergic as well as non-adrenergic non-cholinergic neurotransmitters play an important role in regulating genital physiological responses by mediating vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle contractility. Vasoactive peptides and neuropeptides also modulate genital sexual responses by regulating vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle cells and epithelial function. The endocrine milieu, particularly sex steroid hormones, is critical in the maintenance of tissue structure and function. Reduced levels of estrogens as well as androgens are associated with dramatic alterations in genital tissue structure, including the nerve network, as well as the response to physiological modulators. Furthermore, estrogen as well as androgen deficiency is associated with reduced expression of sex steroid receptors.

### Genital arousal and responsive desire among women with and without sexual interest/arousal disorder symptoms [^113CzHpm]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

A key feature of the incentive motivation model is that the connection between arousal and desire depends on other relevant factors. Notably, romantic relationships are a common context in which women experience distressing sexual difficulties, such as low desire, and relationship factors have been linked to several sexual outcomes within romantic relationships, including desire.

The incentive motivation model emphasizes that the emergence of desire from arousal is partially determined by the incentive value placed on a sexual stimulus and the sexual experiences that it represents. Emotional connection with a romantic partner plays an influential role in motivating sexual activity with that partner, suggesting that the quality of a romantic relationship could affect the value of sex with a romantic partner and, in turn, the degree to which genital arousal triggers desire for that partner. Recent evidence indicates the powerful role that relationship satisfaction plays in links between subjective arousal and responsive desire, with high relationship satisfaction enhancing the ability of subjective arousal to trigger desire for a partner.

Moreover, recent advances in the study of sexual desire have highlighted the crucial need to distinguish among desire targets when investigating what predicts sexual desire. Desire measures commonly used today typically distinguish between solitary and dyadic desire. Much of the literature on women and low desire has focused on women in romantic relationships and, often implicitly, sexual desire specifically for their romantic partners.

### Understanding the role of serotonin in female hypoactive sexual desire disorder and treatment options [^114oqyAq]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The neurobiology of sexual response is driven in part by dopamine and serotonin, with dopamine modulating excitatory pathways and serotonin regulating inhibitory pathways. Neurobiological underpinnings of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) are seemingly related to overactive serotonin activity that results in underactive dopamine activity. Consequently, pharmacologic agents that decrease serotonin, increase dopamine, or some combination thereof, have therapeutic potential for HSDD.

- **Aim**: To review the role of serotonin in female sexual function and the effects of pharmacologic interventions that target the serotonin system in the treatment of HSDD.

- **Methods**: Searches of the Medline database for articles on serotonin and female sexual function.

- **Outcomes**: Relevant articles from the peer-reviewed literature were included.

- **Results**: Female sexual response is regulated not only by sex hormones but also by several neurotransmitters. It is postulated that dopamine, norepinephrine, oxytocin, and melanocortins serve as key neuromodulators for the excitatory pathways, whereas serotonin, opioids, and endocannabinoids serve as key neuromodulators for the inhibitory pathways. Serotonin appears to be a key inhibitory modulator of sexual desire, as it decreases the ability of excitatory systems to be activated by sexual cues. Centrally acting drugs that modulate the excitatory and inhibitory pathways involved in sexual desire (e.g. bremelanotide, bupropion, buspirone, flibanserin) have been investigated as treatment options for HSDD. However, only flibanserin, a multifaceted agent, is currently approved for this purpose.

Do androgen levels correlate with sexual function and predict HSDD?

Research determining the associations between androgens (testosterone and its metabolite 5α-DHT) has been limited by the low levels in women, insufficient sensitivity and specificity of immunoassays to evaluate these low levels, and, until recently, a high degree of cross-reactivity between testosterone and other circulating steroids. The limited available data indicate weak, independent associations between testosterone (measured by LC-MS/MS) with sexual desire, orgasm, and self-image in premenopausal women. Testosterone (measured by the RIA) has been associated with sexual desire, arousal, and masturbation frequency in midlife women. Early follicular phase levels of total and free testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) have been positively correlated with self-reported sexual desire in premenopausal women aged 25–44 years who are not using hormonal contraception, whereas no correlation was found in women with HSDD.

A recent study of women aged 18–39 years, with regular menstrual cycles, not using any sex steroid therapy, who had sex steroids measured by LC-MS/MS, found weak positive associations between both sexual desire and sexual pleasure and DHEA as well as androstenedione. Orgasm was positively correlated with both testosterone as well as androstenedione. All analyses were adjusted for age, body mass index, cycle stage, smoking, parity, partner status, and psychoactive medication.

In a study examining HSDD in postmenopausal women, the prevalence was significantly greater in surgically menopausal women.

### Testosterone therapy for reduced libido in women [^114JGuQH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2010). Low credibility.

Modest benefit has been shown from transdermal testosterone therapy given to postmenopausal women with reduced sexual desire. An increased frequency of satisfying sexual encounters and intensity of sexual desire and response has been demonstrated in medically and psychiatrically healthy women who are able to have 2–3 satisfying sexual experiences each month before therapy commences. Women who are more clearly sexually dysfunctional, in keeping with currently proposed definitions of sexual disorder, have not been studied.

Numerous factors are known to influence women's sexual desire, with mood and feelings towards the partner showing the most robust associations. Identifying women whose low desire might stem from low testosterone activity remains a challenge, as neither serum levels of testosterone nor its metabolites correlate with desire or function. Production of androgens in the brain, sensitivity of the androgen receptors, and activity of cofactors are all potentially relevant confounds.

The long-term safety of systemic testosterone, with or without estrogen, is unknown. However, understanding it is necessary as women's sexual lives tend to endure as long as there is an active partner.

### Testosterone for midlife women: The hormone of desire [^115hSvRm]. Menopause (2015). Low credibility.

Testosterone declines with aging, so most midlife women have "low" testosterone levels. Because libido also declines with aging and distressing sexual problems peak at midlife, should midlife women with low libido and associated distress be treated with testosterone? This Practice Pearl reports clinical trial evidence, reviews the risks, and explains how testosterone might be used in a clinical setting. For women who may be considering a trial of testosterone therapy, limitations and adverse effects should be disclosed, and appropriate monitoring should be instituted once treatment has begun.

### The impact of hormones on menopausal sexuality: A literature review [^114rGXxP]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Menopause is associated with physiological and psychological changes that influence sexuality. During menopause, the primary biological change is a decrease in circulating estrogen levels. Estrogen deficiency initially accounts for altered bleeding and diminished vaginal lubrication. Continual estrogen loss often leads to numerous signs and symptoms, including changes in the vascular and urogenital systems. Alterations in mood, sleep, and cognitive functioning are common as well. These changes may contribute to lower self-esteem, poorer self-image, and diminished sexual responsiveness and sexual desire.

- **Nonhormonal factors**: Other important nonhormonal factors that affect sexuality are health status and medications, changes in or dissatisfaction with the partner relationship, social status, and cultural attitudes toward older women.

- **Treatment options**: The problems in sexual functioning related to estrogen deficiency can be treated with hormone therapy that includes estrogens alone and estrogens combined with androgens. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers also may be useful in ameliorating postmenopausal sexual complaints.

This article reviews the literature on the impact of menopausal estrogen loss on sexuality and on the effect of hormone therapy on sexual function during menopause.

### Association of sex hormones with sexual function, vitality, and physical function of symptomatic older men with low testosterone levels at baseline in the testosterone trials [^114LsE5o]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

The prevalence of sexual dysfunction, low vitality, and poor physical function increases with aging, as does the prevalence of low total and free testosterone (TT and FT) levels. However, the relationship between sex hormones and age-related alterations in older men is not clear.

The objective of this study was to test the hypotheses that baseline serum TT, FT, estradiol (E2), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels are independently associated with sexual function, vitality, and physical function in older symptomatic men with low testosterone levels participating in the Testosterone Trials (TTrials).

- **Design**: Cross-sectional study of baseline measures in the TTrials.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted at 12 sites in the United States.

- **Participants**: The 788 TTrials participants were ≥ 65 years and had evidence of sexual dysfunction, diminished vitality, and/or mobility disability, and an average of two TT < 275 ng/dL.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Main outcome measures**: Question 4 of the Psychosocial Daily Questionnaire (PDQ-Q4), the FACIT-Fatigue Scale, and the 6-minute walk test.

- **Results**: Baseline serum TT and FT, but not E2 or SHBG levels, had small, but statistically significant associations with validated measures of sexual desire, erectile function, and sexual activity. None of these hormones was significantly associated within or across trials with FACIT-Fatigue, PHQ-9 Depression or Physical Function-10 scores, or gait speed.

- **Conclusions**: FT and TT levels were consistently, independently, and positively associated, albeit to a small degree, with measures of sexual desire and erectile function.

### Experimental models for the study of female and male sexual function [^117QLL36]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Significant progress has been made in understanding the physiological and pharmacological mechanisms of human sexual functioning through preclinical research in animal models.

- **Aim**: To provide evidence-based documentation of the experimental models evaluating male and female sexual function for useful clinical translation.

- **Methods**: Consensus discussion over the past 18 months, leading to summarized views of seven experts from six countries.

- **Main outcome measure**: The report was based on the critical analysis of scientific information available in literature and subcommittee presentations, discussions, and exchanges of ideas and feedback.

- **Results**: Fundamental research in animal models has led to considerable understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying desire, arousal, genital, and other sexual responses, and the design of rational pharmacological treatments for certain sexual dysfunctions in males and females. Tissue and cellular in vitro systems have provided critical information on in vivo interactions and modulations in the presence and absence of chemical, biological, vascular, neurologic, endocrine, and genetic inputs. The animal models seem indispensable for elucidating the biophysiological and etiopathological aspects of male and female sexual disorders.

- **Conclusions**: Useful insights into the human experience have been derived from basic research in ways that are far more difficult to obtain in humans, both scientifically and ethically. The animal model with a good predictive value can be used successfully as a preclinical tool.

### Associations among physiological and subjective sexual response, sexual desire, and salivary steroid hormones in healthy premenopausal women [^115RLTVc]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Few studies have examined how sexual arousal influences healthy premenopausal women's hormones, limiting our understanding of basic physiology and our ability to transfer knowledge from clinical and nonhuman populations.

- **Aim**: To examine how sexual arousal and steroid hormones (testosterone [T], cortisol [C], estradiol [E]) were linked, to see whether hormone levels influenced and/or changed in response to sexual arousal elicited via visual erotic stimuli in healthy women.

- **Methods**: Participants included 40 healthy premenopausal women not using exogenous hormones.

- **Main outcome measures**: Change in genital sexual arousal (vaginal pulse amplitude), change in subjective sexual arousal, sexual desire (via the Sexual Desire Inventory and Female Sexual Function Index scales), as well as T, C, and E via saliva samples taken before and following viewing of erotic stimuli as genital arousal was recorded via a vaginal photoplethysmograph.

- **Results**: Estradiol (E) increased in response to sexual stimuli, but this was not statistically associated with genital sexual arousal, whereas cortisol (C) decreased in association with genital sexual arousal, and testosterone (T) showed no statistically significant change. Relationship status was linked to genital but not subjective sexual arousal, with dating women exhibiting higher genital sexual arousal than single or partnered women. Results indicated that all three hormones were associated with self-reported genital arousal (via the Detailed Assessment of Sexual Arousal scales) and sexual desire in different domains, and both T and E were associated with self-reported measures.

This guideline was developed with the administrative support of the ISSWSH and the contributions from a multidisciplinary panel of international experts. The panel, consisting of 16 researchers and clinicians, who were the ISSWSH members and nonmembers, convened to review and discuss clinical management strategies for the use of testosterone using a modified Delphi method. In preparation, the panelists conducted an evidence-based literature review that included original research, meta-analyses, reviews, and clinical practice and consensus guidelines regarding testosterone in women. Where guidance is not provided in the Global Position Statement, previously published guidelines have been used. At the consensus meeting, the panelists presented summaries of the literature; discussion of testosterone measurement, formulations, and indications for treatment; and developed consensus for this clinical guideline.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^114GtERN]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). High credibility.

There is consistent evidence from placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs) indicating that testosterone therapy is more effective than placebo for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in postmenopausal women. The earlier studies evaluated testosterone implants and oral testosterone formulations; however, these modes of testosterone administration often result in supraphysiological concentrations.

In contrast, treatment of women with transdermal testosterone, administered either as a patch releasing 300 mcg of testosterone per day or a manufactured cream delivering 5 mg testosterone in 0.5 mL (10 mg/mL) daily, results in free testosterone levels within the normal premenopausal range. Transdermal testosterone enhances sexual desire and reduces sexually associated personal distress in naturally and surgically menopausal women, both with and without concomitant estrogen ± progestogen therapy, who present with HSDD.

In studies involving women with HSDD, transdermal testosterone also increased the frequency of satisfying sexual events, arousal, orgasm frequency, pleasure, responsiveness, and self-image, while reducing sexual concerns. In two studies, surgically menopausal women with HSDD treated with transdermal testosterone experienced a statistically significantly greater and meaningful treatment benefit compared to those who received placebo, as reported during face-to-face interviews. Women who reported experiencing a clinically meaningful benefit achieved larger statistically significant improvements in sexual desire, satisfying sexual activity, and personal distress than those not identifying with such benefit.

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^111gK2zf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

Recommendations pertaining to the associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and female sexual function: The associations between endogenous androgen concentrations and sexual function in women remain uncertain because of issues relating to the sensitivity and specificity of androgen assays in some studies and insufficient data. The physiology of androgens is complex because of their conversion in tissues and possible intracrine metabolism in multiple tissues. No cutoff blood level can be used for any measured circulating androgen to differentiate women with and without sexual dysfunction (Grade C).

- **Systemic testosterone therapy for postmenopausal women**: Recommendations suggest using doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, based on findings from meta-analyses of placebo/comparator-controlled RCTs. There are insufficient data to make any recommendations regarding the use of testosterone in premenopausal women for treatment of sexual function or any other outcome.

- **Testosterone treatment of naturally or surgically postmenopausal women with HSDD**: Testosterone therapy, in doses that approximate physiological testosterone concentrations for premenopausal women, exerts a beneficial effect on sexual function. This includes increases, above the effects of placebo/comparator therapy, of an average of one satisfying sexual event per month, and increases in the subdomains of sexual desire, arousal, and orgasm.

### Hormone therapy for sexual function in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis update [^111EbvfH]. Menopause (2023). High credibility.

Seventeen of the 20 studies published since December 2012 might suffer from attrition bias given the high amount of missing data. Nevertheless, the effect of hormone therapy on sexual function did not change when excluding studies at high risk of bias. Among these trials, missingness for sexual function was usually higher than for other outcomes. Proper use of the FSFI could reduce the amount of missing data. Measuring sexual function over a 6-month period rather than 4 weeks could reduce the number of participants excluded after randomization; this has been previously suggested and is validated in women who have sex with women. Similarly, missing data could also be reduced by rephrasing the FSFI to include all forms of vaginal penetration, or by using a measure such as the Day-to-Day Impact of Vaginal Aging questionnaire, which considers nonpenetrative sexual activity.

Furthermore, nearly all studies that investigated sexual satisfaction used the FSFI satisfaction domain; however, one question cannot be answered by unpartnered women, and high rates of missing data for this question were reported in the Menopause Strategies: Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) trials. Therefore, restricting inclusion to women who have a partner or using a scale that does not require the responder to have a partner could reduce the amount of missing data. Finally, clinical trial participants may be uncomfortable discussing sexuality compared with other health-related topics, so future RCTs could add willingness to answer sexuality questionnaires as a criterion.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^113iGFLj]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The biopsychosocial treatment model for female sexual dysfunctions, such as hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), involves multiple etiologies that encompass biopsychosocial factors. These include neuroendocrine imbalance, physical health issues, disease, interpersonal difficulties, psychological distress, and sexually repressive cultural and religious values. The ISSWSH POC for HSDD offers an efficient way to diagnose HSDD while identifying etiologic factors and establishing a subsequent treatment pathway.

Treatments should adhere to a biopsychosocial model, incorporating pharmacologic options (hormonal and nonhormonal agents), psychotherapy, or multimodal treatments that combine pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. The optimal strategy involves identifying which biopsychosocial factors are compromised, likely contributing to distressing symptoms, and amenable to evidence-based solutions tailored to these predisposing factors. If psychosocial factors have been modified, or if these factors are present but not the primary source of sexual dysfunction onset, or if there are no psychosocial factors, then biological etiologic factors should be considered.

Systemic testosterone, targeting central nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, shows clear efficacy for treating HSDD in postmenopausal women. Even when the primary etiology is biological, symptoms may be maintained or exacerbated by psychosocial and interpersonal factors that have resulted from a biologically based female sexual dysfunction. Furthermore, when the etiology of generalized, acquired HSDD appears to be multifactorial, it is crucial to consider both biological and psychosocial aspects to ensure comprehensive treatment.

### Effects of testosterone on sexual function in men: Results of a meta-analysis [^113NQqzd]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

The role of androgen decline in the sexual activity of adult males is controversial. To clarify whether sexual function would benefit from testosterone (T) treatment in men with partially or severely reduced serum T levels, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo-controlled studies published in the past 30 years. The aim of this study was to assess and compare the effects of T on the different domains of sexual life.

A comprehensive search of all published randomized clinical trials was performed in MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Contents databases. Guided by prespecified criteria, software-assisted data abstraction and quality assessed by two independent reviewers, a total of 17 randomized placebo-controlled trials were found to be eligible. For each domain of sexual function, we calculated the standardized mean difference relative to T and reported the results of pooled estimates of T treatment using the random effect model of meta-analysis. Heterogeneity, reproducibility, and consistency of the findings across studies were explored using sensitivity and meta-regression analysis.

Overall, 656 subjects were evaluated: 284 were randomized to T, 284 to placebo (P), and 88 treated in cross-over. The median study length was 3 months (range 1–36 months). Our meta-analysis showed that in men with an average T level at baseline below 12 nmol/l, T treatment moderately improved the number of nocturnal erections, sexual thoughts and motivation, number of successful intercourses, and scores of erec.

### Do hormones influence women's sex? Sexual activity over the menstrual cycle [^113RtGDk]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

In mammals, the effects of ovarian steroids influence sexual behavior. In humans, there are a few studies that take into account if ovulation occurs.

- **Aim**: The study aims to investigate if a woman's sexuality changes during the week and over the menstrual cycle, and if so, in what way.

- **Methods**: This is a prospective cohort study involving 1,957 heterosexual women over the period of January 2004 to December 2011. Two subgroups were considered: women having a partner and singles.

- **Main outcome measure**: Sexual interviews, along with the Female Sexual Function Index and Female Sexual Distress Scale questionnaires, were used to exclude women with sexual dysfunction. Women with ovulation confirmed by sonography were enrolled. Participants were given diary cards to report their daily sexual activity. Serum concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, total testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, and free androgen index were measured during the follicular, periovular, and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.

- **Results**: One thousand one hundred eighty women (age range 18–40 years) were included in the analyses. Of them, 925 were in a heterosexual relationship and 255 were single. Women with a partner had more sexual activity during the weekend, while singles maintained constant sexual activity throughout the week. The sexual activity of singles was higher during the ovulatory phase and lower during menses compared to women with a partner. A linear correlation was found between sexual activity as well as androgenic hormonal profile during the menstrual cycle in women with and without a partner.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116LMSro]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for male hypogonadism, particularly in terms of indications for screening, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend asking male patients with diabetes or prediabetes about their sexual health, specifically low libido and erectile dysfunction. Patients should be screened with a morning serum total testosterone level if symptoms and/or signs of hypogonadism are detected, such as low libido, erectile dysfunction, and depression.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^114zoFyN]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). High credibility.

A summary of the key clinical recommendations for this clinical practice guideline is described in the Global Position Statement. Where evidence is not available, this panel relied on expert opinion and widely established clinical principles.

- **Key take-away messages**: Following the ISSWSH Process of Care (POC) for HSDD, assessment of low sexual desire includes the use of the validated self-report screening and diagnostic instrument, the Decreased Sexual Desire Screener, that enables the diagnosis of generalized, acquired HSDD and identification of associated biopsychosocial factors. The clinician and the patient should discuss the results of the Decreased Sexual Desire Screener to determine the relative importance of these contributors. Recommended strategies also include a detailed sexual history that incorporates information about sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain, as well as other aspects of sexual activity and function as indicated. Sexual history taking may involve partnered and unpartnered sexual activity, past and present relationships, and sexual experiences. Regarding the discrepancy of desire between the patient and her partner, the patient should be diagnosed with HSDD only if the discrepancy causes her distress.

Confounders of normal desire, such as concomitant medications (e.g. antidepressants, antihypertensives), life events (e.g. pregnancy, lactation, surgery), and relationship issues, should be fully explored.

### Sexual functioning in 4,418 postmenopausal women participating in UKCTOCS: a qualitative free-text analysis [^113HGypC]. Menopause (2019). Low credibility.

Sexual problems were sometimes linked to medication use for both women and their partners (204/2,883; 7.1%). Most responses referred to drug-related loss of libido, erectile dysfunction (ED), or the inability to have penetrative sex. Few women mentioned that these problems had been restricting their sex life for many years, whereas others had accepted the situation. One participant shared: "My husband is on medication which prevents him from getting an erection. However, we are both quite happy with a kiss and cuddle after 42 years of marriage" (64 years old; inactive).

Many of these physical health-related problems significantly affected sexual function. Some women reported that they or their partner were embarrassed and reluctant to discuss sexual issues with a healthcare provider. As one respondent noted, "My husband is taking tablets which may or may not make him impotent. At 75, he thinks it is not necessary to discuss that with his GP [primary care physician]; I disagree" (68 years old; inactive).

Help-seeking and treatment for sexual problems were mentioned by only 174 participants (174/2,883; 6%), predominantly by sexually active women (143/174; 82.2%). A primary healthcare professional, usually a primary care physician, was the main source of support for participants who disclosed this information. Erection-enhancing medication (i.e. sildenafil) was often mentioned in relation to ED.

- **Menopause-related interventions**: Interventions used for menopause-related symptoms were mostly vaginal lubricants or moisturizers and hormone creams. Past use of systemic hormone therapy (HT) was mentioned by 63 women (2.2%).

### Global consensus position statement on the use of testosterone therapy for women [^114kXfbP]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2019). Low credibility.

- **Measurement of testosterone, female sexual dysfunction, and endogenous androgen levels**:
	1. Recommendations pertaining to the measurement of circulating testosterone in women:

		Testosterone may act directly via the androgen receptor/nongenomic androgenic action or by reduction to the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone and/or aromatization to estradiol and their metabolites. Testosterone concentrations decline during the reproductive years (Level IIB). Testosterone concentrations appear to be maintained in women beyond the age of 65 years, but whether this confers a benefit is yet to be understood (Level IIB).

		Total testosterone can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility using liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays (Grade B). Direct assays for the measurement of total and free testosterone are highly unreliable in the female range (Grade A).

		Reference laboratories should be "harmonized" with biological standards in coordination with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Expert Opinion). Measurement of testosterone using direct assays in clinical practice is appropriate if liquid/gas chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry assays are not available, to exclude high baseline concentrations and also to exclude supraphysiological concentrations during treatment (Expert Opinion).

		Research into testosterone physiology and clinical effects should mainly focus on measuring total testosterone as the main biomarker rather than "free" testosterone because evidence that "free" testosterone is the biologic indicator is limited.

### Approach to the patient: The evaluation and management of men ≥ 50 years with low serum testosterone concentration [^114XKuPY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

The first step in evaluating a man with low serum testosterone is to determine his pretest probability of hypogonadism. It is important to note the significant overlap between the nonspecific symptoms of hypogonadism and depression. Given the patient's report of depressed mood and fatigue, he was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, which screened negative for major depression.

A careful assessment of symptoms and signs specific to hypogonadism is crucial. According to the initial European Male Ageing Study, three sexual symptoms — low libido, erectile dysfunction, and reduced morning erections — were consistently associated with low serum testosterone levels in a syndromic manner. Among these, diminished libido had the highest odds ratio for indicating low serum testosterone concentration. It is important to consider that this study cannot establish causality; therefore, reduced sexual activity might lower serum testosterone, suggesting a potential reverse causation.

The prevalence of these sexual symptoms in the study was noted to be 25% to 35% even among men with normal serum testosterone levels. Symptoms such as fatigue and low mood are nonspecific and have low diagnostic value, as they may also be indicative of systemic disease. However, the presence of sexual dysfunction symptoms along with low serum testosterone may suggest hypogonadism.

### Female orgasmic disorder: How far we have [not] come [^1175ZoMi]. International Urogynecology Journal (2025). Low credibility.

The female orgasm is a complex physiological and psychological response essential for sexual well-being and overall health. Historically misinterpreted, its significance is now better understood through modern research integrating neurobiological, hormonal, and psychological factors. Female orgasmic disorder (FOD), characterized by persistent difficulty in achieving orgasm, significantly affects emotional and relational well-being. This review summarizes knowledge on the female orgasm, its dysfunction, and treatment modalities.

- **Methods**: A comprehensive literature search was conducted using MEDLINE/PubMed and Google Scholar, focusing on studies published between 2000 and 2024. Keywords included "female orgasmic disorder", "female orgasm", "anorgasmia", and "female sexual dysfunction". After screening abstracts and full texts, 20 articles were included, supplemented by additional sources through reference review.

- **Results**: The female orgasm involves interplay between anatomical structures such as the clitoris, vagina, and pelvic floor muscles, as well as neural pathways and hormonal interactions. FOD is classified as primary (lifelong) or secondary (acquired) and is influenced by psychosocial, relational, and medical factors. Treatment options include cognitive-behavioral therapy, directed masturbation, pelvic floor muscle training, pharmacological interventions such as sildenafil, bupropion, or hormonal therapy, mechanical devices, and emerging regenerative therapies such as platelet-rich plasma and stem cell treatments.

### Endocrine aspects of female sexual dysfunction [^1153mDMp]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Various endogenous hormones, including estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, and prolactin, may influence female sexual function.

- **Aim**: To provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of women with endocrinologic sexual difficulties.

- **Methods**: The Endocrine Aspects of Female Sexual Dysfunction Committee was part of a multidisciplinary International Consultation. It included four experts from two countries and several peer reviewers.

- **Main outcome measure**: Expert opinion was based on committee discussion, a comprehensive literature review, and evidence-based grading of available publications.

- **Results**: The impact of hormones on female sexual function and their etiological roles in dysfunction is complex. Research data are limited as studies have been hampered by a lack of precise hormonal assays and validated measures of sexual function in women. Sex steroid insufficiency is associated with urogenital atrophy and may also adversely affect central sexual thought processes. Systemic estrogen/estrogen progestin therapy alleviates climacteric symptoms; however, there is no evidence that this therapy specifically improves hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premenopausal or postmenopausal women. Exogenous testosterone has been shown in small randomized controlled trials (RCT) to improve sexual desire, arousal, and sexual satisfaction in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women. However, as there is no biochemical measure that clearly identifies who to treat, the use of exogenous testosterone should be considered only after other causes of HSDD have been excluded.

### Sexual effects of androgens in women: Some theoretical considerations [^114m9c2S]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

To consider explanations for the inconsistent evidence concerning the behavioral effects of androgens in women, the following possible explanatory mechanisms are explored: [1] Women vary in their behavioral responsiveness to testosterone (T). [2] Some reported effects of exogenous T may be induced by increasing bioavailable estrogen. [3] Sexual effects of T may be secondary to direct effects on mood. [4] The relationship between T and sexuality is readily obscured by psychological mechanisms. [5] Stress-induced increases in adrenal androgens may further confuse the picture. [6] Women who respond to T do so at levels that are ineffective in men. There is no evidence of a threshold in women above which further increases in T have no additional effect.

A theoretical model involving desensitization of the central nervous system to T during early development in males is presented as a possible explanation for some of these relevant differences between men and women and for much of the conflicting evidence in the literature on women.

### Androgen use for low sexual desire in midlife women [^116jod7A]. Menopause (2013). Low credibility.

Andrea, a 53-year-old postmenopausal woman, is concerned about her loss of desire for sexual activity. Her last menstrual period occurred 2 years ago, and she has experienced minimal vasomotor symptoms. She has a loving relationship with her husband, to whom she has been married for 5 years and with whom she has previously enjoyed sexual intimacy, often initiating it. She is disturbed by the fact that not only has she no sexual desire but also that she has become unresponsive to her husband's sexual advances. The problem predates menopause by 1 to 2 years. She has recently heard that testosterone may be a treatment for this and wants to know what options are available.

### Night sweats, sleep disturbance, and depression associated with diminished libido in late menopausal transition and early postmenopause: baseline data from the Herbal Alternatives for Menopause Trial (HALT) [^111wZNnR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the association of depression, sleep disturbance, and menopausal symptoms with diminished libido. Data from a 2001–2002 baseline survey of 341 peri- and postmenopausal women, aged 45–55 years, participating in a randomized trial, was analyzed. Eligibility included at least 2 hot flashes and/or night sweats per day and no hormone therapy for at least the prior 3 months. The survey evaluated sexual function, depression, sleep, and vasomotor symptoms. We examined the association between these factors using multivariate regression models.

Of 341 women, 64% had diminished libido, 18% had moderate to severe depression, and 43% had poor sleep quality. Women averaged 4.6 hot flashes and 1.9 night sweats per day. Depressive symptoms (P = 0.003), poor sleep (P = 0.02), and night sweats (P = 0.04) were significantly associated with diminished libido.

Factors associated with diminished libido in midlife are complex but include depression, disturbed sleep, and night sweats, all common symptoms of the menopausal transition and early menopause.

### Testosterone for low libido in postmenopausal women not taking estrogen [^113xxYe5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The efficacy and safety of testosterone treatment for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in postmenopausal women not receiving estrogen therapy are unknown.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week trial in which 814 women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder were randomly assigned to receive a patch delivering 150 or 300 micrograms of testosterone per day or a placebo. Efficacy was measured to week 24; safety was evaluated over a period of 52 weeks, with a subgroup of participants followed for an additional year. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 24 in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes.

- **Results**: At 24 weeks, the increase in the 4-week frequency of satisfying sexual episodes was significantly greater in the group receiving 300 micrograms of testosterone per day than in the placebo group (an increase of 2.1 episodes vs. 0.7, P < 0.001) but not in the group receiving 150 micrograms per day (1.2 episodes, P = 0.11). As compared with placebo, both doses of testosterone were associated with significant increases in desire (300 micrograms per day, P < 0.001; 150 micrograms per day, P = 0.04) and decreases in distress (300 micrograms per day, P < 0.001; 150 micrograms per day, P = 0.04). The rate of androgenic adverse events, primarily unwanted hair growth, was higher in the group receiving 300 micrograms of testosterone per day than in the placebo group (30.0% vs. 23.1%). Breast cancer was diagnosed in four women who received testosterone (as compared with none who received placebo); one of the four received the diagnosis in the first 4 months.

Before prescribing testosterone therapy, clinicians should obtain informed consent. They should explain that for women, it is an off-label therapy. Through shared decision-making, they should counsel regarding the benefits and risks, recognizing the patient's goals and concerns, and provide detailed documentation of the discussion.

Dosing should be targeted to achieve testosterone concentrations in the physiologic premenopausal range. In a study of premenopausal women with no complaints of sexual dysfunction intended to define normal female androgen values, women aged 20–29 years, 30–39 years, and 40–49 years had testosterone values ranging from 45.5 to 57.5 ng/dl, 27.6 to 39.8 ng/dl, and 27.0 to 38.6 ng/dl, respectively. This range is approximately 1/10th–1/15th of the systemic testosterone values in healthy men (range 300–800 ng/dl). Thus, treatment using any male product for women should be initiated using one-tenth of the recommended starting dose for men.

By 2030, using the age of 50 years as a proxy for menopause, the world population of postmenopausal women will be around 1.2 billion, with an incidence of 47 million reaching menopause each year. In addition, increasing numbers of women experience menopause earlier, with adverse health consequences affecting multiple systems, including those relevant to sexual health, often associated with significant distress.

The terms premature ovarian insufficiency (less than age 40 years) and early menopause (less than age 45 years) describe the spectrum of conditions associated with the loss of ovarian function before the age of natural menopause.

- **Spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency**: This is idiopathic and can be caused by chromosomal and genetic defects, and is associated with autoimmune disorders, infections, metabolic disturbances, and environmental factors.
- **Induced ovarian failure**: This results from interventions such as pelvic radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgical oophorectomy, including risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in women with BRCA mutations.

Circulating ovarian hormone levels of both estrogens as well as androgens are abruptly decreased and more substantially reduced after surgical menopause than natural menopause. The prevalence of primary ovarian insufficiency in women younger than 40 years is approximately 1%; younger than 30 years, 0.1%; and younger than 20 years, 0.01%, with little difference by ethnicity. Spontaneous early menopause affects approximately another 5% of women between ages 40 and 45 years.

### Biological and psychosocial pathophysiology of female sexual dysfunction during the menopausal transition [^112AEvsA]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Although increasing age is a primary determinant of reduced sexual function in older women, hormonal changes may significantly contribute to female (and couples') sexual dysfunction.

- **Aim**: To analyze the most relevant biological, psychosexual, and/or contextual factors that influence changes in women's sexuality during and after menopause.

- **Methods**: A Postmenopausal FSD Roundtable consisting of multidisciplinary international experts was convened to review specific issues related to postmenopausal women and sexual dysfunction.

- **Main outcome measure**: Expert opinion was based on a review of evidence-based medical literature, presentation, and internal discussion.

- **Results**: Menopause is associated with physiological and psychological changes that influence sexuality. The primary biological change is a decrease in circulating estrogen levels. Estrogen deficiency initially accounts for irregular menstruation and diminished vaginal lubrication. Continual estrogen loss is associated with changes in the vascular, muscular, and urogenital systems, as well as alterations in mood, sleep, and cognitive functioning, influencing sexual function both directly and indirectly. The age-dependent decline in testosterone as well as androgen function, starting in the early 20s, may precipitate or exacerbate aspects of female sexual dysfunction. These effects are most pronounced following bilateral ovariectomy and consequent loss of 50% or more total testosterone. The contribution of progestogens to sexual health and the variability in the effects of specific progestogens are being increasingly explored.

### International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^115wW8UD]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The brain is one of the most important targets for sex hormones throughout the lifespan. Some research supports the role of estradiol in the central modulation of sexual desire. Other research demonstrates that testosterone has enduring influences on many neural and behavioral functions via both genomic and nongenomic actions. The neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the influence of testosterone on sexual behavior in women are still not completely understood. It remains unclear whether testosterone positively modulates sexual desire in women through a direct stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR) or through its conversion to estrogen and subsequent binding to estrogen receptors.

Consistent with preclinical data, two lines of evidence point toward a direct, AR-mediated effect of testosterone on sexual behavior in women. One is based on the fact that estrogen-alone therapy in postmenopausal women was associated with a small to moderate improvement in sexual function, particularly in pain, with no effect on libido, sexual desire, and interest. Second, in a study of postmenopausal women using transdermal estradiol and testosterone gel randomized to an aromatase inhibitor or placebo, total and free testosterone in the physiologic range was associated with improvement in sexual satisfaction, well-being, and mood. Aromatase inhibition did not appear to influence the outcome. Existing evidence, therefore, suggests that testosterone conversion into estradiol is not necessary to exert its beneficial effects on sexuality.

### Gonadotrophins for idiopathic male factor subfertility [^113ZQX3o]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Male factors leading to subfertility account for at least half of all cases of subfertility worldwide. Although some causes of male subfertility are treatable, treatment of idiopathic male factor subfertility remains empirical. Researchers have used gonadotrophins to improve sperm parameters in idiopathic male factor subfertility with the ultimate goal of increasing birth and pregnancy rates, but results have been conflicting.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effect of systemic follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on live birth and pregnancy rates when administered to men with idiopathic male factor subfertility.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register (14 January 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, Issue 12 of 12, 2012), Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily and Ovid MEDLINE (1946 to 14 January 2013), Ovid EMBASE (1980 to week 2 of 2013), Ovid PsycINFO (1806 to week 2 of 2013), trial registers for ongoing and registered trials at ClinicalTrials.gov (19 January 2013), the World Health Organisation International Trials Registry Platform (19 January 2013), The Cochrane Library Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (19 January 2013), and OpenGrey for grey literature from Europe (19 January 2013). Searches were not limited by language. Bibliographies of included and excluded trials and abstracts of major meetings were searched for additional trials.

### Interrelationships between ovarian and pituitary hormones in ovulatory menstrual cycles across reproductive age [^115Cigxg]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Ovarian hormones regulate pituitary gonadotropin secretion across the menstrual cycle via negative and positive feedback mechanisms. The contribution of individual hormones is complex and is a continuing area of research.

- **Objective**: The aim of the study was to identify relationships between LH/FSH and estradiol, progesterone, inhibin A, inhibin B, and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) in ovulatory menstrual cycles across reproductive age.

- **Design**: Serum ovarian and pituitary hormones were studied in a group of young (45 yr; n = 55) women. The slopes of the regression lines relating the ovarian and pituitary hormones were determined by multiple linear regression analysis and expressed with 95% confidence intervals for each ovarian hormone, with FSH and LH as independent variables. Both simultaneous and delayed (time lagged) relationships were examined.

- **Results**: Clear associations were evident for the lagged prediction of FSH, with significant negative associations being evident with inhibin B and AMH in the follicular phase and with estradiol, inhibin B, progesterone, and AMH in the luteal phase. For the lagged prediction of LH, significant positive and negative associations were observed with estradiol and inhibin B, respectively, in the follicular phase and a negative association with progesterone and inhibin B in the luteal phase.

- **Conclusions**: It is concluded that in the follicular phase, inhibin B is a major feedback regulator of FSH and may also be a negative feedback regulator of LH. AMH may be indirectly involved in FSH regulation.

### Brixadi [^113UVKfC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Chronic use of opioids may influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, leading to androgen deficiency. This may manifest as low libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, amenorrhea, or infertility. The causal role of opioids in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadism is unknown because various medical, physical, lifestyle, and psychological stressors that may influence gonadal hormone levels have not been adequately controlled in studies conducted at the time of writing. Patients presenting with symptoms of androgen deficiency should undergo laboratory evaluation.

- **Cardiac electrophysiology**: Thorough QT studies with buprenorphine products have demonstrated modest QT prolongation of ≤ 15 msec. Two categorical analyses of cardiovascular-specific adverse events among patients exposed to buprenorphine demonstrated no proarrhythmic potential. One Holter monitoring study demonstrated no arrhythmia. An analysis of medical literature provided no evidence for a causal association between buprenorphine and Torsades de Pointes.

- **Physiological effects**: Buprenorphine in IV (2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 mg) and sublingual (12 mg) doses have been administered to opioid-experienced subjects who were not physically dependent. This was done to examine cardiovascular, respiratory, and subjective effects at doses comparable to those used for the treatment of opioid use disorder. Compared to placebo, there were no statistically significant differences among any of the treatment conditions for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, O2 saturation, or skin temperature over time. Systolic blood pressure was higher in test subjects.

### Predictors of decreased libido in women during the late reproductive years [^116kESTf]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

To identify risk factors for decreased libido among women in the late reproductive years, a prospective cohort study was conducted. Women aged 35 to 47 years, identified through random digit dialing, were prospectively followed for four years with serial hormone assays and standardized questionnaires. Mean hormone values, hormone trends over four years, and fluctuation in hormone levels were compared among women with and without a decrease in libido at the last assessment period. Total testosterone, dihydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, body mass index, psychosocial, and socioeconomic variables were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression.

Of 326 women, 87 (27%) reported a decreased libido, whereas 239 (73%) did not. Participant-specific means for all hormone levels over the study period were similar among both groups. However, total testosterone fluctuation over the study was significantly different between groups. Women whose testosterone levels fluctuated from 3.8 to 21.5 ng/dL around a mean value of 9 ng/dL were four times more likely to report decreased libido compared with women with little fluctuation in testosterone [odds ratio (OR) 4.0; 95% CI, 1.6–10.0]. Depression (OR 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9–6.1), vaginal dryness (OR 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8–6.6), and children living at home (OR 1.4; 95% CI, 1.1–1.7) were also independently associated with decreased libido.

Decreased libido in the late reproductive years is associated with a pronounced fluctuation in total testosterone over time. Other independent risk factors include depression, vaginal dryness, and having children living at home.

If a woman does not experience clinically meaningful improvement, treatment should not be continued beyond 6 months. Other causes for the symptoms should be reinvestigated. In women not responding to testosterone therapy, measurement of 5α-reductase could be considered, as some experts propose that women with reduced 5α-reductase activity may not respond to physiologic doses of transdermal testosterone. If testosterone therapy results in improvement of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), the expert panel recommended that the woman continue for 6–12 months and then consider taking a drug holiday to see if treatment is still required. Furthermore, the panel concluded that although there is a lack of long-term safety data, ongoing testosterone therapy may be needed to maintain the improvement in HSDD.

### Future sexual medicine physiological treatment targets [^112SC5oK]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Sexual function in men and women incorporates physiological processes and the regulation of the central and peripheral nervous systems, the vascular system, and the endocrine system. There is a need for state-of-the-art information due to the evolving research understanding of the underlying molecular biological factors and mechanisms governing sexual physiological functions.

- **Aim**: To develop an evidence-based, state-of-the-art consensus report on the knowledge of the major cellular and molecular targets of biological systems responsible for sexual physiological function.

- **Methods**: State-of-the-art knowledge representing the opinions of seven experts from four countries was developed in a consensus process over a two-year period.

- **Main outcome measures**: Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate.

- **Results**: Scientific investigation in this field is needed to increase knowledge and foster development of future treatments for all forms of biologically-based sexual dysfunction. This article addresses the knowledge of the major cellular and molecular targets of biological systems responsible for sexual physiological function. Future treatment targets include growth factor therapy, gene therapy, stem and cell-based therapies, and regenerative medicine.

- **Conclusions**: Scientific discovery is critically important for developing new and increasingly effective treatments in sexual medicine. Broad physiological directions should be vigorously explored.

### Endocrinologic control of men's sexual desire and arousal/erection [^115ivieG]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Several hormones and neurotransmitters orchestrate men's sexual response, including the appetitive (sexual desire) and consummative (arousal and penile erection) phases.

- **Aim**: To provide an overview and recommendations regarding endocrinologic control of sexual desire and arousal/erection and their disturbances.

- **Methods**: Medical literature was reviewed by the subcommittee of the International Consultation of Sexual Medicine, followed by extensive internal discussions and a public presentation with other experts. The role of pituitary (prolactin, oxytocin, growth hormone, and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone), thyroid, and testicular hormones was scrutinized.

- **Main outcome measures**: Recommendations were based on grading of evidence-based medical literature, followed by interactive discussions.

- **Results**: Testosterone plays a primary role in controlling and synchronizing male sexual desire and arousal, acting at multiple levels. Meta-analysis indicates that testosterone therapy for hypogonadal individuals can improve low desire and erectile dysfunction. Hyperprolactinemia is associated with low desire, which can be successfully corrected by appropriate treatments. Oxytocin and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone are important in eliciting sexual arousal; however, the use of these peptides, or their analogs, for stimulating sexual arousal is still under investigation. Evaluation and treatment of other endocrine disorders are suggested only in selected cases.

- **Conclusion**: Endocrine abnormalities are common in patients with sexual dysfunction.

### Quantifying the variability in the assessment of reproductive hormone levels [^115DfUeZ]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to quantify how representative a single measure of reproductive hormone level is of the daily hormonal profile using data from detailed hormonal sampling in the saline placebo-treated arm conducted over several hours.

Design: This research involved a retrospective analysis of data from previous interventional studies evaluating reproductive hormones.

Setting: The study was conducted at the Clinical Research Facility at a tertiary reproductive endocrinology center at Imperial College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Patients: In total, 266 individuals were included in the analysis, comprising healthy men and women (n = 142) and those with reproductive disorders and states (n = 124). Among these, 11 had functional hypothalamic amenorrhoea, 6 had polycystic ovary syndrome, 62 women and 32 men had hypoactive sexual desire disorder, and 13 were postmenopausal women.

Interventions: Data from these individuals, who had undergone detailed hormonal sampling in the saline placebo-treated arms of previous research studies, was used to quantify the variability in reproductive hormones due to pulsatile secretion, diurnal variation, and feeding. This was measured using the coefficient of variation (CV) and entropy.

Main Outcome Measures: The study assessed the ability of a single measure of reproductive hormone level to reflect the variability in reproductive hormone levels due to pulsatile secretion, diurnal variation, and nutrient intake.

Results: It was found that the initial morning value of reproductive hormone levels was typically higher than the mean value throughout the day. For example, there was an 18.4% decrease in luteinizing hormone level from the initial morning measure to the daily mean.

### Committee opinion no. 698: Hormone therapy in primary ovarian insufficiency [^11456jZ8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for primary ovarian insufficiency, more specifically with respect to hormone therapy, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend achieving replacement levels of estrogen as a first-line approach for hormone therapy (either orally or transdermally). It is advised not to obtain serum estradiol level testing to monitor the effects of treatment.

### Physiology of female sexual function: Animal models [^116AuKii]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Data concerning the physiology of desire, arousal, and orgasm in women are limited because of ethical constraints. The aim is to gain knowledge of the physiology of female sexual function through animal models.

- **Methods**: To provide state-of-the-art knowledge concerning female sexual function in animal models, representing the opinions of seven experts from five countries, developed in a consensus process over a two-year period.

- **Main outcome measure**: Expert opinion was based on the grading of evidence-based medical literature, widespread internal committee discussion, public presentation, and debate.

- **Results**: Sexual desire may be considered as the presence of desire for, and fantasy about, sexual activity. Desire in animals can be inferred from certain appetitive behaviors that occur during copulation and from certain unconditioned copulatory measures. Proceptive behaviors are dependent in part on estrogen, progesterone, and drugs that bind to D1 dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, oxytocin receptors, opioid receptors, or gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. Peripheral arousal states are dependent on the regulation of genital smooth muscle tone. Multiple neurotransmitters and mediators are involved, including adrenergic, and nonadrenergic, noncholinergic agents such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, nitric oxide, neuropeptide Y, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and substance P. Sex steroid hormones, estrogens, as well as androgens are critical for the structure and function of genital tissues, including modulation of genital blood flow, lubrication, and neurotransmitter function.

### The effects of hormonal contraceptives on female sexuality: A review [^111ZUzkX]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Hormonal contraceptives can influence female sexual function. The goal of this article was to provide a comprehensive review of the effects that various hormonal contraceptives may have on female sexual function.

- **Methods**: A Medline search was conducted using several terms related to and including contraception, oral contraceptive, female sexual function, dyspareunia, libido, and sexual desire.

- **Results**: A thorough review analyzed the effects of hormonal contraceptives on female sexual function.

- **Conclusions**: The sexual side effects of hormonal contraceptives are not well studied, particularly concerning their impact on libido. There appear to be mixed effects, with a small percentage of women experiencing an increase or a decrease in libido, while the majority remain unaffected. Healthcare providers must be aware that hormonal contraceptives can have negative effects on female sexuality to counsel and care for their patients appropriately.

### Questions in psychiatry (QuiP): Assessing sexual well-being [^115Weq9W]. Bipolar Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

When evaluating sexual dysfunction, it is crucial to determine whether contributing factors occurred in the past or are ongoing.

- **Factors to consider when assessing sexual functioning**:
	- **Psychological factors**: Mental illness, such as anhedonia or reduced libido, subsyndromal symptoms like anxiety, and trauma from emotional, physical, or sexual abuse.

	- **Physical health**: Chronic medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and gynecological and reproductive history, such as endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and the use of hormonal contraception.

	- **Treatments**: The impact of psychotropics, like antidepressants and antipsychotics; medications, such as diuretics and antihypertensives; and complementary therapies, including St John's Wort.

### Blood testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms [^112Sp4X3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

There are few systematic studies of the relationship between blood testosterone concentrations and the symptoms of overt androgen deficiency. Because most testosterone preparations are relatively short-term, the rapid changes in blood testosterone concentrations they cause make it difficult to define any testosterone threshold. By contrast, subdermal testosterone implants provide stable blood testosterone concentrations over days to weeks, while gradually declining to baseline over 5–7 months. This provides an opportunity to define a blood testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms by observing androgen-deficient men as their familiar symptoms return as testosterone pellets slowly dissolve.

Among 52 androgen-deficient men who underwent 260 implantations over 5 years, at the time of return of androgen deficiency symptoms, the blood total and free testosterone concentrations were highly reproducible within individuals (F = 0.8, P = 0.49 and F = 1.4, P = 0.24, respectively) but varied markedly between men (F = 167 and F = 138, both P < 0.001), indicating that each person had a consistent testosterone threshold for androgen deficiency symptoms that differed markedly between individuals. The most reported symptoms of androgen deficiency were lack of energy, lack of motivation, and reduced libido. The symptomatic threshold was significantly lower in men with secondary hypogonadism compared with men with primary or mixed hypogonadism (total, 9.7 ± 0.5 nmol/liter vs. 11.7 ± 0.4 nmol/liter and 10.2 ± 0.3 nmol/liter, P = 0.006; free, 146 ± 10 p).

### Hormone abnormalities are not related to the erectile dysfunction and decreased libido found in many men with infertility [^112obBoC]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether hormonal markers predict erectile dysfunction (ED) and symptoms of testosterone deficiency syndrome (TDS), which are commonly found in the population of infertile men.

The design was a retrospective study utilizing a prospectively maintained infertility database.

- **Setting**: A tertiary referral center.
- **Patients**: A total of 1,750 of 2,783 men presenting for evaluation of infertility between 1995 and 2010 completed validated questionnaires.
- **Interventions**: Androgen Deficiency in the Aging Male (ADAM) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men questionnaires were administered. Baseline risk factors for ED and TDS were also measured. Subjects underwent serum hormone evaluation for total testosterone (T), calculated bioavailable T, sex hormone-binding globulin, E2, LH, FSH, and prolactin (PRL).
- **Main outcome measures**: Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine the significance of hormonal markers in predicting ED (Sexual Health Inventory for Men score < 22) and/or a positive ADAM score.

The results showed that the prevalence of ED and a positive response to the ADAM questionnaire were 30.5% and 45.2%, respectively, in this population (mean age, 36 years). Low serum T (total T < 10 nmol/L) was found in 29.4%. Neither T nor bioavailable T was significantly associated with the symptoms of ED or TDS on multivariable regression analysis.

The conclusions indicate that erectile dysfunction and TDS in young, infertile men seem to be unrelated to hormone changes.

### Endocrine aspects of women's sexual function [^115yvyS5]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Endocrine changes during aging, as well as endocrine disorders, may either directly or indirectly modulate female sexual function by altering sex hormones or by impacting vascular, neurogenic, or psychological factors.

- **Aim**: To review information on the impact of hormonal changes associated with aging or those caused by endocrine disorders on female sexual function, and information on the risks and benefits of hormonal treatments.

- **Methods**: Committee members outlined topics and reviewed the published literature on endocrine aspects of female sexual function over a 2-year period. Recommendations were presented at the International Consultation on Sexual Medicine in Paris, France, 2009, and revised accordingly.

- **Main outcome measures**: Quality of data published in the literature and recommendations were based on the GRADES system.

- **Results**: Recommendations and guidelines concerning the role of sex hormones and endocrine disorders in female sexual function were derived.

- **Conclusions**: Hormones are only one component of the many factors that contribute to normal sexual function in women. Further research is needed on the impact of hormones and endocrine disorders on female sexual dysfunction and the benefits and risks of hormonal therapies.

### Normal male sexual function: Emphasis on orgasm and ejaculation [^112oxvX9]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Orgasm and ejaculation are two separate physiological processes that are sometimes difficult to distinguish. Orgasm is an intense, transient peak sensation of intense pleasure creating an altered state of consciousness associated with reported physical changes. Antegrade ejaculation is a complex physiological process that is composed of two phases (emission and expulsion) and is influenced by intricate neurological and hormonal pathways. Despite the many published research projects dealing with the physiology of orgasm and ejaculation, much about this topic is still unknown. Ejaculatory dysfunction is a common disorder and currently has no definitive cure. Understanding the complex physiology of orgasm and ejaculation allows for the development of therapeutic targets for ejaculatory dysfunction.

In this article, we summarize the literature on the physiology of orgasm and ejaculation, starting with a brief description of the anatomy of sex organs and the physiology of erection. Then, we describe the physiology of orgasm and ejaculation, detailing the neuronal, neurochemical, and hormonal control of the ejaculation process.

### International society for the study of women's sexual health clinical practice guideline for the use of systemic testosterone for hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women [^116BGQd1]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Low credibility.

The lack of a clear correlation between sexual function and declining androgen levels has been explained by the complexity of androgen metabolism and measurement, and the observation that circulating testosterone levels do not adequately reflect tissue concentrations. Although circulating hormone levels have been used as indicators of tissue exposure, a significant proportion of androgen synthesis may be intracrine. In this process, circulating precursors and testosterone act as prohormones and are converted to active hormones within target cells.

The complex regulation of androgen receptor (AR) expression plays a key role in androgen effects. Furthermore, androgenic effects vary according to individual variations in the amount and activity of the enzymes 5α-reductase and aromatase, as well as individual differences in the AR response. However, it is still not clear whether AR activity is a modulator of the androgenic effect on sexual desire, or if levels of intracrine activity of androgens are better parameters for assessing the androgen effect on sexual desire.

- **Rationale for testosterone therapy in women**: Although no testosterone serum concentration correlates with the presence or absence of HSDD or its severity, there is a loose correlation between testosterone concentration during treatment and its benefits for improving sexual dysfunction. Although the complexity of central and peripheral mechanisms of action of testosterone on sexual desire is not completely understood, research and clinical evidence support a positive effect of testosterone therapy on sexual desire when premenopausal physiological levels are restored.

### Update on female sexual function [^114CjsDx]. Current Opinion in Urology (2001). Low credibility.

In this review, we briefly discuss recently published data on female sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain, as well as medical and iatrogenic factors associated with female sexual function. The studies reviewed highlight a number of important methodological and etiological issues in the study of female sexual function. Researchers are urged to use standardized methods for defining sexual disorders and for selecting patient samples. Placebo-controlled studies are essential for examining the pharmacological aspects of female sexual dysfunction.

Evidence suggests that free testosterone levels may be associated with sexual desire in women. Sildenafil citrate increases genital blood flow but may not impact subjective reports of arousal. Past research implicated the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2 and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptors in female sexual function, while recent data suggest a role for the 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor. Increasing attention is being paid to medical and health conditions that impact sexual function, such as neurological conditions, cancer, hysterectomy, and cardiovascular disease.

### Obesity and sexual desire: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111WAeg7]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Impaired sexual functioning is one of the consequences of obesity, with hormonal disorders involving testosterone.

- **Aim**: To explore the link between obesity and sexual desire, assess how changes in body weight affect sexual desire, and examine the role of testosterone in these changes in obese and overweight men.

- **Methods**: The systematic review was conducted in PubMed. Studies involving obese or overweight men that reported different libido levels or changes after weight loss interventions were included. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed.

- **Results**: The search identified 2,259 studies, of which 28 met the eligibility criteria. Most studies focused on weight-loss interventions (n = 21, 77%), with 13 studies investigating the effect of bariatric surgeries. Testosterone levels were reported in 14 studies. The studies encompassed a total population of 18,653 people, including 10,356 obese and overweight men. Of the 28 identified studies, 15 indicated a potential association between BMI, waist circumference, and sexual desire. Effect size meta-analysis, calculated using data from four studies presenting results before and after bariatric surgery, suggests that an increase in the International Index of Erectile Function sexual desire domain was very strongly associated with changes in a patient's weight resulting from bariatric surgery (d = 1.22, 95% CI 0.41–2.03, P = 0.003). The meta-analysis of four studies, presenting results before and after diet intervention, showed a strong impact of weight loss on an increase in the Sexual Desire Inventory (SDI).

### Sexual desire during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause: observations from the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study [^117UabFS]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

The study aims to describe levels of sexual desire across the menopausal transition (MT) and early postmenopause (PM), including effects of age, MT-related factors, health, stress, symptoms (such as hot flashes, sleep disturbances, mood changes), and social opportunity factors.

The methods involved a subset of Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study (SMWHS) participants who provided data during early reproductive, early and late menopausal transition stages, or postmenopause (n = 286). This included menstrual calendars for staging the MT, annual health reports between 1990 and 2005, and morning urine samples assayed for estrone glucuronide (E(1)G), testosterone (T), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Multilevel modeling using the R program tested factors related to sexual desire.

The results indicate that women experienced a significant decrease in sexual desire during the late MT stage (p < 0.01) and early PM (p < 0.0001). Those with higher urinary E(1)G and T reported significantly higher levels of sexual desire, while those with higher FSH levels reported significantly lower sexual desire (p < 0.0001, 0.06, and 0.0002, respectively). Women using hormone therapy also reported higher sexual desire (p = 0.02). Conversely, those reporting higher perceived stress reported lower sexual desire (p < 0.0001), although a history of sexual abuse did not have a significant effect. Women troubled by symptoms such as hot flashes, fatigue, depressed mood, anxiety, difficulty falling asleep, early morning awakenings, and awakening during the night also reported significantly lower sexual desire (p range from < 0.03 to 0.0001).
