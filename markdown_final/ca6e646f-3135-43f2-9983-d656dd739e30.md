## Question

For black patients, what is the first line option for hypertension?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the first-line antihypertensive therapy options for Black patients, including when to use monotherapy versus combination therapy, which drug classes are recommended, and how to approach exceptions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and heart failure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline sources and their consensus. Then, I should verify the evidence base supporting race-informed initial therapy. Next, I will examine when to start with two agents versus one, and which combinations are preferred. After that, I need to check important exceptions where ACE inhibitors or ARBs are indicated despite general monotherapy cautions. Finally, I will consider practical implementation, adherence, and monitoring, and I should double-check areas of controversy or evolving evidence before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the guideline consensus so I don't jump to conclusions. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same first-line classes for Black adults without compelling indications: a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, with a strong caution against ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy because of attenuated blood pressure response in many Black patients [^111DCbKx] [^115grVaK] [^1115n7eo] [^115frrgt].

> Wait, let me verify the evidentiary foundation for that recommendation before I anchor on it. The pivotal rationale traces to ALLHAT, where Black participants randomized to lisinopril had higher rates of stroke, heart failure, and cardiovascular disease, and higher systolic blood pressure compared with chlorthalidone, whereas amlodipine performed comparably to chlorthalidone for most outcomes, supporting diuretics or CCBs as preferred initial agents in Black adults [^112FZ2Lx] [^112hemUj]. I should also confirm the quantitative BP-response signal: meta-analyses show Black adults have about a 4–5 mm Hg smaller systolic BP reduction with ACE inhibitor monotherapy versus White adults, reinforcing the caution against ACE inhibitor monotherapy in this population [^1131p2ZY] [^113yrpr4].

> Hold on, I should verify the nuance about ACE inhibitors and ARBs. I initially thought "avoid ACE inhibitors/ARBs in Black patients", but that's too broad; the correct, guideline-concordant statement is to avoid ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy in Black patients without compelling indications, because combination therapy that includes a RAS blocker is effective and often necessary, and RAS blockade is first-line when CKD with albuminuria is present or when heart failure indications exist [^115grVaK] [^113TaGwi] [^112iyGaV].

> Next, I should review when to start with combination therapy rather than monotherapy. For stage 2 hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg), guidelines recommend initiating two first-line agents from different classes, ideally as a single-pill combination, to achieve faster, more reliable control and improve adherence; this applies broadly and is emphasized for Black adults given higher severity and salt sensitivity in many cases [^113JSXaD] [^111kNc8j] [^1115n7eo]. Let me double-check the strength: ACC/AHA gives this a Class I recommendation with moderate-quality evidence, and ESC/ESH similarly endorses initial combination for most patients, including Black adults [^111kNc8j] [^1115n7eo].

> I will now examine preferred combinations so I don't overgeneralize. The most consistently supported initial combinations pair a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB with a RAS blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB), balancing efficacy and cardiorenal protection; this strategy avoids ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy while leveraging the additive BP-lowering of different mechanisms [^113JSXaD] [^1115n7eo] [^1124e2kh]. But wait, what if we consider CCB plus thiazide as initial therapy? That can lower BP, yet some data suggest CCB plus RAS blocker may yield slightly better outcomes than thiazide plus RAS blocker in high-risk African ancestry patients, so if I have to choose, I'd lean toward CCB plus RAS blocker when both are acceptable, while acknowledging the evidence is limited and individualized response matters [^117JpQsF].

> Let me consider stage 1 hypertension so I don't over-treat. For SBP 130–139 mm Hg or DBP 80–89 mm Hg, it is reasonable to start with a single first-line agent and titrate or add a second agent if BP remains above goal, with the same preference for a thiazide or CCB in Black adults absent compelling indications for RAS blockade [^114xvW8W] [^111DCbKx]. I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary guidance; yes, ACC/AHA endorses monotherapy initiation in stage 1 with close follow-up for intensification as needed [^114xvW8W].

> Now, I need to ensure I cover important exceptions where RAS blockade is actually indicated despite the general monotherapy caution. In CKD with albuminuria, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is recommended to slow kidney disease progression, often combined with a thiazide or CCB for BP control; in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, ACE inhibitor or ARB (or ARNI) is foundational; in diabetes with proteinuria, RAS blockade is likewise indicated, again frequently in combination to reach targets [^115grVaK] [^113TaGwi] [^112iyGaV]. Hold on, I should verify that these are high-strength recommendations; yes, these are consistently strong recommendations across VA/DoD, ACC/AHA, and KDIGO-aligned commentaries [^115grVaK] [^113TaGwi].

> I should double-check practical implementation details that influence real-world control. Single-pill combinations improve adherence and time-to-control, so when combination therapy is indicated, I should prefer an SPC; chlorthalidone is favored over hydrochlorothiazide when a thiazide is chosen due to stronger outcome data, and amlodipine is a reasonable CCB choice given potency and tolerability, with careful attention to edema and dose titration [^113JSXaD] [^1124e2kh] [^111UepAZ]. Let me verify that these choices align with labeling and guideline pharmacology; yes, both amlodipine and thiazide-like agents have robust BP-lowering effects and are endorsed as components of initial therapy in appropriate patients [^111UepAZ] [^1124e2kh].

> Next, I should review monitoring and escalation so I don't miss therapeutic inertia. Reassess BP within 2–4 weeks of initiation or dose change, titrate to maximally tolerated doses, and if still above goal, add a second agent from a different class; avoid simultaneous ACE inhibitor plus ARB because of potential harm, and consider spironolactone as a fourth agent for resistant hypertension after optimizing triple therapy and confirming adherence and secondary causes [^111kNc8j] [^117BqjS3]. Wait, I should confirm the harm signal for dual RAS blockade; yes, contemporary guidelines advise against ACEi + ARB combinations due to adverse renal and electrolyte effects without added benefit [^111kNc8j].

> But wait, what about the evolving debate on race-based algorithms versus individualized, physiology-guided therapy? Contemporary cohort analyses suggest the BP differences between classes are modest on average, with substantial overlap between individuals, and some experts advocate race-agnostic algorithms emphasizing combination therapy and lifestyle, which have achieved high control rates with reduced disparities in real-world programs; I need to acknowledge this while still aligning with current guideline-endorsed practice patterns that prioritize thiazides or CCBs for initial therapy in Black adults when no compelling indication dictates otherwise [^112toGNe] [^1161NWso] [^116FTHSg]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; until guideline bodies fully pivot, evidence-based care should follow the existing consensus while incorporating patient-specific comorbidities and preferences [^113JSXaD].

> Putting this together, my final, clinically actionable synthesis is as follows: for Black adults with hypertension and no compelling indication for RAS blockade, start with a thiazide-type diuretic (prefer chlorthalidone) or a dihydropyridine CCB (e.g., amlodipine). For stage 2 hypertension or if BP is more than 20/10 mm Hg above goal, initiate two agents, ideally as a single-pill combination that includes a RAS blocker paired with the thiazide or CCB. Avoid ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy. And if CKD with albuminuria, heart failure, or diabetes with proteinuria is present, prioritize RAS blockade as part of combination therapy to protect kidneys and heart while controlling BP [^111DCbKx] [^1124e2kh] [^115grVaK] [^1115n7eo].

For Black patients with hypertension, **thiazide-type diuretics or calcium channel blockers (CCBs)** are the recommended first-line therapy [^111DCbKx] because they achieve greater blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction than ACE inhibitors or ARBs as monotherapy [^112toGNe] [^112FZ2Lx]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are not recommended as initial monotherapy in Black patients without compelling indications (e.g. CKD with proteinuria) [^115hsw1Z] [^115dbKMN]. For stage 2 hypertension (≥ 140/90 mmHg), **initial combination therapy** with two agents (typically a thiazide or CCB plus a RAS blocker) is recommended to improve control and adherence [^113JSXaD] [^1115n7eo]. Therapy should be individualized based on comorbidities, tolerance, and response [^1124e2kh].

---

## Recommended first-line antihypertensive medications

Major guidelines (JNC 8, ACC/AHA, VA/DoD, and Hypertension Canada) recommend **thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs** as first-line therapy for Black patients with hypertension [^111DCbKx] [^115frrgt] [^113TaGwi]. This is supported by evidence that these agents achieve greater BP reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction than ACE inhibitors or ARBs as monotherapy in Black patients [^112FZ2Lx] [^112toGNe].

---

## Rationale for thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers

Thiazide diuretics and CCBs are preferred due to their **superior efficacy** in Black patients, who often exhibit salt sensitivity and low renin profiles [^117R6bb2]. Thiazide diuretics reduce plasma volume and peripheral resistance, while CCBs dilate arterioles; both mechanisms are effective in low-renin hypertension [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting first-line therapy

- **ALLHAT trial**: Thiazide diuretics (chlorthalidone) were superior to ACE inhibitors (lisinopril) and CCBs (amlodipine) in preventing cardiovascular events, particularly stroke, in Black patients [^112hemUj].
- **Meta-analyses**: Multiple meta-analyses confirm greater BP reduction with thiazides and CCBs compared to ACE inhibitors or ARBs in Black patients [^114gaBx3] [^113yrpr4].
- **Combination therapy**: Combining a thiazide or CCB with a RAS blocker (ACE inhibitor or ARB) significantly improves BP control and cardiovascular outcomes in Black patients [^115nvs2k].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Metabolic side effects**: Thiazide diuretics may cause hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, requiring monitoring and management [^notfound].
- **Individual variability**: Response to antihypertensive therapy varies among individuals; personalized treatment plans are essential [^112G4LYX].
- **Combination therapy**: Most patients require combination therapy to achieve BP targets; initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension or high cardiovascular risk patients [^113JSXaD] [^111kNc8j].

## Current guidelines summary

| **Guideline** | **Recommended first-line therapy for black patients** | **Additional recommendations** |
|-|-|-|
| JNC 8 | Thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs | - ACE inhibitors or ARBs not recommended as initial monotherapy <br/> - Combination therapy for stage 2 hypertension |
| ACC/AHA | Thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs | - Initial combination therapy for stage 2 hypertension <br/> - Individualized therapy based on comorbidities |
| VA/DoD | Thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs | - ACE inhibitors or ARBs not recommended as monotherapy <br/> - Combination therapy for most patients |
| Hypertension Canada | Thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs | - ACE inhibitors not recommended as first-line monotherapy <br/> - Combination therapy for resistant hypertension |

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Thiazide-type diuretics and CCBs are the **preferred first-line antihypertensive therapy** for Black patients due to superior efficacy in BP reduction and cardiovascular risk reduction [^111DCbKx]. ACE inhibitors or ARBs are not recommended as initial monotherapy in Black patients without compelling indications [^115hsw1Z]. Combination therapy, particularly with a thiazide or CCB plus a RAS blocker, is recommended for stage 2 hypertension or high cardiovascular risk patients [^113JSXaD]. Therapy should be individualized based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and response to treatment [^1124e2kh].

### Initial combination therapy for hypertension in patients of African ancestry: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117JpQsF]. Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that consider the effect of initial dual antihypertensive combination treatment on blood pressure (BP), morbidity, or mortality in hypertensive African ancestry adults, using the methodology of the Cochrane Collaboration. Main outcomes were difference in means (continuous data) and risk ratio (dichotomous data). We retrieved 1728 reports yielding 13 RCTs of 4weeks to 3years duration (median 8weeks) in 3843 patients. Systolic BP was significantly higher on β-adrenergic blocker vs. other combinations, 3.80 [0.82;6.78] mmHg, but comparable for other combinations. Hypokalemia and hyperglycemia occurred with calcium channel blocker (CCB)+diuretics > diuretics+angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin-II-type-1-receptor antagonist (ARB) > CCB+ACEI/ARB. An RCT including high-risk patients reported combined morbidity/mortality for hydrochlorothiazide (mg) 25+benazepril 40 vs. amlodipine 10+benazepril 40 of respectively 8.9% vs. 6.6% (n = 1414, risk ratio 1.35 [0.94;1.94]; all patients, N = 11 506, 1.23 [1.11;1.37]). We conclude that limited evidence supports CCB+ACEI rather than HCT+ACEI as first-line initial combination therapy in African ancestry patients with hypertension.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^114yMY2E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendations 6 to 9

In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic, CCB, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or ARB. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide‐type diuretic or CCB. In the population aged ≥ 18 years with CKD, initial (or add‐on) antihypertensive treatment should include an ACEI or ARB to improve kidney outcomes. If goal BP is not reached within 1 month of treatment, increase the dose of the initial drug or add a second drug, and if goal BP cannot be reached with 2 drugs, add and titrate a third drug. Referral to a hypertension specialist is recommended for patients in whom goal BP cannot be attained.

Basis of Recommendations

In contrast to treatment targets, most professional societies agree on the class of antihypertensives to use for specific comorbid disease categories (Table 1). For the nonblack population without diabetes, all society recommendations include thiazide diuretics, CCBs, ACEIs, and ARBs as first‐line therapies. An important consideration with thiazide diuretics is that the strength of individual drugs within the class varies in BP‐lowering effects.

A Cochrane Review of > 60 RCTs for thiazide monotherapy versus placebo in adults with primary hypertension (BP 140 to < 160/90 to < 100 mm Hg) examined the BP effects of 6 different thiazide diuretics. 46 Hydrochlorothiazide, unlike the other thiazide medications studied, demonstrated a dose‐dependent BP reduction. Compared with placebo, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide on BP ranged from 6.25 mg/d, leading to a 4–mm Hg (95% CI 2 to 6)/2–mm Hg (95% CI 1 to 4) reduction, to 50 mg/d, resulting in a 11–mm Hg (95% CI 6 to 15)/5–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 7) reduction. Chlorthalidone, regardless of dose ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg/d, led to a 12–mm Hg (95% CI 10 to 14)/4–mm Hg (95% CI 3 to 5) reduction in BP. While the maximal effects were judged to be similar between the different thiazides, attention to dosing is important given the wide range of effect with hydrochlorothiazide.

### Association of race / ethnicity-specific changes in antihypertensive medication classes initiated among Medicare beneficiaries with the eighth Joint National Committee panel member report [^113efkoH]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

In December 2013, the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC8) published a recommendation that non-Black adults initiate antihypertensive medication with a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), whereas Black adults initiate treatment with a thiazide-type diuretic or calcium channel blocker. β-Blockers were not recommended as first-line therapy.

Objective

To assess changes in antihypertensive medication classes initiated by race/ethnicity from before to after publication of the JNC8 panel member report.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This serial cross-sectional analysis assessed a 5% sample of Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 years or older who initiated antihypertensive medication between 2011 and 2018, were Black (n = 3303 [8.0%]), White (n = 34 943 [84.5%]), or of other (n = 3094 [7.5%]) race/ethnicity, and did not have compelling indications for specific antihypertensive medication classes.

Exposures

Calendar year and period after vs before publication of the JNC8 panel member report.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The proportion of beneficiaries initiating ACEIs or ARBs and, separately, β-blockers vs other antihypertensive medication classes.

Results

In total, 41 340 Medicare beneficiaries (65% women; mean [SD] age, 75.7 [7.6] years) of Black, White, or other races/ethnicities initiated antihypertensive medication and met the inclusion criteria for the present study. In 2011, 25.2% of Black beneficiaries initiating antihypertensive monotherapy did so with an ACEI or ARB compared with 23.7% in 2018 (P = 0.47 for trend). Among beneficiaries initiating monotherapy, the proportion filling a β-blocker was 20.1% in 2011 and 15.4% in 2018 for White beneficiaries (P < .001 for trend), 14.2% in 2011 and 11.1% in 2018 for Black beneficiaries (P = 0.08 for trend), and 11.3% in 2011 and 15.0% in 2018 for beneficiaries of other race/ethnicity (P = 0.40 for trend). After multivariable adjustment and among beneficiaries initiating monotherapy, there was no evidence of a change in the proportion filling an ACEI or ARB before to after publication of the JNC8 panel member report overall (prevalence ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97–1.03) or in Black vs White beneficiaries (prevalence ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83–1.12; p = 0.60 for interaction). Among beneficiaries initiating monotherapy, the proportion filling a β-blocker decreased from before to after publication of the JNC8 panel member report (prevalence ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84–0.93) with no differences across race/ethnicity groups (P > .10 for interaction).

Conclusions and Relevance

A substantial proportion of older US adults who initiate antihypertensive medication do so with non-guideline-recommended classes of medication.

Racial and ethnic differences in treatment — initial therapy and medication number in black adults: Guideline statement 10.1.1.1 says, "In black adults with hypertension but without HF or CKD, including those with DM, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. (COR I, LOE B-R)", and 10.1.1.2 states, "Two or more antihypertensive medications are recommended to achieve a BP target of less than 130/80 mm Hg in most adults with hypertension, especially in black adults with hypertension. (COR I, LOE B-R)". The commentary adds that medication selection "should consider all aspects of the patient, including their comorbid conditions, age, and lifestyle factors", and highlights that with "severely elevated urinary albumin excretion, an ACE inhibitor or an ARB would be first-line therapy".

Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to patients with white coat HTN (management), ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to recommend BP-lowering drug treatment in patients with white coat HTN. Consider initiating BP-lowering drug treatment in patients with HTN-mediated organ damage and high cardiovascular risk.

### Cardiovascular risk reduction in hypertensive black patients with left ventricular hypertrophy: the LIFE study [^116n8giK]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We report on a subanalysis of the effects of losartan and atenolol on cardiovascular events in black patients in the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study.

Background

The LIFE study compared losartan-based to atenolol-based therapy in 9,193 hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Overall, the risk of the primary composite end point (cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction) was reduced by 13% (p = 0.021) with losartan, with similar blood pressure (BP) reduction in both treatment groups. There was a suggestion of interaction between ethnic background and treatment (p = 0.057).

Methods

Exploratory analyses were performed that placed LIFE study patients into black (n = 533) and non-black (n = 8,660) categories, overall, and in the U.S. (African American [n = 523]; non-black [n = 1,184]).

Results

A significant interaction existed between the dichotomized groups (black/non-black) and treatment (p = 0.005); a test for qualitative interaction was also significant (p = 0.016). The hazard ratio (losartan relative to atenolol) for the primary end point favored atenolol in black patients (1.666 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.043 to 2.661]; p = 0.033) and favored losartan in non-blacks (0.829 [95% CI 0.733 to 0.938]; p = 0.003). In black patients, BP reduction was similar in both groups, and regression of electrocardiographic-LVH was greater with losartan.

Conclusions

Results of the subanalysis are sufficient to generate the hypothesis that black patients with hypertension and LVH might not respond as favorably to losartan-based treatment as non-black patients with respect to cardiovascular outcomes, and do not support a recommendation for losartan as a first-line treatment for this purpose. The subanalysis is limited by the relatively small number of events.

### Moving toward a consensus: comparison of the 2023 ESH and 2017 ACC / AHA hypertension guidelines [^1165rPnZ]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA and ESH guidelines recommend initial treatment with antihypertensive agents from at least 1 of 4 major classes: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, and calcium channel blockers. The ESH guideline continues to recommend beta-blockers as an optional first-line therapy for several CV and many non-CV conditions, including atrial fibrillation, aortic dissection, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while the American guideline only recommends them for patients with ischemic heart disease or heart failure. The ESH guideline points to several randomized control trials and meta-analyses that show beta-blockers significantly reduce major CVD events when compared to placebo.

Initiation of combination therapy with medications from different classes is also prominent in both guidelines. The ACC/AHA guideline recommends an initial two-drug regimen for patients with "stage 2 hypertension" and BP > 20/10 mm Hg above target, and for Black patients (COR I, LOE: C-EO), while ESH recommends initial therapy with a two-drug combination regimen for most patients with hypertension (COR I, LOE: A). ESH strongly advocates for single-pill combination therapy to improve medication adherence and achieve BP control, while the U.S. guideline recommends either single-pill combination or multi-pill combinations.

### Efficacy of newer versus older antihypertensive drugs in black patients living in sub-saharan Africa [^113XAxRc]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Sub-Saharan Africa is facing an epidemic of cardiovascular disease, mainly driven by hypertension. Depending on the age range in published studies, hypertension currently affects from 30% up to 60% of blacks, born and living in Africa. The 2003 guidelines of the World Health Organization and International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) propose that for the majority of hypertensive patients without a compelling indication for another class of drugs, a low-dose diuretic should be considered as the first choice of therapy on the basis of comparative trial data, availability and cost. However, recent trials, proved benefit of newer vs older antihypertensive drugs in terms of blood pressure control, reduction of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and metabolic side effects. They also indicated that the majority of hypertensive patients require multiple drugs to achieve control. Modern guidelines for the management of hypertension, endorse the use of single-pill combinations of antihypertensive drugs to initiate treatment. Recommendations for the management of hypertension in native black African patients are to a large extent extrapolations of studies conducted in blacks living in the United States or Europe and do not account for differences in selection in previous generations, ethnic admixture, and lifestyle. We therefore designed the newer versus older antihypertensive agents in African hypertensive patients (NOAAH) to compare in native black African patients a single-pill combination of newer drugs, not involving a diuretic, with a combination of older drugs, including a diuretic.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of elevated blood pressure and hypertension [^1115n7eo]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hypertension, more specifically with respect to black patients, ESC 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating combination therapy including a CCB combined with either a thiazide diuretic or a renin-angiotensin system blocker in black patients from Sub-Saharan Africa requiring BP-lowering treatment.

### Comparative effectiveness of calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme / angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics on cardiovascular events likelihood in hypertensive African-American and non-hispanic caucasians: a retrospective study across HCA healthcare [^113Da2Yt]. Clinical Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) blood pressure guideline recommends calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and thiazide diuretics as first‐line agents for non‐Hispanic (NH) Black adults with hypertension who do not have heart failure or renal disease. The guideline also emphasizes the use of antihypertensive medications from two or more different classes. Conversely, the International Society of Hypertension in Blacks (ISHIB) advises combination therapy with a CCB and a renin‐angiotensin blocking agent (preferably an angiotensin receptor blocker [ARB]) as the primary treatment for NH Black patients with hypertension. Numerous trials have assessed the efficacy of different antihypertensive regimens, yielding conflicting results, particularly in racial and ethnic‐specific studies. The Antihypertensive and Lipid‐Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) found that angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, CCBs, and alpha‐receptor blockers were not superior to thiazide diuretics in lowering blood pressure. Thiazide diuretics were also more effective in preventing strokes among NH Black individuals compared to other medications. However, the African American Study of Kidney Disease indicated that ACE inhibitors were more effective than beta‐blockers and CCBs in slowing the progression of renal disease in NH Black Americans with nondiabetic renal disease, contradicting ALLHAT's findings that ACE inhibitors were not superior to other antihypertensive classes for preventing kidney disease.

Understanding the optimal first‐line antihypertensive medications for preventing cardiovascular events and mortality is crucial for clinical decision‐making. Previous studies have explored the efficacy of antihypertensive treatments in reducing cardiovascular events. Identifying the most effective treatments for controlling hypertension and reducing cardiovascular events and mortality with minimal side effects is essential for guiding clinicians and reducing the global burden of cardiovascular disease. To provide an updated perspective on the comparative efficacy of antihypertensive medications, we aimed to investigate the association between prior antihypertensive medication use and the likelihood of cardiovascular events and to assess whether this relationship is influenced by the patient's race. The findings from this study will be relevant for contemporary clinical management of hypertension, especially considering the new ACC/AHA hypertension guidelines.

### JNC 8 guidelines for the management of hypertension in… [^113PQ4sc]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In the general population, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg or higher in adults 60 years and older, or 140/90 mm Hg or higher in adults younger than 60 years.
- In patients with hypertension and diabetes, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg or higher, regardless of age.
- Initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, ACE inhibitor, or ARB in the general nonblack population or a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker in the general black population.
- If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased, or a second medication should be added.

In the general population of adults 60 years and older, pharmacologic treatment should be initiated when the systolic pressure is 150 mm Hg or higher, or when the diastolic pressure is 90 mm Hg or higher. Patients should be treated to a target systolic pressure of less than 150 mm Hg and a target diastolic pressure of less than 90 mm Hg. Treatment does not need to be adjusted if it results in a systolic pressure lower than 140 mm Hg, as long as it is not associated with adverse effects on health or quality of life. There is no evidence that treating patients with CKD to a lower blood pressure goal slows the progression of the disease. Similarly, there is no evidence from randomized controlled trials showing that treatment to a systolic pressure of less than 140 mm Hg improves health outcomes in adults with diabetes and hypertension.

Pharmacologic Treatment In the general nonblack population, including those with diabetes, initial anti-hypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic, calcium channel blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, or angiotensin receptor blocker. In the general black population, including those with diabetes, initial treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker. If the target blood pressure is not reached within one month after initiating therapy, the dosage of the initial medication should be increased or a second medication should be added. Blood pressure should be monitored and the treatment regimen adjusted until the target blood pressure is reached.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^113i4TjW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

We searched the Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2016, Issue 2), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) up to February 2016. We searched in clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs in Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

Randomized, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drug with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias and entered the data. Primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial) and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarized data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals.

Main Results

We found three studies in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. None of the studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment so we asked investigators for data for this subgroup (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants). They included outpatients, and mostly European and white people. Two trials included only people with type 2 diabetes, whereas the other trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. Certainty of evidence was very low due to the serious imprecision, and for using a subgroup not defined in advance. Confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants and, hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Maternal ethnicity and its impact on the haemodynamic and blood pressure response to labetalol for the treatment of antenatal hypertension [^112fxrjL]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Blood pressure (BP) control outside pregnancy is associated with a reduction in adverse cardiovascular events, and in pregnancy with improved outcomes. Outside pregnancy, there is evidence β-blockers are less effective in controlling BP in black populations. However, in pregnancy, labetalol is recommended as a universal first-line treatment, without evidence for the impact of ethnicity on its efficacy. We sought to compare haemodynamic responses to labetalol in black and white pregnant patients.

Methods

This was a prospective observational cohort study in a London teaching hospital. Maternal haemodynamics were assessed in 120 pregnant women treated with labetalol monotherapy. Measurements were taken at presentation, 1 and 24h after treatment. Participants were monitored regularly until delivery. Statistical analysis was performed by multilevel modelling.

Results

Both groups exhibited similar temporal trends in haemodynamic changes over the first 24h following labetalol. Both showed a reduction in BP and peripheral vascular resistance within 1h and in heart rate after 24h. There was no change in cardiac output and stroke volume in either group. BP control (< 140/90) was achieved at 1h in 79.7% of the white and 77% of the black cohort. At 24h, control was achieved among 83.1% and 63.9%, and up to the immediate intrapartum period control was achieved in 89.8% and 70.4% of white and black patients, respectively.

Conclusions

There is no difference in the acute haemodynamic changes and hypertension can be controlled throughout pregnancy with labetalol monotherapy in excess of 70% pregnant black and white patients.

### Hypertension treatment in blacks: discussion of the U.S. clinical practice guidelines [^116PzcJx]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Blacks are especially susceptible to hypertension (HTN) and its associated organ damage leading to adverse cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and renal outcomes. Accordingly, HTN is particularly significant in contributing to the black-white racial differences in health outcomes in the US. As such, in order to address these health disparities, practical clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) on how to treat HTN, specifically in blacks, are needed. This review article is a timely addition to the literature because the most recent U.S. CPG more explicitly emphasizes race into the algorithmic management of HTN. However, recent clinical research cautions that use of race as a proxy to determine therapeutic response to pharmaceutical agents may be erroneous. This review will address the implications of the use of race in the hypertension CPGs. We will review the rationale behind the introduction of race into the U.S. CPG and the level of evidence that was available to justify this introduction. Finally, we will conclude with practical considerations in the treatment of HTN in blacks.

### National trends in antihypertensive treatment among older adults by race and presence of comorbidity, 2008 to 2017 [^112tp8FM]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In 2014, hypertension guidelines for older adults endorsed increased use of fixed-dose combinations, prioritized thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for Black patients, and no longer recommend beta-blockers as first-line therapy.

Objective

To evaluate older adults' antihypertensive use following guideline changes.

Design

Time series analysis.

Patients

Twenty percent national sample of Medicare Part D beneficiaries aged 66 years and older with hypertension.

Intervention

Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC8) guidelines MAIN MEASURES: Quarterly trends in prevalent and initial antihypertensive use were examined before (2008 to 2013) and after (2014 to 2017) JNC8. Analyses were conducted among all beneficiaries with hypertension, beneficiaries without chronic conditions that might influence antihypertensive selection (hypertension-only cohort), and among Black patients, given race-based guideline recommendations.

Key Results

The number of beneficiaries with hypertension increased from 1,978,494 in 2008 to 2,809,680 in 2017, the proportions using antihypertensives increased from 80.3 to 81.2%, and the proportion using multiple classes and fixed-dose combinations declined (60.8 to 58.1% and 20.7 to 15.1%, respectively, all P < .01). Prior to JNC8, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and CCBs was increasing. Use of CCBs as initial therapy increased more rapidly following JNC8 (relative change in quarterly trend 0.15% [95% CI, 0.13–0.18%), especially among Black beneficiaries (relative change 0.44% [95% CI, 0.21–0.68%]). Contrary to guidelines, the use of thiazides and combinations as initial therapy consistently decreased in the hypertension-only cohort (13.8 to 8.3% and 25.1 to 15.7% respectively). By 2017, 65.9% of Black patients in the hypertension-only cohort were initiated on recommended first-line or combination therapy compared to 80.3% of non-Black patients.

Conclusions

Many older adults, particularly Black patients, continue to be initiated on antihypertensive classes not recommended as first-line, indicating opportunities to improve the effectiveness and equity of hypertension care and potentially reduce antihypertensive regimen complexity.

### Systematic review: antihypertensive drug therapy in black patients [^114gaBx3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hypertension occurs more frequently and is generally more severe in black persons than in white persons, leading to excess morbidity and mortality.

Purpose

To systematically review the efficacy of different antihypertensive drugs in reducing blood pressure, morbidity, and mortality in hypertensive black adults.

Data Sources

The following databases were searched from their inception through November 2003: MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS (Literatura Latino-Americana y del Caribe en Ciencias de la Salud), African Index Medicus, and the Cochrane Library. PubMed was also searched from September 2003 through March 2004. Searches were conducted without language restriction.

Study Selection

Randomized, controlled trials of drugs versus placebo (blood pressure outcomes) or drugs versus placebo or other drugs (morbidity and mortality outcomes).

Data Extraction

2 reviewers independently extracted data.

Data Synthesis

The efficacy of beta-blockers in reducing systolic blood pressure and the efficacy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in achieving diastolic blood pressure goals did not significantly differ from that of placebo (weighted mean difference for beta-blockers, -3.53 mm Hg [95% CI, -7.51 to 0.45 mm Hg]; relative risk for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 1.35 [CI, 0.81 to 2.26]). In the pooled analyses, other reviewed drugs (calcium-channel blockers, diuretics, central sympatholytics, alpha-blockers, and angiotensin II receptor blockers) were more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure, but only calcium-channel blockers remained effective in all prespecified subgroups, including patients with a baseline diastolic blood pressure of 110 mm Hg or greater. Main morbidity and mortality outcomes did not differ significantly between treatment groups when drugs were combined to reach blood pressure goals. However, trial results indicated a greater occurrence of diabetes with diuretics and a higher risk for cardiovascular events with drug regimens that included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.

Limitations

This meta-analysis evaluated the blood pressure lowering-efficacy of monotherapy only.

Conclusions

Drugs differ in their efficacy for reducing blood pressure in black patients, but there is no solid evidence that efficacy for reducing morbidity and mortality outcomes differs once patients achieve the blood pressure goal.

### Is there a standard for surgical therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma in healthy and cirrhotic liver? A comparison of eight guidelines [^112FqGam]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 2 shows the comparison of the indications to LR and LT using the assigned colour codes as described in the methods section.

Treatment of HCC in Child-Pugh A cirrhosis. Green circle: first-line therapy. Yellow circle: therapy can be carried out or therapy recommended as second line. Black circle: no or no clear treatment recommendations. Red-circled white dot: rejection of the therapy. HCC, hepatocellular carcinoma.

Child-Pugh class B

According to the BCLC-based guidelines and JSH guidelines, the treatment recommendations for HCC on Child-Pugh B cirrhosis are identical to Child-Pugh A cirrhosis as described in the previous chapter.

In particular, the SEOM guidelinesrecommend LR for patients with solitary or limited multifocal HCC (stage BCLC-0 and BCLC-A), with no major vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread, no portal hypertension (defined as hepatic venous pressure gradient < 11 mm Hg or platelet count > 100 000), adequate liver reserve and an anticipated liver remnant of at least 30–40%. Anatomical resections are recommended. Patients within Milan criteria could be considered for LT (from either a dead or living donor).

LR is the first-line curative treatment of solitary or multifocal HCC confined to the liver, anatomically resectable and with satisfactory liver function reserve according to the APASL guidelines.LT can be offered to patients within the Milan criteria when resection is not possible.

According to the Italian and German guidelines, LT is the treatment of choice for patients with Child-Pugh B cirrhosis within the Milan criteria. According to the Italian guidelines for patients with Child B cirrhosis non-eligible for transplantation, LR represents an option in case of a single tumour which can be removed with a limited resection in particular for those patients without clinically manifested portal hypertension. Patients not suitable for transplantation with Child B cirrhosis can be resected or treated with RFA according to tumour size and number according to the German S3-guidelines.

Figure 3 shows the comparison of the indications for LR and LT.

### Comparison of blood pressure control rates among recommended drug selection strategies for initial therapy of hypertension [^116Ymf4Z]. American Journal of Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Several approaches to initiation of antihypertensive therapy have been suggested. These include thiazide diuretics (TDs) as the first drug in all patients, initial drug selection based on age and race criteria, or therapy selection based on measures of plasma renin activity (PRA). It is uncertain which of these strategies achieves the highest control rate with monotherapy in Stage-I hypertension. We sought to compare control rates among these strategies.

Methods

We used data from the Pharmacogenomic Evaluation of Antihypertensive Responses study (PEAR) to estimate control rates for each strategy: (i) TD for all, (ii) age- and race-based strategy: Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) for all blacks and for whites ≥ 50 years and a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (atenolol) for whites < 50 years) or (iii) a PRA based strategy: HCTZ for suppressed PRA (< 0.6ng/ml/h) and atenolol for non-suppressed PRA (≥ 0.6ng/ml/h) despite age or race. Hypertension was confirmed prior to treatment with HCTZ (148 blacks and 218 whites) or with atenolol (146 blacks and 221 whites).

Results

In the overall sample, using clinic blood pressure (BP) response, the renin-based strategy was associated with the greatest control rate (48.9% vs. 40.8% with the age and race-based strategy (P = 0.0004) and 31.7% with the TD for all strategy (P < 0.0001)). The findings were similar using home or by 24-hour ambulatory BP responses and within each racial subgroup.

Conclusions

A strategy for selection of initial antihypertensive drug therapy based on PRA was associated with greater BP control rates compared to a thiazide-for-all or an age and race-based strategy.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^111bTQCB]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

One of the key factors that drives BP control is the prescribing patterns of clinicians, which is highly variable. There are numerous factors that contribute to the choice of antihypertensive medication for individual patients, including patient and clinician preferences. To encourage evidence‐based treatment and standardization of prescribing patterns for antihypertensive regimens, the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) published a report on the prevention, detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood pressure in 2014, and the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) published a joint recommendation for the management of hypertension in 2017 (2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines). Briefly, the JNC 8 recommended thiazide diuretics, angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as acceptable first‐line treatment options for non‐Black patients and recommended only thiazide diuretics or CCBs as first‐line options for Black patients. Beta blockers were no longer recommended as a first‐line option, in contrast to its previous report. The adoption of the JNC 8 recommendations varied across health care providers, with some controversies mostly centering around an established higher treatment threshold for older adults (150 mm Hg/90 mm Hg for adults 60 years and older); this recommendation deviated from more aggressive targets recommended by other organizations. This controversy later contributed to the development of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines, which differed primarily in the choice of initial medications and the target blood pressure goals. The 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a broader use of thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and CCBs for all patients, regardless of race, and emphasized selecting medications based on individual patient characteristics and comorbidities. Compared with the JNC 8 report, the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines recommended a lower target BP broadly, particularly in high‐risk patients. Following the publication of those guidelines, several international studies have characterized prescribing patterns for antihypertensive medications in select subpopulations (ie, patients with chronic kidney disease [CKD])or in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Prescribing patterns have also been studied in a population‐based cohort in the United Kingdom. To date, there has been limited exploration of how prescribing patterns overall may have changed since publication of the JNC 8 report or 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines in the United States. In addition, previous studies have suggested that it can take more than a decade for clinical guidelines to be adopted into routine clinical practice and that those guidelines can be adopted differentially for patients from minority populations. Thus, understanding how the adoption of clinical practice guidelines for antihypertension management may vary by sociodemographic variables may help identify opportunities for more equitable prescribing practices nationally.

### Disparities in initial antihypertensive intensity by sex, race and ethnicity in newly treated patients with hypertension [^113Nmz8w]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Sex, race, and ethnicity disparities in hypertension (HTN) treatment intensity have been previously described. It remains unclear if these disparities occur at treatment onset and whether they can be explained by differences in clinical factors.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of adults with newly-treated HTN using linked EHR+claims data from OneFlorida+ Consortium. We included Florida Medicaid & Medicare-recipients diagnosed with HTN and prescribed ≥ 1 first-line antihypertensive during 2013–2020. We used generalized linear models to estimate differences in total therapeutic intensity score (TTIS)-a patient's total daily dose (TDD) divided by recommended maximum TDD for a drug, summed across entire regimen-by sex, race, and ethnicity. We then modeled the same, controlling for demographics, blood pressure, and relevant comorbidities.

Results

In total 4,094 patients (mean age 58 ± 16; female 57.6%; White 56.7%) were included. We observed variations in the initiation of antihypertensive classes by sex, race and ethnicity. In univariate analyses, men averaged 7.6% (95%CI:3.9%-11.3%) greater TTIS versus women and Black individuals averaged 10.5% (95%CI:6.6%-14.3%) greater TTIS versus White individuals, whereas no disparities were observed by ethnicity. After adjusting for clinical factors, these disparities persisted: men had 7.6% (95%CI:3.9%-11.4%) greater TTIS versus women, and Black individuals had 17.9% (95%CI:13.8%-21.9%) greater TTIS versus White individuals.

Conclusion

We observed disparities in treatment intensity by sex and race that were not explained by differences in clinical factors. There was sex-based variation in practice patterns, and Black individuals received more intensive initial antihypertensive therapy than White individuals.

### 2017 ACC / AHA blood pressure treatment guideline recommendations and cardiovascular risk [^116X5WYJ]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guideline provides updated recommendations for antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification.

Objectives

Determine the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events among adults recommended and not recommended antihypertensive medication initiation or intensification by the 2017 ACC/AHA BP guideline.

Methods

The authors analyzed data for black and white REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study participants (age ≥ 45 years). Systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were measured twice at baseline (2003 to 2007) and averaged. Participants not taking (n = 14,039) and taking (n = 15,179) antihypertensive medication were categorized according to their recommendations for antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification by the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline. Overall, 4,094 CVD events (stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure) occurred by December 31, 2014.

Results

Among participants not taking antihypertensive medication, 34.4% were recommended pharmacological antihypertensive treatment initiation. The CVD event rate per 1,000 person-years among participants recommended antihypertensive medication initiation with SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg was 22.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20.3 to 25.0). Among participants with SBP/DBP 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg, the CVD event rate was 20.5 (95% CI: 18.5 to 22.6) and 3.4 (95% CI: 2.4 to 4.4) for those recommended and not recommended antihypertensive medication initiation, respectively. Among participants taking antihypertensive medication, 62.8% were recommended treatment intensification. The CVD event rate per 1,000 person-years among participants recommended treatment intensification was 33.6 (95% CI: 31.5 to 35.6) and 22.4 (95% CI: 20.8 to 23.9) for those with SBP/DBP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg and 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg, respectively.

Conclusions

Implementing the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline would direct antihypertensive medication initiation and intensification to adults with high CVD risk.

### Impact of antihypertensive drug classes on cardiovascular outcomes: insights from the STEP study [^117NHNxJ]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension is a significant global health concern, particularly in China and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and mortality. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that lowering blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs effectively reduces major cardiovascular events and mortality; this benefit is primarily attributed to the extent of blood pressure reduction rather than the specific properties of individual drug classes. However, different classes of antihypertensive drugs have been reported to exert distinct effects on specific cardiovascular outcomes.

Despite extensive research, evidence on comparative effectiveness of different antihypertensive drug classes remains inconsistent, and clinical guidelines vary significantly. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Blood Pressure Treatment Guidelines recommended thiazide or thiazide-like diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) as first-line agents. The 2023 European Society of Hypertension Guidelines provide a comparable broad recommendation, but also include beta-blockers as first-line option. The NICE (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) guideline recommends ACEIs or ARBs as first-line treatment for patients with type 2 diabetes, or for adults younger than 55 years who are not of Black African or African Caribbean family origin; for all other patient groups, CCBs are recommended. These inconsistencies highlight the need for further research to identify which antihypertensive drug class provides the most favourable cardiovascular outcomes and should be prioritised as the optimal first-line antihypertensive therapy. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether prolonged exposure to specific antihypertensive drug classes is associated with a reduced risk of composite cardiac outcome in individuals with well-controlled blood pressure, using data from the STEP (Strategy of Blood Pressure Intervention in the Elderly Hypertensive Patients) trial.

### Diuretic treatment of hypertension [^115vXdik]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Although thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics are indispensable drugs in the treatment of hypertension, their role as first-line or even second-line drugs is a provoking debate.

The European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension (ESC/ESH) guidelines recommend that thiazide diuretics should be considered as suitable as β-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers for the initiation and maintenance of antihypertensive treatment.

Another European position, endorsed by the British Hypertension Society, is that diuretics and calcium channel blockers should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients aged ≥ 55 years or black patients of any age, whereas ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers in the case of intolerance to ACE inhibitors) should be first-line drugs in hypertensive patients younger than 55 years of age.

The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee (JNC VII) on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommends that thiazide diuretics should be preferred drugs in "most" hypertensive patients, either alone or combined with drugs from other classes.

The present review does not intend to negate the important role of diuretics in certain groups of patients (blacks, salt-sensitive patients, concomitant heart failure) or to underestimate their role in multiple-drug combinations in patients with resistant hypertension. The main argument that will be discussed is the place of diuretics as first-line drugs or add-on drugs in the context of the available antihypertensive armamentarium.

The pro side of the controversy will argue that diuretics should remain the preferred drugs for initial treatment in many hypertensive patients, whereas the cons side will contend that emerging evidence from outcome-based studies is casting doubt on the role of these drugs as first-line and even second-line antihypertensive treatment.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^115917NJ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects 47% of adults in the United States (US). Despite decades of Joint National Committee (JNC) guidelines and public health campaigns, hypertension remains a leading cause of stroke, heart, and kidney disease. Across the hypertension control cascade, stark inequities exist: hypertension disproportionately impacts people of color, individuals of low socioeconomic status, and uninsured populations, contributing to higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these communities. Hypertension therefore provides a useful case study for assessing the way guidelines utilize race in treatment algorithms. To better understand how hypertension guidelines have conceptualized and applied race, we conducted a systematic scoping review of adult US hypertension guidelines.

### First-line β-blocker use for hypertension in the veterans health administration [^116JspFr]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Starting in 2014, US guidelines have not recommended β-blockers for first-line treatment of hypertension in the absence of compelling indications due to their tolerability profile and inferior protection against stroke and mortality compared with other first-line agents. The prevalence and factors associated with this guideline-discordant practice are unknown.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of and factors associated with first-line β-blocker use among those without compelling indications for a β-blocker.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Serial cross-sectional study of new users of antihypertensive medications using national, patient-level data in the Veterans Health Administration between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2022. Patients were veterans initiating antihypertensive medications for newly diagnosed hypertension in the outpatient setting based on diagnosis codes and prescription dispenses, excluding veterans without a primary care visit in the prior year.

Exposure

Initiation of antihypertensive medications for newly diagnosed hypertension.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Among those without compelling indications (ie, aortic aneurysm and/or disease, angina, atrial fibrillation or arrhythmia, chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization), multivariable Poisson regression was used to estimate factors associated with β-blocker initiation.

Results

Of 3 138 304 included veterans (mean [SD] age 61.0 [13.0] years, 2 958 488 [94.3%] male, 149 807 [4.8%] Hispanic, 490 636 [15.6%] non-Hispanic Black, 2 028 127 [64.6%] non-Hispanic White, and 66 798 [2.1%] other races and ethnicities), 774 821 (24.7%) initiated a β-blocker. Overall, 684 045 patients (88.2%) who initiated a β-blocker did not have compelling indications, which decreased over time from 245 703 (91.8%) in 2000 through 2005 to 93 088 (81.5%) in 2018 to 2022. Metoprolol and carvedilol were the most commonly initiated β-blockers and increased over time, and atenolol initiation decreased over time. Among other factors, a greater prevalence ratio for β-blocker initiation was observed among older (PR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04–1.05), female (PR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.09–1.14), non-Hispanic White (as reference group; Non-Hispanic Black PR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.73–0.76; Hispanic PR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.73–0.77; all others PR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.86–0.92) or frail veterans (PR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.25–1.31).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, most veterans using β-blockers as a first-line treatment for hypertension did not have compelling indications, and several factors were associated with likelihood of β-blocker initiation in this group. Interventions are needed to improve initial guideline-concordant treatment for veterans with incident hypertension.

### Recognition and management of hypertension in older persons: focus on African Americans [^1157ozVP]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Hypertension is the most commonly diagnosed condition in persons aged 60 and older and is the single most important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke), kidney disease, and dementia. More than half of individuals with hypertension in the United States are aged 60 and older. Hypertension disproportionately affects African Americans, with all age groups, including elderly adults, having a higher burden of hypertension-related complications than other U.S.

Populations

Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of blood pressure (BP) reduction on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with most of the evidence in individuals aged 60 and older. Several guidelines have recently been published on the specific management of hypertension in individuals aged 60 and older, including in high-risk groups such as African Americans. Most recommend careful evaluation, thiazide diuretics and calcium-channel blockers for initial drug therapy in most African Americans, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in those with chronic kidney disease or heart failure. Among the areas of controversy is the recommended target BP in African Americans aged 60 and older. A recent U.S. guideline recommended raising the systolic BP target from less than 140 mmHg to less than 150 mmHg in this population. This article will review the evidence and current guideline recommendations for hypertension treatment in older African Americans, including the rationale for continuing to recommend a SBP target of less than 140 mmHg in this population.

### Factors associated with appropriate treatment of acute-onset severe obstetrical hypertension [^115xvhUD]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant patients receive expeditious treatment with first-line antihypertensive agents within 1 hour of confirmed severe hypertension to reduce the risk for maternal stroke. However, it is unknown how often this guideline is followed and what factors influence a patient's likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant care.

Objective

We aimed to identify factors associated with receiving guideline-concordant treatment for an obstetrical hypertensive emergency.

Study Design

We present a case-control study of all pregnant and postpartum patients who had persistent severe hypertension (≥ 2 systolic blood pressures ≥ 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110 mm Hg, or both within 1 hour of each other) during their delivery hospitalization at a tertiary hospital from October 1, 2013, to August 31, 2020. Data were extracted from the hospital electronic medical records using standard definitions and billing and diagnosis codes. We defined receipt of the recommended treatment as administration of a first-line antihypertensive agent (intravenous labetalol, intravenous hydralazine, or immediate-release oral nifedipine) within 60 minutes of the first or second severe-range blood pressure measurement during their delivery hospitalization. Delayed treatment was defined as the administration of a first-line agent > 60 minutes after the second elevated blood pressure measurement. Patients were considered untreated if a first-line agent was never administered. Maternal sociodemographic, clinical and pregnancy factors, and time and day of the week of the hypertensive emergency were compared among patients who received the recommended treatment, those who received delayed treatment, and those who were untreated. Bivariate analyses were performed, and multinomial and multivariable logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounders.

Results

Of the 39,918 deliveries in the cohort, 1987 (5.0%) were complicated by severe, persistent obstetrical hypertension. Of these patients, 532 (26.8%) received the recommended treatment, 356 (17.9%) received delayed treatment, and 1099 (55.3%) did not receive any first-line antihypertensive therapy. The multinomial regression models that were used to compare these 3 groups indicated that patients who received the recommended treatment were more likely to be Black (adjusted odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.36–2.51), Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.28–2.52), or pregnant and at < 37 weeks of gestation (adjusted odds ratio, 6.65; 95% confidence interval, 5.08–8.72). Treatment was less likely if the severe obstetrical hypertension emergency occurred overnight (7:00 PM to 6:59 AM) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.64–0.97) or during the postpartum period (adjusted odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.51–0.86).

Conclusion

Approximately half of obstetrical patients with at least 2 documented severely elevated blood pressure measurements did not receive the recommended antihypertensive treatment. Of those who did receive treatment, about 40% had delayed treatment. Black and Hispanic race and preterm gestation were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving the recommended treatment when compared with White race and term pregnancies. Patients whose severe obstetrical hypertension emergency occurred overnight and those who were postpartum were less likely to receive any first-line antihypertensive treatment. Overall, patients without sociodemographic and clinical risk factors for severe obstetrical hypertension or other pregnancy complications were less likely to be treated. However, treatment improved significantly over time with the implementation of targeted quality measures and specific institutional policies based on the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' latest severe obstetrical hypertension management guidelines.

### Diuretic use in black patients with uncontrolled hypertension [^111QhgYK]. American Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Highly publicized recommendations favor the use of diuretics as a first-line or add-on agent in the management of hypertension, particularly among black patients and patients with resistant hypertension. Failure to follow such guidelines might contribute to high rates of uncontrolled hypertension. This study assessed diuretic prescribing patterns in a sample of black patients with uncontrolled hypertension who were identified from a population of home care recipients.

Methods

The study was conducted in an urban home health organization. Participants were black, aged 21 to 80 years, and had a diagnosis of hypertension. Participants with uncontrolled hypertension were identified, and in-home interviewers collected information on prescribed antihypertensive medications.

Results

Of 658 participants, 5.5% were not prescribed any antihypertensives, and only 46% were prescribed a diuretic. Participants who were not taking a diuretic were taking fewer antihypertensive medications (1.7 vs. 2.9; P < 0.0001), had a higher mean diastolic blood pressure (89.2 vs. 85.5; P = 0.0005), and were more likely to have a systolic blood pressure ≥ 160mm Hg (57.6% vs. 49.0%; P = 0.04). The adjusted mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 5 and 4mm Hg lower, respectively, in patients who were taking a diuretic.

Conclusions

In this sample of black patients with uncontrolled hypertension, despite wide publicizing of the recommendations for use of diuretics, a majority are still not receiving a diuretic. This important issue merits continued attention.

### Harmonization of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology / European Society of Hypertension blood pressure / hypertension guidelines [^1124e2kh]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Antihypertensive Drug Treatment Strategy

As outlined in Tables 6–8, both guidelines recommend use of agents from the following 4 drug classes: diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in adults with no compelling indication for selection of a specific BP-lowering medication.

The ACC/AHA indicates a preference for the longer-acting thiazide-type diuretic chlorthalidone compared with other diuretic agents because chlorthalidone was the diuretic used in many of the landmark event–based randomized clinical trials. Both guidelines advise combination therapy in most adults with hypertension (usually, an initial combination of ACE inhibitors or ARB, a diuretic, and/or a CCB). The ACC/AHA specifically recommends combination therapy for Black patients and for adults with more severe hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg and an average SBP/DBP > 20/10 mm Hg above their target BP). In addition, the ACC/AHA guideline recommends that initial antihypertensive drug therapy in Black patients should include a thiazide-type diuretic or CCB. The ESC/ESH guideline also recommends that initial treatment in most Black patients should be with a 2-drug combination, comprising a diuretic and CCB, either in combination with each other or with an ACE inhibitor or ARB. The ACC/AHA notes that single-pill combinations improve treatment adherence but may contain lower-than-optimal doses of the thiazide diuretic component. The ESC/ESH recommends a core drug combination treatment strategy for most patients including patients with uncomplicated hypertension, patients with HMOD, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, or peripheral artery disease. This strategy comprises initial dual combination therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB and CCB or diuretic), preferably in a single-pill combination, followed, if still above target BP, by triple therapy (ACE inhibitors or ARB, CCB and diuretic) using a single-pill combination, followed if still above the target by the addition of spironolactone or other diuretic, α-blocker, or β-blocker and consideration of referral to a specialist center. Both guidelines recommend against simultaneous use of ACE inhibitors and ARB. Likewise, both guidelines provide specific advice on choice of BP-lowering medications in adults with hypertension and various comorbidities/conditions, and in special patient groups, as well. In the ESC/ESH guidelines, β-blockers are considered to be first-line antihypertensive drugs in patients with a specific indication for their use, because, in comparison with other BP-lowering drugs, β-blockers are usually equivalent in preventing major cardiovascular events with the exception of less efficacy for stroke prevention. Therefore, their use is primarily recommended in specific (most importantly cardiac) indications and in pregnant women or women planning pregnancy.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^116AyEQJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the use of antihypertensives changed in 2014 and 2017. To understand the effect of these guidelines, we examined trends in antihypertensive prescriptions in the United States from 2010 to 2019 using a repeated cross‐sectional design.

Methods and Results

Using electronic health records from 15 health care institutions for adults (20–85 years old) who had ≥ 1 antihypertensive prescription, we assessed whether (1) prescriptions of beta blockers decreased after the 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) report discouraged use for first‐line treatment, (2) prescriptions for calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics increased among Black patients after the JNC 8 report encouraged use as first‐line therapy, and (3) prescriptions for dual therapy and fixed‐dose combination among patients with blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mm Hg increased after recommendations in the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. The study included 1 074 314 patients with 2 133 158 prescription episodes. After publication of the JNC 8 report, prescriptions for beta blockers decreased (3% lower in 2018–2019 compared to 2010–2014), and calcium channel blockers increased among Black patients (20% higher in 2015–2017 and 41% higher in 2018–2019, compared to 2010–2014), in accordance with guideline recommendations. However, contrary to guidelines, dual therapy and fixed‐dose combination decreased after publication of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines (9% and 11% decrease in 2018–2019 for dual therapy and fixed‐dose combination, respectively, compared to 2015–2017), and thiazide diuretics decreased among Black patients after the JNC 8 report (6% lower in 2018–2019 compared to 2010–2014).

Conclusions

Adherence to guidelines on prescribing antihypertensive medication was inconsistent, presenting an opportunity for interventions to achieve better blood pressure control in the US population.

### Management of high blood pressure in blacks: an update of the international society on hypertension in blacks consensus statement [^112Vs4ER]. Hypertension (2010). Low credibility.

Since the first International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on the "Management of High Blood Pressure in African American" in 2003, data from additional clinical trials have become available. We reviewed hypertension and cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment guidelines, pharmacological hypertension clinical end point trials, and blood pressure-lowering trials in blacks. Selected trials without significant black representation were considered. In this update, blacks with hypertension are divided into 2 risk strata, primary prevention, where elevated blood pressure without target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, or overt cardiovascular disease for whom blood pressure consistently < 135/85 mm Hg is recommended, and secondary prevention, where elevated blood pressure with target organ damage, preclinical cardiovascular disease, and/or a history of cardiovascular disease, for whom blood pressure consistently < 130/80 mm Hg is recommended. If blood pressure is ≤ 10 mm Hg above target levels, monotherapy with a diuretic or calcium channel blocker is preferred. When blood pressure is > 15/10 mm Hg above target, 2-drug therapy is recommended, with either a calcium channel blocker plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker or, alternatively, in edematous and/or volume-overload states, with a thiazide diuretic plus a renin-angiotensin system blocker. Effective multidrug therapeutic combinations through 4 drugs are described. Comprehensive lifestyle modifications should be initiated in blacks when blood pressure is ≥ 115/75 mm Hg. The updated International Society on Hypertension in Blacks consensus statement on hypertension management in blacks lowers the minimum target blood pressure level for the lowest-risk blacks, emphasizes effective multidrug regimens, and de-emphasizes monotherapy.

### Abstract… [^117R6bb2]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Hypertension in Black Patients The prevalence of hypertension in adult black patients in the United States is 32. 4 percent, compared with
23. 3 percent in white patients. 2 This increased prevalence is accompanied by an 80 percent higher rate of mortality associated with stroke, a 50 percent higher rate of mortality associated with heart disease and a striking, sixfold greater rate of hypertension-related end-stage renal disease. TREATMENT WITH ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS The excellent blood pressure–lowering efficacy of diuretics and calcium channel antagonists in hypertensive black patients is related to their characteristic volume expansion, salt sensitivity and low renin profile. As recommended by JNC VI, diuretics should be used for initial therapy unless there is an absolute or relative contraindication.

The problem of a reduced blood pressure-lowering effect of beta blockers and ACE inhibitors is moot if diuretics are used as initial or second-line drug therapy in black patients with hypertension. The combination of diuretics and ACE inhibitors or beta blockers produces equivalent lowering of blood pressure in whites and blacks, perhaps as a result of diuretic-induced stimulation of renin release. This is true even for combination-type drugs that contain as little as 6. 25 to
12. 5 mg of hydrochlorothiazide. 14 Most hypertensive black patients require two or more antihypertensive drugs to control systolic blood pressure to less than 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg, the current goals recommended by JNC VI for patients with uncomplicated hypertension. In the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study, 15 only 46 percent of black hypertensive patients with stage 1 or stage 2 disease achieved a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg with monotherapy.

In the absence of contraindications, special efforts should be made to ensure that black patients with hypertension who have had a myocardial infarction are receiving a beta blocker and that hypertensive black patients with systolic heart failure or diabetic nephropathy are receiving an ACE inhibitor. In these cases, the protective effect of the drugs is due to more than just reduction of blood pressure. In black hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, evidence now shows that non–dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists can slow the chronic progression of renal disease.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^113TaGwi]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Pharmacological treatment — For hypertension: We recommend offering a thiazide-type diuretic, calcium channel blocker, or either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker as primary pharmacologic therapy for hypertension for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. In African American patients with hypertension, we recommend against using an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker as monotherapy. In hypertensive patients 65 years and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes. We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same patient: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or direct renin inhibitors. For the treatment of hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against initiating combination therapy over initiating monotherapy with the sequential addition of another medication.

### Defining hypertension by blood pressure 130 / 80 mm Hg leads to an impressive burden of hypertension in young and middle-aged black adults: follow-up in the CARDIA study [^113Gdn3u]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale for Pharmacotherapy of Stage 1 Hypertension in Blacks Without Major Clinical CVD Events

Blacks have a much higher incidence of hypertension by age 55 years than whites, defined by systolic BP ≥ 130 mm Hg. Blacks also appear to have a greater incidence of clinical CVD in the BP range of 130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg than whites. The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Hypertension Guideline recommendation to begin antihypertensive pharmacotherapy for stage 1 hypertension when 10‐year atherosclerotic CVD risk is ≥ 10% for primary prevention has a substantial evidence base and potentially may be more beneficial in blacks than whites. 13

This author has expressed concern about the class I recommendation for antihypertensive pharmacotherapy as primary prevention in adults with stage 1 hypertension (BP, 130–139/80–89 mm Hg) given the paucity of data on the benefit of antihypertensive medications for primary prevention in this group. 14 Yet, in 2010, we stated that concerned clinicians may elect to begin antihypertensive pharmacotherapy for primary prevention when systolic BP is 130 to 139 mm Hg and absolute 10‐year CVD risk is ≥ 10%. 15 The concern is with the level of evidence and not the recommendation.

Hypertension in ethnic groups — treatment recommendations: It is recommended that a two-drug combination, usually as an SPC, is used as initial therapy for most black patients (Class I, Level C). In black patients, initial antihypertensive treatment should include a diuretic or a CCB, either in combination or with a RAS blocker (Class I, Level B). In other ethnic groups, BP-lowering treatment may be based on the core treatment algorithm (Class IIb, Level C). Except in patients with low grade 1 hypertension or frail older patients, in whom initial treatment with a single drug may be more appropriate, and angioedema is more common with ACE inhibitors and thus ARBs may be preferred.

### Cost-effectiveness analyses of antihypertensive medicines: a systematic review [^115jzTRA]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adultsrecommends several possible medicine classes for initial treatment of hypertension. TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes are recommended as the initial choice of antihypertensive medicines for non–African-American patients and for patients with diabetes. For African-American patients TDs and CCBs are recommended, and for patients with chronic kidney disease, ACEIs and ARBs are recommended. Prescribers may consider adding another medicine from TD, CCB, ACEI, or ARB classes for the second step, and then β-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, or others for the third step. Similarly, several medicine classes are recommended for first-line therapy in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guideline for hypertension. The recommended initial treatment option is ACEIs or low-cost ARBs for patients aged < 55 years, CCBs for those aged ≥ 55 years or African American, and TD if CCBs are not suitable; β-blockers are not a preferred initial therapy. The second-line therapy is dual therapy of ACEs or ARBs with a CCB for most patients. The third-line therapy is the use of three medicines, including ACE or ARB with a CCB, and a TD, if required. Because several pharmacologic treatment options can be used for the first-line therapy, it is important to evaluate which medicines are more cost effective among those options.

The evidence from pharmacoeconomic evaluations can provide valuable information for decision makers in setting public health priorities. Many pharmacoeconomic studies of antihypertensive medicines conducted in recent years have found control of hypertension to be cost effective. Several systematic reviews of these studies also have been published, but their focus has been on a specific medicine, such as irbesartan, or medicine class, such as ACEIs or ARBs. Thus, no comprehensive review has been conducted for studies across all anti-hypertensive medicine classes. The objectives are to systematically review all pharmacoeconomic evaluations of antihypertensive medicines and summarize the cost effectiveness of these medicines.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^113yrpr4]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this study confirms and quantifies the hypothesis that adult black hypertensive patients do generally have a lesser mean reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response to ACEI monotherapy when compared to whites. This meta-analysis provides evidence for current guidelines that recommend that drugs other than ACEI should be preferred for uncomplicated, mild-moderate hypertension in blacks, guidelines that have particular import in sub-Saharan Africa. These results, though, must be taken in the context of other research that provides strong evidence for the benefits of ACEIs in some subgroups of hypertensive black adults, particularly those with certain complications such as chronic kidney disease and diabetes mellitus and those requiring multi-drug therapy for their hypertension. For hypertensive black adults in whom ACEI monotherapy is indicated, higher doses may be necessary to obtain the desired reduction in blood pressure.

Combination therapy and SPCs — Combination therapy "is more effective, efficient, and consistent in lowering BP and improves adherence when using an SPC compared with stepped-care therapy", though "a stepped-care approach can be effective for BP lowering if well-executed". "Initial combination therapy is recommended for stage 2 hypertension and some high-risk patients with stage 1 hypertension (eg, non-Hispanic Black adults, ASCVD risk > 7.5%) using 2 agents from different classes, preferably in an SPC to improve adherence and BP control". For candidates for initial combination therapy, thresholds include "SBP ≥ 20 mm Hg and DBP ≥ 10 mm Hg above their goal", and "starting treatment with SPCs rather than equivalent free-pill combinations improves adherence". "Available RCT evidence supports using an RAS blocker with either a thiazide-type diuretic or a dihydropyridine CCB as initial therapy". "Several small RCTs have demonstrated that low-dose combinations of 3 or 4 drugs together reduce BP more effectively than monotherapy over 3 to 6 months of treatment; however, none of these trials have evaluated CVD prevention". "In general, initial combination therapy with 2 drugs is reasonable in adults with stage 2 hypertension and those at high CVD risk". "However, BP-lowering medications should be carefully initiated and monitored in older patients because hypotension or orthostatic hypotension (OH) may develop".

### Efficacy of different drug classes used to initiate antihypertensive treatment in black subjects… [^112K2Uyo]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions In contrast to current recommendations, calcium channel blockers are more effective than thiazides as initial treatment in black subjects with hypertension. If treatment is started with thiazides or converting-enzyme inhibitors, combination therapy is more likely to be required to control blood pressure and reduce left ventricular mass. SIMILAR TO the recommendations of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, 1 the South African guidelines for antihypertensive therapy2 recommend the use of low-dose thiazides as the preferred first-line drug, to which calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, β-blockers, or reserpine may be added to achieve blood pressure control.

If at the first monthly follow-up visit the target BP was not attained, the daily dose of the first-line drug was increased as follows: nifedipine GITS to 60 mg/d, verapamil hydrochloride SR to 360 mg/d, hydrochlorothiazide to 25 mg/d, and enalapril maleate to 20 mg/d. In keeping with other studies, 3, 15 most of our black patients with mild to moderate hypertension required multiple drug treatment to achieve adequate control, especially if treatment was initiated with a thiazide or an ACE inhibitor. Low rates of BP control have been previously documented in black patients with hypertension who were receiving treatment with captopril, 12 enalapril, 16, 17 or hydrochlorothiazide. 18 On balance, the evidence available suggests that ACE inhibitors should not be used as monotherapy in black patients with hypertension, but only in combination with other medications.

14 At 13 months, the addition of hydrochlorothiazide and/or other drugs achieved BP control in 79. 3% of patients randomized to enalapril treatment. This observation suggests that BP control rather than drug class is the predominant factor determining left ventricular mass regression. In contrast with the modified South African guidelines, 1, 2 long-acting calcium channel blockers are more effective than thiazides as initial treatment in African blacks with hypertension. Outcome trials in hypertension were largely conducted in white22, 23 and Asian subjects. 24–26 Because such information is not yet available for African blacks, the present findings should be subject to further investigation in prospective morbidity and mortality trials in African blacks.

### Myocardial infarction and stroke associated with diuretic based two drug antihypertensive regimens: population based case-control study [^113xcAbi]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Untreated high blood pressure is strongly associated with myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. The findings of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) suggested that low dose diuretics are superior to calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as first line treatment for the prevention of one or more forms of cardiovascular disease in high risk patients with hypertension. A network meta-analysis confirmed and extended these findings.

On the basis of this evidence, the seventh report guidelines issued in the United States by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure recommend the use of low dose diuretics as first line pharmacological treatment for uncomplicated high blood pressure. In England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines recommend the use of low dose diuretics as a first choice therapy for high blood pressure in black patients or those aged 55 or above, and recommend a combination of diuretics plus angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers in patients under 55 years who do not respond to initial treatment.

About half of all patients with hypertension require a second medication to achieve control of blood pressure. In ALLHAT at five years, for instance, 40.7% of patients randomly allocated to chlorthalidone were taking at least one other antihypertensive medication. Other major classes of antihypertensive medication — β blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers — all lower blood pressure. However, the optimal second line agent for the prevention of cardiovascular disease among patients who are taking low dose diuretics and who require additional treatment for blood pressure control is not known. Although a National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute working group recommended the conduct of a trial to evaluate the optimal second line treatment for hypertension, no such trial has been performed to date.

The purpose of this case-control study was to examine the association of myocardial infarction and stroke with several commonly used two drug treatments regimens: diuretics plus β blockers; diuretics plus angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers; and diuretics plus calcium channel blockers.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^116woGb8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 1 074 314 patients in 15 academic health care institutions across the United States, we observed a higher proportion of uncontrolled hypertension among Black patients compared with patients of other races and an increasing trend of monotherapy and decreasing trends of FDC and polytherapy. The probability of receiving monotherapy was 35% (95% CI, 32%–38%) higher comparing 2019 with 2010, and the probability of receiving FDC and polytherapy was 42% (95% CI: 40%–44%) and 3% (95% CI: 1%–4%) lower, respectively. Consistent with the recommendations from the 2014 JNC 8 report, the use of beta blockers decreased, though the magnitude was small, and CCB prescriptions increased among Black patients. However, the use of thiazide diuretics among Black patients did not increase after the JNC 8 report, and the use of dual therapy and FDC among patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg also did not increase after recommendations by the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines.

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^115w1TWQ]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss. There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

### The construction and meaning of race within hypertension guidelines: a systematic scoping review [^111a6e15]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Twenty-two guidelines (59%) mentioned race at least once in reference to pharmacology. Guidelines emphasized the need for different first-line medications based on whether a patient belonged to a "Black" or "African American" racial group. A 1991 guideline asserted that "black patients tend to respond better to diuretics and calcium antagonists than to beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as monotherapy". Whelton et al. recommended "[f]or black adults with hypertension (without HF or CKD), initial antihypertensive treatment should include a thiazide diuretic or CCB". The two most recent hypertension guidelines included in this review recommended different pharmacologic medications based on race.

Fourteen guidelines (38%) referenced interventions designed to address existing differences in hypertension outcomes between racial groups due to lifestyle or behavioral factors. Ten guidelines discussed interventions to decrease sodium intake –, and increase potassium intake. Multiple guidelines described a unique relationship between salt and high blood pressure in African Americans. From the time this association was mentioned in 1991 ("limiting salt intake is recommended for all hypertensive patients, particularly those who are considered salt-sensitive, such as black and older adults"), the reference did not substantially change. A 2006 guideline stated: "The potential benefits of these dietary approaches are amplified because survey data indicate that blacks consume high levels of sodium while their potassium intake is less than that of nonblacks". The AHA's 2014 guideline asserted: "A reduction of salt intake is recommended in patients who are 'salt sensitive', which may be a fairly common finding in black communities". The 2018 guideline on resistant hypertension noted: "Other subgroups of individuals (e.g. those with CKD350 and obesity, blacks) are often more sensitive and can derive particularly robust benefits from sodium restriction". Other guidelines highlighted the need for interventions to increase physical activity, decrease obesity rates, and encourage smoking cessation. For example, Egan et al. wrote, "special attention to smoking cessation is especially important for African Americans with diabetes as they have more lower-extremity amputations than Caucasians with diabetes".

### Rationale and design of the comparison of 3 combination therapies in lowering blood pressure in black Africans (CREOLE study): 2 × 3 factorial randomized single-blind multicenter trial [^1141XyuP]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Current hypertension guidelines recommend the use of combination therapy as first-line treatment or early in the management of hypertensive patients. Although there are many possible combinations of blood pressure(BP)-lowering therapies, the best combination for the black population is still a subject of debate because no large randomized controlled trials have been conducted in this group to compare the efficacy of different combination therapies to address this issue.

Methods

The comparison of 3 combination therapies in lowering BP in the black Africans (CREOLE) study is a randomized single-blind trial that will compare the efficacy of amlodipine plus hydrochlorothiazide versus amlodipine plus perindopril and versus perindopril plus hydrochlorothiazide in blacks residing in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Seven hundred two patients aged 30–79 years with a sitting systolic BP of 140 mm Hg and above, and less than 160 mm Hg on antihypertensive monotherapy, or sitting systolic BP of 150 mm Hg and above, and less than 180 mm Hg on no treatment, will be centrally randomized into any of the 3 arms (234 into each arm). The CREOLE study is taking place in 10 sites in SSA, and the primary outcome measure is change in ambulatory systolic BP from baseline to 6 months. The first patient was randomized in June 2017, and the trial will be concluded by 2019.

Conclusions

The CREOLE trial will provide unique information as to the most efficacious 2-drug combination in blacks residing in SSA and thereby inform the development of clinical guidelines for the treatment of hypertension in this subregion.

### 2014 hypertension recommendations from the eighth Joint National Committee panel members raise concerns for elderly black and female populations [^111df3yT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

A report from panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee titled "2014 Evidence-Based Guideline for the Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults" has garnered much attention due to its major change in recommendations for hypertension treatment for patients ≥ 60 years of age and for their treatment goal. In response, certain groups have opposed the decision to initiate pharmacologic treatment to lower blood pressure (BP) at systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg and treat to a goal systolic BP of < 150 mm Hg in the general population age ≥ 60 years. This paper contains 3 sections-an introduction followed by the opinions of 2 writing groups-outlining objections to or support of maintaining this proposed strategy in certain at-risk populations, namely African Americans, women, and the elderly. Several authors argue for maintaining current targets, as opposed to adopting the new recommendations, to allow for optimal treatment for older women and African Americans, helping to close sex and race/ethnicity gaps in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.

### Managing hypertension using combination therapy [^116ET2nc]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

More than 70% of adults treated for primary hypertension will eventually require at least two antihypertensive agents, either initially as combination therapy or as add-on therapy if monotherapy and lifestyle modifications do not achieve adequate blood pressure control. Four main classes of medications are used in combination therapy for the treatment of hypertension: thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). ACEIs and ARBs should not be used simultaneously. In black patients, at least one agent should be a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction should be treated initially with a beta blocker and an ACEI or ARB (or an angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor), followed by add-on therapy with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist and a diuretic based on volume status. Treatment for patients with chronic kidney disease and proteinuria should include an ACEI or ARB plus a thiazide diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be treated similarly to those without diabetes unless proteinuria is present, in which case combination therapy should include an ACEI or ARB.

### Evolving the role of black race in hypertension therapeutics [^1161NWso]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Black race has been used to guide antihypertensive drug selection for Black patients based on predominant between race (same drug) and intra-race (different drugs) blood pressure (BP) response patterns. Accordingly, thiazide diuretics and calcium antagonists have been recommended over renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (angiotensin-receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and beta blockers for Black patients. Current antihypertensive drug prescribing reflects historical guidance as calcium antagonists and thiazide diuretics are prescribed more and RAS blockers less in Black than White patients. Hypertension control rates in Blacks, lag those for Whites despite their greater use of combination drug therapy and lesser use of monotherapy. This is also true across drug regimens containing any of the 4 recommended classes for initial therapy as well as for evidence-based combination drug therapy (calcium antagonist or thiazide diuretic+RAS blocker) regimens for which there is no known racial disparity in BP response. Current recommendations acknowledge the need for combination drug therapy in most, especially in Black patients. One exemplary comprehensive hypertension control program achieved > 80% control rates in Black and White patients with minimal racial disparity while utilizing a race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm. Black patients manifest robust, if not outsized, BP responses to diet/lifestyle modifications. Importantly, race neither appears to be a necessary nor sufficient consideration for the selection of effective drug therapy. Accordingly, we urge the initiation of adequately intense race-agnostic drug therapy coupled with greater emphasis on diet/lifestyle modifications for Black patients as the cornerstone of a race-informed approach to hypertension therapeutics.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^111ZDU8g]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations

It is possible that people initiating hypertension drugs other than first line options suggested by current guidance were prescribed them for other indications. Despite good balance on baseline comorbidities in matched cohorts, residual confounding caused by unrecorded heart failure and kidney disease could have attenuated the blood pressure response to treatment. However, we endeavoured to reduce confounding by indication by including only people with hypertension; undertaking our analyses only in people who did not have diabetes; and matching by propensity score on multiple factors, inclusive of heart failure. This last approach achieved highly balanced cohorts for each drug comparison within each group. Furthermore, we used multiple strategies to help detect bias in our matched cohorts; our negative outcome analysis demonstrated no increased risk of herpes zoster in any drug group. Additionally, our positive outcome analyses showed that our data and methods were sensitive to drug effects anticipated to be causally associated with specific hypertension drugs.

Our results related to ethnicity have wide margins of uncertainty, which could have occurred for several reasons. Firstly, we compared changes in blood pressure between black and non-black people, consistent with current UK guidance. Much of the original clinical research that informs this guidance compared people with an African or Caribbean ethnic origin versus people classified as white. If people of non-black and non-white ethnicity in our study had intermediate responses to the hypertension drug classes, their inclusion in the non-black group could have contributed to the overlapping confidence intervals observed for non-black and black people. Secondly, we had small numbers of black people initiating ACEI/ARB as a first line treatment for hypertension, suggesting that current NICE guidance is closely adhered to. Thirdly, the uncertainty we observed could have reflected the wide variation in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system across all ethnic groups.

Our outcomes relied on measurements of blood pressure at clinics because these measurements are recommended by NICE to monitor hypertension in primary care and to guide treatment decisions, except for patients suspected of white coat hypertension or resistant hypertension, in whom ambulatory or home monitoring is recommended. Therefore, the blood pressure measurements used in this study reflect the provision of care as it occurs routinely. Furthermore, we do not expect that any one method of blood pressure measurement was more or less concentrated in any one drug group, thus removing the risk of measurement bias. Our study did not look at the issue of adherence to hypertension drugs, although our as-treated analysis did censor individuals if they discontinued their index drug.

### Evaluation and management of resistant hypertension: core curriculum 2024 [^117BqjS3]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure above goal despite confirmed adherence to 3 first-line antihypertensive agents or when blood pressure is controlled with 4 or more medications at maximal or maximally tolerated doses. In addition to meeting these criteria, identifying patients with true resistant hypertension requires both accurate in-office blood pressure measurement as well as excluding white coat effects through out-of-office blood pressure measurements. Patients with resistant hypertension are at higher risk for adverse cardiovascular events and are more likely to have a potentially treatable secondary cause contributing to their hypertension. Effective treatment of resistant hypertension includes ongoing lifestyle modifications and collaboration with patients to detect and address barriers to optimal medication adherence. Pharmacologic treatment should prioritize optimizing first-line, once daily, longer acting medications followed by the stepwise addition of second-, third-, and fourth-line agents as tolerated. Physicians should systematically evaluate for and address any underlying secondary causes. A coordinated, multidisciplinary team approach including clinicians with experience in treating resistant hypertension is essential. New treatment options, including both pharmacologic and device-based therapies, have recently been approved, and more are in the pipeline; their optimal role in the management of resistant hypertension is an area of ongoing research.

### Racial and ethnic disparities in antihypertensive medication prescribing patterns and effectiveness [^112G4LYX]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Variability in drug effectiveness and provider prescribing patterns have been reported in different racial and ethnic populations. We sought to evaluate antihypertensive drug effectiveness and prescribing patterns among self-identified Hispanic/Latino (Hispanic), Non-Hispanic Black (Black), and Non-Hispanic White (White) populations that enrolled in the NIH All of Us Research Program, a US longitudinal cohort. We employed a self-controlled case study method using electronic health record and survey data from 17,718 White, Hispanic, and Black participants who were diagnosed with essential hypertension and prescribed at least one of 19 commonly used antihypertensive medications. Effectiveness was determined by calculating the reduction in systolic blood pressure measurements after 28 or more days of drug exposure. Starting systolic blood pressure and effectiveness for each medication were compared for self-reported Black, Hispanic, and White participants using adjusted linear regressions. Black and Hispanic participants were started on antihypertensive medications at significantly higher SBP than White participants in 13 and 7 out of 19 medications, respectively. More Black participants were prescribed multiple antihypertensive medications (58.46%) than White (52.35%) or Hispanic (49.9%) participants. First-line HTN medications differed by race and ethnicity. Following the 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline release, around 64% of Black participants were prescribed a recommended first-line antihypertensive drug compared with 76% of White and 82% of Hispanic participants. Effect sizes suggested that most antihypertensive drugs were less effective in Hispanic and Black, compared with White, participants, and statistical significance was reached in 6 out of 19 drugs. These results indicate that Black and Hispanic populations may benefit from earlier intervention and screening and highlight the potential benefits of personalizing first-line medications.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^112toGNe]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

International guidelines for hypertension are similar to NICE guidelines in that ethnicity is a major consideration in the choice of a first line hypertension drug, although they do not use the algorithmic approach of UK guidance. Ethnicity based recommendations are supported by strong evidence from the ALLHAT randomised clinical trial, which showed use of thiazides or CCB was more effective than ACEI/ARB at lowering blood pressure in black people. We have suggested above several reasons why our results might differ from established clinical evidence. However, the value of making clinical decisions based on ethnicity is increasingly questioned given the growing proportion of people who classify themselves as multiethnic or of mixed heritage. Furthermore, our understanding of interactions between genetic and environmental factors in the development of hypertension is improving. Thus, the value of using categorisations of ethnicity as a proxy predictor for drug response is uncertain in current society, although is likely to be informed by ongoing research.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we observed reductions in blood pressure for CCB that were similar in magnitude to those for ACEI/ARB in people aged above and below 55. This finding suggests that some people aged 55 and older who are currently offered CCB, but have indications for renin-angiotensin blockade such as proteinuria, could be missing the therapeutic benefits of ACEI/ARB. We found no evidence that CCB new use was associated with larger reductions in blood pressure than ACEI/ARB new use among black people versus other ethnic groups, although power was limited and uncertainty existed in the estimate. Our results suggest that the algorithm for choice of pharmacotherapy in UK NICE guidance could be simplified. Moving towards a choice of any of the three major hypertension drug classes with suggested compelling indications for their use would align the UK with international guidance, in particular with regard to age.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^116FTHSg]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The appropriateness of using the Black race to guide the choice of initial antihypertensive therapy, therefore, warrants careful consideration. While practice guidelines, favor calcium-channel blockers and diuretics for Black adults with hypertension, these are typically recommended as part of combination therapy with a renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blocker rather than as monotherapy. Importantly, race-specific differences in average blood pressure responses do not reliably predict individual responses to single-drug therapy, as the BP response distributions overlap significantly between Black and White adults. Therefore, there is no clear advantage to using race as a determinant for selecting single-drug therapy in patients for whom monotherapy is otherwise appropriate.

The Kaiser Permanente's Gardena Medical Offices in the United States implemented a comprehensive hypertension control program to address racial disparities in blood pressure management. The program that included a patient population that was 65% Black utilized a team-based approach, culturally tailored communication, physician-led initiatives to reduce therapeutic inertia, and adherence to evidence-based guidelines. A race-agnostic therapeutic algorithm was also introduced to guide treatment decisions. The program initially aimed to close the racial gap in blood pressure control (< 140/90 mm Hg), which stood at 6.3% (76.6% control in Black patients versus 82.9% in others). Over several years, blood pressure control rates among Black patients improved to 81.4%, reducing the disparity to 2.8%. This demonstrated that high blood pressure control rates and reduced racial disparities can be achieved without race-specific prescribing, particularly when combined with intensive, guideline-aligned care and efforts to avoid therapeutic inertia.

### Prescription patterns for the use of antihypertensive drugs for primary prevention among patients with hypertension in the United Kingdom [^114cBUZi]. American Journal of Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Several antihypertensive drugs are available for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, existing evidence on prescription patterns was primarily generated among patients at high CVD risk with short-term follow-up, and failed to capture impacts of time and patient characteristics. Our objective was therefore to describe longitudinal prescription patterns for antihypertensive drugs for the primary prevention of CVD among patients with arterial hypertension in the United Kingdom.

Methods

This population-based cohort study used data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, included 660,545 patients with hypertension who initiated an antihypertensive drug between 1998 and 2018. Antihypertensive treatments were measured by drug class and described overall and in subgroups, focusing on first-line therapy (first antihypertensive drug(s) recorded after a diagnosis of hypertension) and second-line therapy (antihypertensive drug(s) prescribed as part of a treatment change following first-line therapy).

Results

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (29.0%), thiazide diuretics (22.1%), and calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) (21.0%) were the most prescribed first-line therapies. ACE inhibitors have been increasingly prescribed as first-line therapy since 2001. Men were more likely to be prescribed ACE inhibitors than women (43.5% vs. 32.1%; difference: 11.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 11.0%-11.8%), and Black patients were more likely to be prescribed CCBs than White patients (63.6% vs. 37.0%; difference: 26.6%; 95% CI, 24.8%-28.4%).

Conclusions

Antihypertensive prescription patterns for the primary prevention of CVD among patients with hypertension are consistent with treatment guidelines that were in place during the study period, providing reassurance regarding the use of evidence-based prescribing.

### WITHDRAWN: effect of antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure in blacks [^116YyP1F]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Black people have a greater prevalence of elevated blood pressure leading to excess morbidity and mortality.

Objectives

To systematically review the effects of different antihypertensive drugs on mortality, morbidity and blood pressure black adults with elevated blood pressure.

Search Strategy

Medline, Embase, LILACS, African Index Medicus, the Cochrane Library November 2003; Pubmed September 2003 to March 2004. Searches were conducted without language restriction.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of drugs versus placebo (blood pressure outcomes) or versus placebo or other drugs (morbidity and mortality outcomes).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data unblinded. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Authors were contacted twice to obtain missing information.

Main Results

Full reports or abstracts from more than 2900 references of papers yielded 30 trials considering 53 interventions with 8 classes of antihypertensive drugs in 20,006 black patients from Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States of America, aged 18 to > 80 years. In one large trial the main morbidity and mortality outcomes did not differ significantly between initial treatment drug classes when drugs were added to reach goal blood pressures. However, the comparison ACE Inhibitors vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for stroke 1.40 [1.17 to 1.68]; combined CHD 1.15 [1.02 to 1.30] and combined CVD 1.19 [1.09 to 1.30] and the comparison alpha blocker vs diuretic favoured the diuretic for combined CVD 1.40 [1.25 to 1.57]. In addition, all comparisons for heart failure favoured diuretic (1.47 [1.24 to 1.74] vs calcium blocker; 1.32 [1.11 to 1.58] vs ACE Inhibitor; and 2.18 [1.73 to 2.74] vs alpha blocker. The results also showed a greater occurrence of diabetes with diuretics. No significant differences were detected between placebo and beta adrenergic blockers in the reduction of systolic blood pressure (weighted mean difference [95% CI], -3.52 [-7.50 to 0.46] mm Hg). In addition, ACE inhibitors did not significantly differ from placebo in achievement of goal diastolic blood pressure (risk difference [95% CI], 5% [-10% to 21%]). Calcium blockers, diuretics, centrally acting agents, alpha adrenergic blockers and angiotensin II antagonists were all more effective than placebo in reducing blood pressure in the pooled analyses. Only calcium blockers remained effective in all prespecified subgroups, including baseline diastolic blood pressure > 109 mm Hg.

Authors' Conclusions

When first-line drugs from different classes are compared in the treatment of black people, there is no evidence of differential effects on most mortality and morbidity outcomes. Those morbidity differences that were found favoured diuretics. Drugs differ in their ability to reduce blood pressure in black people. Calcium blockers were the only drug class that reduced blood pressure in all subgroups of black people including those with severe hypertension. Beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blocker, alpha blockers and ACE Inhibitors were least good at reducing blood pressure in black adults.

### Losartan potassium (Arbli) [^117JuAf2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

Arbli is indicated for the treatment of hypertension in adults and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular (CV) events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarction. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including losartan.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Arbli may be administered with other antihypertensive agents.

1.2 Hypertensive Patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy

Arbli is indicated to reduce the risk of stroke in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy, but there is evidence that this benefit does not apply to Black patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Association of race / ethnicity-specific changes in antihypertensive medication classes initiated among Medicare beneficiaries with the eighth Joint National Committee panel member report [^112FZ2Lx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In December 2013, the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC8) published a report with evidence-based treatment recommendations for patients initiating antihypertensive medication. Both the JNC8 panel member report and the previous seventh (JNC7) guideline recommended thiazide-type diuretics as first-line therapy, regardless of race/ethnicity, among patients without compelling indications for specific classes of antihypertensive medication. However, the JNC8 panel member report differed from the JNC7 guideline by including race/ethnicity-specific recommendations for additional initial medications, either alone or as components of combination therapy. For non-Black adults, the JNC8 panel member report recommended thiazide-type diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Black adults were recommended thiazide-type diuretics or CCBs. The panel did not recommend β-blockers as first-line therapy in the absence of either coronary heart disease (CHD) or heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

The race/ethnicity-specific treatment recommendations in the JNC8 panel member report were based on randomized trial data showing that Black adults have smaller blood pressure (BP) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk decreases than White adults when treated with an ACEI. Prespecified subgroup analyses of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) found that the risks of stroke, heart failure, and CVD were higher in Black participants randomized to an ACEI vs a thiazide-type diuretic, and the risk of stroke was higher in Black participants randomized to an ACEI vs a CCB. No differences were present for White participants. β-Blockers were not recommended for first-line therapy because there is evidence of increased CVD risk with β-blockers compared with ARBs.

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate changes in the initial antihypertensive medication regimens filled between 2011 and 2018 among older US adults who were Black, White, or of other race/ethnicity. In addition, we evaluated changes in the initial classes of antihypertensive medication filled before vs after December 18, 2013, the date the JNC8 panel member report was published.

Changes in Trends After Guidelines

After publication of the JNC 8 report in 2014, which removed beta blockers as a first‐line therapy for most patients (except those with CAD and congestive heart failure) and recommended the use of thiazide diuretics and CCBs alone as first‐line therapies for Black patients, the probability of receiving a beta blocker prescription did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 but was 3% (95% CI, 2%–4%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with the pre‐JNC 8 time period of 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4A). Among Black patients, the probability of receiving CCB was 20% (95% CI, 18%–22%) higher in 2015 to 2017, and 41% (95% CI, 38%–41%) higher in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4B). Among Black patients, the probability of receiving thiazide diuretics did not change significantly from 2015 to 2017 and was 6% (95% CI, 8%−5%) lower in 2018 to 2019 compared with 2010 to 2014 (Figure 4B).

Odds ratio is interpreted as the odds of receiving beta blocker as first‐line therapy (A) or CCB and thiazide directics as first‐line therapy for Black patients (B) among all treatment episodes during the specified period compared with the reference period 2010–2014 or receiving dual therapy and FDC for patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg compared with the reference period 2015–2017 (C), controlling for order of prescription episode, site, age, sex, race, ethnicity, hypertension control, body mass index, and other chronic disease histories. ACC/AHA indicates American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association; BP, blood pressure; CCB, calcium‐channel blocker; FDC, fixed‐dose combination; JNC 8, Eighth Joint National Committee; OR, odds ratio; and PCORnet, National Patient‐Centered Clinical Research Network.

Despite a recommended increased use of dual therapy and FDC among patients with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg by the 2017 Hypertention Clinical Practice Guidelines, we observed a decreasing trend instead. Compared with 2015 to 2017, there was a 9% (95% CI, 11%−8%) decrease in use of dual therapy and 11% (95% CI, 12%−9%) decrease in the use of any FDC in 2018 to 2019 (Figure 4C).

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^115qc5YC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Compared with prior studies, we also observed similar increases in the prevalence of uncontrolled BP among adults taking antihypertensive medications, particularly after 2014. Consistent with prior studies and reports, we observed a higher probability of uncontrolled BP among Black patients compared with White patients. Additionally, there was a 50% (95% CI, 48%–51%) and 15% (95% CI, 13%–17%) higher probability of receiving polytherapy and FDC prescriptions, respectively, among Black patients compared with White patients. These findings align with the finding that Black patients in our study and prior studies received more intensive antihypertensive therapy but still had less BP control.

Racial and ethnic disparities in BP control arise from various factors. A prior study found that the primary determinants of disparities in BP control were substandard insurance coverage and poor access to health care, which could be related to myriad social determinants, including structural racism and bias. Practice guidelines have long recommended race‐based pharmacologic management of hypertension, citing differential responsiveness to classes of antihypertensive medication across races. The race‐based approach was based on studies showing more BP lowering from diuretics and CCBs among Black patients, with beta blockers and drugs that act on the renin‐angiotensin system (such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs) showing less response. However, some experts have argued that the differences are small, with substantial overlap in BP response between Black and White patients. In 2014, the JNC 8 report removed ACE inhibitors and ARBs as the first‐line treatment for Black patients and instead recommended using only CCB and thiazide diuretic. Our study, along with studies by Anderson et aland Colvin et alusing Medicare claims data and Egan et al using NHANES data, observed an increase in use of CCB as the first‐line treatment among Black patients in accordance with the guideline. However, we found a guideline‐discordant decrease in the use of thiazide diuretics among Black patients, which was also noted by Anderson et al. However, because monotherapy is still the most prevalent treatment pattern and that both CCBs and thiazides are recommended in Black patients as initial treatment, the decrease in thiazide diuretics could be due to replacement effect, that is, the increased use of CCBs replaced the use of thiazide diuretics. Although our study along with others suggested that race‐based hypertension guidelines may influence clinical prescribing, there is no evidence that these guidelines have reduced the racial disparity in BP control.

### Current trends in hypertension identification and management: insights from the national health and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) following the 2017 ACC / AHA high blood pressure guidelines [^111uCmZw]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Guideline adherence was also suboptimal in participants with comorbidities or in designated special groups. The use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB in CKD Stage 3 or higher, or in patients with albuminuria without CKD, was absent with 1 in 4 participants. Over half of the participants with stable ischemic heart disease were not on a β‐blocker and an ACE inhibitor or ARB. Despite current guidelines recommending these agents as the antihypertensives of choice in these special populations, a significant percentage are not benefiting from their renal and cardiovascular protection. Furthermore, both ACE inhibitors and ARBs carry the strongest recommendation and highest level of evidence as first‐line BP agents in all comers with hypertension, indicating improper initial antihypertensive selection by prescribers. Additionally, in nearly half of those surveyed, Black participants without heart failure or CKD Stage 3 or higher were missing a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker. Even though the 2013 Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure report recommended thiazide‐type diuretics or calcium channel blockers for Black patients, our study demonstrates that race disparities in antihypertensive medical management continue to exist.

In addition to suboptimal utilization of antihypertensives, a majority of patients with hypertension had uncontrolled BP. Previous data from the National Center for Health Statistics demonstrated that while the prevalence of hypertension in the general population remained unchanged from 1999 to 2016 at 27.9% to 29.9%, there was a substantial increase in the percentage of adults with controlled BP from 31.6% to 48.3% during this time. However, there was no significant change in the rate of controlled BP from 2011 to 2016, suggesting a plateau in this trend, which may have possibly inspired the creation of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. This study demonstrated similar findings with only 44.8% of patients demonstrating controlled BP from 2017 to 2020. It appears that despite these new guidelines for the management of hypertension, there are still barriers preventing adequate achievement of BP goals. Our research identified non‐Hispanic Black race and severe albuminuria as barriers to adequate BP control. Furthermore, among participants prescribed 2 antihypertensive medications, access to routine health care and excessive alcohol use were also identified alongside these factors. These findings support previous calls for addressing systemic health care disparities and improving access in the United States. Nevertheless, clinicians may significantly improve BP control by addressing excessive alcohol consumption and managing albuminuria, where applicable.

### Amlodipine besylate (Norvasc) [^111UepAZ]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

1.1 Hypertension

NORVASC®is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including NORVASC.

Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC).

Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

NORVASC may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^112hemUj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Additional Insights

While JNC 8 has the same treatment recommendations for people with or without diabetes, most other societies suggest that only ACEIs or ARBs should be first‐line treatment for patients with diabetes. In the case of patients with diabetes and a history of CKD, we agree that ACEIs or ARBs should be first line.

In the black population with hypertension, CCBs and thiazide diuretics generally tend to be favored as initial therapy over renin‐angiotensin system blockers. 13, 14, 45 The evidence for this recommendation comes from ALLHAT, which showed in prespecified subgroup analysis that black patients treated with lisinopril had higher rates of stroke, CVD, and HF plus 4 mm Hg higher SBP compared with those treated with chlorthalidone. 49

On the other hand, the primary and secondary outcomes were similar in the chlorthalidone and amlodipine groups except for higher rates of HF with amlodipine. Compared with lisinopril, the black patients in the amlodipine group had lower stroke rates and improved BP control. Therefore, both CCBs and thiazide diuretics are considered first line for black patients with hypertension.

If a black patient has coexisting CKD, initial treatment should be an ACEI or ARB if the patient also has albuminuria, as supported by the KDIGO guidelines. This recommendation, for starting with CCBs and thiazides is generalized to black patients with diabetes, because nearly half of the black patients in ALLHAT had diabetes. Given that most patients require > 1 agent to control hypertension, it is important to know that combination treatment with CCB or diuretics plus rennin‐angiotensin system blockade leads to the same efficacy in black or white patients. The International Society for Hypertension in Blacks suggests starting with a CCB or thiazide diuretic if < 10 mm Hg above target or using a 2‐drug approach if > 15/10 mm Hg over with a CCB or diuretic plus a rennin‐angiotensin system blocker. 13

### Influence of patient race on physician prescribing decisions: a randomized on-line experiment [^112ozYS5]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Prior research reports black patients have lower medication use for hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and diabetes.

Objective

To assess whether patient race influences physicians' prescribing.

Design

Web-based survey including three clinical vignettes (hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes), with patient race (black, white) randomized across vignettes.

Subjects

A total of 716 respondents from 5,141 eligible sampled primary care physicians (14% response rate).

Interventions

None

Measurements

Medication recommendation (any medication vs none, on-patent branded vs generic, and therapeutic class) and physicians' treatment adherence forecast (10-point Likert scale, 1-definitely not adhere, 10-definitely adhere).

Results

Respondents randomized to view black patients (n = 371) and white patients (n = 345) recommend any medications at comparable rates for hypercholesterolemia (100.0% white vs 99.5% black, P = 0.50), hypertension (99.7% white vs 99.5% black, P = 1.00), and diabetes (99.7% white vs 99.7% black, P = 1.00). Patient race influenced medication class chosen in the hypertension vignette; respondents randomized to view black patients recommended calcium channel blockers more often (20.8% black vs 3.2% white) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less often (47.4% black vs 62.6% white) (P < 0.001). Patient race did not influence medication class for hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Respondents randomized to view black patients reported lower forecasted patient adherence for hypertension (P < 0.001, mean: 7.3 black vs 7.7 white) and diabetes (P = 0.05 mean: 7.4 black vs 7.6 white), but race had no meaningful influence on forecasted adherence for hypercholesterolemia (P = 0.15, mean: 7.2 black vs 7.3 white).

Conclusion

Racial differences in outpatient prescribing patterns for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes are likely attributable to factors other than prescribing decisions based on patient race.

### Self-reported antihypertensive medication class and temporal relationship to treatment guidelines [^114TNPFV]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

The greater antihypertensive responses to initial therapy with calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or thiazide-type diuretics than renin-angiotensin system blockers as initial therapy in non-Hispanic Black (NHB) adults was recognized in the US High BP guidelines from 1988 to 2003. The 2014 Report from Panel Members Appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (2014 aJNC8 Report) and the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association High Blood Pressure Guideline were the first to recommend CCBs or thiazide-type diuretics rather than renin-angiotensin system blockers as initial therapy in NHB. We assessed the temporal relationship of these recommendations on self-reported CCB or thiazide-type diuretics monotherapy by NHB and NHW adults with hypertension absent compelling indications for β-blockers or renin-angiotensin system blockers in National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2015 to 2018 versus 2007 to 2012 (after versus before 2014 aJNC8 Report). CCB or thiazide-type diuretics monotherapy was unchanged in NHW adults (17.1% versus 18.1%, P = 0.711) and insignificantly higher after 2014 among NHB adults (43.7% versus 38.2%, P = 0.204), although CCB monotherapy increased (29.5% versus 21.0%, P = 0.021) and renin-angiotensin system blocker monotherapy fell (44.5% versus 31.0%, P = 0.008). Although evidence-based CCB monotherapy increased among NHB adults in 2015 to 2018, hypertension control declined as untreated hypertension and monotherapy increased. While a gap between recommended and actual monotherapy persists, evidence-based monotherapy appears insufficient to improve hypertension control in NHB adults, especially given evidence for worsening therapeutic inertia. Initiating treatment with single-pill combinations and timely therapeutic intensification when required to control hypertension are evidence-based, race-neutral options for improving hypertension control among NHB adults.

### Recommendations for the management of special populations: racial and ethnic populations [^116gQdVh]. American Journal of Hypertension (2003). Low credibility.

One of the current challenges in the treatment of hypertension is the variation in the incidence and morbidity among ethnic populations. For example, in the recent Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), in which 35% of the patients were African American, the diuretic chlorthalidone was associated with greater reductions in blood pressure (BP) than the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor lisinopril and was also associated with a relative risk reduction in stroke compared with lisinopril. However, the increased stroke risk associated with lisinopril was experienced among African American but not non-African American patients. ALLHAT did not permit combination therapy with ACE inhibitors plus diuretics; therefore, the benefits of such regimens in this patient population could not be assessed. In the Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, in contrast to the overall study population, African American patients with left ventricular hypertrophy treated with atenolol were at lower risk of experiencing the primary composite end point (death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) than African Americans treated with losartan, with or without diuretics. On the other hand, in the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension, African American patients treated with the ACE inhibitor ramipril had a significantly lower incidence of the primary composite end point (glomerular filtration rate reduction, end-stage renal disease, or death) than African Americans treated with the calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Although the use of diuretics in African American patients may be a logical first-line choice for BP reduction, most patients will require combination therapy. African American patients with systolic BP ≥ 15 mm Hg above target level or a diastolic BP ≥ 10 mm Hg above target should be considered for first-line combination therapy. Although certain combinations have been shown to be effective in non-African American patients, the choice of drugs for combination therapy in African American patients may be different.

### Differences in hypertension medication prescribing for black Americans and their association with hypertension outcomes [^113raVQr]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

National guidelines recommend different pharmacologic management of hypertension (HTN) without comorbidities for Black/African Americans (BAA) compared with non-BAA. We sought to 1) identify if these recommendations have influenced prescription patterns in BAA and 2) identify the differences in uncontrolled HTN in BAA on different antihypertensive medications.

Methods

We constructed a linked retrospective observational cohort using 2 years of electronic health records data, comprising of patients aged 18 to 85 with HTN on 1- or 2-drug regimens, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), thiazide diuretics, or calcium channel blockers (CCB). We examined prescribing differences and HTN control in BAA versus non-BAA.

Results

Among 10,875 patients identified, 20.6% were identified as BAA. 46.4% of BAA had uncontrolled HTN (≥ 140/90 mmHg) compared with 39.0% of non-BAA (P < .001). 61.8% of BAA were treated with 1-drug compared with 68.4% of non-BAA. Of BAA on monotherapy: 41.3% were on thiazide, 40.1% on CCB, and 18.6% on ACE/ARB. Of non-BAA on monotherapy, 27.7% were on thiazide, 30.1% were on CCB, and 42.3% were on ACE/ARB. Of BAA patients on 1 drug, 45.2% had uncontrolled HTN compared with 38.0% of non-BAA (P < .001). Of BAA on 2 drugs, 48.2% had uncontrolled HTN compared with 41.1% non-BAA (P < .001). For each drug regimen, there was more variation in HTN control within each group than between BAA and non-BAA.

Conclusions

Providers seem to be following race-based guidelines for HTN, yet HTN control for BAA remains worse than non-BAA. An individualized approach to HTN therapy for all patients may be more important than race-based guidelines.

### First-line combination therapy versus first-line monotherapy for primary hypertension [^115Q3UvG]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of a review originally published in 2017. Starting with one drug and starting with a combination of two drugs are strategies suggested in clinical guidelines as initial treatment of hypertension. The recommendations are not based on evidence about clinically relevant outcomes. Some antihypertensive combinations have been shown to be harmful. The actual harm-to-benefit balance of each strategy is unknown.

Objectives

To determine if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to April 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (from 2005), Embase (from 1974), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We used no language restrictions. We also searched clinical studies repositories of pharmaceutical companies, reviews of combination drugs on the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency websites, and lists of references in reviews and clinical practice guidelines.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials with at least 12 months' follow-up in adults with primary hypertension (systolic blood pressure/diastolic blood pressure 140/90 mmHg or higher, or 130/80 mmHg or higher if participants had diabetes), which compared combination of two first-line antihypertensive drugs with monotherapy as initial treatment. Trials had to include at least 50 participants per group and report mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events, or serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, evaluated the risk of bias, and performed data entry. The primary outcomes were mortality, serious adverse events, cardiovascular events, and cardiovascular mortality. Secondary outcomes were withdrawals due to drug-related adverse effects, reaching blood pressure control (as defined in each trial), and blood pressure change from baseline. Analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle. We summarised data on dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

This update included one new study in which a subgroup of participants met our inclusion criteria. As none of the four included studies focused solely on people initiating antihypertensive treatment, we asked investigators for data for this subgroup. One study (PREVER-treatment 2016) used a combination of thiazide-type diuretic/potassium-sparing diuretic; as the former is not indicated in monotherapy, we analysed this study separately. The three original trials in the main comparison (monotherapy: 335 participants; combination therapy: 233 participants) included outpatients, mostly European and white people. Two trials only included people with type 2 diabetes; the remaining trial excluded people treated with diabetes, hypocholesterolaemia, or cardiovascular drugs. The follow-up was 12 months in two trials and 36 months in one trial. It is very uncertain whether combination therapy versus monotherapy reduces total mortality (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 21.72), cardiovascular mortality (zero events reported), cardiovascular events (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.22 to 4.41), serious adverse events (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.92), or withdrawals due to adverse effects (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.35); all outcomes had 568 participants, and the evidence was rated as of very low certainty due to serious imprecision and for using a subgroup that was not defined in advance. The confidence intervals were extremely wide for all important outcomes and included both appreciable harm and benefit. The PREVER-treatment 2016 trial, which used a combination therapy with potassium-sparing diuretic (monotherapy: 84 participants; combination therapy: 116 participants), included outpatients. This trial was conducted in Brazil and had a follow-up of 18 months. The number of events was very low and confidence intervals very wide, with zero events reported for cardiovascular mortality and withdrawals due to adverse events. It is very uncertain if there are differences in clinical outcomes between monotherapy and combination therapy in this trial.

Authors' Conclusions

The numbers of included participants, and hence the number of events, were too small to draw any conclusion about the relative efficacy of monotherapy versus combination therapy as initial treatment for primary hypertension. There is a need for large clinical trials that address the review question and report clinically relevant endpoints.

### Starting antihypertensive drug treatment with combination therapy: controversies in hypertension-con side of the argument [^11255D96]. Hypertension (2021). Medium credibility.

Tailoring Antihypertensive Treatment

In the early 1970s, Laragh's group coined the terms low-renin, normal-renin, and high-renin hypertension by relating plasma renin activity to the daily sodium excretion. Under normal conditions, plasma renin activity increases with sodium restriction but decreases with higher BP. Although an imperfect generalization, low-renin hypertension is characterized by volume expansion and its high-renin counterpart by increased peripheral resistance, and are indications to start BP-lowering treatment with a diuretic as opposed to an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system or vasodilator. The activity of the renin system decreases with advancing ageand is lower in Blacks compared with Whites. – These pathophysiological principles explain why guidelines, with the exception of the 2018 Europeanand the 2020 Internationalguidelines recommend to start antihypertensive drug treatment with ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors or ARBs below age 55 and with thiazide diuretics (TDs) or dihydropyridine CCBs (calcium-channel blockers) in older patients and in Blacks across the adult age range. Isolated systolic hypertension, which in its initial course is not associated with increased peripheral resistance, but is caused by stiffening of the large arteriesis an indication for TDsor CCBs. The 2020 International Society of Hypertension guidelinesupported the use of thiazide-like diuretics, that is, indapamide and chlorthalidone, rather than regular TDs (chlorothiazide and hydrochlorothiazide), based on a systematic review of 19 randomized clinical trials involving 112 113 patients. The observed benefits were mainly confined to thiazide-like diuretics rather than TDs with reductions in the risk of cardiac events (odds ratio, 0.78; P < 0.001), heart failure (odds ratio, 0.57; P < 0.001), and stroke (odds ratio, 0.82; P = 0.016).

ACE inhibitors not only inhibit the generation of active angiotensin II, but also the inactivation of the vasodilator bradykinin, explaining their higher potency compared with ARBs and direct renin inhibitors and the recommendation to prescribe ARBs only in ACE inhibitor-intolerant patients. The involvement of sympathetic drive and the renin-angiotensin system in the cardiovascular and renal complications of hypertension and its comorbidities clarifies why guidelines – unanimously recommend the use ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, and βBs (beta-blockers), ACE inhibitors, and ARBs in secondary prevention.

### A review of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in black patients with hypertension [^115wLCZt]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To review current guidelines and recent data evaluating the efficacy and safety of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in black hypertensive patients.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating race-specific outcomes in hypertension were gathered using a MEDLINE search with keywords black, African American, ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin system, and hypertension. Studies published from 2000 through April 2018 were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Six guidelines, 8 monotherapy publications, and 5 combination therapy publications included race-specific results and were included in the review. The authors individually compared and contrasted the results from each publication.

Data Synthesis

Numerous monotherapy trials indicate that black patients may have a reduced blood pressure (BP) response with ACE inhibitors or ARBs compared with white patients. Conversely, additional studies propose that race may not be the primary predictor of BP response. Reduced efficacy is not observed in trials involving combination therapy. Some studies suggest increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality with ACE inhibitor or ARB monotherapy in black patients; however, data are conflicting. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This article clarifies vague guideline statements and informs clinicians on the appropriate use of ACE inhibitors or ARBs for hypertension treatment in black patients through an in-depth look into the evidence.

Conclusions

Potentially reduced efficacy and limited outcomes data indicate that ACE inhibitors or ARBs should not routinely be initiated as monotherapy in black hypertensive patients. Use in combination with a calcium channel blocker or thiazide diuretic is efficacious in black patients, and there are no data showing that this increases or decreases cardiovascular or cerebrovascular outcomes.

### Hypertension in black people: pathophysiology and therapeutic aspects [^1125wTe8]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2002). Low credibility.

Salt sensitivity is regarded as an important contributor to the higher risk of hypertension in black people as compared with whites. This finding is in agreement with a better response to diuretics than to monotherapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in black subjects. It is important to remember that the hypotensive effect of ACE inhibitor is augmented in patients on a thiazide diuretic. Moreover, the antihypertensive response to a specific drug varies among black patients. Thus, ACE inhibitors should also be viewed as important options to treat hypertensive black subjects. Results from clinical trials support an emphasis on lifestyle modification and a more intensive blood pressure lowering by pharmacological interventions to reduce the large black-white gap in cardiovascular events and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) attributed to hypertension.

### Blood pressure guidelines-where are we now? [^115pucha]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

In June 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) updated its recommendations on the management of patients with hypertension (published in 2004), in light of "significant new data" relating to drug treatment.1,2 The update, published in collaboration with the British Hypertension Society (BHS), recommended first-line use of a calcium-channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic in patients aged over 55 years or an ACE inhibitor in those aged under 55 years, and advised that beta-blockers should no longer be used for routine initial therapy.1 Recently published data from England suggest that primary care prescribing has changed in line with this new guideline.3 However, interpretation of the evidence that underpins some of the key recommendations is open to debate, particularly as there are differences from some other major guidelines in the recommendations for first-line therapy. Here we consider the updated NICE guideline, the rationale for its treatment recommendations, and the subsequent change in clinical practice. In particular, we focus on the initial drug management of adults without conditions such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease that would in themselves be a key determinant of management.

### Difference in blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitor monotherapy between black and white adults with arterial hypertension: a meta-analysis of 13 clinical trials [^1131p2ZY]. BMC Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Among African-Americans adults, arterial hypertension is both more prevalent and associated with more complications than among white adults. Hypertension is also epidemic among black adults in sub-Saharan Africa. The treatment of hypertension among black adults may be complicated by lesser response to certain classes of anti-hypertensive agents.

Methods

We systematically searched literature for clinical trials of ACE-inhibitors among hypertensive adults comparing blood pressure response between whites and blacks. Meta-analysis was performed to determine the difference in systolic and diastolic blood pressure response. Further analysis including meta-regressions, funnel plots, and one-study-removed analyses were performed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity or bias.

Results

In a meta-analysis of 13 trials providing 17 different patient groups for evaluation, black race was associated with a lesser reduction in systolic (mean difference: 4.6 mmHg (95% CI 3.5–5.7)) and diastolic (mean difference: 2.8 mmHg (95% CI 2.2–3.5)) blood pressure response to ACE-inhibitors, with little heterogeneity. Meta-regression revealed only ACE-inhibitor dosage as a significant source of heterogeneity. There was little evidence of publication bias.

Conclusions

Black race is consistently associated with a clinically significant lesser reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure to ACE-inhibitor therapy in clinical trials in the USA and Europe. In black adults requiring monotherapy for uncomplicated hypertension, drugs other than ACE-inhibitors may be preferred, though the proven benefits of ACE-inhibitors in some sub-groups and the large overlap of response between blacks and whites must be remembered. These data are particularly important for interpretation of clinical drug trials for hypertensive black adults in sub-Saharan Africa and for the development of treatment recommendations in this population.

VA/DoD hypertension — initiate drug therapy: For the general population, recommend one or more of thiazide-type diuretics, ACEIs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) or ARBs (angiotensin II receptor blockers), and long-acting CCBs (calcium channel blockers); for patients unlikely to achieve goal with monotherapy (e.g., patients with SBP/DBP of > 20/10 mm Hg above goal), consider initiating treatment with combination therapy or monotherapy with close follow-up for titration and/or addition of medications based on blood pressure response. For specific populations, For patients age 65 and over, we suggest a thiazide-type diuretic for reduction in composite cardiovascular outcomes, and For African American patients, we recommend against using ACEIs or ARBs as monotherapy; for patients with CKD, For patients with CKD, see the VA/DoD CKD CPG. Additionally, We recommend against more than one of the following three drug classes together in the same patient: ACEIs, ARBs, or direct renin inhibitors.

### Which drug should be used to treat patients with uncomplicated essential hypertension? [^113Q8d68]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To review recent data and guidelines on selecting the initial antihypertensive drug.

Recent Findings

The main driver of benefit from blood pressure-lowering therapy is blood pressure reduction, and there is little evidence supporting additional drug class-specific benefits in primary prevention of major cardiovascular outcomes. The results also confirm that in the patient with uncomplicated hypertension as well as in those patients with diabetes without nephropathy, initial therapy with 'newer therapies' (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin receptor blockers) are effective, but not more effective than thiazide diuretics, at reducing stroke, coronary heart disease, morbidity or mortality, or all-cause mortality.

Summary

While compelling indications may exist for specific drug classes in those with specific target organ damage (i.e. heart failure, renal insufficiency, and coronary artery disease), thiazide diuretics remain unsurpassed in lowering blood pressure and in preventing hypertension-related clinical outcomes. Despite a more favorable metabolic profile, alpha-blockers are less effective in preventing cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure and stroke. Calcium channel blockers produce a similar reduction in blood pressure and cardiovascular disease outcomes compared with thiazide-type diuretics, although they are consistently less effective in preventing heart failure. In the absence of heart failure or renal disease, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have shown little advantage in clinical trials over diuretics in preventing cardiovascular disease and are not indicated as an initial therapy in Blacks.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Choice of initial monotherapy versus initial combination therapy — stage-based recommendations are: In adults with stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg), initiation of antihypertensive drug therapy with 2 first-line agents of different classes, ideally in a single-pill combination (SPC), is recommended (1 B-R). In adults with stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–139 mm Hg and DBP 80–89 mm Hg), initiation with a single first-line antihypertensive drug is reasonable, with dosage titration and sequential addition of other agents as needed to achieve BP control (2a C-EO). In adults with hypertension, simultaneous use of an ACEi, ARB, and/or renin inhibitor in combination is not recommended due to the potential for harm (3: Harm A). Pharmacologically, most patients require ≥ 2 antihypertensive medications to achieve BP control.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^111ZK52c]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

High blood pressure, or hypertension, affects more than one in four adults globally and is a major modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality. Internationally, guideline based approaches to pharmacotherapy for hypertension have been adopted to simplify clinical practice and improve blood pressure control. Although some evidence suggests that the effectiveness of drug treatment for hypertension does not differ across the general population, guideline recommendations hinge on the understanding that the effect of these drugs differs among specific subpopulations.

In the United Kingdom (UK), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/ARB) as first line treatment for hypertension in people younger than 55, and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for people without diabetes aged 55 and older, replacing CCB with thiazides for those with drug intolerance. The presence of an age based recommendation is unique among major international guidelines for hypertension treatment, and is based on differences in the activity of the renin-angiotensin system with age. Since this threshold was introduced in the first iteration of NICE hypertension guidance in 2004, the evidence base for hypertension treatment in older age, including the use and safety of ACEI/ARB drugs in older populations has evolved.

Furthermore, in NICE guidelines, use of CCB or thiazides is recommended as first line treatment for black people of African or Caribbean ethnic origin (referred to in this article as black people to reflect diversity). The same drugs are recommended, after consideration of comorbidities, in international guidelines. The pathophysiology of hypertension in this population has been thought to differ importantly from people of white heritage; lower levels of renin result in a reduced response to hypertension drugs that block the renin-angiotensin system such as ACEI/ARB. However, treatment recommendations based on historical categorisations of ethnicity have recently been criticised, because ethnicity can be considered a social construct rather than a biological one, and the proportion of people with mixed ethnic heritage has increased.

Contemporary routine care is characterised by an increasingly older, more ethnically diverse and multi-morbid population. For people initiating hypertension drugs, it is not known whether current age and ethnicity based treatment recommendations translate to greater blood pressure reductions in these settings.

### First line drug treatment for hypertension and reductions in blood pressure according to age and ethnicity: cohort study in UK primary care [^113yYxy4]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data

We conducted a cohort study using the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD-GOLD) linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. CPRD-GOLD is a nationally representative repository of prospectively collected, anonymised electronic health records from primary care in the UK, which has been extensively validated. It holds data on demographic information, health related behaviours, test results including blood pressure measurements, diagnoses, and prescriptions for more than 11 million people. The Hospital Episodes Statistics database records all hospital admissions for patients covered by the UK's health service who receive treatment from either English NHS trusts or independent providers. Almost 60% of general practices included in CPRD-GOLD are linked to Hospital Episodes Statistics. We used linked data in this study to improve completeness of ethnicity recording.

Cohort entry

We identified new users of hypertension drugs (CCB, ACEI/ARB, and thiazides), defined as people who had a prescription for one of these drugs in the study period (1 January 2007 to 31 December 2017), with no previous use of these drugs in the preceding year. People entered the cohort (index date) on the date of the first prescription. People were eligible for inclusion from the latest of the following: study start date (1 January 2007), one year after general practice registration (to allow time for recording of covariates in the general practice record), the date when the general practices' data recording processes were considered of adequate standard to be included in CPRD-GOLD, or the person's 18th birthday. People remained in the cohort until the earliest of the following: end of the study period (31 December 2017), last data collection from the general practice, date of leaving the general practice, or death.

Exclusion

We sought to study the association between first line drug treatment for hypertension and blood pressure solely in those individuals treated for hypertension. Therefore, we excluded people who initiated any of the study drugs without recorded blood pressure measurements in the year before cohort entry, and those whose blood pressure was at target or lower (< 140/90 mm Hg, according to current NICE guidelines). We also excluded people who initiated more than one hypertension drug on the index date, as well as those with diabetes at baseline (because current NICE guidance recommends ACEI/ARB as first line hypertension treatment for all people with diabetes). Additionally, because ethnicity was a stratifying factor, we excluded people whose ethnicity was not determinable even after data linkage.

### Combination therapy versus monotherapy as initial treatment for stage 2 hypertension: a prespecified subgroup analysis of a community-based, randomized, open-label trial [^115nvs2k]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines suggest consideration of initial combination therapy for patients with stage 2 hypertension, but rates of hypertension treatment and control in clinical practice vary according to age, race, sex, and body mass index (BMI).

Objective

This was a prespecified subgroup analysis of one of the primary efficacy end points-mean change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 6 weeks -in a previously published community-based, randomized, open-label trial comparing valsartan monotherapy with valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) combination therapy as initial treatment for high-risk patients with stage 2 hypertension.

Methods

Eligible participants with stage 2 hypertension (SBP ≥ 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure [DBP] ≥ 100 mm Hg) were treated with valsartan 160 mg/d or valsartan/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg/d for 2 weeks, followed by forced titration to valsartan 320 mg/d or valsartan/HCTZ 320/12.5 mg/d for an additional 4 weeks. In addition to the primary blood pressure end point (change in SBP at 6 weeks), secondary blood pressure end points at 6 weeks included changes in DBP and the proportion of patients achieving a blood pressure control threshold of < 140/90 mm Hg (< 130/80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes), as recommended by the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7). The subgroups of interest were women, blacks, Hispanics, the elderly (age ≥ 65 years), patients with diabetes, smokers, and lean, overweight, and obese subjects (BMI < 25, 25- < 30, and = 30 kg/m(2), respectively).

Results

The randomized trial included 1668 patients (756 [45.3%] female, 392 [23.5%] black, 109 [6.5%] Hispanic, 220 [13.2%] elderly, 970 of 1641 [59.1%] obese, 166 [10.0%] with diabetes, 467 [28.0%] smokers) with stage 2 hypertension. Among those allocated to combination therapy compared with monotherapy, the mean (SD) change in SBP at 6 weeks was -27.4 (18.5) and -19.3 (17.7) mm Hg in women, -21.4 (17.6) and -12.6 (18.5) mm Hg in black subjects, -21.7 (17.6) and -16.3 (16.5) mm Hg in Hispanic subjects, -25.5 (20.2) and -16.9 (17.9) mm Hg in the elderly, and -23.6 (18.1) and -15.9 (16.2) mm Hg in obese subjects. With the exception of the results for Hispanics, all comparisons of combination therapy and monotherapy were statistically significant (P ≤ 0.01). A higher proportion of those receiving valsartan/ HCTZ compared with valsartan monotherapy reached the JNC 7-defined blood pressure goal (44.5% vs 29.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). This pattern was seen consistently in most subgroups analyzed, including men (41.8% vs 27.9%; P < 0.001), women (47.8% vs 30.5%; P < 0.001), white subjects (46.4% vs 33.8%; P < 0.001), black subjects (41.8% vs 19.1%; P < 0.001), those aged < 65 years (44.6% vs 29.7%; P < 0.001), those aged ≥ 65 years (43.9% vs 24.5%; P = 0.004), overweight subjects (49.0% vs 31.2%; P < 0.001), and obese subjects (41.4% vs 26.0%; P < 0.001). In the entire study cohort, patients assigned to combination therapy had a significantly higher incidence of dizziness compared with those assigned to monotherapy (8.5% vs 4.7%; P = 0.002); however, there was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of adverse events between treatment groups in the prespecified subgroups.

Conclusions

Across various subgroups of patients with stage 2 hypertension, combination therapy was consistently associated with a significantly greater reduction in SBP than monotherapy. With the exception of a significantly greater increase in dizziness compared with monotherapy, combination therapy was well tolerated.

### Hypertension in sub-saharan Africa: burden, barriers and priorities for improving treatment outcomes [^116P58PY]. Circulation Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The burden of hypertension is rising rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), posing significant health challenges and economic costs that hinder national development. Despite being well-studied in clinical medicine, the detection, treatment, and control of hypertension in SSA remain inadequate. This is due to barriers across the care continuum, including individual-, provider-, and system-level obstacles within the health system. A critical issue is the lack of contextualized mechanistic research to understand the mechanisms, phenotypes, and treatment responses in native SSA populations. Current treatment approaches are often based on data from diaspora Africans, particularly African Americans. Consequently, most guidelines do not recommend angiotensin system drugs as first-line agents for Black patients, a stance that should be reconsidered given some evidence of their effectiveness in native SSA populations. Addressing these barriers requires a comprehensive, multisectoral strategy that includes both preventative and clinical measures at the population and individual levels. Preventative approaches should encompass health and nutrition education, improving food supply quality, and implementing comprehensive transportation and environmental policies. In addition, strategies should be developed to increase the detection of undiagnosed cases through enhanced screening and treatment access to those not receiving care, and revisit current treatment approaches to ensure that they are more tailored to the specific populations and settings. In conclusion, innovative strategies are needed to identify and overcome barriers to hypertension diagnosis and management. A coordinated, multisectoral approach that includes a contextualized mechanistic research agenda, as well as task shifting and task sharing, will help prevent and reduce hypertension in SSA.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^1137KQLo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Among 15 health care institutions across the United States, we evaluated trends of antihypertensive prescriptions using electronic health records and found an increasing trend of monotherapy (35% higher [95% CI, 32%–38%] in 2019 compared with 2010). We also observed decreasing trends of polytherapy and FDC. We observed a higher probability of uncontrolled BP and receipt of polytherapy and FDC among Black patients compared with White patients. Consistent with recommendations by the JNC 8, the use of beta blockers decreased after 2014, and the use of CCB among Black patients increased after 2014. In contrast to the recommended guideline, the use of thiazide diuretics decreased among Black patients. Despite the recommendations by the American Society of Hypertension and ACC/AHA, the use of FDC and dual therapy among patients with elevated BP declined after 2017.

### Trends of antihypertensive prescription among US adults from 2010 to 2019 and changes following treatment guidelines: analysis of multicenter electronic health records [^116v4ysb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the use of antihypertensives changed in 2014 and 2017. To understand the effect of these guidelines, we examined trends in antihypertensive prescriptions in the United States from 2010 to 2019 using a repeated cross-sectional design.

Methods and Results

Using electronic health records from 15 health care institutions for adults (20–85years old) who had ≥ 1 antihypertensive prescription, we assessed whether (1) prescriptions of beta blockers decreased after the 2014 Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) report discouraged use for first-line treatment, (2) prescriptions for calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics increased among Black patients after the JNC 8 report encouraged use as first-line therapy, and (3) prescriptions for dual therapy and fixed-dose combination among patients with blood pressure ≥ 140/90mmHg increased after recommendations in the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. The study included 1074314 patients with 2133158 prescription episodes. After publication of the JNC 8 report, prescriptions for beta blockers decreased (3% lower in 2018–2019 compared to 2010–2014), and calcium channel blockers increased among Black patients (20% higher in 2015–2017 and 41% higher in 2018–2019, compared to 2010–2014), in accordance with guideline recommendations. However, contrary to guidelines, dual therapy and fixed-dose combination decreased after publication of the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines (9% and 11% decrease in 2018–2019 for dual therapy and fixed-dose combination, respectively, compared to 2015–2017), and thiazide diuretics decreased among Black patients after the JNC 8 report (6% lower in 2018–2019 compared to 2010–2014).

Conclusions

Adherence to guidelines on prescribing antihypertensive medication was inconsistent, presenting an opportunity for interventions to achieve better blood pressure control in the US population.

### The use of single-pill combinations as first-line treatment for hypertension: translating guidelines into clinical practice [^115XyoWN]. Journal of Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2008 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines recommend the first-line prescription of two antihypertensive drugs in single-pill combinations (SPCs), also known as fixed-dose combinations, for the treatment of most patients with hypertension. This recommendation is based on a large amount of data, which shows that first-line treatment with SPCs supports reaching blood pressure targets rapidly and reducing cardiovascular outcome risk while keeping the therapeutic strategies as simple as possible and fostering adherence and persistence. As this approach constitutes a big shift from the stepped-care approaches that have been dominant for many years, practicing physicians have expressed concerns about using SPCs as first-line agents. In this review, we will discuss the barriers to the uptake of this recommendation. We will also offer suggestions to reduce the impact of these barriers and address specific concerns that have been raised.
