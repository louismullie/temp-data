## Question

What is the management of asymptomatic urinary tract infection in males?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of asymptomatic urinary tract infection in males. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining asymptomatic bacteriuria and confirming diagnostic thresholds in men. Then, I should verify the overarching principle of when to treat versus not treat. Next, I will examine the two exceptions where treatment is indicated. After that, I need to review special populations where treatment is not indicated despite higher prevalence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision algorithm and highlight stewardship and safety considerations, making sure I double-check each claim against guideline-grade sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and diagnostic criteria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is the presence of at least 10^5 CFU/mL of one or more bacterial species in a properly collected urine specimen in a patient without localizing genitourinary symptoms or systemic signs attributable to a urinary tract infection; in men, a single positive specimen suffices, whereas in women, persistence is typically confirmed with two positive specimens obtained within two weeks, and pyuria alone does not convert ASB into a UTI, so I need to ensure I am not overcalling infection based on WBCs alone [^1172Rvx7] [^115cn9bG] [^113Ww9GY].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the core principle before listing exceptions. The default, evidence-based approach is to avoid screening for and treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in most nonpregnant adults, including men, because treatment does not reduce subsequent symptomatic UTI, may increase short-term UTI risk, and causes harm such as C. difficile infection and antimicrobial resistance; this is a strong recommendation across IDSA and aligned statements from AGS and Choosing Wisely, so I need to anchor on nontreatment unless a clear exception applies [^113GFY7m] [^112hLfCm] [^114drgDM] [^112ACxBu].

> Now, I will examine the first exception where treatment is indicated. Before endoscopic urologic procedures that breach mucosa and carry a risk of bleeding — such as TURP, TURBT, ureteroscopy, or percutaneous stone surgery — screening for and treating ASB reduces postoperative infectious complications; I should confirm that the regimen is short and timed, ideally 1–2 doses given 30–60 minutes preoperatively, with culture-directed therapy preferred when available, and I should double-check that this applies to mucosal-trauma procedures rather than all urologic procedures [^1137PKjR] [^11666rwx] [^114THHTQ].

> Wait, let me verify the second exception. In pregnancy, screening and treating ASB is recommended to reduce pyelonephritis and adverse obstetric outcomes; however, the question here is about males, so pregnancy is not applicable to this case, but I should acknowledge it as the other universally accepted indication so I do not omit it from the general framework of exceptions [^113nqUSu] [^116pPSDe].

> Next, I should review special populations where treatment is not indicated despite higher prevalence. In men with diabetes, IDSA recommends against screening or treating ASB because randomized data show no reduction in symptomatic UTI and higher adverse effects with therapy; I initially thought diabetes might be an exception, but wait, I should correct that — IDSA explicitly advises against treatment in diabetes, and the recommendation for men is inferred from studies primarily in women, with consistent harm signals from antimicrobials [^113eBoEC] [^114SU4wm]. In spinal cord injury, treatment of ASB increases recurrence with more resistant organisms and does not reduce symptomatic UTI, so I should avoid treating ASB there as well [^1166Vvbp] [^114fWK1J]. For men with indwelling catheters, screening and treatment of ASB are not recommended because biofilm-associated bacteriuria rapidly recurs and treatment selects for resistance; I need to ensure I do not conflate catheter-associated UTI with ASB in this context [^116frRvS] [^113j8aEa]. In older men, including those in long-term care, treatment of ASB does not improve mortality, incontinence, or subsequent UTI, and delirium without localizing symptoms should prompt evaluation for other causes rather than antibiotics for bacteriuria [^111s8y5Z] [^117VPowJ]. For men undergoing artificial urinary sphincter or penile prosthesis implantation, IDSA suggests not screening or treating ASB preoperatively, as standard perioperative prophylaxis suffices and device infections are rarely due to preoperative ASB organisms; I should confirm that this is a weak recommendation but aligns with observational data [^116iyZxz] [^114L2fM6].

> I need to ensure I address a common pitfall. Pyuria accompanying ASB, especially in catheterized patients, should not be interpreted as an indication for antimicrobial therapy; I should double-check that this principle is consistent across IDSA catheter-associated UTI guidance to avoid overtreatment driven by WBCs alone [^111qu7BB] [^116MGqhD].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision pathway. First, confirm the absence of urinary symptoms and systemic signs attributable to UTI; if symptoms are present, manage as symptomatic UTI rather than ASB. Second, if the patient is a man without symptoms, do not screen for ASB in routine care. Third, if ASB is incidentally discovered, do not treat except for two scenarios: before mucosal-trauma endoscopic urologic procedures, where 1–2 preoperative doses are recommended, and in pregnancy, which does not apply to men. Fourth, in special populations such as diabetes, spinal cord injury, catheterized patients, older adults, or those undergoing prosthetic device surgery, maintain a nontreatment stance and focus on stewardship and alternative explanations for nonspecific symptoms [^113GFY7m] [^1137PKjR] [^112hLfCm].

> But wait, what if someone argues for treatment to prevent future UTI or complications? I should double-check the harm data. Treatment of ASB increases adverse drug events, C. difficile, and resistance, and in some studies increased short-term symptomatic UTI; from a societal perspective, avoiding unnecessary antibiotics for ASB is preferred, reinforcing the default position of no treatment outside the two exceptions [^11183VFt] [^115K3ua3] [^111gDBjm].

> Finally, I should confirm stewardship and safety pearls. Educate teams to avoid urine cultures in asymptomatic men, to distinguish ASB from CAUTI in catheterized patients, and to use single-dose or very short-course prophylaxis only when indicated for mucosal-trauma procedures; these steps reduce low-value care and resistance without compromising outcomes [^112ACxBu] [^112hWfHk] [^114NonCc].

Do not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in men unless they are **pregnant** (not applicable) or **about to undergo urologic procedures involving mucosal trauma** [^1137PKjR] [^11666rwx]. ASB is common in older men [^1172pEaw] and those with urinary devices, but treatment does not improve outcomes and increases harm from adverse effects and resistance [^11183VFt] [^111gDBjm]. Reserve antibiotics for **symptomatic UTI** or for **pre-procedural prophylaxis** in mucosal-trauma procedures [^11653GoY]; avoid screening or treating otherwise [^113GFY7m].

---

## Definition and prevalence

ASB is defined as ≥ 10^5 CFU/mL of bacteria in a voided urine specimen without urinary symptoms [^1172Rvx7] [^115cn9bG]. Prevalence in community-dwelling men aged ≥ 70 years is **3.6–19%**, and in long-term care it is **15–40%** [^116iyZxz].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

Multiple high-quality guidelines consistently recommend **against screening or treating ASB** in men:

- **IDSA 2019**: Strong recommendation against screening or treating ASB in nonpregnant adults, including men, except before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^112hLfCm] [^1137PKjR].

- **AUA/CUA/SUFU 2019**: Do not treat ASB in nonpregnant patients not undergoing invasive urinary procedures [^113ZF5em].

- **USPTF 2019**: No evidence supports screening or treating ASB in nonpregnant adults, including men [^114Fbwkb].

---

## Risks associated with treatment

Treating ASB in men carries **significant risks**:

- **Adverse drug effects**: Higher incidence with antibiotics [^11183VFt] [^114SU4wm].

- **Antimicrobial resistance**: Treatment promotes resistance, complicating future infections [^111gDBjm] [^11183VFt].

- **Clostridioides difficile infection**: Increased risk with unnecessary antibiotics [^111gDBjm] [^112Qjg1m].

- **No clinical benefit**: Treatment does not reduce symptomatic UTI, mortality, or other adverse outcomes [^11183VFt] [^1135Vqiz].

---

## Exceptions: when to treat ASB in men

Treatment is indicated only in **two scenarios**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Pregnancy | Not applicable to men |
| Urologic procedures with mucosal trauma (e.g. TURP, TURBT, ureteroscopy, percutaneous stone surgery) | - Screen and treat ASB before procedure [^1137PKjR] <br/> - Short-course (1–2 doses) antibiotics 30–60 minutes pre-op [^11666rwx] |

---

## Diagnostic criteria

ASB in men is diagnosed by a **single urine specimen** with ≥ 10^5 CFU/mL of bacteria and no urinary symptoms [^1172Rvx7].

---

## Clinical outcomes of untreated ASB

Untreated ASB in men **does not increase** the risk of symptomatic UTI, renal impairment, or mortality [^notfound]. It is a benign condition that **does not warrant intervention** [^113GFY7m].

---

## Special populations

Certain populations have a higher prevalence of ASB, but treatment remains **not indicated**:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Higher prevalence, but no benefit from treatment [^113eBoEC] [^114SU4wm].

- **Spinal cord injury**: High prevalence, but treatment increases resistance and adverse effects [^1172pEaw] [^114fWK1J].

- **Indwelling urinary catheters**: Universal bacteriuria; treatment ineffective and promotes resistance [^115cj212] [^115wpVNC].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Do not screen or treat ASB**: In asymptomatic men, except before urologic procedures with mucosal trauma [^113GFY7m] [^1137PKjR].

- **Treat only symptomatic UTI**: Base treatment on clinical symptoms and culture results [^114xyRJP].

- **Use antibiotics judiciously**: To avoid adverse effects, resistance, and unnecessary costs [^111gDBjm] [^112ACxBu].

---

ASB in men is common but benign; **do not screen or treat** except before mucosal-trauma urologic procedures. Treating ASB causes harm without benefit, so reserve antibiotics for symptomatic infections.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is a common finding in many populations, including healthy women and persons with underlying urologic abnormalities. The 2005 guideline from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures. Treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The guideline did not address children and some adult populations, including patients with neutropenia, solid organ transplants, and nonurologic surgery. In the years since the publication of the guideline, further information relevant to ASB has become available. In addition, antimicrobial treatment of ASB has been recognized as an important contributor to inappropriate antimicrobial use, which promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance. The current guideline updates the recommendations of the 2005 guideline, includes new recommendations for populations not previously addressed, and, where relevant, addresses the interpretation of nonlocalizing clinical symptoms in populations with a high prevalence of ASB.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: when to screen and when to treat [^1135Vqiz]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common. Populations with structural or functional abnormalities of the genitourinary tract may have an exceedingly high prevalence of bacteriuria, but even healthy individuals frequently have positive urine cultures. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is seldom associated with adverse outcomes. Pregnant women and individuals who are to undergo traumatic genitourinary interventions are at risk for complications of bacteriuria and benefit from screening and treatment programs. Although screening is recommended for renal transplant recipients, the benefits for these patients are less clear. For other populations, including most bacteriuric individuals, negative outcomes attributable to asymptomatic bacteriuria have not been described. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in these patients is not beneficial and, in fact, may be associated with harmful outcomes, such as increased short-term frequency of symptomatic infection, adverse drug effects, and reinfection with organisms of increased antimicrobial resistance. Screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria and treatment is recommended for only selected groups where benefit has been shown. Many research questions still need to be addressed. Different populations have unique risk factors, and the benefits and risks of different management approaches for asymptomatic bacteriuria must continue to be addressed systematically in appropriate clinical trials.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1172Rvx7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) diagnostic definitions and specimen requirements — In patients without indwelling catheters, ASB is defined as ≥ 10^5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL in a voided urine specimen without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). For women, 2 consecutive specimens obtained preferably within 2 weeks are used to confirm persistence, and between 10% and 60% of women do not have persistent bacteriuria on repeat screening after an initial positive specimen. For men, a single urine specimen meeting these quantitative criteria is sufficient for diagnosis. In patients with indwelling devices, ≥ 10^3 CFU/mL remains the most appropriate diagnostic criteria for bladder bacteriuria, while lower quantitative counts (≥ 10^2 to < 10^5 CFU/mL) from "in and out" catheterization or after insertion of a new indwelling catheter suggest true bacteriuria, although the clinical significance of these lower counts in asymptomatic people has not been evaluated.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) guideline — definition and scope: ASB is defined as the presence of 1 or more species of bacteria in urine at specified counts (≥ 10^5 colony-forming units [CFU]/mL or ≥ 10^8 CFU/L), irrespective of pyuria, and without signs or symptoms attributable to urinary tract infection (UTI). The 2005 IDSA guideline recommended that ASB should be screened for and treated only in pregnant women or in an individual prior to undergoing invasive urologic procedures, and treatment was not recommended for healthy women; older women or men; or persons with diabetes, indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injury. The current guideline reviews and updates the 2005 guideline, and the recommendations also consider populations not addressed previously, such as children and patients with solid organ transplants or neutropenia, noting that antimicrobial stewardship programs have identified management of ASB as an important opportunity for decreasing inappropriate antimicrobial use.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria: prevalence, diagnosis, management, and current antimicrobial stewardship implementations [^111J6Dw2]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common clinical condition that often leads to unnecessary treatment. It has been shown that incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria increases with age and are more prominent in women than men. In older women, the incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recorded to be more than 15%. This number increased up to 50% for those who reside in long-term care facilities. In most scenarios, asymptomatic bacteriuria does not lead to urinary tract infections, and therefore, antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been shown to improve patient outcomes. In 2019, the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) updated its asymptomatic bacteriuria management guidelines, which emphasized on the risks and benefits of treating the condition. Women who are pregnant should be screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria in the first trimester and treated, if positive. Individuals who are undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures should be screened and treated appropriately for asymptomatic bacteriuria as well. Treating asymptomatic bacteriuria in individuals with diabetes, neutropenia, spinal cord injuries, indwelling urinary catheters, and so on has not been found to improve clinical outcomes. Furthermore, unnecessary treatment is often associated with unwanted consequences including but not limited to increased antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and increased health care cost. As a result, multiple antibiotic stewardship programs around the US have implemented protocols to appropriately reduce unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria. It is important to appropriately screen and treat asymptomatic bacteriuria only when there is evidence of potential benefit.

### Reducing treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria: what works? [^112hWfHk]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common, but usually benign. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria contributes to negative antimicrobial outcomes. Optimizing antimicrobial use for bacteriuria is a component of antimicrobial stewardship programs and includes key practices of dissemination and implementation of guidelines, laboratory practices which support stewardship, and programs to monitor and implement optimal antimicrobial treatment for urinary infection. These activities vary in their effectiveness, costs, and complexity to institute. Stewardship strategies targeting unique populations with a high prevalence of bacteriuria and for whom symptom assessment is not straightforward need to be further developed and evaluated to support optimal stewardship.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111gDBjm]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship considerations in asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) emphasize limiting unnecessary cultures and therapy; a positive urine culture often encourages antimicrobial use, and obtaining urine cultures when not clinically indicated promotes inappropriate antimicrobial use. Given the potential negative societal consequence of antimicrobial resistance, screening for bacteriuria and treatment of ASB should be discouraged unless there is evidence to support a benefit of treatment for a given population. Randomized studies across multiple groups found no benefit of antimicrobial treatment, while antimicrobials increased risks including antimicrobial resistance, Clostridioides difficile infection, and in some cases increased urinary tract infection shortly after therapy.

### Urinary tract infection in male patients: challenges in management [^112TE65A]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections in male patients share many of the management principles as used in the management of female patients, including the need to accurately define the clinical syndrome, choose empirical therapy based on the severity of illness and the potential for antimicrobial resistance, and consider the need for source control in severely ill patients. The microbiology of the causative organisms is more unpredictable compared to female patients, and data to inform treatment decisions from clinical trials specific to male patients are relatively scarce.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — urologic procedure recommendations state that in patients who will undergo endoscopic urologic procedures, we suggest that a urine culture be obtained prior to the procedure and targeted antimicrobial therapy prescribed, rather than empiric therapy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and in patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest short course (1 or 2 doses), rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), with the remark that antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria — older, functionally or cognitively impaired patients: In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and delirium (acute mental status change, confusion) and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). In older patients with functional and/or cognitive impairment with bacteriuria and without local genitourinary symptoms or other systemic signs of infection who experience a fall, we recommend assessment for other causes and careful observation rather than antimicrobial treatment of bacteriuria (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Values and preferences emphasize avoiding adverse outcomes of antimicrobial therapy such as CDI, increased antimicrobial resistance, or adverse drug effects when benefit is unproven. Remarks note that for a bacteriuric patient with fever and other systemic signs potentially consistent with a severe infection (sepsis) and without a localizing source, broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy directed against urinary and nonurinary sources should be initiated.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with diabetes — In patients with diabetes, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Remarks: The recommendation for nontreatment of men is inferred from observations in studies which have primarily enrolled women. In a randomized trial, antimicrobial treatment of ASB did not lead to a difference in rates of symptomatic UTI (40% vs 42% over the entire study period), and rates of pyelonephritis were not significantly different between antimicrobial and placebo groups (0.13 vs 0.28 per 100 patient-days; RR, 2.13 [95% CI, .81–5.62]); during the 6-week blinded portion, pyelonephritis was numerically higher with antimicrobials (8% vs 2%). Treatment-related adverse effects were more common with antimicrobials (18% vs 6%), and treated subjects received nearly 5 times more days of antimicrobial therapy; in prospective cohorts there were no between-group differences in symptomatic UTI, diabetic complications, or mortality, men with diabetes were included in only 1 cohort study with similar outcomes, and there is high-quality evidence that antimicrobials increase the risk of adverse effects.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in patients living with urological devices — guidance and rationale: No evidence identified through the systematic literature search addressed the treatment of ASB in patients living with previously implanted urological devices, and the consensus of the panel was that ASB should not be screened for or treated in patients living with urological devices. The panel noted that any additional benefit from screening and treating ASB would be negligible, bacterial species isolated from device infections are usually distinct from organisms isolated from ASB, and no evidence was identified that ASB in patients with a urological device in situ is a risk factor for urological device infection.

Urologic device implantation and patients living with devices — In patients planning to undergo surgery for artificial urine sphincter or penile prosthesis implantation, we suggest not screening for or treating asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence), and remarks state that all patients should receive standard perioperative prophylaxis prior to device implantation. In patients living with implanted urological devices, we suggest not screening for or treating ASB (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). The prevalence of ASB in older men is 3.6%–19% in the community and 15%–40% among residents of long-term care facilities; a review reported 45% of men undergoing AUS and 18% undergoing PP had preoperative ASB, and prosthetic device infection has been reported to occur in 1%–2% of AUS implants and 2%–8% of PP implants. The guideline identified only 1 publication assessing the role of ASB treatment prior to urological device implantation.

Recommendation strength and interpretation using GRADE — All recommendations follow GRADE and are either strong or weak. Recommendations are strong when there is moderate- or high-quality evidence that the desirable consequences outweigh the undesirable consequences for a course of action, and they may also be strong when there is high-quality evidence of harm and benefits are uncertain (ie, low or very low quality). Table 2 provides the suggested interpretation of strong and weak recommendations for patients, clinicians, and healthcare policy makers: for strong recommendations, all or almost all individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, all or almost all individuals should receive the intervention, and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations with adherence usable as a quality criterion or performance indicator; for weak (conditional) recommendations, most individuals would probably want the suggested course of action but many would not, clinicians should recognize that fully informed individuals might reasonably choose different courses of action and a shared decision-making process is typically useful to align with values and preferences, and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) values and preferences — The panel states that most patients would wish to receive antimicrobial therapy for ASB if benefits outweigh harms, but where treatment is unlikely to confer a benefit, risks including adverse drug effects, CDI, and antimicrobial resistance suggest most would not wish to receive antimicrobial treatment. From the societal perspective, avoidance of antimicrobial use where there is no benefit is preferred, and when the quality of evidence is low with no suggestion of potential harm, the panel "generally recommend against the treatment of ASB because of the high-quality evidence that antimicrobial therapy contributes to antimicrobial resistance". They also note costs are not offset by demonstrable benefits and that high-quality evidence shows no reduction in symptomatic UTI or other outcomes where there is no evidence of benefit with treatment of ASB.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114Fbwkb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in healthy nonpregnant women — screening and treatment recommendation: In healthy premenopausal, nonpregnant women or healthy postmenopausal women, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). The prevalence of ASB in healthy, premenopausal women ranges from 1% to 5%, and in healthy postmenopausal women in the community from 2.8% to 8.6%. While symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) occurs significantly more frequently in women with bacteriuria than in nonbacteriuric women, observational studies report no differences in rates of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, serum creatinine levels, abnormal intravenous pyelogram findings, or mortality in women with or without bacteriuria. Randomized data show there were no differences in the frequency of subsequent UTI during 1 year of follow-up after a 1-week course of nitrofurantoin versus placebo. Prior guideline conclusions were that healthy, premenopausal women with ASB have an increased risk for UTI, but no long-term adverse outcomes, and that treatment of ASB neither decreases the frequency of symptomatic infection nor prevents further episodes of ASB; similarly, the US Preventive Services Task Force stated that evidence does not support screening of nonpregnant women or men for ASB, as improved clinical outcomes cannot be demonstrated. A systematic review concluded antimicrobial treatment of ASB may improve short-term microbiologic outcomes, but resolution is not sustained and there is no measurable improvement in morbidity or mortality. Additional studies reported that during 15 months of follow-up there was no difference in symptomatic UTI and that ASB was not a predictor for symptomatic UTI, while a randomized trial found antimicrobial therapy was an independent risk factor for symptomatic UTI (hazard ratio, 3.09 [95% CI, 2.19–4.20]) with 1 episode of pyelonephritis in the untreated group and 2 in the treated group, noting a high proportion (33%) of Enterococcus species and that symptomatic episodes were not confirmed microbiologically.

Indwelling urinary catheter — management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in long-term care: Benefit of antimicrobial therapy for ASB while a catheter remains in situ is stated as uncertain and there is high-quality evidence of harm with increased antimicrobial resistance, so screening with urine cultures in catheterized patients or obtaining urine cultures for nonspecific symptoms should be discouraged. A prospective cohort study of prophylaxis to prevent ASB and urinary tract infection (UTI) in patients with long-term indwelling catheters reported no benefits, and a randomized bundle intervention was associated with a substantial decrease in screening and treatment for ASB in long-term care patients without an increase in symptomatic UTI.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria — general risk–benefit rationale outside pregnancy: Although women with ASB may also be at increased risk of symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), ASB, even when persistent, appears not to be associated with other adverse outcomes, and there is no evidence to suggest that episodes of symptomatic UTI are attributable to the ASB. Moreover, treatment of ASB may not decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI, including pyelonephritis, and antibiotics may increase rather than decrease the risk of subsequent UTI. There is high-quality evidence that antibiotics have an increased risk of adverse effects, that screening and treating ASB is extremely costly, and that the use of antibiotics promotes emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

We suggest obtaining a urine culture prior to the procedure and prescribing targeted antimicrobial therapy rather than empiric therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). In patients with ASB who will undergo a urologic procedure, we suggest a short course (1 or 2 doses) rather than more prolonged antimicrobial therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), and antimicrobial therapy should be initiated 30–60 minutes before the procedure.

### Management of asymptomatic bacteriuria in Non-catheterized adults [^113fEjAS]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Understanding the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is important given the prevalence of the condition, associated risks in certain patient populations, and the risks associated with inappropriate antibiotic administration. Generally, screening and treatment is only recommended in pregnant women and in those undergoing urologic procedures that will violate the urothelium. Knowing the appropriate time to screen and treat ASB is critical for managing high-risk patients and preventing the growth of antibiotic resistance. Recent research into the protective nature of avirulent strains of Escherichia coli might offer a new approach to management of ASB.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^1167qfpY]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a common finding. Inappropriate antimicrobial treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria has been identified as a major issue for antimicrobial stewardship programs. This review summarizes and evaluates recent studies which extend our knowledge of the occurrence, management, and outcomes of bacteriuria.

Recent Findings

The reported prevalence of bacteriuria is higher in some developing countries than generally reported for developed countries, but reasons for this remain unclear. Clinical studies of young women, renal transplant patients, and patients undergoing minor nontraumatic urologic procedures confirm that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria for these populations is not beneficial, and may be harmful. There is also no benefit for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria prior to orthopedic surgery to decrease postoperative surgical site infection. Studies continue to report substantial inappropriate antimicrobial use for treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

Summary

Recent publications confirm that asymptomatic bacteriuria is benign in most patients. Management strategies for pregnant women with recurrent bacteriuria require further clarification. There is a continuing problem with inappropriate treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and sustainable strategies to optimize antimicrobial use for this problem are needed.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in neutropenia — no recommendation for high-risk neutropenia; low-risk patients have very small infection risk. In patients with high-risk neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 100 cells/mm3), ≥ 7 days' duration following chemotherapy), we make no recommendation for or against screening for or treatment of ASB (knowledge gap). For patients with high-risk neutropenia managed with current standards of care, it is unclear how frequently ASB occurs and how often it progresses to symptomatic UTI. Patients with low-risk neutropenia (> 100 cells/mm3, ≤ 7 days, clinically stable) have only a very small risk of infection.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) with impaired voiding — asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) management: Recommendation — In patients with SCI, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Evidence summary highlights that subjects with SCI have a high prevalence of bacteriuria and a high incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI), and treatment of ASB is usually followed by early recurrence of bacteriuria with reinfecting strains more likely to be antimicrobial resistant. Trials in intermittently catheterized patients observed no differences in rates of symptomatic UTI between antimicrobial treatment/prophylaxis and placebo or no treatment. Multiple reviews and guidelines concluded that ASB should not be screened for or treated in SCI patients, and European Association of Urology guidance states screening for and treatment of ASB are not recommended. Some evidence suggests ASB might be protective and that treatment of ASB may be associated with an increased risk of symptomatic UTI; bacterial interference using nonpathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli 83972/HU2117) has been evaluated, with two RCTs in neurogenic bladders reporting protection against symptomatic UTI in small cohorts (20 and 27 patients, respectively). Clinical signs and symptoms of UTI in SCI may differ from the classic genitourinary symptoms experienced by patients with normal sensation.

### Urinary tract infections: core curriculum 2024 [^1137rWfo]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the most commonly encountered infections in clinical practice. Accurate diagnosis and evidence-based treatment of UTIs will lead to better clinical care for many patients and limit unnecessary antibiotic use. Urinalysis and urine cultures are helpful tools in the diagnosis of UTIs; however, it is important to recognize their limitations. Differentiating between asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) and true UTI is important because antibiotics are unnecessary in most nonpregnant patients with ASB and can even potentially cause harm if prescribed. Choice and duration of antibiotics varies across the spectrum of UTI syndromes such as acute uncomplicated cystitis, pyelonephritis, prostatitis, and catheter-associated UTIs. The treatment approach also depends on patients' degree of immunosuppression and their genitourinary anatomy. Therefore, patients with urological obstruction or kidney transplants may require a specialized and multidisciplinary management approach. For individuals prone to frequent UTIs, some preventative measures can be utilized, yet there is often not a "one size fits all" approach.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in older adults — "Don't use antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in older adults unless specific urinary tract symptoms are present". ASB prevalence increases with age: in community women age 65 to 90 it ranges from 6% to 16%, is highest in women age 90 and older at 22% to 43%, and in community men age 65 and older it ranges from 5% to 21%, with the highest prevalence in those age 90 and older; in institutionalized elderly, 25% to 50% of women and 15% to 35% of men have ASB. Antimicrobial therapy for ASB has no short- or long-term benefits for mortality, genitourinary symptoms, or subsequent symptomatic episodes and in acute-care settings causes adverse drug reactions and re-infection with more-resistant organisms; although in long-term-care facilities individuals with bacteriuria are at greater risk of symptomatic infection, this is not attributable to bacteriuria. Identifying symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) in frail or cognitively impaired elderly is often challenging, and the Society of Healthcare Epidemiology of America has published proposed criteria for initiation of antibiotics and surveillance definitions for nursing homes. For older adults with ASB undergoing traumatic genitourinary procedures with mucosal bleeding, antimicrobial treatment is supported in men undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate, and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria is recommended before urologic procedures for which mucosal bleeding is anticipated.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) after nonrenal solid organ transplant — do not screen or treat. In patients who have received a solid organ transplant other than a renal transplant, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). This recommendation places a high value on avoidance of antimicrobial use so as to limit the acquisition of antimicrobial-resistant organisms or Clostridioides difficile infection in SOT patients, who are at increased risk for these adverse outcomes. In nonrenal SOT recipients, symptomatic UTI is uncommon and adverse consequences of symptomatic UTI are extremely rare; the risk of complications from ASB is, therefore, probably negligible.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a significant cause of morbidity among older adults. However, antibiotic prescriptions for clinically suspected UTIs are often inappropriate. Health care providers frequently struggle to differentiate UTI from asymptomatic bacteriuria, particularly in patients presenting with nonspecific symptoms. Patients with baseline cognitive impairments that limit history-taking can be particularly challenging. This article reviews the epidemiology and pathogenesis of UTI in older adults. It discusses an approach to diagnosis and treatment focused on recognizing patients who would likely benefit from antibiotic treatment and on identifying patients for whom empiric antibiotic therapy should not be given.

IDSA 2019 asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — treatment before endourological procedures summarizes that two RCTs and two prospective nonrandomized studies enrolling a total of 570 patients with ASB compared antimicrobial treatment to no treatment before TURP or TURBT. In one trial of 192 patients, 43% in the treatment and 40% in the control groups had preoperative bacteriuria (≥ 10^7 CFU/L), bacteriuria was eliminated in 67% and 30%, respectively (P < .02) after 6 weeks, and none of the 26 patients in the cefotaxime group and 3 of the 23 (13%) in the control group developed postoperative upper UTI. In another randomized trial, preoperative bacteriuria (≥ 10^7 CFU/L) was present in 46 of 76 (61%), 34 of 75 (45%), and 38 of 71 (54%) across short course, prolonged course, and no treatment groups; ASB was eliminated postoperatively in 65.2%, 91.2% (P = .012), and 7.9%, respectively; there were no cases of postoperative bacteremia and only 1 patient with postoperative upper UTI in each of the ciprofloxacin groups, whereas the control group had four patients with bacteremia and four with upper UTI. Observational data report no episodes of bacteremia when appropriate antimicrobials were given 2–12 hours preoperatively versus 7 patients (6.15%) developing bacteremia without appropriate antimicrobials, and that postoperative bacteremia and fever occurred in 8 of 25 (32%) without appropriate antimicrobials with no postoperative septicemia.

Evidence-based guidelines state that asymptomatic bacteriuria is not a clinically significant condition in men and nonpregnant women and that treatment is unlikely to confer clinical benefit. We hypothesized that, among patients with indwelling catheters or condom collection systems, many who receive a diagnosis of and are treated for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) actually have asymptomatic bacteriuria and, therefore, that antibiotic therapy is inappropriate.

Methods

We reviewed all urine culture results at a veterans affairs medical center during a 3-month period. Cultures yielding 10(4) colony-forming units/mL were included if the urine had been collected from a hospitalized patient with an indwelling (Foley) catheter or a condom collection system. We applied standardized definitions to determine whether the episode represented catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CAABU) or CAUTI. Antibiotic therapy was considered appropriate for patients who met criteria for symptomatic UTI.

Results

Overall, 280 episodes met criteria for inclusion: 164 CAABU and 116 CAUTI. Of the 164 episodes of CAABU, 111 (68%) were managed appropriately (no treatment), whereas 53 (32%) were treated with antibiotics (inappropriate treatment). In multivariate analysis, older patient age, having predominantly gram-negative bacteriuria, and higher urine white blood cell count were significantly associated with inappropriate treatment of CAABU (P < .05, by logistic regression).

Conclusions

Better recognition of CAABU and the distinction between this condition and CAUTI, consistent with evidence-based guidelines, may play a key role in reducing unneeded antibiotic usage in hospitalized patients.

1 Introduction

With nearly half of women experiencing a urinary tract infection (UTI) in their lifetime, these infections are one of the leading reasons for antibiotic prescriptions in the United States and worldwide. Despite their clinical ubiquity, physicians exhibit significant variation in their approaches to the workup and treatment of uncomplicated UTIs that may not always follow clinical practice guidelines. Use of unvalidated approaches to the management of UTIs may lead to inaccurate diagnoses and inappropriate antibiotic treatments; prior studies demonstrate that 50%–70% of antibiotic prescriptions for UTI may be inappropriate, which contributes to worsening global rates of antibiotic resistance.

Current treatment guidelines from the American Urological Society (AUA), Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), and American Geriatrics Society (AGS) agree that UTI diagnosis should be based on clinical symptomology of urinary symptoms (e.g. dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, new incontinence in the absence of vaginal symptoms) associated with culture‐proven bacteriuria with a bacterial uropathogen. Rates of asymptomatic bacteriuria range from 1% to 5% in premenopausal women to 16% in older women in the community and as high as 50% for older women in long‐term care facilities, demonstrating why appropriate clinical symptoms are needed to diagnose a UTI.

Prior studies, however, have shown that among patients diagnosed with a UTI in the emergency room (ER), only 32% of adults and 17% of the oldest adults have urinary symptoms, demonstrating poor adherence to current clinical practice guidelines. Patients who have been inappropriately treated with antibiotics for a UTI (e.g. treating those with asymptomatic bacteriuria) have worse outcomes, which may include subsequent infections with multidrug‐resistant organisms or substantial medication side effects. Patients who have an inappropriate initial antibiotic prescription are also subjected to additional drug costs and are at risk of antibiotic switching which can cost up to $2000 more per patient.

Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of UTIs produce worse patient outcomes, increased healthcare costs, and higher societal antibiotic burden. The goals of our study were to evaluate the factors associated with inappropriate diagnosis and treatment of cystitis in the outpatient setting in a set of patients diagnosed with UTI without signs of bacteremia.

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^116Nr2Uk]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent urinary tract infection — episode timing and management considerations indicate that episodes do not need to be in the immediate six months preceding presentation, and that recurrence burden should guide prophylaxis; expectant management may be less appropriate than active prophylaxis in an individual who has received more than three to four therapeutic courses of antibiotics in the past year. Patients with a long culture-proven history at lower-than-definition frequency (two episodes within six months within the previous year) may also be appropriate to include under the rUTI umbrella, and patients consistently presenting with one to two symptomatic infections per year for multiple years will likely benefit from a more proactive management strategy similar to that for rUTI.

### Management of catheter-associated urinary tract infection [^1163a5cG]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim of this article is to review recent publications concerning the management of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), including the issues of diagnosis and prevention. Articles reviewed include the various guidelines concerning CAUTI released recently by multiple organizations.

Recent Findings

There has been a recent upsurge of interest in prevention of CAUTI and a proliferation of guidelines in this area. Social changes in US government reimbursement to hospitals and public reporting of hospital-acquired infections may underlie this interest. The awareness that CAUTI and catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria are distinct conditions is increasing, but unnecessary treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria remains quite prevalent. The focus in recent CAUTI literature is on prevention, often through strategies to minimize urinary catheter use. Very little new evidence is available to guide diagnosis and treatment strategies.

Summary

Interpretation of many studies of CAUTI is impeded by the failure to distinguish between symptomatic CAUTI and asymptomatic bacteriuria in the study outcomes. This distinction currently relies on clinical symptoms and is not easily made, even with the help of various guidelines. Many aspects of the management of CAUTI merit further study, and the current interest in CAUTI is likely to lead to exciting advances in this field.

### Promoting appropriate urine culture management to improve health care outcomes and the accuracy of catheter-associated urinary tract infections [^114NonCc]. American Journal of Infection Control (2017). Low credibility.

Published literature indicates that the unjustified ordering or improper collection of urine for urinalysis or culture from either catheterized patients or those without indwelling devices, or misinterpretation of positive results, often leads to adverse health care events, including increased financial burdens, overreporting of mandated catheter-associated urinary tract infection events, overtreatment of patients with antimicrobial agents, selection of multidrug-resistant organisms, and Clostridium difficile infection. Moreover, national guidelines that provide evidence-based direction on core processes that form the basis for subsequent clinical therapy decisions or surveillance interpretations; that is, the appropriate ordering and collection of urine for laboratory testing and the treatment of patients with symptomatic urinary tract infection, are not widely known or lack adherence. This article provides published evidence on the influence of inappropriate ordering of urine specimens and subsequent treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and associated adverse effects; reviews research on bacterial contamination and preservation; and delineates best practices in the collection, handling, and testing of urine specimens for culture or for biochemical analysis in both catheterized and noncatheterized patients. The goal is to provide infection preventionists (IPs) with a cohesive evidence-based framework that will assist them in facilitating the implementation of a urine culture management program that reduces patient harms, enhances the accuracy of catheter-associated urinary tract infection surveillance, improves antibiotic stewardship, and reduces costs.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113qk953]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Neutropenia and asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) — urinary source frequency and screening implications: With current management strategies for high-risk neutropenia patients, the urinary tract is an infrequent source for bacteremia. In a retrospective review of hospitalized febrile neutropenia, patients with ANC ≤ 1500 cells/mm3 within 4 weeks of chemotherapy had low urinary tract infection (UTI) rates, with only 2.8% overall, including 2.9% in those with ANC ≤ 100 cells/mm3, and only 1 of 109 had bacteremia from a urinary source. While no studies specifically address screening, screening for bacteriuria with specific antimicrobial treatment, if present, has not been reported to provide important additional benefits. Patients with low-risk neutropenia (< 7 days, clinically stable, ANC > 100 cells/mm3) have a lower risk of infection and are assumed to have risks similar to nonneutropenic populations.

### Proposing the "Continuum of UTI" for a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management of urinary tract infections [^116TBNh8]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Patients with suspected UTIs are categorized into 3 clinical phenotypes based on current guidelines: no UTI, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB), or UTI. However, all patients may not fit neatly into these groups. Our objective was to characterize clinical presentations of patients who receive urine tests using the "continuum of UTI" approach.

Materials and Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of a random sample of adult noncatheterized inpatient and emergency department encounters with paired urinalysis and urine cultures from 5 hospitals in 3 states between January 01, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Trained abstractors collected clinical (eg, symptom) and demographic data. A focus group discussion with multidisciplinary experts was conducted to define the continuum of UTI, a 5-level classification scheme that includes 2 new categories: lower urinary tract symptoms/other urologic symptoms and bacteriuria of unclear significance. The newly defined continuum of UTI categories were compared to the current UTI classification scheme.

Results

Of 220,531 encounters, 3392 randomly selected encounters were reviewed. Based on the current classification scheme, 32.1% (n = 704) had ASB and 53% (n = 1614) did not have a UTI. When applying the continuum of UTI categories, 68% of patients (n = 478) with ASB were reclassified as bacteriuria of unclear significance and 29% of patients (n = 467) with "no UTI" were reclassified to lower urinary tract symptoms/other urologic symptoms.

Conclusions

Our data suggest the need to reframe our conceptual model of UTI vs ASB to reflect the full spectrum of clinical presentations, acknowledge the diagnostic uncertainty faced by frontline clinicians, and promote a nuanced approach to diagnosis and management of UTIs.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115cj212]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Catheter-associated bacteriuria — evidence with short-term indwelling catheters: Biofilm formation along the indwelling catheter means all patients ultimately develop bacteriuria if the catheter remains in situ, with acquisition of bacteriuria 3%–5% per catheter day; antimicrobial therapy may delay but not prevent onset. Many individuals with short-term catheters (in place for < 30 days) do not develop bacteriuria because the catheter is removed prior to acquisition. In newly catheterized patients, 235 of 1497 (14.9%) developed bacteriuria (defined as ≥ 10^2 CFU/mL) at a mean of 6.4 ± 6.1 days; only 194 (7.7%) reported subjective symptoms and only 1 episode of bacteremia was considered probably attributable to bacteriuria. In a prospective randomized trial comparing silver coated with uncoated silicone catheters, 3036 patients with catheters in situ for ≥ 48 hours were enrolled; there were 334 (11%) UTIs, 16 with bacteremia (0.5% of catheters; 4.8% of bacteriuric patients). In a retrospective cohort of 444 episodes in 308 patients, 128 (41.6%) had catheter-associated UTI and 180 (58.4%) had ASB; only 3 episodes of bacteremia (0.7% of bacteriuric subjects) were directly attributable to bacteriuria, and > 90% of patients received antimicrobials within 30 days of the urine culture.

### Management of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections in the older adult [^112HusbM]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most frequent bacterial infections diagnosed in older adults and the most common reason for antibiotic prescriptions in nursing homes. Distinguishing between asymptomatic bacteriuria and UTI in older adults can be challenging and implementing a systematic approach to diagnosis using standard toolkits or algorithms is recommended for patients residing in post-acute and long-term care settings. This article reviews the pathophysiology, microbiology, diagnostic approach, treatment, and approaches to prophylaxis in the older adult.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of asymptomatic bacteriuria: 2019 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115cWeR4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Endoscopic urologic procedures — single-dose versus longer-course antimicrobial treatment for preoperative asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) showed no significant differences in postoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) but lower cost and anxiety with single-dose. In one trial, 31 patients were randomized to a single dose given 30–60 minutes before the surgical procedure and a second dose if a catheter was placed postoperatively, and 28 patients to antimicrobial treatment starting 3 days prior to and continuing for 15 days after surgery. In a second spinal cord injury (SCI) cohort, a single dose (35 patients) given 30 minutes prior to the procedure was compared to 3–5 days of preprocedural antimicrobials (25 patients), with no significant differences in the frequency of postoperative UTI; the single-dose regimen decreased antimicrobial cost (3.6 ± 6.1 US dollars vs 33.1 ± 47.6 US dollars; P < .001) and those who received the longer course reported greater preprocedural anxiety (18 vs 0%; P < .05). These 2 studies suggest that single-dose preoperative treatment of ASB is likely sufficient and associated with fewer adverse events. Perioperative antimicrobials probably reduce the risk of sepsis by approximately 6% and of UTIs by approximately 9%, and prolonged antimicrobial courses increase cost and adverse effects and probably increase length of stay and patient anxiety.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) after kidney transplantation — avoid screening or treatment beyond the immediate postoperative period. In renal transplant recipients who have had renal transplant surgery > 1 month prior, we recommend against screening for or treating ASB (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). There is insufficient evidence to inform a recommendation for or against screening or treatment of ASB within the first month following renal transplantation.

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria, to screen or not to screen-and when to treat? [^111D5ira]. Current Opinion in Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ABU) is a common clinical condition that often leads to unnecessary treatment. The purpose of this review is to outline and evaluate the most recent literature on the management of ABU.

Recent Findings

The role of ABU management has been evaluated in several patient subgroups: healthy patients without identified risk factors, pregnant women, postmenopausal women, women with recurrent UTI, patients with diabetes, elderly institutionalized patients, patients with renal transplants, patients with indwelling catheters and prior to surgery. Available evidence only supports the need for screening and treatment of ABU in pregnant women and prior to urological procedures breaching the mucosa. In all the other conditions the treatment of ABU is not only useless but also harmful. A short course treatment in pregnant women is recommended; in patients with ABU prior to urological procedures breaching the mucosa the treatment should be given in line with antibiogram and in line with the recommendations of European Association of Urology guidelines.

Summary

The approach to patients with ABU has changed completely during recent years. Today, screening and treatment of ABU is recommended only in pregnant women and in all patients who are candidates for urological procedures breaching the mucosa.

### Novel technologies for the diagnosis of urinary tract infections [^114VaKCN]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

UTIs are characterized according to several schema and terminologies, which are relevant to their diagnostic work-up. Anatomically, lower UTIs are confined to the bladder (cystitis) and/or urethra, while upper UTIs involve ascension to the kidneys (pyelonephritis). The latter are more commonly associated with both bacteremia (a condition defined microbiologically) and urosepsis (defined clinicopathologically), although they may occur with cystitis alone. UTIs may be further defined according to patient risk factors. Uncomplicated UTI (uUTI) affects non-pregnant, immunocompetent females without structural/functional urinary tract abnormalities or other predisposing conditions. Notably, an explicit microbiologic diagnosis (i.e. urine culture) is not necessarily indicated for routine cases of uncomplicated cystitis, as empiric antimicrobial therapy is often appropriate. Complicated UTI (cUTI) is an umbrella term for infections arising in the context of risk factor(s) listed above for uUTI. Traditionally, a UTI in a male is inherently considered complicated (although this is controversial). Complicated infections secondary to catheterization are termed catheter associated UTIs. In terms of temporal dynamics, multiple episodes of symptomatic infection (two within 6 months or three within 1 year) with intervening periods of clinical resolution are recurrent UTIs. These may represent persistent infections by the same offending organism or reinfection by a different species/strain. Likewise, the term chronic UTI is applied loosely to either recurrent or unresolving infections. Finally, the concept of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) refers to recovery of a potential uropathogen at high burden (typically > 10 5 CFU/mL) in the absence of symptomatology. Antimicrobial therapy is typically not indicated for ASB, except in certain populations at high risk for adverse outcomes (e.g. renal transplant recipients and pregnant women, especially those undergoing invasive urologic procedures).

### Asymptomatic bacteriuria [^115Zs6K2]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine in the absence of urinary symptoms, is a common clinical finding that often warrants a decision about whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy. There are few indications to treat asymptomatic bacteriuria, and inappropriate treatment contributes to the development of antimicrobial resistance. In 2019, the Infectious Diseases Society of America revised its 2005 guidelines on asymptomatic bacteriuria, incorporating new evidence. The updated guidelines recommend screening and appropriate treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women and in individuals undergoing endourological procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The guidelines recommend against screening and treatment in infants and children; healthy adults, including nonpregnant pre- and postmenopausal women; and patients with diabetes mellitus, long-term indwelling catheters, or spinal cord injuries. The guidelines also recommend against screening and treatment in patients undergoing nonurological surgery, patients who have had a kidney transplant more than one month prior, recipients of other solid organ transplants, or those with impaired voiding following spinal cord injury. Although delirium in older adults can be caused by a urinary tract infection, the guidelines recommend that patients with delirium and no urinary or systemic symptoms be assessed for other causes of delirium, rather than initiating treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria, because treatment has not been shown to have any beneficial effect on clinical outcomes.

Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) around urologic prosthetic device procedures — observational outcomes: Procedures were performed in 689 patients; among 454 with a preoperative urine culture, 337 were negative and 117 had untreated ASB, and all received routine broad-spectrum perioperative antimicrobial prophylaxis. At a median follow-up of 15 months, postoperative prosthetic device infections occurred in 15 of 454 (3.3%), with similar frequencies for patients with or without bacteriuria (3% and 4.3%, respectively). Preoperative ASB was 2-fold higher in the AUS cases, but subsequent device infection rates were similar for subjects with ASB or IP implantation, and only 1 of 15 (7%) infections matched the preoperative urine isolate.

### Urinary tract infections in adults… [^1143JJsA]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The initial empiric therapy for these patients should include an agent with a broad spectrum of activity against the expected uropathogens. Treatment most often includes a fluoroquinolone, administered orally if possible. Patients with complicated UTIs require at least a 10- to 14-day course of therapy. Follow-up urine cultures should be performed within 10 to 14 days after treatment to ensure that the uropathogen has been eradicated. Recent studies have shown that patients initially placed on parenteral therapy can be switched to oral therapy within 72 hours as long as they are clinically improving and able to tolerate the oral agent, and a regimen is available that covers the identified pathogen.

Patients who are too ill to take oral antibiotics or who are unable to take them should initially be treated with parenterally administered single agents, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, a third-generation cephalosporin, aztreonam, a broad-spectrum penicillin, a quinolone or an aminoglycoside. The choice of antibiotic is largely empiric, but Gram staining of the urine may be helpful. Once these patients have improved clinically, they can be switched to oral therapy based on the results of culture and sensitivity studies. 23 Men with urinary tract infections should receive a minimum of seven days of antibiotic therapy. However, more extensive courses may be required in, for example, men with associated urinary tract infection and prostatitis. Consensus regarding the need for a urologic work-up in men with urinary tract infections is lacking.

Symptomatic bacteriuria in a patient with an indwelling Foley catheter should be treated with antibiotics that cover potential nosocomial uropathogens. Patients with mild to moderate infections may be treated with one of the oral quinolones, usually for 10 to 14 days. Parenteral antibiotic therapy may be necessary in patients with severe infections or patients who are unable to tolerate oral medications. The recommended duration of therapy for severe infections is 14 to 21 days. Treatment is not recommended for catheterized patients who have asymptomatic bacteriuria, with the following exceptions: patients who are immunosuppressed after organ transplantation, patients at risk for bacterial endocarditis and patients who are about to undergo urinary tract instrumentation. Symptomatic urinary tract infections complicate 1 to 2 percent of pregnancies, usually in women with persistent bacteriuria.

### Abstract… [^114fs2uW]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections for which antibiotics are prescribed. The Infectious Diseases Society of America issued guidelines for the treatment of uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis and acute pyelonephritis in women. 1 The presence of bacteria in the urine of an asymptomatic patient is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria. The IDSA also has published guidelines on indications for the screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in various patient populations.
2. Although women with asymptomatic bacteriuria are more likely to have subsequent symptomatic UTIs, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria does not decrease the frequency of symptomatic UTI or prevent further episodes of bacteriuria. Asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been shown to be associated with detrimental long-term outcomes.

For these reasons, the IDSA does not recommend screening for or treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in premenopausal nonpregnant women.
2. Patients with Spinal Cord Injuries Patients with spinal cord injuries have a higher prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic UTI. A prospective, randomized trial in patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria and intermittent catheterization showed similar rates of UTI at follow-up, whether or not prophylactic antimicrobials were administered. 36 Although there are few trials addressing the treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in patients with spinal cord injuries, review articles and consensus guidelines support the IDSA recommendations 2 that asymptomatic bacteriuria should not be screened for or treated in patients with spinal cord injuries. However, in the asymptomatic patient, cloudy or foul smelling urine is not an indication for urinalysis, culture, or antimicrobial treatment.

A study of residents in long-term care facilities with chronic indwelling catheters and bacteriuria who were treated with cephalexin or no therapy showed no differences in the incidence of fever or reinfection; however, patients who received antibiotic therapy had twice the incidence of subsequent microbial resistance to cephalexin. 37 When possible, the indwelling catheter should be removed, and the patient should receive clean intermittent catheterization to reduce the risk of symptomatic UTI. The replacement of a chronic indwelling Foley catheter is associated with a low risk for bacteremia, and antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis is not indicated for this procedure.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, and management of… [^114xyRJP]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

In this third WikiGuidelines consensus statement, we provide an evidence-based approach to UTI management developed by a global network of experts for practical use across diverse clinical settings. This guideline fills a critical gap by providing pragmatic, broadly applicable recommendations tailored for generalist care and systems-based practice. Our guidance is rooted in the best available evidence and is designed for clinicians from various backgrounds and health care environments. It emphasizes a patient-centered approach to the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of UTIs and related genitourinary infections. Further research is needed to establish clear criteria for urine testing in febrile patients. The clinical review found insufficient quality of evidence to enable a clear recommendation. Effective management of UTI hinges on appropriate diagnostic testing and antimicrobial stewardship, aiming to prevent the misuse of antibiotics for ASB.

Symptom-based testing is key to ensure appropriate urine culture testing and proper diagnosis of UTI. 52, 53 A 2017 systematic review54 showed 45% of included patients experienced inappropriate initiation of antimicrobial treatment for ASB; various interventions, such as education on diagnostic protocols, provided a significant absolute risk reduction of 33%. Avoiding overtesting and resulting overtreatment of ASB is essential to preserving antimicrobial effectiveness. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation for empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients diagnosed with UTIs. Empirical treatment regimens for pediatric and adult patients should contain antimicrobials that have historically demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of UTIs, achieve adequate urinary concentrations, and provide reliable activity against the most common pathogens based on local resistance rates.

Empirical treatment decisions can be made based on review of the individual patient's urinary tract anatomy or dysfunction, allergies medication list for interactions, microbiological and prior treatment history, the type of UTI, and the clinical severity of presentation. A sufficient quality and quantity of evidence was found to provide a clear recommendation. Multiple RCTs comprised patients with gram negative bacteremia from predominantly urinary sources demonstrate noninferiority of 7 days compared with 14 total days of treatment for a variety of patient-oriented outcomes, such as clinical cure, clinical failure, relapse, and all-cause mortality. 145–148 Thus, we can provide a clear recommendation for 7 days of treatment for gram negative bacteremia from a urinary source when source control has been addressed. Whether shorter duration.
