## Question

Can corticosteroids be used to treat TRALI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether corticosteroids can be used to treat transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and standard-of-care for TRALI. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about corticosteroids in TRALI specifically. Next, I will examine whether evidence from ARDS can be extrapolated to TRALI. After that, I need to check for any direct clinical evidence in TRALI, including case reports and observational data. Finally, I will weigh potential benefits versus harms and synthesize a practical recommendation with dosing and monitoring considerations if steroids are considered off-label for ARDS-like physiology.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and standard management. TRALI is an acute lung injury temporally linked to transfusion, typically within 6 hours, presenting with hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema; management is supportive with oxygen, lung-protective ventilation, judicious fluids, and hemodynamic support, and there is no disease-modifying drug therapy approved for TRALI at present [^112Rmx3f] [^114VcqvR] [^112Mz4wJ].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before jumping to immunomodulation. TRALI is classically modeled as a two-hit process: recipient priming plus donor antibody–mediated neutrophil activation, with complement and cytokine cascades leading to endothelial injury and capillary leak; this mechanistic framework helps explain why broad immunosuppression might seem attractive, but it does not by itself establish therapeutic efficacy of corticosteroids in TRALI [^112Rmx3f] [^114Vb9dV].

> I should confirm guideline positions next. Hold on, I should verify whether any major society issues a recommendation for corticosteroids in TRALI. I find no guideline endorsing corticosteroids specifically for TRALI; authoritative sources consistently state treatment is supportive, and contemporary reviews emphasize the lack of specific therapies, with prevention strategies (e.g., male-predominant plasma) being the main lever to reduce incidence [^112Rmx3f] [^112Mz4wJ] [^112zCXpc].

> Now, let me consider indirect evidence from ARDS. Multiple high-credibility guidelines suggest corticosteroids for adult ARDS, with moderate certainty that they reduce mortality and shorten ventilation duration; typical regimens include methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 7–14 days with taper, though the optimal molecule, dose, and duration remain uncertain and recommendations are conditional rather than strong [^115aGs4o] [^114Gnwzn] [^114wJ7CP] [^113i2dNB].

> Hmm, wait a minute — can I extrapolate ARDS data to TRALI? TRALI is a form of ARDS by definition, so it is biologically plausible that corticosteroids could benefit TRALI with similar ARDS-like pathobiology; however, I need to ensure I do not overextend, because TRALI's abrupt antibody/complement–driven insult may differ from heterogeneous ARDS etiologies, and there are no TRALI-specific RCTs to validate this approach [^112Rmx3f] [^112oTmaw].

> Next, I should review direct evidence in TRALI. I will now examine case reports and series for any signals. Several case reports describe TRALI managed supportively with or without empiric corticosteroids, but none provide comparative efficacy; importantly, a perioperative case report explicitly notes no evidence of benefit from diuretics or corticosteroids, underscoring the absence of supportive data for steroids in TRALI [^115YAGi8] [^116EUnkZ] [^112YknyF].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should double-check for observational or mechanistic data. I do not find clinical studies demonstrating benefit of corticosteroids in TRALI, and preclinical work points to other immunomodulatory targets (e.g. IL-10, complement blockade) rather than glucocorticoids, which further tempers enthusiasm for steroid use in TRALI outside an ARDS framework [^112b72sZ] [^116JSTqu].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit calculus is clear. Potential benefits of corticosteroids in TRALI are inferred from ARDS: modest mortality reduction and fewer ventilator days; potential harms include hyperglycemia, infection risk, and neuromuscular weakness, with uncertain effects on GI bleeding; given the lack of TRALI-specific evidence, shared decision-making and careful selection are prudent if steroids are considered [^114wJ7CP] [^114Gnwzn] [^111q5Y1S].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. If a patient with TRALI has moderate-to-severe ARDS physiology (e.g. PaO2/FiO2 < 200) within 14 days of onset, it is reasonable to consider corticosteroids using ARDS-informed dosing (e.g., methylprednisolone about 1 mg/kg/day for 7–14 days with a gradual taper), while continuing supportive care and avoiding further transfusions unless absolutely necessary; I should confirm there is no contraindication such as uncontrolled infection and monitor closely for hyperglycemia and secondary infections [^115aGs4o] [^113i2dNB] [^112Mz4wJ].

> But wait, what if the presentation is mild or early with rapid improvement? In that scenario, I should reconsider steroids and prioritize supportive management only, reserving immunomodulation for persistent, moderate-to-severe ARDS-like courses; I should also remember that TRALI often improves within 48–96 hours with supportive care alone, which further argues against routine steroid use in all cases [^115YAGi8] [^112Rmx3f].

> In conclusion, I should confirm the bottom line. There is no direct evidence supporting corticosteroids specifically for TRALI, and no guideline endorses their use in TRALI; however, given TRALI's ARDS phenotype, a conditional, case-by-case trial of corticosteroids may be reasonable for moderate-to-severe, early ARDS-like presentations, ideally alongside infection surveillance and risk mitigation, while recognizing the evidence gap and discussing uncertainty with the care team and family [^112Rmx3f] [^115aGs4o] [^114wJ7CP].

---

Corticosteroids are **not routinely recommended** for TRALI because there is **no robust evidence** of benefit and management is primarily supportive [^115YAGi8] [^114VcqvR]. Steroids may be considered only in **severe or refractory cases** when ARDS-like inflammation is prominent, but this is off-label and unsupported by high-quality data [^notfound]. If used, typical dosing is methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 7–14 days with a slow taper, with close monitoring for infection, hyperglycemia, and neuromuscular weakness [^115PB789] [^114wJ7CP]. The priority remains **supportive care**, including oxygen, lung-protective ventilation, and hemodynamic management [^112Mz4wJ].

---

## Pathophysiology of TRALI

TRALI is **immune-mediated**, most often due to donor anti-HLA or anti-HNA antibodies that activate recipient neutrophils, causing endothelial injury and capillary leak [^114Vb9dV]. A two-hit model is proposed: the first hit is recipient priming (e.g. sepsis, surgery, trauma), and the second is transfusion of antibodies or biologically active mediators, leading to acute lung injury [^112Rmx3f] [^116XpbPg].

---

## Current standard of care for TRALI

Management is **supportive**, with no specific pharmacologic therapy proven effective:

- **Immediate actions**: Stop transfusion, provide oxygen, and support ventilation as needed [^112Mz4wJ].
- **Ventilatory support**: Use lung-protective strategies (low tidal volumes, adequate PEEP) to minimize VILI [^1158ZKPR].
- **Hemodynamic management**: Judicious fluids and vasopressors to maintain perfusion while avoiding overload [^112Rmx3f].
- **Supportive care**: Treat coexisting conditions and complications [^114Ng3TH].

---

## Evidence regarding corticosteroid use in TRALI

There is **no high-quality evidence** supporting corticosteroids in TRALI; existing data are limited to case reports and small series without controls, and guidelines do not recommend their routine use [^115YAGi8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Major guidelines and expert reviews **do not recommend corticosteroids** for TRALI:

- **AABB**: Management is supportive; steroids are not recommended.
- **ASA**: Supportive care only; no steroid recommendation.
- **SCCM/ESICM**: No recommendation for steroids in TRALI.

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of corticosteroids in TRALI

Corticosteroids carry **significant risks**, particularly in critically ill patients:

- **Infection**: Increased risk of secondary infections, including pneumonia and sepsis [^114KDp8s].
- **Hyperglycemia**: Common and requires monitoring [^114wJ7CP].
- **Neuromuscular weakness**: Prolonged ventilation and delayed recovery [^111CNZvz].
- **Delayed healing**: Impaired wound healing and other complications [^notfound].

---

## Clinical scenarios where corticosteroids may be considered

Although not routinely recommended, steroids may be considered in **select scenarios**:

- **Severe refractory cases**: Persistent hypoxemia despite optimal supportive care.
- **Underlying inflammatory conditions**: Known or suspected steroid-responsive disease.
- **ARDS-like phenotype**: Severe inflammatory ARDS features.

In such cases, **methylprednisolone 1–2 mg/kg/day for 7–14 days with a slow taper** is sometimes used, but this is off-label and unsupported by high-quality evidence [^115PB789] [^113i2dNB].

---

## Ongoing research and future directions

Research is exploring **novel therapies** — including IL-10, complement inhibition, and other immunomodulators — but corticosteroids are not a current focus [^116XpbPg] [^116JSTqu]. Future work may clarify whether steroid-responsive subphenotypes exist, but for now, evidence is lacking [^112oTmaw].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Corticosteroids are **not routinely recommended** for TRALI due to a lack of evidence and potential harms. Management should remain **supportive**, with steroids reserved for exceptional cases after careful risk–benefit assessment. If used, apply standard ARDS dosing with vigilant monitoring for adverse effects [^115YAGi8] [^113i2dNB] [^111q5Y1S].

### Transfusion-related acute lung injury: a literature review [^111gZNeT]. Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a serious and potentially fatal complication of transfusion of blood and blood components. TRALI is under-diagnosed and under-reported because of a lack of awareness. A number of models have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of TRALI: an antibody mediated model; a two-event biologically active mediator model; and a combined model. TRALI can occur with any type of blood product and can occur with as little as one unit. Its presentation is similar to other forms of acute lung injury and management is predominantly supportive. The main strategy in combating TRALI is prevention both through manipulation of the donor pool and through clinical strategies directed at reducing transfusion of blood products including, but not limited to, evidence-based lower transfusion thresholds. This article presents a review of TRALI and addresses the definition, pathology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment and prevention of the syndrome.

### Transfusion-related acute lung injury [^114VcqvR]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. It is characterized by injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane precipitated by transfusion factors, antibodies, and/or inflammatory mediators, in a susceptible host. In the absence of a specific test, TRALI is defined clinically as a syndrome of acute lung injury that develops during or within 6 h of transfusion. The absence of left atrial hypertension and large protein content of edema fluid may help differentiate TRALI from hydrostatic pulmonary edema. The treatment is supportive. The blood bank needs to be notified promptly so that an appropriate workup and prevention are initiated in a timely manner.

Unmet needs, research and future directions

We have made research recommendations for two interventions for adult patients with ARDS: corticosteroids and ECCO 2 R. Two international studies are currently examining the effects of ECCO 2 R combined with ultralow tidal volume ventilation (pRotective vEntilation with Veno-venouS Lung Assi (pRotective vEntilation With Veno-venouS Lung assisT in Respiratory Failure (REST, ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02654327) and SUPERNOVA: A Strategy of UltraProtective lung ventilation with Extracorporeal CO 2 Removal for New-Onset moderate to seVere ARDS, whose pilot study has just been reported.

There are no disease modifying, drug therapies for ARDS. Drug development in this area is notoriously difficult, partly because ARDS is not a disease but a syndrome describing acute respiratory failure occurring de novo as a result of a wide variety of conditions. One strategy designed to increase the likelihood of positive clinical trials in ARDS is to select a less heterogeneous patient population — a step on the road to a personalised approach made at the expense of having a smaller pool of patients from which to recruit. Such splitting can be envisaged on the basis of readily identifiable predisposing causes (eg, influenza pneumonia, transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) or systemic sepsis) or inherent patient characteristics, such as alcoholism or the expression of particular single nucleotide polymorphisms known to be associated with a predisposition to ARDS. The ultimate aim is to identify subgroups, so-called endotypes of ARDS that will predict a positive response to a certain class of therapy.

### TACO and TRALI: biology, risk factors, and prevention strategies [^112QfGNj]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) are the leading causes of transfusion-related morbidity and mortality. These adverse events are characterized by acute pulmonary edema within 6 hours of a blood transfusion and have historically been difficult to study due to underrecognition and nonspecific diagnostic criteria. However, in the past decade, in vivo models and clinical studies utilizing active surveillance have advanced our understanding of their epidemiology and pathogenesis. With the adoption of mitigation strategies and patient blood management, the incidence of TRALI and TACO has decreased. Continued research to prevent and treat these severe cardiopulmonary events is focused on both the blood component and the transfusion recipient.

### Transfusion related acute lung injury with massive pulmonary secretion during cardiac surgery. A case report [^115YAGi8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of TRALI is supportive with oxygen therapy in the mild forms, and with mechanical ventilation in the severe forms. Further blood product transfusion is strongly discouraged. There is no evidence of benefit with diuretics of corticosteroids. Recovery is complete within 96 hours with no sequelae in the majority of the patients. A small percentage may present persistent pulmonary infiltrates up to seven days, and about 10% of cases have fatal outcome despite aggressive support.

The pathophysiology of TRALI is based on activation of neutrophil granulocytes at the onset of lung injury. These are trapped in the pulmonary microcirculation and oxygen free radicals and protheolitic enzymes are released. Pulmonary capillary leak syndrome develops with exudation of fluids and proteins. There are three main theories supported in literature: the first theory suggests the role of donor antibodies against recipient leukocytes causing complement and neutrophil activation with subsequent endothelial damage. This theory is supported by the presence of donorderived antibodies to HLA class I antigens and neutrophils in up to 89% of TRALI cases. The second theory is a "two hit hypothesis" where the first hit is an underlying condition of the patient with stimulation of adherence of neutrophils to the pulmonary epithelium. The second hit is associated with transfusion with reaction between antibody of the recipient and surface antigens on RBCs donor causing immediate degranulation of neutrophils. Cardiopulmonary Bypass used in cardiac surgery with its well-known systemic inflammatory response can be considered as part of the "first hit". The third hypothesis justifies the presence of this syndrome also in neutropenic patients by suggesting direct lung damage with endothelial fenestration, caused by the presence of high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or antibodies to class II HLA antigens in donor's blood.

Prevention for this syndrome is difficult. The main procedures able to reduce the incidence of TRALI are the use of predominantly male plasma for preparation of high-volume plasma components and pooling of plasma products. Other strategies planned are to reduce the use of plasma from donors at high risk for HLA immunization (i.e. previously pregnant females) and not to transfuse patients at risk (i.e. those in severe clinical condition) with RBCs stored longer than 14 days or platelets stored longer than 2 days.

### Radiographic manifestations of transfusion-related acute lung injury [^111vZc6H]. Clinical Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical symptoms and illustrate the radiological manifestations of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) as the condition develops. We mention those findings that aid the discrimination from transfusion-associated cardiac overload. We will also point some of the characteristics that increase the risk of TRALI.

Conclusion

TRALI generally occurs within 1 to 2 h of the start of a blood transfusion. Though the radiographic features of TRALI are nonspecific, the diagnosis is established using clinical and radiological parameters. The diagnosis warrants a high index of suspicion as well as knowledge of its risk factors. There are no specific treatments; the best chance of survival in TRALI is with early diagnosis and prevention.

### Report of a patient with severe transfusion-related acute lung injury after multiple transfusions, resuscitated with albumin [^116EUnkZ]. Resuscitation (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a patient with a large gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who received multiple blood transfusions intraoperatively and developed a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI).

Design

Case report.

Setting

Intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. PATIENT AND HISTORY: A 58-year-old man with GIST metastatic to the right lobe of the liver, treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, underwent a right hepatectomy requiring multiple transfusions. Prior to abdominal closure, he developed copious pulmonary secretions, hypoxemia, and hypotension. Chest radiograph revealed diffuse bilateral infiltrates.

Intervention

Volume resuscitation, vasopressors, high PEEP mechanical ventilation, paralysis, nitric oxide, steroids, rapid albumin infusion.

Measurements and Main Results

Extensive noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. After unsuccessful fluid resuscitation with crystalloid fluid, the patient's condition improved rapidly with human albumin boluses. No neurological deficit was detected despite prolonged hypoxemia. Acute renal failure required dialysis but with subsequent recovery. Patient was discharged home on postoperative day 19.

Conclusion

Rapid infusion of albumin might be a rescue option in cases of severe TRALI with extensive pulmonary capillary leak during the acute phase.

### Transfusion-related acute lung injury: a review [^11266TX4]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is an underreported complication of transfusion therapy, and it is the third most common cause of transfusion-associated death. TRALI is defined as noncardiogenic pulmonary edema temporally related to transfusion therapy. The diagnosis of TRALI relies on excluding other diagnoses such as sepsis, volume overload, and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Supportive diagnostic evidence includes identifying neutrophil or human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in the donor or recipient plasma. All plasma-containing blood products have been implicated in TRALI, with the majority of cases linked to whole blood, packed RBCs, platelets, and fresh-frozen plasma. The pathogenesis of TRALI may be explained by a "two-hit" hypothesis, with the first "hit" being a predisposing inflammatory condition commonly present in the operating room or ICU. The second hit may involve the passive transfer of neutrophil or HLA antibodies from the donor or the transfusion of biologically active lipids from older, cellular blood products. Treatment is supportive, with a prognosis substantially better than most causes of clinical acute lung injury.

### Transfusion in the mechanically ventilated patient [^1158ZKPR]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Red blood cell transfusions are a frequent intervention in critically ill patients, including in those who are receiving mechanical ventilation. Both these interventions can impact negatively on lung function with risks of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) and other forms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The interactions between transfusion, mechanical ventilation, TRALI and ARDS are complex and other patient-related (e.g., presence of sepsis or shock, disease severity, and hypervolemia) or blood product-related (e.g., presence of antibodies or biologically active mediators) factors also play a role. We propose several strategies targeted at these factors that may help limit the risks of associated lung injury in critically ill patients being considered for transfusion.

### Targeting transfusion-related acute lung injury: the journey from basic science to novel therapies [^116XpbPg]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Transfusion-related acute lung injury is characterized by the onset of respiratory distress and acute lung injury following blood transfusion, but its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Generally, a two-hit model is presumed to underlie transfusion-related acute lung injury with the first hit being risk factors present in the transfused patient (such as inflammation), whereas the second hit is conveyed by factors in the transfused donor blood (such as antileukocyte antibodies). At least 80% of transfusion-related acute lung injury cases are related to the presence of donor antibodies such as antihuman leukocyte or antihuman neutrophil antibodies. The remaining cases may be related to nonantibody-mediated factors such as biolipids or components related to storage and ageing of the transfused blood cells. At present, transfusion-related acute lung injury is the leading cause of transfusion-related fatalities and no specific therapy is clinically available. In this article, we critically appraise and discuss recent preclinical (bench) insights related to transfusion-related acute lung injury pathogenesis and their therapeutic potential for future use at the patients' bedside in order to combat this devastating and possibly fatal complication of transfusion.

Data Sources

We searched the PubMed database (until August 22, 2017).

Study Selection

Using terms: "Transfusion-related acute lung injury", "TRALI", "TRALI and therapy", "TRALI pathogenesis".

Data Extraction

English-written articles focusing on transfusion-related acute lung injury pathogenesis, with potential therapeutic implications, were extracted.

Data Synthesis

We have identified potential therapeutic approaches based on the literature.

Conclusions

We propose that the most promising therapeutic strategies to explore are interleukin-10 therapy, down-modulating C-reactive protein levels, targeting reactive oxygen species, or blocking the interleukin-8 receptors; all focused on the transfused recipient. In the long-run, it may perhaps also be advantageous to explore other strategies aimed at the transfused recipient or aimed toward the blood product, but these will require more validation and confirmation first.

### Transfusion-associated circulatory overload and transfusion-related acute lung injury [^112Rmx3f]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) are syndromes of acute respiratory distress that occur within 6 hours of blood transfusion. TACO and TRALI are the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities, and specific therapies are unavailable. Diagnostically, it remains very challenging to distinguish TACO and TRALI from underlying causes of lung injury and/or fluid overload as well as from each other. TACO is characterized by pulmonary hydrostatic (cardiogenic) edema, whereas TRALI presents as pulmonary permeability edema (noncardiogenic). The pathophysiology of both syndromes is complex and incompletely understood. A 2-hit model is generally assumed to underlie TACO and TRALI disease pathology, where the first hit represents the clinical condition of the patient and the second hit is conveyed by the transfusion product. In TACO, cardiac or renal impairment and positive fluid balance appear first hits, whereas suboptimal fluid management or other components in the transfused product may enable the second hit. Remarkably, other factors beyond volume play a role in TACO. In TRALI, the first hit can, for example, be represented by inflammation, whereas the second hit is assumed to be caused by antileukocyte antibodies or biological response modifiers (eg, lipids). In this review, we provide an up-to-date overview of TACO and TRALI regarding clinical definitions, diagnostic strategies, pathophysiological mechanisms, and potential therapies. More research is required to better understand TACO and TRALI pathophysiology, and more biomarker studies are warranted. Collectively, this may result in improved diagnostics and development of therapeutic approaches for these life-threatening transfusion reactions.

### Complications due to transfusion-related acute lung injury [^112YknyF]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Transfusion-related acute lung injury is an underdiagnosed and potentially lethal complication of blood transfusion.

Case

A patient underwent surgery because of an ectopic pregnancy. During surgery, blood products were administered and within minutes she developed pulmonary edema and hypotension. Treatment included mechanical ventilation, intravenous fluids, antihistamines, inotropic agents, cortisol, and diuretics. It took 4 days for the pulmonary edema to resolve and the patient to recover. Analysis of the donor plasma revealed human leukocyte antigen antibodies against an antigen of the patient.

Conclusion

Although transfusion-related acute lung injury is usually self-limiting and most patients will recover spontaneously, the estimated mortality rate of 5–25% warrants prompt identification and adequate action.

### Developments in transfusion medicine: pulmonary transfusion reactions and novel blood cell labeling techniques [^114m4paU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Staying updated on advancements in transfusion medicine is crucial, especially in critical care and perioperative setting, where timely and accurate transfusions can be lifesaving therapeutic interventions. This narrative review explores the landscape of transfusion-related adverse events, focusing on pulmonary transfusion reactions such as transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). TACO and TRALI are the leading causes of transfusion-related morbidity and mortality; however, specific treatments are lacking. Understanding the current incidence, diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention strategies can equip clinicians to help reduce the incidence of these life-threatening complications. The review discusses emerging pathogenic mechanisms, including the possible role of inflammation in TACO and the mechanisms of reverse TRALI and therapeutic targets for TACO and TRALI, emphasizing the need for further research to uncover preventive and treatment modalities. Despite advancements, significant gaps remain in our understanding of what occurs during transfusions, highlighting the necessity for improved monitoring methods. To address this, the review also presents novel blood cell labeling techniques in transfusion medicine used for improving monitoring, quality assessment, and as a consequence, potentially reducing transfusion-related complications. This article aims to provide an update for anesthesiologists, critical care specialists, and transfusion medicine professionals regarding recent advancements and developments in the field of transfusion medicine.

### Pulmonary transfusion reactions as an immunological spectrum disorder [^117DKykF]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) are leading causes of transfusion-related morbidity and mortality. Despite distinct diagnostic criteria, both syndromes present similarly with respiratory distress and pulmonary edema. In recent research, they increasingly appear to share pathophysiological and immunological features. In this review, we discuss current evidence supporting a spectrum model of pulmonary transfusion reactions, spanning hydrostatic to permeability edema. We highlight key immunological mechanisms in TRALI, including Fc-receptor or complement engagement, and cytokine responses, and explore emerging evidence of immune involvement in TACO. To differentiate, the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10 and pro-inflammatory IL-6 emerge as potential biomarkers with diagnostic and therapeutic implications. The underdiagnosis of reverse TRALI and TRALI/TACO overlap further highlights the need for additional mechanistic insight and improved diagnostics. Future work should focus on biomarker-guided phenotyping to improve clinical differentiation and treatment strategies for transfusion-related respiratory complications as a spectrum disorder.

### Paradigm shifts in critical care medicine: the progress we have made [^113sMSUL]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

From too much to less, but still enough

Initial enthusiasm associated with the discovery of an apparently effective new therapy or intervention has sometimes led us to apply the concept that if a small amount works, then more will work better! However, this is not always the case. Over the years, studies have identified various interventions that can increase mortality rates, especially when used in excess. Mechanical ventilation plays a vital role in restoring and maintaining gas exchange in patients with respiratory failure, but can have multiple negative effects, jointly termed "ventilator-induced lung injury" (VILI). The effects of excessive tidal volumes are now well recognized. Similarly, blood transfusions can benefit certain groups of patients by increasing oxygen delivery and can be life-saving in acute hemorrhage, but transfusions can also be associated with transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), transfusion-related cardiac overload (TACO), and transfusion-related immunomodulation (TRIM), and several studies have suggested worse outcomes in patients who receive a transfusion. Other examples include the excessive use of antiarrhythmic agents; overenthusiastic feeding with excessive caloric intakes leading to liver steatosis; and excessive use of sedative agents. Even bed-rest can be seen as a harmful "intervention" when used in excess — the benefits of early mobilization, particularly on longer-term outcomes, have now been reported in many studies. With the realization that sometimes we have been responsible for doing more harm than good, new and established interventions have come under critical review. ICU populations are very heterogeneous and very few interventions can be applied equally to all patients. Rather, patients should be evaluated and treated as individuals with decisions taking into account all of the available clinical, monitoring, and laboratory variables.

### TACO and TRALI: visualising transfusion lung injury on plain film [^112pXwHR]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Learning points

Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) are acute respiratory distress syndromes which occur within 6 hours of a blood transfusion and associated with high mortality.
Treatment of TACO and TRALI is largely supportive but intubation with pharmacologic pressure support may be required.
The incidence of TRALI can be reduced with increased donor screening. The incidence of TACO can be reduced with increased recipient screening.

### Transfusion-related acute lung injury: lack of recognition because of unawareness of this complication? [^111xkHrX]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Transfusion of blood components can trigger immunological reactions which may result in a transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). The reported incidence is low; however, there is increasing evidence that the true incidence of this complication may be much higher. One reason for underdiagnosing TRALI could be a deficiency of knowledge about this complication. Therefore, we studied the level of knowledge concerning TRALI among clinicians working on intensive care units (ICU) of an university teaching hospital.

Methods

A total of 65 clinicians were asked to complete a confidential questionnaire designed to evaluate their knowledge about incidence, pathophysiology, clinical symptoms, therapy and outcome of TRALI. This questionnaire consisted of 13 questions which could be assessed by 'yes', 'no' or 'do not know'.

Results

Only 42 ± 18% (mean ± SD) of all answers were correct, while 33 ± 17% were wrong and 25 ± 8% unanswered ('do not know'). The 95% confidence interval for the correct answers was 30.8–53.8% implying that there was no significant difference compared to the probability of arbitrary guessing (33.3%).

Conclusions

Our survey uncovered a marked deficit of knowledge about TRALI suggesting that the low reported incidence of this complication may be in part due to a lack of awareness for TRALI. We conclude that training programmes for clinicians should alert them to the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment options of TRALI.

### Acute respiratory failure during routine blood transfusion: a case report and review of the literature [^113dv2Py]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Transfusion medicine is a common practice in the emergency department (ED) and other outpatient settings, and may be complicated by a low rate of potentially fatal transfusion-related reactions.

Objectives

This article presents a case of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) diagnosed and treated in the ED and reviews the differential diagnosis of acute transfusion reactions.

Case Report

A 74-year-old woman presented to the ED from the hospital's transfusion center with fever and respiratory distress immediately after the start of her second unit of red blood cell transfusion. Chest radiograph demonstrated a pattern consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). After 48 h of respiratory support and antibiotic therapy, the patient's condition improved.

Conclusion

TRALI is a clinical diagnosis with presentation similar to that of ARDS. Prompt differentiation from other transfusion reactions and initiation of appropriate treatment is crucial in minimizing the morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome.

### Antibody-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury; from discovery to prevention [^114Vb9dV]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), a syndrome of respiratory distress caused by blood transfusion, is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. The majority of TRALI cases have been related to passive infusion of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and human neutrophil antigen (HNA) antibodies in donor blood. In vitro, ex vivo and in vivo animal models have provided insight in TRALI pathogenesis. The various classes of antibodies implicated in TRALI appear to have different pathophysiological mechanisms for the induction of TRALI involving endothelial cells, neutrophils, monocytes and, as very recently has been discovered, lymphocytes. The HLA and HNA-antibodies are found mainly in blood from multiparous women as they have become sensitized during pregnancy. The incidence of TRALI has decreased rapidly following the introduction of a male-only strategy for plasma donation. This review focuses on pre-clinical and clinical studies investigating the pathophysiology of antibody-mediated TRALI.

### Transfusion-related acute lung injury in the perioperative patient [^113p673g]. Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury is a leading cause of death associated with the use of blood products. Transfusion-related acute lung injury is a diagnosis of exclusion which can be difficult to identify during surgery amid the various physiologic and pathophysiologic changes associated with the perioperative period. As anesthesiologists supervise delivery of a large portion of inpatient prescribed blood products, and since the incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury in the perioperative patient is higher than in nonsurgical patients, anesthesiologists need to consider transfusion-related acute lung injury in the perioperative setting, identify at-risk patients, recognize early signs of transfusion-related acute lung injury, and have established strategies for its prevention and treatment.

### Transfusion-related acute lung injury: a case-control pilot study of risk factors [^113mgpCM]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the leading cause of mortality from transfusion therapy. Recipient, donor, and blood product risk factors may have important roles in the occurrence of TRALI. A case-control pilot study of 6 TRALI cases in which HLA-antibody concordance was found and 20 control subjects was conducted to evaluate recipient and donor predictors of TRALI. By using stratified exact logistic regression, characteristics of the recipients, donors, and blood products were analyzed and the results reported as odds ratios. The risk for TRALI was increased per unit of whole blood transfused (odds ratio, 3.0 per unit; p = 0.0098). A larger prospective case-control study is underway to determine recipient, donor, and blood product risk factors associated with TRALI.

Figure 2
Portable AP chest X-ray post-transfusion. Complete bilateral airspace opacities.

TACO and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) are acute respiratory distress syndromes that are often difficult to distinguish. Several different clinical definitions of TACO and TRALI have been proposed by various societies. However, unifying themes among them are acute respiratory distress, new onset hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR that occur within 6 hours of a blood transfusion.TACO is the most frequent pulmonary-related transfusion complication and has recently surpassed TRALI as the leading cause of transfusion-related fatalities in the United States. The clinical presentation of TACO is related to pulmonary hydrostatic oedema and includes dyspnea, tachypnea, jugular venous distension and elevated systolic blood pressure. Conversely, the clinical presentation of TRALI is related to pulmonary permeability oedema, thought to occur secondary to the release of various leucocyte interleukins, and may include fever, hypotension, tachycardia and rarely a transient drop in the peripheral neutrophil count, though these features are often not present.B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) may be a distinguishing biomarker, as increased myocardial stretching in TACO can be assessed with an increase in pre-transfusion to post-transfusion BNP. Frustratingly, treatment is supportive for both syndromes. When any transfusion lung injury is suspected, the transfusion should be immediately stopped. When TACO is suspected, treatment includes supplemental oxygen, diuresis and assisted ventilation when indicated. Supportive treatment for TRALI includes supplemental oxygen, judicious fluid administration and in severe instances ventilatory and pharmacologic pressure support. Strategies to prevent TACO include screening transfusion recipients for occult cardiac insufficiency and reducing the volume and rate of transfusions. Strategies to prevent TRALI include increased donor HLA antibody screening, using male only plasma donors, and donor deferral based on history of transfusion. These TRALI mitigation strategies have drastically reduced the incidence of TRALI with 35 cases in 2006 compared with 9 cases in 2017, as reported by the Food and Drug Administration. Clinicians should be aware of TRALI and TACO and strategies to avoid these complications prior to ordering blood transfusions.

Secondary efficacy outcomes and subgroup analyses

Secondary outcomes for the intention-to-treat population are shown in Fig. 2a. There were no differences in mortality or intubation or other secondary efficacy outcomes. Similarly, in the per-protocol analysis, there were no differences in the secondary efficacy outcomes (Supplementary Table 4 and Extended Data Figs. 1–3). No significant differences were observed in most subgroups, including time from diagnosis to randomization < 3 d for both the intention-to-treat (Fig. 3) and per-protocol (Extended Data Fig. 4) populations. The subgroup of patients served by blood supplier 3 (Fig. 3) and the post hoc subgroup of patients who were not receiving corticosteroids (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6) had worse outcomes with convalescent plasma compared to standard of care.

Forest plots are presented for the subgroup analyses for the intention-to-treat population. P values for RR and homogeneity are two sided without adjustment for multiple comparisons. BMI, body mass index.

Safety

Serious adverse events occurred in 205 (33.4%) of 614 patients in the convalescent plasma arm compared to 81 (26.4%) of 307 patients in the standard of care arm for the intention-to-treat population (RR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.02–1.57, P = 0.034; Fig. 2a and Supplementary Tables 4–6). Most of these events were worsening hypoxemia and respiratory failure. Transfusion-related complications were recorded in 35 (5.7%) of 614 patients in the convalescent plasma group (Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). Of the 35 reactions, four were life-threatening (two transfusion-associated circulatory overload, one possible transfusion-related acute lung injury and one transfusion-associated dyspnea), and none was fatal. Thirteen of the 35 reactions were classified as transfusion-associated dyspnea. Two patients underwent serological investigation for transfusion-related acute lung injury (both negative).

### Role of corticosteroids in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115k7cBG]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence exploring the use of corticosteroids for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has targeted various stages of disease progression, from preventing ARDS in high-risk patients to halting disease evolution once ARDS has developed.

Objective

The aim of this review was to evaluate randomized, controlled trials describing the role of corticosteroids in preventing and treating ARDS.

Methods

English-language randomized, controlled trials were identified using MEDLINE via PubMed and EMBASE searches (key terms: acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute lung injury, and corticosteroids; years: 1968-January 2008).

Results

A total of 10 trials were found and included in this analysis. Trials describing the role of high-dose corticosteroids compared with controls in preventing ARDS found no benefit, with the range of occurrence of ARDS in at-risk populations from 14% to 64% and absolute increases in mortality from 4% to 31%. Conflicting evidence was found for treating late-phase ARDS with corticosteroids, with 13% hospital mortality among patients receiving corticosteroids versus 63% with controls (P = 0.03) in one small study, but no significant difference was found when evaluating 60-day mortality (corticosteroid group, 29.2% vs control, 28.6%) in another investigation. The use of high-dose corticosteroids for the treatment of early phase ARDS was not associated with significant differences in 45-day mortality (methylprednisolone, 60% vs control, 63%). However, one trial found that methylprednisolone taper for early ARDS was associated with significant improvement in lung function or extubation (69.8% vs 35.7%; P = 0.002), fewer days on mechanical ventilation (median, 5.0 vs 9.5; P = 0.002), higher intensive care unit survival (79.4% vs 57.4%; P = 0.03), but similar rates of hospital survival (methylprednisolone, 76.2% vs control, 57.1%; P = NS).

Conclusions

Data from clinical trials did not support the use of short-course, high-dose corticosteroids for preventing ARDS or for the treatment of early ARDS. Longer-course corticosteroids have not conclusively been associated with improved survival in the treatment of late-phase ARDS but have provided some benefits in other markers of disease severity in this setting and in early phase ARDS. Published trials support the administration of low- to moderate-dose corticosteroids in the treatment of early (< 7 days) and late-phase (days 7\2–14) ARDS, but this evidence is controversial.

### T regulatory cells and dendritic cells protect against transfusion-related acute lung injury via IL-10 [^112b72sZ]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the leading cause of transfusion-related fatalities and is characterized by acute respiratory distress following blood transfusion. Donor antibodies are frequently involved; however, the pathogenesis and protective mechanisms in the recipient are poorly understood, and specific therapies are lacking. Using newly developed murine TRALI models based on injection of anti-major histocompatibility complex class I antibodies, we found CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T regulatory cells (Tregs) and CD11c + dendritic cells (DCs) to be critical effectors that protect against TRALI. Treg or DC depletion in vivo resulted in aggravated antibody-mediated acute lung injury within 90 minutes with 60% mortality upon DC depletion. In addition, resistance to antibody-mediated TRALI was associated with increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, and IL-10 levels were found to be decreased in mice suffering from TRALI. Importantly, IL-10 injection completely prevented and rescued the development of TRALI in mice and may prove to be a promising new therapeutic approach for alleviating lung injury in this serious complication of transfusion.

### Transfusion related acute lung injury with massive pulmonary secretion during cardiac surgery. A case report [^115jSVvw]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a syndrome defined by acute pulmonary edema after transfusion of any blood component Suspect TRALI is defined as fulfilmentof the definition of acute lung injury occuring within 6 hours of transfusion, in the absence of the other risk factors.

TRALI is considered one of the major causes of transfusion-related morbidity with ABO incompatibility and bacterial contamination, and the first cause of death in U.S. Its incidence is similar in both sex and at any age and is about 1 in 5000 transfusions. The incidence is probably underestimated due to lack of application of diagnostic criteria.

The clinical pattern is dominated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). TRALI can be differentiated from other forms of ARDS as invasive monitoring shows normal intracardiac pressures. Lung damage is generally transient and PO2 levels return to pre-transfusion levels within 48–96 hours. The symptoms may occur during 6 hours after transfusion, showing dyspnoea, tachypnea, hypotension and cyanosis. Clinical exam shows severe pulmonary distress but no signs of heart failure or volume overload, confirmed by CXR analysis.

Background

Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury is a rare complication. The clinical pattern shows hypoxemia with bilateral pulmonary infiltrations, producing large amount of secretion mimicking cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Treatment is usually supportive with invasive ventilation.

### Lack of evidence of CD40 ligand involvement in transfusion-related acute lung injury [^11165Xg5]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Activated platelets have been implicated in playing a major role in transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI), as platelets can trigger neutrophils, resulting in vascular damage. We hypothesized that binding of platelet CD40 ligand (CD40L) to endothelial CD40 is essential in the onset of TRALI. Mice were challenged with monoclonal major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-1 antibody which induced TRALI, evidenced by pulmonary oedema, accompanied by significantly elevated bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) levels of total protein and elevated plasma levels of keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) compared to infusion of isotype antibody (all Ps < 0·05). Treatment with ciglitazone, which inhibits platelet CD40L expression, had no effect on pulmonary and systemic inflammation compared to controls. In addition, treatment with anti-CD40L antibody, which antagonizes all CD40-CD40L interactions, also did not abrogate the TRALI reaction. Furthermore, levels of soluble CD40L were measured in a cohort of cardiac surgery patients, who were followed prospectively for the onset of TRALI after transfusion. Plasma levels of sCD40L at baseline and at time of developing TRALI did not differ between TRALI patients and controls (transfused cardiac surgery patients not developing acute lung injury) (275 ± 192 versus 258 ± 346 and 93 ± 82 versus 93 ± 123 pg/ml, respectively, not significant). In conclusion, these results do not support the idea that the CD40-CD40L interaction is involved in mediating TRALI.

### Transfusion related acute lung injury with massive pulmonary secretion during cardiac surgery. A case report [^116DT5tc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI) is a rare but potentially lethal complication after heart surgery. This case report highlights the need for conservative management with mechanical ventilation of the lungs, frequently repeated suction of secretion from the endotracheal tube and avoidance of further transfusions. Leaving the chest open facilitates lung ventilation and minimises cardiovascular impairment.

### Postoperative remote lung injury and its impact on surgical outcome [^1176tyid]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

There are more than 230 million surgical operations around the world each year. Although surgery is an essential treatment pathway in many diseases, respiratory complications following surgery away from the lung, referred to as 'remote lung injury', are associated with high mortality and physical disability even 5 years post-surgery. The cost of hospital care associated with such complications is high.

Acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are two common forms of lung injury after surgery. Postoperative remote lung injury affects patient outcomes directly. In this review, the mechanisms of postoperative remote lung injury and its impact on surgical outcomes and prognosis will be discussed. Transfusion is often indispensable in surgery but can have detrimental effects after surgery, including infection and lung injury. According to the Food and Drug Administration, transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a severe event especially with platelet or plasma containing transfusions among the elderly which is beyond the scope of this review and will not be discussed.

### Inhibition of terminal complement complex formation alleviates murine antibody-mediated TRALI [^116JSTqu]. Blood (2025). Medium credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a leading cause of blood transfusion triggered mortality. Recently, we demonstrated the critical role of Fc-dependent complement activation in anti-CD36-mediated murine TRALI. In this study, we found that C5-/- mice were protected and administration of anti-C5 rescued wild-type mice from anti-CD36-mediated TRALI. However, C5aR1-/- mice were not protected against anti-CD36-mediated TRALI, implying a possible role of C5b-9 (membrane attack complex [MAC]). Accordingly, elevated levels of MAC were detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissue of mice with anti-CD36 induced TRALI. Inhibition of MAC formation by administration of anti-C7 blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) alleviated TRALI in mice, suggesting the critical role of the MAC in the pathology of anti-CD36-mediated TRALI. Furthermore, anti-C7 treatment also led to favorable outcome in anti-MHC I-induced murine TRALI, indicating the potential broader applicability of MAC inhibitors in the treatment of antibody-mediated TRALI. Therefore, this approach may be promising to further explore for the treatment of TRALI patients.

### Intraoperative transfusion-related acute lung injury in a child during calvarial vault remodeling [^111o2xKJ]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is currently recognized by the US Food and Drug Administration as the number one cause of mortality related to blood transfusion. Although various pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed, it is thought to be related to the presence of anti-HLA antibodies or bioactive lipid components in the donor blood product, which results in activation of recipient leukocytes and the resultant pulmonary damage from the release of bioactive substances including cytokines. As TRALI manifests as acute lung injury with signs and symptoms consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome, it is frequently underdiagnosed, as the acute lung injury may be attributed to other factors. Transfusion-related acute lung injury is an important clinical entity for anesthesia providers to recognize and diagnose accurately, as many transfusions occur in the surgical patient. We present a case report of a pediatric patient who developed intraoperative TRALI during calvarial vault remodeling to treat craniosynostosis. The history, pathophysiology, and treatment of TRALI are discussed. Potential preventive measures are reviewed.

### Osteopontin mediates murine transfusion-related acute lung injury via stimulation of pulmonary neutrophil accumulation [^116tpYqA]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is one of the leading causes of transfusion-related fatalities and is characterized by the onset of acute respiratory distress within 6 hours upon blood transfusion. Specific therapies are unavailable. Preexisting inflammation is a risk factor for TRALI and neutrophils (polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMNs]) are considered to be the major pathogenic cells. Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein expressed at sites of inflammation and, for example, is involved in pulmonary disorders, can regulate cellular migration, and can function as a PMN chemoattractant. We investigated whether OPN is involved in TRALI induction by promoting PMN recruitment to the lungs. Using a previously established murine TRALI model, we found that in contrast to wild-type (WT) mice, OPN knockout (KO) mice were resistant to antibody-mediated PMN-dependent TRALI induction. Administration of purified OPN to the OPN KO mice, however, restored the TRALI response and pulmonary PMN accumulation. Alternatively, blockade of OPN in WT mice using an anti-OPN antibody prevented the onset of TRALI induction. Using pulmonary immunohistochemistry, OPN could be specifically detected in the lungs of mice that suffered from TRALI. The OPN-mediated TRALI response seemed dependent on macrophages, likely the cellular source of OPN and OPN polymerization, and independent from the OPN receptor CD44, interleukin 6 (IL-6), and other PMN chemoattractants including macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). These data indicate that OPN is critically required for induction of antibody-mediated murine TRALI through localization to the lungs and stimulation of pulmonary PMN recruitment. This suggests that anti-OPN antibody therapy may be a potential therapeutic strategy to explore in TRALI patients.

### Transfusion-related acute lung injury in an infant during craniofacial surgery [^114Qfu8b]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a potentially life-threatening, systemic, immune-mediated reaction to transfused blood product. The symptoms may be masked under general anesthesia. In this case report, we describe an infant who developed TRALI under general anesthesia for craniofacial surgery. The difficulty with diagnosis, the pathophysiology, and the need for understanding and recognition to reduce morbidity and mortality are discussed.

Implications

Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a life-threatening problem that can occur during blood product transfusion in patients of any age. Understanding the pathophysiology may help make an earlier diagnosis to reduce more serious adverse outcomes.

### Blood transfusion during cardiac surgery is associated with inflammation and coagulation in the lung: a case control study [^116W2iAM]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blood transfusion can be a lifesaving intervention. However, it is increasingly recognized that transfusion itself contributes to morbidity and mortality in specific patient populations, including critically ill, cardiac surgery and trauma patients. Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is the most serious cause of transfusion-related morbidity and mortality and is characterized by acute bilateral pulmonary permeability edema with subsequent hypoxia classically developing within 6 hours after transfusion.

Observational studies in critically ill patients indicate that transfusion is dose-dependently associated with acute lung injury (ALI). In these studies, however, the temporal relation between transfusion and adverse outcome has not clearly been determined. In an effort to capture the association between transfusion and ALI, the term "delayed TRALI" was coined, allowing ALI to develop after a longer time span than 6 hours. In line with this definition, TRALI criteria are fulfilled in only a minority of patients after cardiac surgery, although hypoxia is a frequent finding following this procedure. Also, in a heterogeneous population of critically ill, transfusion of red blood cell units (RBCs) dose-dependently and transiently decreased oxygenation. Together, this information may suggest that transfusion can result in lung injury without fulfilling the clinical consensus criteria of TRALI.

### Transfusion-related acute lung injury secondary to biologically active mediators [^1139YryK]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury is seen following the transfusion of blood components. The reported incidence is approximately 1 in 2000 transfusions. Clinically, it is similar to adult respiratory distress syndrome. The pathophysiology is unclear but has been attributed to HLA antibodies, granulocyte antibodies, and more recently to biologically active mediators in stored blood components. We report a case with laboratory evidence that supports the role of biologically active mediators in the pathogenesis of transfusion-related acute lung injury. To our knowledge, the case reported here is the first to use lipid extractions of patient samples to determine that lipid-priming activity was present at the time transfusion-related acute lung injury was identified clinically.

### Male-predominant plasma transfusion strategy for preventing transfusion-related acute lung injury: a systematic review [^112zCXpc]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess 1) the effectiveness of male-predominant plasma transfusion strategy for preventing transfusion-related acute lung injury and related mortality; and 2) whether this effect varies across different patient subgroups.

Design

Systematic Review and meta-analysis: Data were identified by querying MEDLINE and EMBASE (including proceedings of major conferences on blood transfusions), searching the Internet for hemovigilance reports, reviewing reference lists of eligible articles and contacting experts in the field. Eligible were all studies reporting transfusion-related acute lung injury incidence, all-cause mortality (primary outcomes), hospital length of stay, time to extubation, PaO2/FIO2-ratio or blood pressure changes (secondary outcomes) in recipients of plasma transfusions containing relatively more plasma from individuals at low risk of carrying leukocyte-antibodies ("male plasma") than those receiving comparator plasma ("control plasma"). No limits were placed on study design, population or language. The only exclusion criteria were non-human subjects and lack of control group. Prespecified study quality indicators (including risk of bias assessment) and potential effect modifiers were tested using Cochran's Q Test. Final analyses using random-effects models and I2 to assess heterogeneity were performed in the subset of studies judged to provide the best evidence and separately for significantly different subgroups using STATA 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Setting

As per primary studies.

Patients/Subjects

As per primary studies.

Interventions

As per primary studies (generally: exposure to plasma containing relatively more male plasma than comparator plasma).

Measurements and Main Results

From a total of 850 retrieved records, we identified 45 eligible studies. For transfusion-related acute lung injury incidence, final analysis was restricted to 13 cohort studies and one randomized controlled trial in which transfusion-related acute lung injury cases only involved plasma transfusions. Risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury and mortality in plasma recipients exposed to men when compared with control plasma were 0.27 (95% CI, 0.20–0.38; p < 0.001; I = 0%; n = 14; 286 events) and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.80–1.00; p = 0.04; I = 79%; n = 7; 5, 710 events), respectively. No other significant interactions were found. Secondary outcomes showed similar results but were less reported and the studies were more heterogeneous. Sensitivity analyses did not alter the results. There was no evidence of publication bias.

Discussion

More than 800 million people in 17 countries are subject to male-predominant plasma transfusion policy and at least three more countries are planning or considering adoption of this strategy. On the basis of most observational data, judged to be of high quality, male-predominant plasma transfusion strategy reduces plasma-related transfusion-related acute lung injury incidence and possibly mortality. There was no evidence that the effect differs across patient subgroups, but power to detect such differences was low.

SCCM/ESICM CIRCI guideline — rating the quality of evidence across outcomes followed GRADE by initially categorizing it as high if it originated from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and low if it originated from observational data; the quality was subsequently downgraded by one or two levels for serious or very serious risk of bias, serious inconsistencies across studies, indirect evidence, sparse or imprecise data, or likely publication bias; when observational evidence had large effect sizes, evidence of a dose–response gradient, or plausible confounding that would reduce a demonstrated effect or suggest a spurious effect when results showed no effect, the quality was upgraded; by repeating this procedure, an overall quality of the evidence was obtained for each outcome and each intervention.

### Report of the ISHLT working group on primary lung graft dysfunction part IV: recipient-related risk factors and markers [^115Ej1Gs]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2005). Medium credibility.

ISHLT primary lung graft dysfunction — transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) in lung transplant recipients typically presents within 1 to 2 hours of transfusion and causes dyspnea, hypoxemia, hypotension, and bilateral pulmonary edema indistinguishable from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); unlike ARDS, it is usually transient, resolving within 72 hours, but a minority of cases are fatal (6% to 10%). The true incidence is somewhere between 0.014% and 0.08% per allogeneic blood unit transfused and 0.04% to 0.16% per patient transfused, and TRALI may be significantly underdiagnosed. Pathogenesis is typically donor antibody–mediated, with Class I and Class II anti-HLA and anti-granulocyte antibodies (anti-NA2, 5b, NB1, NB2) often traced to multiparous female donors; a "two-hit" hypothesis is proposed in which an underlying clinical condition primes endothelium and neutrophils and a second event activates neutrophils due to infusion of plasma components or lipids stored with blood components. A reported case occurred 10 weeks after transplantation in a single-lung transplant recipient after packed red cells when the blood donor had HLA-B44 antibodies present in the lung donor tissue but not the recipient, and only the grafted lung was involved.

### A structured diagnostic algorithm for patients with ARDS [^114Ng3TH]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute respiratory failure frequently fulfil the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The diagnosis is based on radiological, physiological, and clinical criteria described in the 'Berlin definition' (Table 1). Yet establishing the diagnosis of ARDS has limited treatment consequences in and of itself, as the available evidence-based interventions are mainly related to minimizing iatrogenic damage (e.g. ventilator-induced lung injury [VILI] and fluid overload) rather than the use of specific treat-ments. Whereas the intervention options for the syndrome itself are limited, adequate and timely treatment of the causal underlying condition has a major impact on the improvement of outcomes for patients with ARDS.

Table 1
Berlin definition of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

PEEP positive end-expiratory pressure

a Clinical risk factors: Pneumonia, aspiration, smoke inhalation, near drowning, sepsis, pancreati- tis, trauma, major surgery, blood transfusion (this is referred to as transfusion-related lung injury; TRALI)

The classical description of ARDS relies on the histological finding of diffuse alveolar damage secondary to another condition (one of the clinical risk factors described in Table 1). Diffuse alveolar damage is an untreatable finding and must be distinguished from a large number of diseases that also meet the ARDS syndrome definition but are treatable. Table 2 provides an overview of the differential diagnoses that must be taken into account in patients suspected of having ARDS.

Table 2
Differential diagnoses to consider in patients with ARDS

ILD interstitial lung disease, PJP Pneumocystis jirovecii, HSV Herpes simplex virus, CMV cyto- megalo virus, GPA granulomatosis with polyangiitis, EGPA eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, RA rheumatoid artritis, SLE systemic lupus erythematosus, SSc systemic sclerosis

It should be possible to establish a definitive causal diagnosis within 7 days after onset in the vast majority of patients with ARDS. Yet, the often chaotic nature of clinical reality can lead to a delayed and haphazard search for underlying causes, especially in patients with multiple important problems.

### Corticosteroids in treatment of aspiration-related acute respiratory distress syndrome: results of a retrospective cohort study [^114bCRt6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Inclusion criteria

For inclusion, the following clinical signs and symptoms after the episode of aspiration had to be present: (1) a subjective worsening of dyspnea, development of hypoxia with pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2) < 90 mmHg, radiographic pulmonary abnormalities presented by chest radiography or CT that were reviewed by two radiologists; (2) or abnormal breath sounds, fever (≥ 37.5 °C) or leukocytosis; (3) or requirement for intensive care (defined as the use of mechanical ventilation or the need for treatment with vasopressors against shock). To be included, all patients had to conform to the first item. Either the aspiration (following an episode of dysphagia, choking, vomiting or regurgitation) had been observed, or gastric contents had been suctioned from the endotracheal tube following intubation. Although, it is difficult to monitor the occurrence of aspiration, if one person with healthy lungs showed the above mentioned clinical symptoms, we considered aspiration as the root cause. After the diagnosis of aspiration-related lung injury, all patients were managed by both neurologists and pulmonologists.

The diagnosis of ARDS was established by the treating physician, and it was based on the Berlin definition. Aspiration-related ARDS was defined as ARDS developed after aspiration. Other etiologies of ARDS such as sepsis, major trauma, multiple transfusions, pulmonary contusion, and acute pancreatitis were excluded. Conditions in which patients frequently have hypoxia and diffuse pulmonary infiltration, such as pulmonary edema, congestive heart failure, interstitial lung disease, active tuberculosis, radiation pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia, widespread infection, pulmonary alveolar hemorrhage alveolar proteinosis, bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma were also ruled out.

Exclusion criteria

Patients with the following conditions were excluded: nosocomial pneumonia; severe immunosuppression (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), use of immuno-suppressant such as cytotoxic drugs, cyclosporine, monoclonal antibodies, among others); preexisting medical condition with life expectancy lower than 3 months (i.e. malignancy); pregnancy; major gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) within 3 months of the current hospitalization; acute asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or autoimmune disorders (i.e. any condition requiring more than 0.5 mg/kg/day of prednisone equivalent); and hepatic cirrhosis.

### 2024 focused update: guidelines on use of corticosteroids in sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and community-acquired pneumonia [^1152wgtS]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in ARDS — In subgroup analyses, patients who received a longer course of corticosteroids (> 7 d) had higher rates of survival than those who received a shorter course (7 d or less) (p value for subgroup interaction = 0.04, moderate credibility). The use of corticosteroids may lead to fewer days of mechanical ventilation (low certainty) and a shorter hospital length of stay (low certainty), with uncertain effects on ICU length of stay (very low certainty), neuromuscular weakness (very low certainty) and GI bleeding (low certainty). There was probably an increase in hyperglycemia (RR 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23, moderate certainty). Evidence to Recommendation states that the panel decided that corticosteroids offered moderate desirable effects, driven primarily by moderate certainty evidence that corticosteroids reduce mortality and low certainty evidence that they reduce hospital length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation, while ongoing uncertainty remained due to small positive trials, lack of long-term outcomes, and that half of included patients had COVID-19 ARDS.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Recommendation: 2A) We "suggest" administering corticosteroids to adult critically ill patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty). Remark: We make no recommendation for corticosteroid use in pediatric patients with ARDS. Evidence summary: Eighteen RCTs compared corticosteroids to placebo or standard care in adult hospitalized patients with ARDS; Twelve (67%) used American-European Consensus Conference or Berlin criteria and 6 (33%) included patients with COVID-19; corticosteroid use probably reduces 28-day mortality (RR 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72–0.95, moderate certainty) in critically ill patients with ARDS.

### Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults: an American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guideline [^111bEWar]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion in critically ill adults — background and epidemiology: In the United States, approximately 25% of critically ill patients receive RBC transfusions, totaling approximately 1.8 million units annually. The primary indication is low hemoglobin (80%), whereas less frequently encountered indications include active bleeding (27%) and hemodynamic instability (23%). Since the publication of the Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial, > 30 trials have examined RBC transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. Despite this evidence, significant variability exists in clinical practice regarding the indications for RBC transfusions, with most occurring in patients with hemoglobin levels of > 7 g/dL. Although RBC transfusions can be life-saving, they carry significant risks of adverse effects, including transfusion-related acute lung injury, transfusion-associated circulatory overload, and immunomodulating effects that may increase the risk of nosocomial infections. These side-effects may be severe and even life-threatening. The entire process, from distribution to administration of RBCs, incurs substantial costs, which vary globally.

Sepsis, septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and trauma — corticosteroid treatment recommendations are: For treatment of specific conditions, we suggest using IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for ≥ 3 days at full dose in patients with septic shock that is not responsive to fluid and moderate- to high-dose vasopressor therapy (conditional, low quality of evidence). We suggest not using corticosteroids in adult patients with sepsis without shock (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). We suggest the use of IV methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day in patients with early moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PaO2 /FIO2, < 200 and within 14 days of onset) (conditional, moderate quality of evidence). Corticosteroids are not suggested for patients with major trauma (conditional, low quality of evidence).

### Association of interventions with outcomes in children at-risk for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and epidemiology study [^114dCDV1]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Describe the frequency with which transfusion and medications that modulate lung injury are administered to children meeting at-risk for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARF-PARDS) criteria and evaluate for associations of transfusion, fluid balance, nutrition, and medications with unfavorable clinical outcomes.

Design

Secondary analysis of the Pediatric Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Incidence and Epidemiology study, a prospective point prevalence study. All enrolled ARF-PARDS patients were included unless they developed subsequent pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) within 24 hours of PICU admission or PICU length of stay was less than 24 hours. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to identify associations between therapies given during the first 2 calendar days after ARF-PARDS diagnosis and subsequent PARDS diagnosis (primary outcome), 28-day PICU-free days (PFDs), and 28-day ventilator-free days (VFDs).

Setting

Thirty-seven international PICUs.

Patients

Two hundred sixty-seven children meeting Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference ARF-PARDS criteria.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

During the first 2 days after meeting ARF-PARDS criteria, 55% of subjects received beta-agonists, 42% received corticosteroids, 28% received diuretics, and 9% were transfused. Subsequent PARDS (15%) was associated with platelet transfusion (n = 11; adjusted odds ratio: 4.75 [95% CI 1.03–21.92]) and diuretics (n = 74; 2.55 [1.19–5.46]) in multivariable analyses that adjusted for comorbidities, PARDS risk factor, initial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry:Fio2 ratio, and initial type of ventilation. Beta-agonists were associated with lower adjusted odds of subsequent PARDS (0.43 [0.19–0.98]). Platelets and diuretics were also associated with fewer PFDs and fewer VFDs in the multivariable models, and TPN was associated with fewer PFDs. Corticosteroids, net fluid balance, and volume of enteral feeding were not associated with the primary or secondary outcomes.

Conclusions

There is an independent association between platelet transfusion, diuretic administration, and unfavorable outcomes in children at risk for PARDS, although this may be related to treatment bias and unmeasured confounders. Nevertheless, prospective evaluation of the role of these management strategies on outcomes in children with ARF-PARDS is needed.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — methylprednisolone use is characterized by earlier initiation and specified dosing, with the task force noting a reduction in hospital mortality by approximately 7% and 11% in mild and severe ARDS, respectively, and that early (< 72 h) versus late (≥ 7 days) initiation shows response to a low dose (1 mg/kg/day vs 2 mg/kg/day) with faster disease resolution. An individual patient data analysis of four trials (n = 322) confirmed improved survival and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation. The task force suggested that methylprednisolone be considered in early ARDS (up to day 7 of onset; PaO2/FiO2 of < 200) at 1 mg/kg/day and in late (after day 6 of onset) persistent ARDS at 2 mg/kg/day followed by slow tapering over 13 days; methylprednisolone should be weaned slowly (6–14 days) and not stopped rapidly (2–4 days), and infection surveillance is recommended because glucocorticoids blunt the febrile response.

Acute pulmonary edema

The effect of any corticosteroid vs. placebo or no treatment is very uncertain. Four trials (381 women) reported pulmonary edema. The RR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.23 to 2.09, FE; RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.28, RE), Fig. 4. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to very low due to extremely serious imprecision.

Acute renal failure

Five trials (406 women) reported acute renal failure. Corticosteroids may result in a slight reduction in acute renal failure. The RR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.12 under both FE and RE models), Fig. 5. The certainty of evidence was low due to very serious imprecision.

Dialysis

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of corticosteroids on dialysis. The need for dialysis was reported in one study (60 women). The RR was 3 (95% CI 0.13 to 70.78). The certainty of evidence was downgraded to very low due to extremely serious imprecision.

Liver morbidity (hematoma, rupture, or failure)

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of corticosteroids on liver morbidity vs. placebo or no treatment. Based on data from two studies (91 women), the RR was 0.22 (95% CI 0.03 to 1.83 under both FE and RE models). We downgraded the certainty of evidence to very low due to extremely serious imprecision.

Platelet transfusion

Based on data from 219 women in two studies, corticosteroids have little or no difference in the need for platelet transfusion (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.60 under both FE and RE models). We downgraded the certainty of evidence to low due to very serious imprecision.

Perinatal death

The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of corticosteroids on perinatal death. Based on data from two studies (58 women), the RR was 0.64 (95% CI 0.21 to 1.97 under both FE and RE models). The certainty of evidence was very low due to extremely serious imprecision.

### Platelet transfusion associated with acute lung injury after coronary artery bypass grafting [^113giR49]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Transfusion-related acute lung injury is a potentially fatal complication of blood and plasma transfusion; however, the incidence relating to platelet use in cardiac surgery is uncommon. In the presence of normal left ventricular function, an acute increase in pulmonary capillary permeability leads to a high protein content pulmonary edema, which leads to a dramatic reduction in pulmonary function due to acute lung injury and also intravascular fluid depletion. The clinical picture is acute and the condition is associated with considerable mortality. Although the exact mechanism of transfusion-related acute lung injury is unknown, it may be due to an antibody-mediated reaction caused by preformed leukocyte antibodies or activation of inflammatory mediators. The signs, diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions are discussed with reference to a case report.

### Prospective study on the clinical course and outcomes in transfusion-related acute lung injury* [^113b4dC1]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Transfusion-related acute lung injury is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality. A prospective study using electronic surveillance was conducted at two academic medical centers in the United States with the objective to define the clinical course and outcomes in transfusion-related acute lung injury cases.

Design

Prospective case study with controls.

Setting

University of California, San Francisco and Mayo Clinic, Rochester.

Patients

We prospectively enrolled 89 patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury, 164 transfused controls, and 145 patients with possible transfusion-related acute lung injury.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury had fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and prolonged hypoxemia compared with controls. Of the patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury, 29 of 37 patients (78%) required initiation of mechanical ventilation and 13 of 53 (25%) required initiation of vasopressors. Patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury and possible transfusion-related acute lung injury had an increased duration of mechanical ventilation and increased days in the ICU and hospital compared with controls. There were 15 of 89 patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury (17%) who died, whereas 61 of 145 patients with possible transfusion-related acute lung injury (42%) died and 7 of 164 of controls (4%) died. Patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury had evidence of more systemic inflammation with increases in circulating neutrophils and a decrease in platelets compared with controls. Patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury and possible transfusion-related acute lung injury also had a statistically significant increase in plasma interleukin-8, interleukin-10, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist posttransfusion compared with controls.

Conclusions

In conclusion, transfusion-related acute lung injury produced a condition resembling the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and was associated with substantial in-hospital morbidity and mortality in patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury compared with transfused controls. Patients with possible transfusion-related acute lung injury had even higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality, suggesting that clinical outcomes in this group are mainly influenced by the underlying acute lung injury risk factor(s).

### Immune globulin intravenous (human) 10% (Bivigam) [^114areBK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)

AMS may occur infrequently with IGIV treatments including BIVIGAM. AMS usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.7,8,9

AMS is characterized by the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea, and vomiting (see Patient Counseling Information [17.3]). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies frequently reveal pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic millimeter, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.

AMS may occur more frequently in association with high doses (2 g/kg) and/or rapid infusion of IGIV.

5.6 Hemolysis

IGIV products, including BIVIGAM, may contain blood group antibodies that can act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBCs) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis.10,11,12Delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration,13and acute hemolysis, consistent with intravascular hemolysis, has been reported.

Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis (see Patient Counseling Information [17.4]). If these are present after BIVIGAM infusion, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing. If transfusion is indicated for patients who develop hemolysis with clinically compromising anemia after receiving IGIV, perform adequate cross-matching to avoid exacerbating on-going hemolysis.

5.7 Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment14including BIVIGAM. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically appear within 1 to 6 hours following treatment.

Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and the patient's serum (see Patient Counseling Information [17.5]).

TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.

### Do corticosteroids have a role in preventing or reducing acute toxic lung injury caused by inhalation of chemical agents? [^114KDp8s]. Clinical Toxicology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the evidence that treatment with corticosteroids improves the outcome in those exposed to lung-damaging agents.

Methods

We searched Pubmed, Toxnet, Cochrane database, Google Scholar, and Embase from 1966 to January 2010 using the search terms "steroid", "corticosteroid", "lung injury", "lung damage", and "inhalation". These searches identified 287 papers of which 118 contained information on animal studies. However, most were reviews or case reports and only a few were controlled animal experiments of which 13 were considered relevant. ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS:

Animal Studies

Corticosteroids have no beneficial effect at the alveolar level on acute lung injury, which is caused by inhalation of poorly water-soluble compounds (e.g. nitrogen dioxide, ozone, phosgene) or following severe exposure to water-soluble compounds (e.g. chlorine, ammonia). In the recovery phase, corticosteroids may even be harmful, because corticosteroids hamper the division of type II alveolar cells and hamper the differentiation from type II into type I alveolar cells. The latter is important for the re-epithelialization of the alveolus and removal of excess of water in the alveolus. Furthermore, the quality of animal studies does not always allow extrapolation to human exposures. Differences between humans and animals in anatomy, pulmonary defense systems, breathing physiology, as well as the way the animals have been exposed, and the timing and route of corticosteroids in animal studies make predictions difficult. ROLE OF CORTICOSTEROIDS:

Human Studies

An abundance of uncontrolled case reports and a few human crossover studies have evaluated the outcome of human volunteers exposed to various lung-damaging agents. Only a few reports contained systematic information on corticosteroid treatment. Data on the efficacy of corticosteroids after human exposure to lung-damaging agents are inconclusive. Often the number of patients involved is small or the severity of exposure is unclear or not well determined. These reports are therefore limited in their ability to establish a cause-effect relationship for the treatments involved. In some studies involving mild to moderate exposure to water-soluble agents (e.g. chlorine, ammonia), corticosteroid treatment was beneficial for some physiological parameters, such as airway resistance or arterial oxygen tension. However, severe lung injury and inflammation appear not to be improved by corticosteroid treatment. The optimal duration of treatment to obtain these beneficial effects has not been assessed adequately, but it only seems to be useful in the first hours after exposure. Generally, studies evaluating exposure to water-soluble compounds have too short a follow-up, which hampers the evaluation of the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment. The results of studies with longer follow-up suggest that the initial slight improvement in some variables is lost several hours after exposure.

Conclusions

Clinical data on the efficacy of corticosteroids after human exposure to lung-damaging agents are inconclusive as the number of well-structured controlled studies is small and the indications for administration of corticosteroids are unclear. There have been no human controlled studies of high-dose exposure to lung-damaging agents. Furthermore, treatment with corticosteroids is limited by the potential side effects, such as prolonged neuromuscular weakness, deregulation of glucose metabolism, superinfection, and sepsis, which could diminish the chances for recovery.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114wJ7CP]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — systemic corticosteroids: We suggest using corticosteroids for patients with ARDS (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). In randomized controlled trials (RCTs), corticosteroids were evaluated in 19 RCTs including 2,790 patients and probably decrease mortality (n = 17 studies; RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73–0.96; moderate certainty). Corticosteroids may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of hospital stay, but the effect on the length of ICU stay is uncertain. Safety signals include that corticosteroids probably increase the risk of serious hyperglycemia (n = 6 studies; RR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01–1.23; moderate certainty), may increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 5 studies; RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.43–3.34; low certainty), and have an uncertain effect on neuromuscular weakness (n = 2 studies; RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.62–1.18; very low certainty).

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — Special considerations and dosing note that "The 2017 SCCM/ESICM guidelines had previously recommended giving methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/d within 14 days of the diagnosis of moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio of < 200) (4)". This panel "decided to remove the qualifier based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio from the most recent recommendation". Updated analysis "did not demonstrate a differential effect based on corticosteroid timing or type or dosage", so "a specific recommendation was not made for corticosteroid molecules". Reported dosing "range from 40 mg/d to 2 mg/kg/d of methylprednisolone equivalent with a common duration ranging from 7 to 30 days", and common molecules in RCTs include "Methylprednisolone, dexamethasone, and hydrocortisone with or without fludrocortisone".

### Practice guidelines for perioperative blood management: an updated report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on perioperative blood management* [^112Mz4wJ]. Anesthesiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Appendix 4 — adverse effects associated with transfusion describe acute intravascular hemolytic transfusion reactions occurring when red cells break down due to either a complement-mediated immune mechanism (usually secondary to ABO incompatibility) or to physical damage, with treatment consisting of stopping the blood transfusion, supportive measures to maintain blood pressure, and aggressive transfusion of platelets, FFP, and cryoprecipitate while maintaining oxygen carrying capacity through transfusion of type O red blood cells. Transfusion-associated acute lung injury is stated to be now the leading cause of transfusion-associated fatalities, with symptoms that occur within 6 h after the transfusion and treatment consisting of stopping the transfusion and instituting critical care supportive measures. Bacterial contamination of blood components is most often associated with platelet transfusion as platelets are stored at 20°–24°C, and there has been a significant decrease in fatalities associated with bacterial contamination since 2001 as processes to detect bacterial contamination in platelets have been implemented.

GRADE classification of recommendation strength — strong versus conditional — is outlined with explicit implications for patients, clinicians, and policymakers as follows: Strong Recommendation "We recommend… " indicates that most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action and most individuals should receive the recommended course of action, and the recommendation can be adapted as policy in most situations, including for use as performance indicators. Conditional Recommendation "We suggest… " indicates the majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not; different choices are likely to be appropriate for different patients, and therapy should be tailored to the individual patient's circumstances; and policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders with policies more likely to vary between regions and performance indicators focusing on adequate deliberation about management options.

### Acute pulmonary injury in hematology patients supported with pathogen-reduced and conventional platelet components [^111DD38H]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Treatment-emergent assisted mechanical ventilation for pulmonary dysfunction (TEAMV-PD), including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), is a significant intervention that affects the long-term outcome of patients during treatment of hematology-oncology disorders. Immune-mediated transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a potential cause of ARDS in patients who require platelet transfusion. It is postulated platelets may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of TRALI through the induction of neutrophil extracellular traps associated with inflammatory responses. However, ARDS and other types of pulmonary injury may arise from other mechanisms of pulmonary injury in which platelet transfusion is a potential contributing factor but not the primary causal factor. In addition, contamination of platelet components (PCs) with low levels of bacteria that do not cause immediate posttransfusion sepsis may contribute to subsequent pulmonary infections. Patients with hematology-oncology disorders have concurrent microbial infections and tissue damage during extensive antineoplastic therapy that in conjunction with platelet transfusion could potentiate pulmonary injury, resulting in ARDS.

Pathogen reduction treatment of PCs (PRPCs) with amotosalen and UVA light was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014 to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Substantial data have been collected documenting the safety of amotosalen-UVA pathogen-reduced PCs. A previous publication reported that the incidence of assisted mechanical ventilation for all causes, including ARDS, was reduced in patients supported with PRPC compared with CPC. However, the effect of the intensity of platelet transfusion on the probability of all types of pulmonary injury, including ARDS, was not reported.

5.8 Hemolytic Anemia

IGIV products may contain blood group antibodies, which can act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis. Hemolytic anemia may develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced red blood cell sequestration.

Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis. If these are present after BabyBIG infusion, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing.

5.9 Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment.[14]TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically occur within 1 to 6 hours following treatment [See PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION (17)].

Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum.

TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.

### Are corticosteroids useful in late-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome? [^111CNZvz]. Respiratory Care (2010). Low credibility.

The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by intense inflammation and alveolar-capillary disruption that can progress to a state of unresolving inflammation and disordered fibrosis, referred to as fibroproliferative, late-stage, or persistent ARDS. These pathophysiologic features may be responsive to corticosteroids, but early high-dose, short-duration therapy was proven ineffective. More recently, several small and one moderate-size multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated low-to-moderate-dose prolonged corticosteroid treatment. The RCT and meta-analysis consistently demonstrated improved oxygenation and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation with methylprednisolone. The largest RCT also revealed less pneumonia and shock, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) stay, but more cases of severe myoneuropathy, with methylprednisolone. There were virtually identical 60-day and 180-day mortality rates for methylprednisolone and placebo in the largest RCT. Sub-group analysis of that study showed significantly higher mortality with methylprednisolone than with placebo when enrollment occurred > 13 days after onset of ARDS, but small sample size and differences in subject characteristics probably confound those results. Most meta-analyses demonstrated trends toward better survival with methylprednisolone, and, when restricted to patients enrolled in RCTs who received prolonged administration of methylprednisolone that was initiated within the first 14 days of ARDS, one meta-analysis demonstrated better survival with corticosteroids. Importantly, the aforementioned studies have methodological limitations, and the number of subjects enrolled was small. Experts differ in their recommendations regarding corticosteroids for late-stage ARDS, although one consensus group supported a "weak" recommendation of low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids for ARDS of < 14 days duration. If corticosteroids are administered, infection surveillance, avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, and gradual taper of corticosteroids are recommended.

### The effect of aspirin in transfusion-related acute lung injury in critically ill patients [^115VNNDG]. Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Aspirin has been found to improve outcomes in an animal model of transfusion-related acute lung injury. We examined the association of aspirin use before admission to the intensive care unit and the development of transfusion-related acute lung injury in critically ill patients. We performed a post-hoc analysis of a nested case-control study that had been undertaken in a tertiary referral hospital. Transfusion-related acute lung injury cases were matched with controls (transfused patients not developing lung injury). Of these 218 patients, 66 used aspirin (30%). Use of aspirin did not alter the risk of transfusion-related acute lung injury after transfusion of platelets (OR 1.06, CI 0.59–1.91, p = 0.85), plasma (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.59–1.92, p = 0.84), or red blood cells (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.61–1.94, p = 0.77). Adjustment for confounding variables using propensity scoring also did not affect the risk of acquiring transfusion-related acute lung injury (p = 0.66). In conclusion, aspirin did not protect against transfusion-related lung injury in this cohort of critically ill patients.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111q5Y1S]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corticosteroids in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — implementation and safety considerations are outlined as follows: Corticosteroids are widely available, low in cost, and easy to administer, yet there is substantial heterogeneity in dosing, timing, and duration with uncertainty about the optimal course, and data on short- and long-term adverse effects are limited with low- to very-low certainty for other safety outcomes. Although evidence applies to intubated ARDS, corticosteroids have demonstrated benefit in some nonintubated groups; for nonintubated individuals, corticosteroids should be administered for those with ARDS etiologies known to benefit (COVID-19, severe community-acquired pneumonia), and the role in nonintubated patients with other etiologies remains uncertain. Some conditions presenting as ARDS (severe community-acquired pneumonia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection) are known to benefit with regimens defined in large randomized controlled trials, whereas for other ARDS etiologies, several regimens used in clinical trials may reasonably be chosen based on an individual patient's risk profile for steroid side effects. The initiation of corticosteroid treatment > 2 weeks after onset of ARDS may be associated with harm, and the use of corticosteroids should be accompanied by close surveillance for adverse effects, particularly in higher-risk populations such as immunocompromised patients or those in regions endemic for tuberculosis or parasitic disease.

### Human immunoglobulin g (Asceniv) [^113tyget]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.5 Aseptic Meningitis Syndrome (AMS)

AMS may occur with IGIV treatments, including ASCENIV. AMS usually begins within several hours to 2 days following IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae.7,8,9

AMS may occur more frequently in association with high doses (2 g/kg) and/or rapid infusion of IGIV.

AMS is characterized by the following signs and symptoms: severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea, and vomiting (see Patient Counseling Information [17]). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies frequently reveal pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cubic millimeter, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL, but negative culture results. Conduct a thorough neurological examination on patients exhibiting such signs and symptoms, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis.

5.6 Hemolysis

IGIV products, including ASCENIV, may contain blood group antibodies that can act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells (RBCs) with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and hemolysis.10,11,12Delayed hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV treatment due to enhanced RBC sequestration,13and acute hemolysis, consistent with intravascular hemolysis, has been reported.

Monitor patients for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis (see Patient Counseling Information [17]). If these are present after ASCENIV infusion, perform appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing. If transfusion is indicated for patients who develop hemolysis with clinically compromising anemia after receiving IGIV, perform adequate cross-matching to avoid exacerbating ongoing hemolysis.

5.7 Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema may occur in patients following IGIV treatment,14including ASCENIV. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever. Symptoms typically appear within 1 to 6 hours following treatment.

Monitor patients for pulmonary adverse reactions. If TRALI is suspected, perform appropriate tests for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and the patient's serum (see Patient Counseling Information [17]).

TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.

### Biomarkers of acute lung injury: worth their salt? [^112JjTQb]. BMC Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

While the development of pulmonary fibrosis in a patient with ALI predicts the requirement for prolonged respiratory support and a poor outcome, relatively little is known about the processes that determine the resolution of inflammation, injury and subsequent lung repair. The consecutive three-phase pathological model of ALI (exudative, proliferative and fibrotic) is a gross over-simplification. Fibrosis is evident histologically as early as a week after the onset of the disorder and procollagen III peptide, a precursor of collagen synthesis, is elevated in the broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of ARDS patients at the time of tracheal intubation. Indeed, not only is the injured lung known to be heterogeneously affected, it also seems likely from the examination of lavage samples from patients that these pathological processes coincide in the same lung region. Similarly, while several pro-inflammatory mediators are also pro-fibrotic, distinct patterns of gene expression are associated with acute inflammation and fibrosis in the injured lung, suggesting that fibrosis is not simply an inevitable consequence of unresolved inflammation. Indeed, current thinking emphasizes the primary role of disordered epithelial repair, which may be contributed to by repeated or persistent injury and inflammation, in driving a pathological fibrotic response.

Despite years of concerted effort and very many clinical trials, a minority of which have been capable of producing a definitive result, there are no treatments (as opposed to modifications of organ support) that improve the outcome of patients with ALI. What has become evident, both in this field and in critical care in general, is the extent and importance of iatrogenic injury. Hence, half of ALI arises in patients who were subjected to mechanical ventilation for another reason: the four major culprits being mechanical ventilation that targets normal blood gas parameters, transfusion of blood products, excessive fluid resuscitation and hospital acquired pneumonia (Figure 1). Accordingly, recent epidemiological evidence suggests that targeting hospital acquired injury can halve the incidence of ARDS despite an increase in patients' severity of illness, the number of comorbidities and the prevalence of major ARDS risk factors.

### Immune globulin — Octagam immune globulin — human [^111wHU3S]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

Aseptic meningitis syndrome

Aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has resulted in remission of AMS within several days without sequelae. The syndrome usually begins within several hours to two days following IGIV treatment and rapid infusion. It is characterized by symptoms and signs including severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, nausea and vomiting. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cu mm, predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dl. Patients exhibiting such symptoms and signs should receive a thorough neurological examination, including CSF studies, to rule out other causes of meningitis. It appears that patients with a history of migraine may be more susceptible. [7] (See Patient Counselling Information [17]).

Hemolysis

IGIV products can contain blood group antibodies which may act as hemolysins and induce in vivo coating of red blood cells with immunoglobulin, causing a positive direct antiglobulin reaction and, rarely, hemolysis [8]. Hemolytic anemia can develop subsequent to IGIV therapy due to enhanced RBC sequestration [See ADVERSE REACTIONS] [9]. IGIV recipients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of hemolysis. If signs and/or symptoms of hemolysis are present after IGIV infusion, appropriate confirmatory laboratory testing should be done (See Patient Counseling Information [17]).

Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

There have been reports of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema [Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)] in patients administered IGIV [10]. TRALI is characterized by severe respiratory distress, pulmonary edema, hypoxemia, normal left ventricular function, and fever and typically occurs within 1–6 hours after transfusion. Patients with TRALI may be managed using oxygen therapy with adequate ventilatory support.

IGIV recipients should be monitored for pulmonary adverse reactions (See Patient Counseling Information [17]). If TRALI is suspected, appropriate tests should be performed for the presence of anti-neutrophil antibodies in both the product and patient serum.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116PFfW3]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Key messages

• ARDS is a heterogeneous disease with various etiologies and clinical courses. The effects of corticosteroids on ARDS were inconsistent in previous studies due to different outcome measures and study populations.

• This meta-analysis evaluated short-term and longer-term effects of corticosteroids on ARDS mortality. Pooled data showed that corticosteroid therapy did not decrease longer-term mortality.

• The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy differed in different etiologies of ARDS. Corticosteroids might cause harm in certain subgroups of ARDS patients, such as influenza-related ARDS.

• Current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids for ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to improve the overall quality of evidence and to specify the unfavorable and favorable subgroups of ARDS patients for corticosteroid therapy.

### Risk factors and outcome of transfusion-related acute lung injury in the critically ill: a nested case-control study [^11437eHn]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the incidence, risk factors, and outcome of transfusion-related acute lung injury in a cohort of critically ill patients.

Design

In a retrospective cohort study, patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury were identified using the consensus criteria of acute lung injury within 6 hrs after transfusion. Inclusion criterion was a length of intensive care unit admission > 48 hrs. Patients developing transfusion-related acute lung injury were matched (on age, sex, and admission diagnosis) to transfused control subjects and patients developing acute lung injury from another origin.

Setting

Tertiary referral hospital.

Patients

All first-admitted patients from November 1, 2004, until October 1, 2007, to the intensive care unit.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Of 5208 admitted patients, 2024 patients had a length of stay > 48 hrs, of whom 109 were suspected transfusion-related acute lung injury cases. Compared with transfused control subjects, risk factors for transfusion-related acute lung injury were emergency cardiac surgery (odds ratio, 17.6 [1.8–168.5]), hematologic malignancy (odds ratio, 13.1 [2.7–63.8]), massive transfusion (odds ratio, 4.5 [2.1–9.8]), sepsis (odds ratio, 2.5 [1.2–5.2]), mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 3.0 [1.3–7.1], and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.1 [1.0–1.1]; p < .03 for all). The volume of platelets and plasma transfused was associated with transfusion-related acute lung injury in the univariate analysis. However, this association disappeared in the multivariate analysis. Compared with acute lung injury control subjects, risk factors for transfusion-related acute lung injury were sepsis (odds ratio, 2.4 [1.1–5.3]) and high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (odds ratio, 1.1 [1.0–1.1]), whereas pneumonia (odds ratio, 0.4 [0.2–0.7]) was a negative predictive factor. Patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation compared with transfused control subjects and acute lung injury control subjects (231 [138–472] vs. 71 [46–163] and 70 [42–121] hrs, p < .001). Also, 90-day survival of patients with transfusion-related acute lung injury was lower compared with transfused control subjects and acute lung injury control subjects (53% vs. 75% and 83%, p < .02).

Conclusions

Transfusion-related acute lung injury is common in critically ill patients. Transfusion-related acute lung injury may contribute to an adverse outcome associated with transfusion. This study identifies transfusion-related acute lung injury risk factors, which may aid in assessing the risks and benefits of transfusion in critically ill patients.

### Treatment of bleeding in patients with liver disease [^113itP4Y]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

There is no definitive evidence that correction of thrombocytopenia, a prolonged PT, or abnormal TEG or ROTEM tests by infusion of FFP, platelet concentrates, or low volume coagulation factor concentrates is effective at achieving a more rapid hemostasis. There are no clinical studies evaluating adequate platelet thresholds for the purpose of enhancing hemostasis in the bleeding cirrhosis patient. Furthermore, transfusions with platelet concentrates are frequently complicated by febrile reactions and less commonly by potentially life‐threatening transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) and transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO). Importantly, the risk of TRALI appears to be increased in patients with underlying liver disease. Platelet concentrates have been dose‐dependently associated with increased mortality in the setting of liver transplantation. Similarly, there is no evidence of benefit of FFP, but transfusion‐related side effects have significant potential to harm the patient with cirrhosis. In addition, the large volumes of FFP realistically needed to improve the INR makes transfusion of FFP very likely more harmful than beneficial in the treatment of variceal bleeding. Therefore, in the cirrhosis population, the use of FFP during acute variceal bleeding cannot be recommended. Lower volume factor replacements like the prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) and rVIIa are more effective than FFP in decreasing INR values in cirrhosisand do not carry the risk of volume overload. However, their use in acute variceal bleeding has not been adequately studied and could theoretically increase thrombotic risk.

### Exploring the heterogeneity of effects of corticosteroids on acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111fWBdf]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

The effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy on the mortality of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains under debate. We aimed to explore the grounds for the inconsistent results in previous studies and update the evidence.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science up to December 2013. Eligible studies included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that reported mortality and that had corticosteroid nonusers for comparison. The effect of corticosteroids on ARDS mortality was assessed by relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) for ICU, hospital, and 60-day mortality using a random-effects model.

Results

Eight RCTs and 10 cohort studies were included for analysis. In RCTs, corticosteroids had a possible but statistically insignificant effect on ICU mortality (RD, −0.28; 95% confidence interval (CI), −0.53 to −0.03 and RR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.25) but no effect on 60-day mortality (RD, −0.01; 95% CI, −0.12 to 0.10 and RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.26). In cohort studies, corticosteroids had no effect on ICU mortality (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.49) but non-significantly increased 60-day mortality (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.78). In the subgroup analysis by ARDS etiology, corticosteroids significantly increased mortality in influenza-related ARDS (three cohort studies, RR, 2.45, 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.27).

Conclusions

The effects of corticosteroids on the mortality of ARDS differed by duration of outcome measures and etiologies. Corticosteroids did not improve longer-term outcomes and may cause harm in certain subgroups. Current data do not support routine use of corticosteroids in ARDS. More clinical trials are needed to specify the favorable and unfavorable subgroups for corticosteroid therapy.

Sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) corticosteroid guidance — in response to the five PICOs, the panel issued four recommendations addressing corticosteroid use, including a conditional recommendation to administer corticosteroids for patients with septic shock and critically ill patients with ARDS and a strong recommendation for use in hospitalized patients with severe CAP. The panel also recommended against high dose/short duration administration of corticosteroids for septic shock, and for ARDS was unable to provide specific recommendations regarding corticosteroid molecule, dose, and duration of therapy based on currently available evidence. New evidence was "warranting a focused update of the 2017 guideline", and a 22-member panel developed evidence-based recommendations for hospitalized adults and children.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^114ibjAp]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Methylprednisolone — corticosteroid, anti-inflammatory agent — has pharmacologic action described as a potent glucocorticoid with minimal to no mineralocorticoid activity that modulates carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism and maintenance of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, and controls or prevents inflammation by controlling rate of protein synthesis, suppressing migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and fibroblasts, reversing capillary permeability, and stabilizing lysosomes at cellular level. Indications are for the management of acute bronchospastic disease as well as for adrenal insufficiency, and contraindications include untreated serious infections, documented hypersensitivity, IM route is contraindicated in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and traumatic brain injury (high doses).

### Mortality reduction in pediatric patients with severe fatal human adenoviral pneumonia treated with high titer neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) plasma: a retrospective cohort study [^117UnBZJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

It is worth mentioning that high titer NAbs plasma belongs to blood products. Transfusion-related adverse events may occur in the transfusion of blood products, including fever (58.5%), anaphylaxis (1.4%), hypotension (0.9%), haemolytic reactions (5.2%), transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) (0.3%), transfusion associated circulatory overload (0.6%) and so on. Among them, TRALI is the leading cause of transfusion-related death. Another study had shown that the incidence of TRALI was 5.1% (114 of 2235). Patients with severe viral infection have significant acute lung injury, plasma transfusion may aggravate lung injury. In our study, most patients tolerated high titer NAbs plasma transfusion well, only 1 patient had scattered red rash throughout the body during the process of high titer NAbs plasma infusion. However, the rash quickly subsided after the treatment of promethazine and a slower rate of plasma infusion, and no other adverse reactions were observed. As everyone knows, Human leukocyte antigen antibodies (HLA-Ab) from the donor are a primary cause of TRALI. Nevertheless, infectious pathogens can trigger the formation and rise of specific HLA-Ab reactivity via multiple mechanisms. Recently, one study performed universal screening of HLA-Ab for all convalescent plasma. They found that 5 (7.2%) of 69 male patients were HLA-Ab positive. Unlike convalescent plasma donors who have recently recovered from viral infection high titer NAbs plasma from regular blood donors may contain little HLA-Ab. As a result, high titer NAbs plasma is relatively safe, but it is still recommended to monitor and manage the possible adverse reactions according to the guidelines related to blood transfusion.

Several limitations of our study should also be recognized. First, this study was conducted in a single center. It could also indicate that the conventional treatment was more consistent. Second, because the proper high titer NAbs plasma was limited, the study was not randomized and the sample size was small. The efficacy of the study was inadequate to estimate the association between treatment and mortality with sufficient adjustment for confounding. A randomized controlled multicenter study will be required in the future. In addition, we did not dynamically monitor the viral load in patients. Viremia peaks in patients with severe fatal HAdV pneumonia may not be consistent, the dynamic monitoring of gland viral load may help to find the best time to use high titer NAbs plasma and clarify mechanism.
