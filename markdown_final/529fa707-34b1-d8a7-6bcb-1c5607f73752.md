## Question

resistant esbl

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about managing resistant ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the clinical scenario and scope of "resistant ESBL". Then, I should verify the hierarchy of evidence and guidelines to anchor recommendations. Next, I will examine site-specific management for urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections, and intra-abdominal infections. After that, I need to consider special populations and stewardship constraints. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and highlight controversies and knowledge gaps, ensuring I cite the most current IDSA guidance and pivotal trials throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct. "Resistant ESBL" typically refers to ESBL-producing Enterobacterales that are non-susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and often co-resistant to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, which constrains oral options and pushes therapy toward carbapenems or carefully selected alternatives; I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary epidemiology and resistance patterns, including the dominance of CTX-M enzymes and frequent co-resistance, which it does [^c98612f4] [^d4e793fd].

> Next, I should review the evidence hierarchy to avoid overinterpreting observational data. The strongest guidance comes from IDSA 2023–2024 updates, with supportive data from the MERINO randomized trial for bloodstream infection, and ESCMID 2022 for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections; I need to ensure I weigh these higher-credibility sources over older or nonrandomized studies when making definitive recommendations [^be16052a] [^70e3a939] [^ece28ce6].

> For urinary tract infections, I will now examine site-specific therapy. For uncomplicated cystitis, nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX are preferred if susceptible, with ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems as alternatives; single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin (E. coli only) are additional options, but I should confirm that fosfomycin is not reliable for Klebsiella due to fosA, which IDSA notes, so I should avoid fosfomycin in Klebsiella cystitis [^084d1a72] [^ba4b95b0]. For pyelonephritis or complicated UTI, TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone are preferred if susceptible, with ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem-cilastatin as preferred when oral agents are inactive or contraindicated; aminoglycosides are alternatives, though nephrotoxicity and CLSI breakpoint changes warrant caution, and I should double-check that plazomicin data support this risk framing, which it does [^868445cc] [^ce01c77f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about piperacillin-tazobactam in UTIs. I initially thought piperacillin-tazobactam might be reasonable for pyelonephritis based on older observational data, but wait, let me verify against the most recent guidance; IDSA advises against piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI despite susceptibility, given concerns about microbiologic failure and the totality of evidence, so I should correct that earlier inclination and avoid piperacillin-tazobactam for these indications [^ad9c486b] [^7159bc0f].

> For bloodstream infections and other invasive infections outside the urinary tract, I need to ensure I anchor on the highest-quality evidence. Carbapenems are first-line: meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred, especially in critically ill or hypoalbuminemic patients, with ertapenem reasonable in stable patients with normal albumin; the MERINO RCT showed higher 30-day mortality with piperacillin-tazobactam versus meropenem, and IDSA extrapolates this to all invasive ESBL-E infections, so I should not substitute piperacillin-tazobactam for definitive therapy in this setting [^be16052a] [^70e3a939] [^b5e05467]. I should confirm duration: 7–14 days is typical depending on source control and clinical response, with step-down to oral TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone only if susceptible and the patient is clinically improving [^notfound].

> For intra-abdominal infections, I should review both empiric and targeted strategies. Empirically, if ESBL risk is high, ceftazidime-avibactam plus metronidazole or ceftolozane-tazobactam plus metronidazole are reasonable carbapenem-sparing options; once the pathogen is identified as ESBL-E, a carbapenem remains preferred, with step-down to an active oral fluoroquinolone or TMP-SMX if susceptible and the patient is stable; I need to ensure I align this with SIS 2024 and IDSA positions, which support these approaches while emphasizing source control and stewardship [^af41901a] [^f8ec23bb] [^be16052a].

> Now, I should consider special populations and stewardship guardrails. In pediatrics, carbapenems remain first-line for invasive ESBL-E infections, with amikacin often retaining activity when gentamicin is resistant; I should confirm that pediatric-specific PK/PD data are limited and that stewardship to avoid empiric carbapenems in non-severe UTIs is emphasized, which it is [^75ae50f2] [^7c6db8dd]. In pregnancy, I need to ensure agents are safe: beta-lactams, including carbapenems, are generally preferred, and I should avoid fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides when possible due to fetal risks, adjusting based on susceptibilities and severity [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the role of newer beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors. Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and cefiderocol have reliable activity against ESBL-E, but IDSA recommends reserving these agents primarily for carbapenem-resistant organisms or polymicrobial infections including CRE, to preserve activity and mitigate cost; I should double-check that this stewardship stance is consistent across 2023–2024 updates, which it is [^edefd257] [^fccdbb51] [^daa8207a].

> But wait, what if the isolate tests "susceptible" to cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam — can I use them? I should confirm IDSA's caution here. For cefepime, IDSA advises avoiding its use for ESBL-E pyelonephritis, cUTI, or invasive infections despite in vitro susceptibility due to unreliable MIC testing and lack of supportive clinical data; for piperacillin-tazobactam, IDSA advises against its use for ESBL-E infections outside the urinary tract and expresses concern even in UTIs, so I should not rely on susceptibility alone to override these recommendations [^9c8963d8] [^ad9c486b].

> I will now examine controversies and knowledge gaps so I don't overstate certainty. The MERINO trial definitively shifted practice away from piperacillin-tazobactam for ESBL-E bacteremia, but carbapenem-sparing options for invasive disease remain investigational; ongoing RCTs may clarify roles for cefepime-enmetazobactam and other combinations, and ESCMID emphasizes the very low certainty of evidence for many non-carbapenem strategies, reinforcing a conservative stance pending stronger data [^b5e05467] [^ece28ce6].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check it against guidelines. First, classify infection site and severity and obtain timely susceptibilities; second, for uncomplicated cystitis, prioritize nitrofurantoin or TMP-SMX if susceptible, with carbapenems reserved for oral failures; third, for pyelonephritis or cUTI, use TMP-SMX or a fluoroquinolone if susceptible, otherwise a carbapenem, avoiding piperacillin-tazobactam; fourth, for bloodstream or other invasive infections, use meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, consider ertapenem only if stable and not critically ill, and step down to an active oral agent if susceptible; fifth, for intra-abdominal infections, employ carbapenem-sparing empiric regimens when ESBL risk is high, then de-escalate to carbapenems if ESBL-E is confirmed; throughout, engage ID consultation and apply stewardship to reserve last-line BL/BLIs for CRE or complex polymicrobial scenarios [^be16052a] [^af41901a] [^edefd257].

> Finally, I should confirm infection control and prevention elements because therapy alone is insufficient. ESBL-E are often healthcare-associated and carry plasmid-mediated co-resistances; strict adherence to hand hygiene, contact precautions when indicated, and antimicrobial stewardship are essential to curb transmission and preserve future options, which is repeatedly emphasized by CDC and IDSA guidance [^36ad4a71] [^14c798ef].

Resistant ESBL infections are best managed with **carbapenems as first-line therapy** for severe or invasive disease, with **fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX for susceptible urinary infections** [^38b90ac5] [^868445cc]. Piperacillin-tazobactam is **not recommended for bloodstream infections** due to higher mortality in RCTs, though it may be considered for low-risk urinary infections if MIC ≤ 16 mg/L [^be16052a] [^7159bc0f]. Newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam) are reserved for **carbapenem-resistant organisms** or when carbapenems are contraindicated [^edefd257] [^fccdbb51]. Therapy should be guided by susceptibilities, infection site, and patient factors, with **ID consultation for complex cases** [^66f92dbc].

---

## Clinical significance of ESBL resistance

ESBLs confer resistance to penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, often with co-resistance to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides, limiting options and increasing morbidity and mortality [^c98612f4] [^d4e793fd]. ESBL-E are a **serious public health threat**, with 197,400 cases and 9,100 deaths in the US in 2017 [^36ad4a71].

---

## First-line treatment options

### Carbapenems

Carbapenems are the **cornerstone of therapy** for severe ESBL infections (sepsis, pneumonia, intra-abdominal, and bloodstream infections) [^be16052a]. Meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, and ertapenem are preferred; ertapenem is suitable for outpatient therapy due to once-daily dosing [^be16052a]. In critically ill or hypoalbuminemic patients, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are preferred over ertapenem [^be16052a].

---

### Fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)

For susceptible urinary infections (cystitis, pyelonephritis, complicated UTI), **fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) or TMP-SMX are preferred** [^868445cc] [^ce01c77f]. Carbapenems are reserved when oral agents are inactive or contraindicated [^868445cc].

---

## Alternative treatment options

### Piperacillin-tazobactam

Piperacillin-tazobactam is **controversial**: it is not recommended for bloodstream infections due to higher mortality in RCTs, but may be considered for low-risk urinary infections if MIC ≤ 16 mg/L [^be16052a] [^7159bc0f].

---

### Newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations

Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, imipenem-relebactam, and ceftolozane-tazobactam are **reserved for carbapenem-resistant organisms** or when carbapenems are contraindicated [^edefd257] [^fccdbb51]. They have robust ESBL activity but should be stewarded to preserve efficacy [^b93d3f27].

---

### Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin

Aminoglycosides (amikacin, gentamicin) are **alternatives for urinary infections**, especially when oral options are limited [^868445cc]. Fosfomycin is an option for uncomplicated E. coli cystitis, but not for pyelonephritis or non-E. coli organisms [^084d1a72] [^ba4b95b0].

---

## Factors influencing treatment choice

- **Infection site and severity**: Carbapenems for severe or invasive disease; oral agents for uncomplicated UTIs [^be16052a] [^868445cc].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Allergies, renal function, and comorbidities guide selection [^notfound].
- **Local resistance patterns**: Susceptibility testing is essential to guide therapy [^5d5e0d41].
- **Clinical stability**: Stable patients may receive oral therapy; unstable patients require IV therapy [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and effectiveness

Carbapenems achieve high clinical and microbiologic cure rates in severe ESBL infections [^4f7aa318]. Fluoroquinolones and TMP-SMX are effective for susceptible urinary infections [^868445cc]. Piperacillin-tazobactam is **inferior to carbapenems in bloodstream infections** [^be16052a] [^b5e05467].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

| **Infection type** | **Preferred treatment** | **Alternative treatment** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe/invasive infections | Carbapenems (meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, ertapenem) | Newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors if carbapenem-resistant |
| Uncomplicated cystitis | Nitrofurantoin, TMP-SMX | Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, single-dose aminoglycoside, fosfomycin (E. coli) |
| Pyelonephritis/cUTI | TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin | Carbapenems if oral agents inactive |
| Bloodstream infections | Carbapenems | Newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors if carbapenem-resistant |

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Cefiderocol**: A siderophore cephalosporin with activity against ESBL-E, including MBL producers [^0eb2e659].
- **Aztreonam-avibactam**: In development for MBL-producing Enterobacterales [^notfound].
- **Rapid diagnostics**: Improved β-lactamase detection to enable targeted therapy and stewardship [^4e98fead].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Carbapenems remain **first-line for severe ESBL infections**, with fluoroquinolones or TMP-SMX for susceptible urinary infections [^38b90ac5] [^868445cc]. Piperacillin-tazobactam is not recommended for bloodstream infections but may be considered for low-risk urinary infections with low MICs [^be16052a] [^7159bc0f]. Newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors are reserved for carbapenem-resistant organisms or when carbapenems are contraindicated [^edefd257] [^fccdbb51]. Therapy should be individualized based on susceptibilities, infection site, and patient factors, with ID consultation for complex cases [^66f92dbc].

Conclusions

None of the antimicrobials currently in development has activity against the entire spectrum of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. The mortality associated with the failure rates from the current salvage therapies highlighted above is disconcerting. The treatment of serious infections with CRE remains an enormous challenge. A concerted global commitment to the intelligent use of antimicrobials, better antibiotic stewardship, the implementation of effective infection control strategies, and the development of more effective therapies are desperately needed.

Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial-resistant infections are commonly encountered in US hospitals and result in significant morbidity and mortality. This guidance document provides recommendations for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa).

Methods

A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated common questions regarding the treatment of ESBL-E, CRE, and DTR-P. aeruginosa infections. Based on review of the published literature and clinical experience, the panel provide recommendations and associated rationale for each recommendation. Because of significant differences in the molecular epidemiology of resistance and the availability of specific anti-infective agents globally, this document focuses on treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the United States.

Results

Approaches to empiric treatment selection, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are briefly discussed. The majority of guidance focuses on preferred and alternative treatment recommendations for antimicrobial-resistant infections, assuming that the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility testing results are known. Treatment recommendations apply to both adults and children.

Conclusions

The field of antimicrobial resistance is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections will continue to challenge clinicians. This guidance document is current as of 17 September 2020. Updates to this guidance document will occur periodically as new data emerge. Furthermore, the panel will expand recommendations to include other problematic gram-negative pathogens in future versions.

### Current options for the treatment of infections due to extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in different groups of patients [^800ad962]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) are a frequent cause of invasive infections worldwide. Carbapenems are nowadays the most used drugs to treat these infections. However, due to the increasing rates of resistance to these antimicrobials, carbapenem-sparing alternatives are being investigated.

Objectives and Sources

The aim of this narrative literature review is to summarize the published information on the currently available antibiotics for the treatment of ESBL-E infections, providing specific information on three subgroups of patients: Group 1, patients with severe infections or infections from high-risk sources or in severely immunocompromised patients; Group 2, patients with non-severe infections from intermediate-risk source; and Group 3, patients with non-severe urinary tract infection.

Content and Implications

For patients in Group 1, the current data would support the use of carbapenems. For milder infections, however, particularly urinary tract infections, other non-carbapenem antibiotics can be considered in selected cases, including beta-lactam/beta-lactam inhibitor combinations, cephamycins, temocillin and aminoglycosides. While specific studies should be performed in these situations, individualized decisions may be taken in order to avoid overuse of carbapenems.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^14279f43]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Current treatment options for infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae

The optimal treatment of infections with CRE is uncertain, as most data come from retrospective case series and anecdotal case reports; few prospective studies or randomized controlled trials are published on this topic. Since carbapenem-producing organisms are often resistant to other antimicrobial classes in addition to most beta-lactams, additional susceptibility testing to antimicrobials such as colistin, fosfomycin, tigecycline, aztreonam, and rifampin is needed. Consultations from experts in the treatment of infections with multidrug-resistant organisms may also prove valuable in patient management. The following antimicrobial therapies have been used with various levels of success in the treatment of CRE infections.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases: implications for the clinical microbiology laboratory, therapy, and infection control [^26d76dd0]. The Journal of Infection (2003). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing gram-negative bacilli are a growing concern in human medicine today. When producing these enzymes, organisms (mostly K. pneumoniae and E. coli) become highly efficient at inactivating the newer third-generation cephaloporins (such as cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). In addition, ESBL-producing bacteria are frequently resistant to many classes of non-beta-lactam antibiotics, resulting in difficult-to-treat infections. This review gives an introduction into the topic and is focused on various aspects of ESBLs; it covers the current epidemiology, the problems of ESBL detection and the clinical relevance of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms. Therapeutic options and potential strategies for dealing with this growing problem are also discussed in this article.

### Β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor combinations in the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing enterobacteriaceae: time for a reappraisal in the era of few antibiotic options? [^e79c12ba]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

The spread of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes in Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp is a major challenge to modern medical practice. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for serious infections caused by ESBL producers; however, carbapenem resistance has increased globally. ESBL producers might be susceptible to β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combination antibiotics such piperacillin-tazobactam or amoxicillin-clavulanate. These drugs are frequently avoided in serious infections caused by ESBL producers because of the inoculum effect in-vitro (especially for piperacillin-tazobactam), animal data suggesting inferior efficacy when compared with carbapenems, concerns about pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug target attainment with standard doses, and poor outcomes shown in some observational studies. Prospective cohort data and a meta-analysis suggest that BLBLIs are non-inferior to carbapenems in the treatment of bloodstream infections caused by ESBL producers. We examine why BLBLIs are perceived as inferior in the treatment of infection with ESBL producers, and discuss data that suggest these concerns might not be strongly supported by clinical evidence.

### Controversies over the management of infections caused by amp-C-and ESBL-producing enterobacterales: what questions remain for future studies? [^c66b99dc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The continuous rise in infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- or AmpC-producing Enterobacterales ) is a major health concern. Carbapenems are regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of these infections. However, their indiscriminant use is not without consequences, and has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales .In this review, we discuss the available evidence supporting the use of other betalactams, nonbetalactams and the new betalactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLA/BLI) to treat these infections. We also analyze unresolved issues in this field.

Recent Findings

Piperacillin tazobactam (PTZ) was classically recommended as a carbapenem-sparing agent. However, data have emerged against its use and it is now a controversial recommendation. IDSA, European and British guidelines reject the empirical use of PTZ for these pathogens, reserving its use for rare clinical situations.Other issues that continue to generate debate are the use of extended infusion (3h) PTZ, the use of older antibiotics, a shortened course of carbapenems and reserving the new BLA/BLI for these infections.

Summary

New treatment strategies should be based on clinical evidence, local epidemiology and the microbiological activity of these drugs.

### Risks of extended-spectrum β-lactamases [^0b25f120]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2008). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are an increasingly important cause of multi-drug resistant infections throughout the world.1,2 Bacteria carrying such enzymes have long been recognised as a cause of healthcare-associated infection.3 However, of concern, the incidence of such organisms also appears to be increasing in the community, typically as a cause of urinary tract infection.1,4 Infections due to ESBL-producing organisms can pose a major threat to life; are often difficult and expensive to treat; and can delay discharge from hospital.5(-)8 Here we discuss the bacteria that produce ESBLs and treatment of patients who are infected with such organisms.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^868445cc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.2—ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) treatment: Suggested approach states that TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin are preferred treatment options for pyelonephritis or cUTIs caused by ESBL-E, with ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem-cilastatin preferred when resistance or toxicities preclude TMP-SMX or fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides as alternative options. The rationale specifies that these agents are preferred assuming in vitro susceptibility; carbapenems are also preferred when resistance or toxicities prevent use or early if the patient is critically ill, and if a carbapenem is initiated and susceptibility to TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin is demonstrated, transitioning to oral formulations is preferred over completing a carbapenem course. Aminoglycosides are considered alternative because of nephrotoxicity risk; in a clinical trial of 609 adults receiving plazomicin once daily compared to meropenem for cUTI and pyelonephritis, an increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg above baseline occurred in 7% vs 4%. Additional considerations include that in 2023 the CLSI revised gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin breakpoints for Enterobacterales; aminoglycosides may be reasonable for completing treatment courses given prolonged renal cortical activity and convenience of once daily dosing, and duration-dependent nephrotoxicity risks should be considered. Fosfomycin is not suggested for pyelonephritis or cUTI given limited renal parenchymal concentrations; more data are needed, and a clinical trial of 97 women with E. coli pyelonephritis reported approximately half with bacteremia, up to 5 days of IV therapy, and participants subsequently transitioned to either once-daily 3 g.

### Diagnosis and treatment of extended-spectrum and ampC β-lactamase-producing organisms [^6505c50d]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the laboratory diagnosis of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing bacteria and evaluate potential treatment options.

Data Sources

A PubMed search, restricted to English-language articles, was conducted (1966-May 2007) using the search terms ESBL, AmpC, diagnosis, detection, carbapenem, ertapenem, fluoroquinolone, cephalosporin, cefepime, tigecycline, and colistin. Additional references were identified through review of bibliographies of identified articles.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that evaluated laboratory methods for the detection of ESBLs and AmpC beta-lactamases and/or the treatment of these organisms were reviewed. All articles that were deemed to be clinically pertinent were included and critically evaluated.

Data Synthesis

Numerous laboratory techniques are available for the detection of ESBLs. In contrast, laboratory techniques for detection of AmpC beta-lactamases are limited, particularly for plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. Routine microbiologic testing may not detect ESBLs or AmpC beta-lactamases. Optimal antibiotic treatment options are derived from limited observational studies and case reports. Randomized clinical trials evaluating appropriate antibiotic treatment options are lacking. In vitro susceptibility does not always correlate with clinical outcomes. The use of imipenem was associated with the lowest incidence of mortality in patients with bacteremia due to ESBL-producing organisms.

Conclusions

Laboratory detection of ESBLs for most organisms is possible with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute-recommended testing. However, these tests can be associated with both false negative and false positive results, particularly with organisms that harbor both ESBL- and plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamases. No established guidelines exist for the detection of AmpC beta-lactamases. Imipenem and meropenem are superior to other antibiotics for the treatment of serious infections due to ESBL and AmpC beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria. While in vitro data demonstrate that tigecycline, ertapenem, and colistin might be potential choices, clinical experience is lacking.

### New treatment options for multiresistant Gram negatives [^6a3d0678]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria infections are listed among the top public health threats of the current era. As a result, there has been an increase in efforts to develop new therapeutic agents against MDR Gram-negatives. The purpose of this review is to summarize the clinical and preclinical findings associated with recently approved drugs and the drugs in clinical development against ESBL and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections.

Recent Findings

There are a number of ESBL active agents in late stage clinical development that can help spare carbapenems. Likewise, recently approved β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations allow a change in the treatment of KPC and OXA-48 producers and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa from colistin to new, safer agents. Treatment of Meta-beta-lactamase (MBL) producers remains an unmet need - apart from cefiderocol, most agents with MBL activity are still in clinical development. Among the few agents with carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii activity, durlobactam/sulbactam in phase III clinical trials provides hope.

Summary

Armamentarium against MDR Gram-negatives has expanded with the dominance of agents active against ESBL and KPC producers. There is a need to prioritize MBL producers and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, as well as the need for clinical trials to test the new agents against serious infections.

### Treatment for infections with carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae: what options do we still have? [^002d78f8]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Review

Introduction

The global spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has become a major challenge in clinical and public health settings. Infections with CRE organisms that are multidrug-resistant (that is, non-susceptible to at least one antimicrobial in at least three antimicrobial classes), extensively drug-resistant (that is, non-susceptible to at least one antimicrobial from all but one or two antimicrobial classes), or pan-drug-resistant (that is, non-susceptible to all antimicrobial agents) are difficult to treat. As a result, severe infections with CRE have significant morbidity, mortality, and health-care costs [-]. Most CRE have beta-lactamases belonging to the Ambler class A, B, and D. Table 1 summarizes main examples from each class of carbapenemase-producing organisms.

Table 1 
Characteristics associated with carbapenemase - producing organisms commonly encountered in clinical practice

ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; KPC, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase; NDM, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase; OXA, oxacillin-hydrolyzing.

Carbapenems are no longer fully effective in the CRE epidemic. The paucity of novel antimicrobials in development escalates the antimicrobial resistance problem, severely reducing the available therapeutic choices. In this review, we will summarize the main treatment options used in clinical practice as well as the few antimicrobials currently in development. For issues related to the epidemiology, detection, and prevention of infections with CRE, the reader is referred to several excellent reviews published on this topic.

Administer ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems as alternative options. Do not use the latter if nitrofurantoin and TMP/SMX are active. Administer a single-dose aminoglycoside or oral fosfomycin (for E. coli only) as another alternative option.

### Treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamases infections: what is the current role of new β-lactams / β-lactamase inhibitors? [^17c476c7]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The widespread diffusion of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs)-producing Enterobacteriales currently represents a major threat for public health worldwide. Carbapenems are currently considered the first-line choice for serious ESBL infections. However, the dramatic global increase in ESBL prevalence has led to a significant overuse of carbapenems that has promoted the selection and spread of carbapenemases, which might further prejudicated our ability to treat infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, strategies to limit the use of carbapenems should be implemented.

Recent Findings

Although piperacillin-tazobactam should no longer be considered an alternative to carbapenems for definitive treatment of bloodstream infections due to ESBL-producing strains, it might still represent an alternative for step-down therapy or for low-to-moderate severity infection originating from urinary or biliary sources and when piperacillin-tazobactam minimum inhibitory concentration of 4mg/l or less. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious ESBL infections. New β-lactams/β-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLI), including cefepime-enmetazobactam, ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam, aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam, are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy relative to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/β-lactamase inhibitors remain to be clarified.

Summary

New BL/BLI have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their administering for ESBL infections.

### About ESBL-producing enterobacterales (...) [^36ad4a71]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales are resistant to common antibiotics and may require complex treatments.
- Infections caused by ESBL-E can occur both in and outside of healthcare settings.
- Good hand hygiene and infection prevention practices can help reduce infection risk. Overview Enterobacterales Enterobacterales are a group of bacteria that cause infections in healthcare settings and communities. Some species are also a normal part of the human gut. ESBL-producing Enterobacterales Some Enterobacterales produce enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Antimicrobial resistance ESBLs break down certain antibiotics, making some infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales difficult to treat. Prevalence In 2017, there were an estimated 197, 400 cases of ESBL-E among hospitalized patients and 9, 100 estimated deaths in the United States.

Types ESBL-producing Enterobacterales include germs like Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Signs and symptoms ESBL-E can cause several different infections, including urinary tract and bloodstream infections. These bacteria can also live in a patient without causing infection or symptoms, known as colonization. Testing To determine if someone has an ESBL-E infection, healthcare providers will send a specimen to the laboratory for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. CDC provides data that can be used for setting breakpoints for interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Treatment and recovery Antimicrobial resistance and its effect on treatment ESBL-E infections are resistant to many prescribed antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins. These infections might require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics.

Carbapenems and risk of greater resistance Carbapenems are often used to treat serious ESBL-E infections, but resistance is on the rise for them, too. The more we rely on this important class of antibiotics, the greater the risk of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. What CDC is doing
- Tracking ESBL-E infections through the Emerging Infections Program and National Healthcare Safety Network.
- Data is also available on the AR & Patient Safety Portal.
- Working closely with health departments, other federal agencies, healthcare providers and patients to prevent infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales and slow the spread of resistant germs.

### Clinical outcomes with ertapenem as a first-line treatment option of infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing gram-negative bacteria [^4f7aa318]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing gram-negative organisms are a growing concern in hospitalized patients. Traditionally, these infections can be effectively treated by the carbapenem class of drugs. In 2005, our institution initiated a protocol for use of ertapenem, a carbapenem, as the first-line treatment option for these infections. It is unknown whether ertapenem is associated with similar clinical response and microbiologic cure rates as those achieved with group 2 carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem, doripenem).

Objective

To describe clinical response and microbiologic cure rates associated with ertapenem as first-line treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms.

Methods

This case series included patients who received ertapenem for more than 48 hours to treat a documented infection with a positive culture for an ESBL-producing organism. Efficacy was determined by the clinical response and microbiologic cure rates achieved with ertapenem.

Results

Seventy-three patients received ertapenem for a mean (SD) of 10.7 (5.9) days. The most common (59%) infection site was urine. The most common causative organisms were ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (47%) and Escherichia coli (48%). Clinical response was observed in 78% of patients. Microbiologic cure was achieved in 92% of the evaluable population (n = 50). There were no significant differences in clinical or microbiologic cure rates across important subgroups.

Conclusions

Patients treated with ertapenem achieved favorable clinical response and microbiologic cure rates. Our data suggest that ertapenem can be used as an alternative to group 2 carbapenems for the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing gram-negative organisms.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^be16052a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Question 1.3—Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin <2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) bloodstream infection—carbapenem preference and extrapolation: In those with clinical isolates available for retesting, 30-day mortality occurred in 9% vs 4% in the piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem arms, respectively, and although the 95% confidence interval ranged from −1% to 11%, the panel still suggests carbapenem therapy as the preferred treatment of ESBL-producing bloodstream infections. Comparable clinical trial data are not available for ESBL-E infections from other body sites, but the panel suggests extrapolating evidence for ESBL-E bloodstream infections to other common sites of infection, and suggests extending the findings to imipenem-cilastatin and ertapenem, with the latter limited to patients with normal serum albumin and patients who are not critically ill.

ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E)—cefepime: The panel suggests avoiding cefepime for the treatment of pyelonephritis or cUTI and for infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if cefepime tests susceptible; however, if cefepime was started empirically for uncomplicated cystitis due to an organism later identified as ESBL-E and the patient improves, no change or extension of therapy is necessary. Rationale includes that ESBLs commonly hydrolyze cefepime, cefepime MIC testing may be inaccurate and/or poorly reproducible with commercial AST methods, clinical trials comparing cefepime with a carbapenem for ESBL-E bloodstream infections have not been conducted, and for these reasons the panel suggests avoiding cefepime for invasive ESBL-E infections.

### Variants of β-lactamase-encoding genes are disseminated by multiple genetically distinct lineages of bloodstream Escherichia coli [^d4e793fd]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics by β-lactamases is the most common mechanism of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. β-lactamases exhibit remarkable diversity and are classified based on molecular structure (Ambler classification: classes A, B, C, and D) and functional properties (Bush-Jacoby classification),. Although some β-lactamases are intrinsic to certain bacteria, their plasmid-mediated spread has accelerated in part due to selective pressure from β-lactam antibiotic use. Broad-spectrum enzymes like TEM-1 and SHV-1 emerged following the introduction of first- and second-generation cephalosporins, prompting the development of oxyimino-cephalosporins such as ceftazidime and cefotaxime. However, the widespread use of these antibiotics led to the emergence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), which can hydrolyze them and have now become globally widespread,. ESBLs belong mostly to class A of the Ambler classification. The earliest ESBLs were variants of TEM and SHV, with ESBL-TEM types specifically evolving from TEM-1 in the 1980s and remaining predominant until the 2000’s,. Since then, CTX-M-type ESBLs have become the most widespread, particularly in E. coli strains from both human and animal sources worldwide,.

The prevalence of ESBL in E. coli from BSI increased from 5% in 1997–2000 to >20% in 2013–2016. Between 2019–2020, nearly 75% of clinical E. coli isolates derived from a single healthcare network have been reported to be co-resistant to ESBL and fluoroquinolone. ESBL-producing E. coli limits treatment options and has been linked with prolonged hospital stay and adverse outcomes,. Carbapenems remain the first-line treatment for invasive ESBL-producing E. coli infections, although de-escalation to fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is advised when possible. For BSIs caused by ESBL-Enterobacterales, including ESBL- E. coli, carbapenem is preferred and a step-down therapy to oral fluoroquinolones or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole if susceptibility is demonstrated. Given these challenges, the World Health Organization has identified ESBL-producing E. coli as a serious threat, urging intensified surveillance efforts and the development of effective new drugs.

### The management of multidrug-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^99c657c6]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae are often related to the production of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and represent an increasing global threat. Recommendations for the therapeutic management of MDR-related infections, however, are mainly derived from retrospective and nonrandomized prospective studies. The aim of this review is to discuss the challenges in the treatment of patients with infections because of MDR Enterobacteriaceae and provide an expert opinion while awaiting for more definitive data.

Recent Findings

To avoid the selection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-sparing strategies should be considered. B-lactams/b-lactamase inhibitors, mainly piperacillin-tazobactam, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 16/4mg/ml or less represents the best alternative to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL-producing strains. Overall, combination therapy may be preferred over monotherapy for CRE. The combination of a carbapenem-containing regimen with colistin or high-dose tigecycline or aminoglycoside can be administered at high-dose prolonged infusion with therapeutic drug monitoring for the treatment of CRE with MIC for meropenem 8-16 mg/l or less. For MIC higher than 8-16 mg/l, the use of meropenem should be avoided and various combination therapies based on the in-vitro susceptibility of antimicrobials (e.g., colistin, high-dose tigecycline, fosfomycin, and aminoglycosides) should be selected.

Summary

Carbapenem-sparing strategies should be used, when feasible, for ESBL infections. The majority of available nonrandomized studies highlight that combination for CRE seem to offer some therapeutic advantage over monotherapy. Strict infection control measures toward MDR Gram-negative pathogens remain necessary while awaiting for new treatment options.

### Current evidence for therapy of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacteremia [^b5e05467]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This article aims to give a state-of-the-art assessment of treatment options for bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, especially those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) or AmpC-producing Enterobacteriaceae. In particular, this review assesses whether current data support 'carbapenem-sparing options' for treatment of these serious infections.

Recent Findings

The MERINO trial refuted earlier observational studies some of which showed equivalence in outcomes between beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations and carbapenems for treatment of bloodstream infection because of ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli or Klebsiella spp. Although numerous factors influence mortality following bloodstream infection, the variability in piperacillin/tazobactam MICs observed in the MERINO trial make this a less secure option than meropenem. However, the search for carbapenem-sparing options continues with four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in progress and a number of other options in clinical development.

Summary

Hard outcomes from RCTs are still needed before intravenous carbapenems can be displaced as the treatment of choice for ceftriaxone-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.

### Treating infections caused by carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae [^1a9745f7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) have spread worldwide, causing serious infections with increasing frequency. CPE are resistant to almost all available antibiotics, complicating therapy and limiting treatment options. Mortality rates associated with CPE infections are unacceptably high, indicating that the current therapeutic approaches are inadequate and must be revised. Here, we review 20 clinical studies (including those describing the largest cohorts of CPE-infected patients) that provided the necessary information regarding isolate and patient characteristics and treatment schemes, as well as a clear assessment of outcome. The data summarized here indicate that treatment with a single in vitro active agent resulted in mortality rates not significantly different from that observed in patients treated with no active therapy, whereas combination therapy with two or more in vitro active agents was superior to monotherapy, providing a clear survival benefit (mortality rate, 27.4% vs. 38.7%; p <0.001). The lowest mortality rate (18.8%) was observed in patients treated with carbapenem-containing combinations.

### Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections [^8aef29de]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Although randomized trials specifically targeting carbapenem-resistant gram-negative infections have not been conducted, treatment of CRE infections with ceftazidime-avibactam has been associated with higher rates of clinical success and survival compared with colistin or aminoglycoside-containing regimens.

Ceftolozane-tazobactam

Ceftolozane is a new 3’-aminopyrazolium cephalosporin with robust activity against P. aeruginosa. It is stable by itself against multiple resistance mechanisms including overexpression of AmpC, a chromosomal cephalosporinase (β-lactamase). The combination with tazobactam further improves its antipseudomonal activity and also imparts activity against strains producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) (but not any carbapenemases). Ceftolozane-tazobactam is active against 67%–89% of carbapenem-nonsusceptible P. aeruginosa strains but is not active against CRE, A. baumannii, or S. maltophilia. As a β-lactam–BLI combination, its efficacy is best correlated with time above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (% f T > MIC).

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases

Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) are a rapidly evolving group of beta-lactamases. To date, the total number of characterised ESBLs exceeds 400. Historically, TEM and SHV-type ESBLs were the most prevalent, but since the early 2000s, CTX-M-type enzymes have been the most common ESBL, with the CTX-M-15 variant dominating worldwide. ESBLs are defined by their ability to hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins, oxyaminopenicillins, and the monobactam aztreonam, but can be inhibited by clavulanic acid in vitro. ESBL-producing organisms can also exhibit resistance to many other classes of antibiotics. This often leaves limited treatment options due to co-inheritance of resistance mechanisms on the plasmid, such as plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance and plasmid-mediated dihydrofolate reductase isoforms driving sulphonamide resistance,. As a result, carbapenems are considered the drug of choice against ESBL infections. In 2017, there were an estimated 197,400 cases of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae among hospitalised patients and 9100 estimated deaths in the United States.

IDSA 2023—ESBL-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), piperacillin–tazobactam suggested approach—If piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy for uncomplicated cystitis caused by an organism later identified as an ESBL-E and clinical improvement occurs, no change or extension of antibiotic therapy is necessary. The panel suggests TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or carbapenems rather than piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI, and piperacillin-tazobactam is not suggested for the treatment of infections outside of the urinary tract caused by ESBL-E, even if susceptibility to piperacillin-tazobactam is demonstrated.

### ESBL-producing enterobacterales in healthcare settings (...) [^14c798ef]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

To survive the effects of antibiotics, germs are constantly finding new defense strategies, called “resistance mechanisms. ” For example, some Enterobacterales can produce enzymes called extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. ESBL enzymes break down and destroy some commonly used antibiotics, including penicillins and cephalosporins, and make these drugs ineffective for treating infections. Learn about CRE Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales This resistance means that there are fewer antibiotic options available to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections. In many cases, even common infections, such as urinary tract infections, caused by ESBL-producing germs require more complex treatments. Instead of taking oral antibiotics at home, patients with these infections might require hospitalization and intravenous carbapenem antibiotics.

See CDC’s report Antibiotic Resistance Threats in the United States, 2019 Carbapenems are one of the few remaining antibiotics that can treat ESBL-producing germs, but resistance enzymes that destroy these antibiotics are on the rise, too. The more we rely on this important class of antibiotics, the greater the risk of spreading resistance to them. Who is at risk. These infections most commonly occur in people with exposure to healthcare, including those in hospitals and nursing homes. However, unlike many other resistant germs, ESBL-producing Enterobacterales can also cause infections in otherwise healthy people who have not been recently been in healthcare settings. In healthy people, this often means urinary tract infections. ESBL germs have also been identified in people returning to the United States after traveling abroad, especially to places where these germs are more commonly found. Top of Page. How are these infections treated.

Infections caused by ESBL-producing germs are treated with antibiotics, but because they are resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics, treatment options might be limited. People with these infections sometimes need to be hospitalized for treatment with IV antibiotics. Carbapenem antibiotics, which are typically reserved for highly resistant infections, are often used to treat serious ESBL-producing Enterobacterales infections. Top of Page. What is CDC doing to address these infections. CDC and partners are working to assess and understand why infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacterales have increased since 2012. Top of Page.

### Carbapenemase-producing organisms: a global scourge [^8a0a5bb4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The dramatic increase in the prevalence and clinical impact of infections caused by bacteria producing carbapenemases is a global health concern. Carbapenemase production is especially problematic when encountered in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. Due to their ability to readily spread and colonize patients in healthcare environments, preventing the transmission of these organisms is a major public health initiative and coordinated international effort are needed. Central to the treatment and control of carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are phenotypic (growth-/biochemical-dependent) and nucleic acid-based carbapenemase detection tests that identify carbapenemase activity directly or their associated molecular determinants. Importantly, bacterial isolates harboring carbapenemases are often resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, resulting in limited therapy options. Emerging agents, novel antibiotic combinations and treatment regimens offer promise for management of these infections. This review highlights our current understanding of CPOs with emphasis on their epidemiology, detection, treatment, and control.

### Innovative approaches in phenotypic β-lactamase detection for personalised infection management [^4e98fead]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Studies demonstrate that poor or inaccurate ESBL detection methods can lead to treatment failure,. With the lack of readily available genotypic methods, the focus should be on developing rapid phenotypic detection and quantification methods that could provide additional information to the clinician. For example, in current practice, most ESBL and AmpC infections are treated with carbapenems. Carbapenem-sparing options are being explored to prevent the emergence of CRE. In response to the challenge posed by CRE, novel beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam, have been developed. Given the diverse antimicrobial effect exhibited by these different combinations against various CRE strains, the ability to accurately detect carbapenemases is essential for tailoring effective treatment strategies. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors could be a suitable alternative to carbapenems to treat less serious infections such as UTIs. For example, bacteria producing a low level of beta-lactamase enzyme may be able to be treated with beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors instead of a carbapenem. In addition, alternative agents such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin could potentially be used to treat these infections, but there is limited efficacy and safety data available.

Improving beta-lactamase detection methods may help mitigate the development and impact of AMR on human health. Current AST methods have limitations (Fig. 2), including static results (MIC) that overlook dynamic changes in pathogen susceptibility and challenges in detecting emerging or low-level resistance. Phenotypic detection methods like broth microdilution and disc diffusion assays are widely used for their simplicity and cost-effectiveness but often require extended incubation times and can be affected by the presence of multiple resistance mechanisms, leading to false positives or negatives. In contrast, genotypic methods such as PCR and WGS offer faster results and precise identification of resistance genes but are costly, require specialised equipment and expertise, and may not reflect gene expression and phenotype accurately. Emerging AST technologies may face regulatory challenges during implementation and integration with existing infrastructure. Choosing the appropriate method depends on the clinical context, resource availability, and the need for accurate and timely detection of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.

ESBL-E pyelonephritis/cUTI clinical evidence and panel preference—A randomized, open-label clinical trial included 66 patients with ESBL-producing E. coli pyelonephritis or cUTI randomized to either piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours or ertapenem 1 g IV every 24 hours, with clinical success similar at 94% for piperacillin-tazobactam and 97% for ertapenem; these studies suggest noninferiority between piperacillin-tazobactam and carbapenems for pyelonephritis or cUTIs. In the subgroup of 231 patients with ESBL-E bloodstream infections from a urinary source in the aforementioned trial, higher mortality was identified in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (7% vs 3%) although not achieving statistical significance. Evaluating the totality of the data, the panel prefers carbapenem therapy (or oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin, if susceptible) for the treatment of ESBL-E pyelonephritis or cUTI; if piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated as empiric therapy and clinical improvement occurs, the decision to continue should be made with the understanding that theoretically there may be an increased risk for microbiological failure with this approach.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E uncomplicated cystitis—aminoglycoside and fosfomycin considerations are as follows: Treatment with a single IV dose of an aminoglycoside is an alternative treatment option for uncomplicated ESBL-E cystitis, and a single IV dose is generally effective for uncomplicated cystitis, with minimal toxicity, but robust clinical trial data are lacking. Susceptibility of E. coli to fosfomycin is not routinely tested by most clinical microbiology laboratories but E. coli resistance to fosfomycin remains rare in the United States, and among gram-negative species, Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) breakpoints are only available for E. coli for fosfomycin. Fosfomycin is not suggested for the treatment of infections caused by K. pneumoniae and several other gram-negative organisms, which frequently carry fosA hydrolase genes that may lead to clinical failure. A randomized open-label trial indicated that a single dose of oral fosfomycin is associated with higher clinical failure than a 5-day course of nitrofurantoin for uncomplicated cystitis, and although this trial was not limited to E. coli cystitis, in a subgroup analysis exclusively of E. coli infections, outcomes remained poor in the fosfomycin group.

AmpC-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E) serious infections—piperacillin-tazobactam use is discouraged except in limited circumstances. The panel suggests against prescribing piperacillin-tazobactam for serious infections caused by AmpC-E, noting at least 4 observational studies identifying poorer clinical outcomes in patients prescribed piperacillin-tazobactam. Piperacillin-tazobactam may be a reasonable treatment option for mild infections such as uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to piperacillin-tazobactam in settings of adverse events to preferred agents or other patient-specific factors. This practice is only advised after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection.

### The use of noncarbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of extended-spectrum β-lactamase infections [^18a3a3e1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The continued rise in infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens is recognized globally as one of the most pressing concerns facing the healthcare community. Carbapenems are widely regarded as the antibiotics of choice for the treatment of ESBL-producing infections, even when in vitro activity to other β-lactams has been demonstrated. However, indiscriminant carbapenem use is not without consequence, and carbapenem overuse has contributed to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The use of non-carbapenem β-lactams for the treatment of ESBL infections has yielded conflicting results. In this review, we discuss the available data for the use of cephamycins, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and ceftazidime-avibactam for the treatment of ESBL infections.

### The continuing plague of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae infections [^f7ee5570]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is a common iatrogenic complication of modern life and medical care. One of the most demonstrative examples is the exponential increase in the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) production among Enterobacteriaceae, which is the most common human pathogens outside of the hospital settings. Infections resulting from ESBL-producing bacteria are associated with devastating outcomes, now affecting even previously healthy individuals. This development poses an enormous burden and threat to public health. This paper aims to narrate the evolving epidemiology of ESBL infections, and highlight current challenges in terms of management and prevention of these common infections.

### The ideal patient profile for new β-lactam / β-lactamase inhibitors [^34ae3461]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The worldwide spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria, the overuse of carbapenems, the emergence of carbapenemase-producing organisms and the growing importance of multidrug-resistant and/or extended drug-resistant strains have totally changed prescribers' habits, leading to very few treatment options in many cases. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations should be considered as an alternative to carbapenems for treating ESBL-producing bacteria and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. The purpose of this study was to provide insight concerning the patients who would constitute ideal candidates to receive these new BLBLI combinations.

Recent Findings

Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are the first drugs constituting the use of new beta-lactamase inhibitors. Ceftolozane/tazobactam is the drug of choice for treating MDR/XDR P. aeruginosa infections. Ceftazidime/avibactam is the best drug available for treating KPC and OXA-48 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam are both carbapenem-sparing agents for treating ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. The role of carbapenem/inhibitors remains to be clarified.

Summary

Each BLBLI combination has distinctive specificities and limitations that need to be investigated cautiously. Randomized trials will play a key role in defining the best strategies. Infection control measures and prompt diagnosis remain fundamental to prevent dissemination of MDR pathogens in healthcare settings and to optimize early antimicrobial treatment.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidance on the treatment of ampC β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections [^00cb971f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) is committed to providing up-to-date guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. A previous guidance document focused on infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with difficult-to-treat resistance (DTR-P. aeruginosa). Here, guidance is provided for treating AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (AmpC-E), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections. A panel of 6 infectious diseases specialists with expertise in managing antimicrobial-resistant infections formulated questions about the treatment of AmpC-E, CRAB, and S. maltophilia infections. Answers are presented as suggested approaches and corresponding rationales. In contrast to guidance in the previous document, published data on the optimal treatment of AmpC-E, CRAB, and S. maltophilia infections are limited. As such, guidance in this document is provided as "suggested approaches" based on clinical experience, expert opinion, and a review of the available literature. Because of differences in the epidemiology of resistance and availability of specific anti-infectives internationally, this document focuses on the treatment of infections in the United States. Preferred and alternative treatment suggestions are provided, assuming the causative organism has been identified and antibiotic susceptibility results are known. Approaches to empiric treatment, duration of therapy, and other management considerations are also discussed briefly. Suggestions apply for both adult and pediatric populations. The field of antimicrobial resistance is highly dynamic. Consultation with an infectious diseases specialist is recommended for the treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections. This document is current as of 17 September 2021 and will be updated annually. The most current version of this document, including date of publication, is available at www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/amr-guidance-2.0/.

### Antibiotic utilization: is there an effect on antimicrobial resistance? [^d63aae12]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

The antimicrobial resistance problem in hospitals continues to worsen. In particular, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are significant causes of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. Treating infections caused by these pathogens presents therapeutic dilemmas. The association between broad-spectrum beta-lactam overutilization and selection for ESBL-KP has been appreciated for some time; several institutions have reported a decrease in the prevalence of ESBL-KP with a shift in antibiotic utilization from third-generation cephalosporins to other broad-spectrum drugs. Currently, optimal treatment of ESBL-KP includes the carbapenems, but widespread use of these drugs is expensive and may be associated with further selection of antibiotic resistance and/or superinfection with other inherently resistant pathogens. VRE are especially difficult organisms to treat because of their inherent and acquired resistance to most currently available antibiotics. The prevalence of VRE has also been documented to decrease upon a shift in antibiotic use from third-generation cephalosporins to broad-spectrum antibiotics of other classes. Thus, antibiotic utilization measures appear to contribute to the control of the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens such as ESBL-KP and VRE.

### Is it time to reconsider initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe? [^3ad70182]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Until recently, most reported cases of bacteraemia caused by multidrug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriacae producing an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Europe have been nosocomial in origin. However, increasing numbers of reports of community-acquired bacteraemia and urinary tract infection caused by ESBL-producing microorganisms suggest that the geographical origin of patients should be taken into account as a risk-factor for possible ESBL production. Early identification of patients at high-risk of infection with ESBL-producing microorganisms, based on their geographical origin and travel history, should help to optimise initial antibiotic treatment strategies for severe urinary tract infections in Europe.

### High burden of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producingandBacteremia in older adults: a seven-year study in two rural Thai provinces [^a890a009]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2019). Medium credibility.

The antibiotic treatment choices for infections caused by ESBL-producing pathogens are limited. We found a high prevalence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporins among ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which is consistent with previous reports from Thailand.A 2016 reportexamined treatment options for children (0–15 years) with E. coli and K. pneumonia e infections visiting a tertiary care center in Bangkok. They also found the vast majority of ESBL-producing isolates were susceptible to amikacin but noted that poor tissue penetration and potential nephrotoxicity limited the use of amikacin and other aminoglycosides outside of urinary tract infections.Another potential treatment option is piperacillin/tazobactam, but we found substantial non-susceptibility (> 25%) to this combination among ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates, similar to Sethaphanich,who found only 62.6% of K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam. This makes it a poor choice for empiric treatment. For now, carbapenems remain a reliable treatment option, but it is troubling that we identified carbapenem-resistant, ESBL-producing isolates from five patients (two E. coli and three K. pneumoniae), especially in light of the recent identification of colistin-resistant E. coli from clinical isolates, healthy adults, and the environment in Thailand. If we cannot prevent and control the spread of these types of multidrug-resistant bacteria, few options will remain for patients infected with this organism in the near future.

### Treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections in children [^fc911d1a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance in conjunction with the erosion of the drug development pipeline may lead us into a bleak future, a "post-antibiotic era." Because of a shortage of studies addressing treatment options for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative (MDRGN) infections in children, data must be extrapolated from the adult literature. However, even adult studies are limited by significant methodological flaws. We are in urgent need of pediatric specific pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data for agents with activity against MDRGN infections as well as improved clinical outcomes studies. For the time being, we must rely on in vitro studies, observational data, and clinical experience to guide our therapeutic decisions. In this review, we discuss treatment considerations for infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing organisms, AmpC β-lactamase-producing organisms, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in the pediatric population.

THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR MBL-PRODUCING CARBAPENEMASE-PRODUCING ENTEROBACTERALES

Limited therapeutic landscape and clinical impact

The management of infections caused by MBL-producing Enterobacterales represents a challenge in the clinical practice due to limited treatment options. This therapeutic gap might contribute to the poor outcomes in patients infected with MBL-producing strains. In the prospective ALARICO study including more than 1200 patients with BSIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, the attributable mortality for MBL-producing Enterobacterales was 35%, substantially higher than that reported for KPC-producing strains (5%). This difference likely reflects the lack of effective antimicrobial options for MBL, in contrast to the last decade's wave of development targeting KPC. Currently available and new treatment options for MBL-producing CRE are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1 
Therapeutic options for MBL-producing CRE

Ceftazidime/avibactam plus aztreonam

Current guidelines recommend the use of ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) in combination with aztreonam (ATM) as preferred option for the treatment of severe infections due to MBL-producing Enterobacterales. Avibactam inhibits serine β-lactamases (e.g. ESBLs, AmpC), thereby protecting ATM from degradation by serine enzymes, that are coproduced in these isolates. This combination was found to be active against MBL in more than 97% of isolates [▪▪]. Clinical studies support the efficacy of this combination. A large recent cohort study including 343 patients with infections caused by MBL-producing CRE showed that the combination CZA plus ATM was associated with reduced mortality compared to colistin-containing regimens, also after propensity score matching [▪▪].

However, some limitations to the use of CZA plus ATM should be underlined:
(1) a major challenge is the lack of a standardized approach to assess the in vitro activity. Several approaches, including the disc approximation method, the broth disc elution method, and the gradient test superposition method, are used but all these methods are not standardized and results are prone to subjective interpretations [, ▪▪];
(2) the simultaneous administration of CZA plus ATM may be difficult in patients without multiple vascular lines. It is not known whether the nonsimultaneously administration of CZA plus ATM may affect the serum levels and pharmacokinetics of the drugs ;
(3) some cases of NDM-producing Escherichia coli resistant to ATM/AVI have been reported, potentially limiting the use of CZA plus ATM.

### Evolution and epidemiology of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and ESBL-producing microorganisms [^10735927]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

The rapid and irrepressible increase in antimicrobial resistance of pathogenic bacteria that has been observed over the last two decades is widely accepted to be one of the major problems of human medicine today. Several aspects of this situation are especially worrying. There are resistance mechanisms that eliminate the use of last-choice antibiotics in the treatment of various kinds of infection. Many resistance mechanisms that emerge and spread in bacterial populations are those of wide activity spectra, which compromise all or a majority of drugs belonging to a given therapeutic group. Some mechanisms of great clinical importance require specific detection procedures, as they may not confer clear resistance in vitro on the basis of the interpretive criteria used in standard susceptibility testing. Finally, multiple mechanisms affecting the same and/or different groups of antimicrobials coexist and are even co-selected in more and more strains of pathogenic bacteria. The variety of beta-lactamases with wide spectra of substrate specificity illustrates very well all the phenomena mentioned above. Being able to hydrolyze the majority of beta-lactams that are currently in use, together they constitute the most important resistance mechanism of Gram-negative rods. Three major groups of these enzymes are usually distinguished, class C cephalosporinases (AmpC), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and different types of beta-lactamases with carbapenemase activity, of which the so-called class B metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are of the greatest concern. This review is focused on various aspects of the evolution and epidemiology of ESBLs; it does not cover the problems of ESBL detection and clinical relevance of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^0d3b1576]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The available therapeutic options for the multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria are limited.

In recent years, clinicians have become dependent on carbapenems for treating ESBL infections. This emphasizes the importance of carbapenem-preserving antimicrobial stewardship.

The role of β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations towards ESBLs has been debated and controversial even if recent reports suggest their use in ESBL infections.

Although tigecycline does not feature in vitro activity against P. aeruginosa or certain Enterobacteriaceae (Proteus spp. Serratia spp. Morganella morganii, Providencia stuartii), it is still an option for complicated IAIs because of its favorable in vitro activity against anaerobic organisms, enterococci, several ESBLs, and some strains of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Because of poor plasma concentrations, tigecycline performs poorly in bacteremic patients, with a much higher risk of failing to clear bacteremia. Tigecycline should not be considered as first-line therapy in patients with healthcare-associated pneumonia and bacteremia.

The recent challenges in the management of Gram-negative MDROs infections, especially in critically ill patients, have revived the clinical use of polymyxins and fosfomycin. There are still open questions about the need of combination therapy and the role of carbapenems, administered at high doses and by extended infusions, in the treatment of infections with carbapenem-resistant entetobacteriaceae.

Ceftolozane/tazobactam and ceftazidime/avibactam have recently been approved in some national agencies for the treatment of IAIs. Ceftolozone/tazobactam is a new antibiotic that has been approved for treatment of cIAIs (in combination with metronidazole) including infection by ESBLs and P. aeruginosa and associated with metronidazole may be valuable for treating infections caused by Gram-negative MDROs in order to preserve carbapenems. It may be useful as empirical therapy to preserve the use of carbapenems in critical patients with risk factors for ESBL isolation or as targeted therapy in patients with isolation of an ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae or P. aeruginosa MDR. It should be considered that in some countries, the production of metallo -β- lactamase s enzymes, that are not inactivated by ceftolozane/tazobactam, may be one of the mechanisms for carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa.

### Treatment options for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections [^50d58c11]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens have become a major healthcare burden in the 21st century, and treatment options had been limited to agents such as colistin and tigecycline in combination with other antibiotics. Fortunately, several new agents with activity against carbapenem-resistant pathogens have been approved or are in late-stage clinical development, which is encouraging. These newer agents will become important additions to the currently limited armamentarium and are expected to improve the outcome of patients affected by carbapenem-resistant pathogens. As each new agent comes with its own strengths and caveats, antimicrobial stewardship will play a crucial role in ensuring their optimal and rational use.

Question 3.6—infections outside of the urinary tract caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) with OXA-48-like production: Suggested approach: Ceftazidime-avibactam is the preferred treatment option for OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales infections. Cefiderocol is an alternative treatment option. If OXA-48-like enzymes are produced by an Enterobacterales clinical isolate, ceftazidime-avibactam is preferred and cefiderocol is an alternative option, and more than 95% of OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales isolates are susceptible to both agents. Meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam have limited activity against OXA-48-like producing isolates because vaborbactam and relebactam are unlikely to inhibit OXA-48-like enzymes and are not suggested, even if susceptible in vitro. Clinical trial data comparing ceftazidime-avibactam vs cefiderocol are not available, and an observational study including 171 patients with OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales infections treated with ceftazidime-avibactam identified 30-day mortality in 22%.

### Management of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae infections [^850d7a91]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Carbapenem resistance is defined as in vitro non-susceptibility to any carbapenem and/or documented production of a carbapenemase. This feature has rapidly spread worldwide among clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, mostly Klebsiella spp., and is associated with diverse molecular mechanisms. Carbapenem resistance is often associated with resistance to all traditional β-lactams and other classes of antibiotics, denoting a typical example of an extensively drug-resistant phenotype.

Objectives

To summarize and interpret in a balanced manner the most clinically relevant data in terms of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infection management.

Sources

Data were extracted by PubMed and clinicaltrials.gov search and manual scrutiny among references of analysed articles.

Content

Features of newer and older, rediscovered antimicrobial options for CRE are described. Observational studies and randomized clinical trials (RCT) of CRE treatment are summarized, with a specific focus on the effects of monotherapy compared with combination treatment.

Implications

The available evidence on the current management of CRE mostly comes from observational, non-comparative, retrospective, small studies, with a high risk of selection bias. Very little evidence comes from RCT. Conflicting results of RCT and observational studies call for caution before combination therapies are deemed superior to monotherapy. Data on newer agents have spurred enthusiasm but remain limited as concerns severe CRE infections. A balanced approach should guide the clinician in the choice of old or new drugs, and of monotherapies or combination regimens. Efforts should be made to perform adequately sized clinical trials answering well-defined research questions.

### Current trends in culture-based and molecular detection of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase-harboring and carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^5dcce99a]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2012). Low credibility.

The ever-expanding role of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL)-harboring and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in causing serious infections poses a grave public health threat because these organisms also tend to be multidrug resistant, for which very few (if any) antibiotic options remain available. Rapid detection of such panresistant organisms offers one of the best solutions to improve patient screening and hospital infection control practices as well as curb inappropriate antibiotic use. This review discusses and compares primarily the current state-of-the-art culture-based and molecular methods that are commercially available for detection or screening of ESBL-harboring and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.

### European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (endorsed by European Society of Intensive Care Medicine) [^ece28ce6]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). Medium credibility.

Scope

These ESCMID guidelines address the targeted antibiotic treatment of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales (3GCephRE) and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, focusing on the effectiveness of individual antibiotics and on combination versus monotherapy.

Methods

An expert panel was convened by ESCMID. A systematic review was performed including randomized controlled trials and observational studies, examining different antibiotic treatment regimens for the targeted treatment of infections caused by the 3GCephRE, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Treatments were classified as head-to-head comparisons between individual antibiotics and between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens, including defined monotherapy and combination regimens only. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, preferably at 30 days and secondary outcomes included clinical failure, microbiological failure, development of resistance, relapse/recurrence, adverse events and length of hospital stay. The last search of all databases was conducted in December 2019, followed by a focused search for relevant studies up until ECCMID 2021. Data were summarized narratively. The certainty of the evidence for each comparison between antibiotics and between monotherapy and combination therapy regimens was classified by the GRADE recommendations. The strength of the recommendations for or against treatments was classified as strong or conditional (weak).

Recommendations

The guideline panel reviewed the evidence per pathogen, preferably per site of infection, critically appraising the existing studies. Many of the comparisons were addressed in small observational studies at high risk of bias only. Notably, there was very little evidence on the effects of the new, recently approved, β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors on infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Most recommendations are based on very-low- and low-certainty evidence. A high value was placed on antibiotic stewardship considerations in all recommendations, searching for carbapenem-sparing options for 3GCephRE and limiting the recommendations of the new antibiotics for severe infections, as defined by the sepsis-3 criteria. Research needs are addressed.

Antimicrobial resistance is a common iatrogenic complication of modern life and medical care. One of the most demonstrative examples is the exponential increase in the incidence of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) production among Enterobacteriaceae, that is, the most common human pathogens outside of the hospital setting. Infections resulting from ESBL-producing bacteria are associated with devastating outcomes, now affecting even previously healthy individuals. This poses an enormous burden and threat to public health. This article aims to narrate the evolving epidemiology of ESBL infections and highlights current challenges in terms of management and prevention of these common infections.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^75ae50f2]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Common uropathogens in children with significant urologic abnormalities, including postsurgery and instrumentation, are Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus.– To cover these, if IV antibiotics are needed, an aminoglycoside or broad-spectrum cephalosporin is recommended, with a child’s individual history guiding whether to cover rarer S. aureus or more indolent Enterococcus spp. empirically. Where multiple antibiotics have previously been used, assessment of the likelihood of resistance is part of management (see below).

Multiple recurrent UTIs, defined by 2 or more UTIs caused by different organisms,are a risk for resistant and MDR bacteria.Although recurrent UTIs might occur without anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract, other risk factors include VUR, underlying neurological conditions, prolonged hospitalization and UTI prophylaxis, and girls are at higher risk than boys. If on prophylaxis, a different treatment antibiotic is required due to breakthrough. For children at high risk of resistance, including suspected ESBL-E, empiric oral options include nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, quinolones and fosfomycin.Empirical IV options for children at moderate risk of resistance but who have never cultured ESBL-E include gentamicin and quinolones. If there has been previous ESBL-E or clinical risk is higher, IV amikacin retains high susceptibility to uropathogens, concentrates well in urine and can avoid broad-spectrum beta-lactam and carbapenem use. Most gentamicin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae exhibit cross-resistance to tobramycin but remain susceptible to amikacin, due to reduced inactivation by bacterial enzymes.If cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae with high bacterial inoculum, empirical B-lactam antibiotics should be switched to a different class. With a high bacterial inoculum, the stationary phase is rapidly reached, so the effect of targeting penicillin-binding proteins is rapidly diminished, and an alternative is better.In the large majority, carbapenems should be spared since their use is the greatest risk for developing carbapenem resistance. Even with a history of recurrent UTI with resistant uropathogens, empirical carbapenems are rarely needed in children with cUTI unless a child presents with sepsis (see below). – If the identified uropathogen is MDR, including carbapenem-resistant, options include a carbapenem plus amikacin combination, colistin and newer B-lactam/B-lactamase antibiotics such as ceftazidime-avibactam. Since methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon uropathogen, this rarely needs to be covered empirically. P. aeruginosa (susceptible and resistant) is more common in recurrent UTIs, so it should be empirically treated with oral quinolones or IV aminoglycosides.

### Cell-wall-inhibiting antibiotic combinations with activity against multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli [^3eb36dfd]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2014). Low credibility.

The increasing prevalence of hospital and community-acquired infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens is rapidly limiting the options for effective antibiotic therapy. Systematic studies on combinations of already available antibiotics that could provide an effective treatment against MDR bacteria are needed. We tested combinations of antibiotics that target one important physiological function (peptidoglycan synthesis) at several steps, and studied Enterobacteriaceae (Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli) for which multidrug resistance associated with ESBL-producing plasmids has become a major problem. To measure the effectiveness of antibiotics alone and in combination, we used checkerboard assays, static antibiotic concentration time-kill assays, and an improved in-vitro kinetic model that simulates human pharmacokinetics of multiple simultaneously administered antibiotics. The target strains included an MDR K. pneumoniae isolate responsible for a recent major hospital outbreak. A double combination (fosfomycin and aztreonam) and a triple combination (fosfomycin, aztreonam and mecillinam) were both highly effective in reducing bacterial populations in all assays, including the in vitro kinetic model. These combinations were effective even though each of the MDR strains was resistant to aztreonam alone. Our results provide an initial validation of the potential usefulness of a combination of antibiotics targeting peptidoglycan synthesis in the treatment of MDR Gram-negative bacteria. We suggest that a combination of fosfomycin with aztreonam could become a useful treatment option for such infections and should be further studied.

### New delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales bacteria, Switzerland, 2019-2020 [^6d272fe3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

NDM enzymes are capable of conferring resistance to almost all β-lactam antimicrobial drugs (except aztreonam), including carbapenems which are often considered drugs of last resort for the treatment of serious infections. Treatment options for infections caused by NDM-producing bacteria are very limited, particularly because they often harbor multiple other resistance genes. For example, there are notable associations between bla NDM genes and plasmid-borne extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and pAmpC encoding genes (most commonly bla CTX-M and bla CMY) that result in resistance to aztreonam ; similarly, 16S rRNA methylases (RMTases), which can confer high-level resistance to all aminoglycosides, have also been strongly associated with NDM carriage. The recently approved β-lactamase inhibitors, diazabicyclooctanes (e.g. avibactam [AVI], relebactam [REL]) and cyclic boronates (e.g. vaborbactam [VAB]) have no activity against metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) and subsequently new treatment options are urgently needed. Aztreonam (ATM)/AVI has been suggested as a treatment option for infections caused by NDM-producing bacteria because ATM is spared by MBL hydrolytic activities and AVI inhibits the activity of any co-produced ESBL or AmpC.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^c17b06bd]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) producing Enterobacteriaceae

Over the past few years a notable increase in antibiotic resistance among Gram-negative bacteria recovered from hospitalized patients has been reported, especially in critically ill patients.

During the last decade, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae has become a growing problem.

In the specific context of intra-abdominal infections, resistance to β-lactams, mediated by extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) is a particular concern.

Acquired resistance to beta-lactams is mainly mediated by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) that confer resistance to the penicillins, first-, second-, and third-generation cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and are inhibited by b-lactamase inhibitors. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) which are encoded by genes that can be exchanged between bacteria. Beta-lactamase genes are often associated with resistance determinants to non-beta-lactam agents such as aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and strains producing ESBLs often exhibit complex multidrug resistant phenotypes and sometimes are panresistant. Therefore, antibiotic options in the treatment of ESBL-producing organisms are extremely limited. Carbapenems are the drugs of choice for treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing organisms in intra-abdominal infections even if, use of carbapenems has been associated with the emergence of carbapenem-resistant bacterial species. Tigecycline has substantial antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae but it merits further evaluation.

### Extended-spectrum β-lactamases: a challenge for clinical microbiologists and infection control specialists [^5d5e0d41]. American Journal of Infection Control (2005). Low credibility.

Since first reported in Europe in the early 1980s, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) have spread worldwide. When producing these broad-spectrum plasmid-encoded enzymes, organisms become highly effective at inactivating penicillins, most cephalosporins, and aztreonam. Mainly produced by Klebsiella spp, ESBLs have been isolated worldwide in different species, most of them belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae. ESBL-producing bacteria can appear as in vitro susceptible to beta-lactams by conventional laboratory methods, making the laboratory diagnosis problematic. Once detected, all beta-lactams except carbapenem and beta-lactamase inhibitor compounds should be reported as resistant. In addition, organisms harboring ESBLs are frequently resistant to other antibiotic classes, such as fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides. Because of the very limited remaining alternatives for treatment and ESBLs significant prevalence worldwide, infection control remains the best way to deal with this bacterial resistance mechanism.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^e51f74a8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy

Initial antibiotic therapy for IAIs is typically empirical in nature because the patient needs immediate attention, and microbiological data (culture and susceptibility results) can require up to 48 hours before they are available for a more detailed analysis.

IAIs can be treated with either single or multiple antimicrobial regimens depending on the range requirements of antimicrobial coverage.

Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations exhibit in vitro activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic organisms and are viable options for empirical treatment of IAIs. However, the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae observed in community-acquired infections restricts this regimen’s empirical use to patients who are not at risk for these drug-resistant microorganisms.

In the past, Cephalosporins have often been used in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections. Among third generation cephalosporins, subgroups with both limited and strong activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cefepime and ceftazidime) have been used in conjunction with metronidazole to treat IAIs. Enterobacteriaceae can have acquired resistance to both cephalosporins, while such resistance is intrinsic in Enterococci [-].

In light of the increasing prevalence of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae due to selection pressures related to overuse of cephalosporins, routine use of these antibiotics is strongly discouraged.

Aztreonam is a parenteral synthetic beta-lactam antibiotic and the first monobactam marketed for clinical use. The drug exhibits potent in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of gram-negative aerobic pathogens (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but its routine use is discouraged due to selection pressures favoring resistant strains, and it therefore shares the same constraints associated with cephalosporin use.

Carbapenems offer a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens (with the exception of MDR resistant gram-positive cocci). For more than 2 decades, carbapenems have been considered the agents of “last resort” for multidrug-resistant infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae. In the last decade, increased carbapenem consumption has been associated with an increased emergence of carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriacea, particularly in Klebsiella pneumoniae.

### Gram-negative bacterial infections: research priorities, accomplishments, and future directions of the antibacterial resistance leadership group [^813e0ae2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is one of the most pressing challenges in the field of infectious diseases and is one of 4 key areas of unmet medical need identified by the Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group (ARLG). The mission of the Gram-Negative Committee is to advance our knowledge of these challenging infections and implement studies to improve patient outcomes. Studies have fallen primarily into 2 broad categories: prospective cohort studies and interventional trials. Among the observational studies, CRACKLE (Consortium on Resistance Against Carbapenems in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Other Enterobacteriaceae) has contributed seminal multicenter data describing risk factors and clinical outcomes of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in sentinel US hospitals. Building on this success, CRACKLE II will expand the network to hospitals across the United States and Colombia. Similar protocols have been proposed to include Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (SNAP and POP studies). In addition, the CREST study (Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Solid Organ Transplant Patients) has provided pivotal data on extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and CRE carriage among solid organ transplant recipients to inform management of this vulnerable patient population. Two clinical trials to define novel ways of using an existing antibiotic, fosfomycin, to treat ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (one that has completed enrollment and the other in late protocol development) will determine the clinical efficacy of fosfomycin as step-down oral therapy to treat complicated urinary tract infections. Additional clinical studies and trials using immunotherapeutic or newly approved agents are also in the planning stage, with the main goals of generating actionable data that will inform clinical decision making and facilitate development of new treatment options for highly resistant gram-negative bacterial infections.

### WSES consensus conference: guidelines for first-line management of intra-abdominal infections [^9e47fcf6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy for extra-biliary community-acquired IAIs

Once the diagnosis of intra-abdominal infection is suspected, it is necessary to begin empiric antimicrobial therapy.

However routine use of antimicrobial therapy is not appropriate for all patients with intra-abdominal infections.

In uncomplicated IAIs, when the focus of infection is treated effectively by surgical excision of the involved tissue, the administration of antibiotics is unnecessary beyond prophylaxis.

In complicated IAIs, when infectious process proceeds beyond the organ, causing either localized peritonitis (intra-abdominal abscess), or diffuse peritonitis antimicrobial therapy is mandatory.

The choice of antimicrobial regimen depends on the source of intra-abdominal infection, risk factors for specific microorganisms and resistance patterns and clinical patient's condition (Recommendation 1 C).

The principles of empiric antibiotic treatment should be defined according to the most frequently isolated germs, always taking into consideration the local trend of antibiotic resistance.

The major pathogens involved in community-acquired IAIs are Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and anaerobes. The main resistance problem is represented by ESBL producers Enterobacteriaceae, even today frequently found in community acquired infections.

Many factors can raise the risk of selection of ESBL but prior exposition to antibiotics (mainly third generation cephalosporins) and comorbidities that make frequent the exposure of patients to multiple antibiotic treatments, are the most significant.

Many others factors can contribute to the severity of an intra-abdominal infection and to a patient's risk for a poor outcome, like patient age, underlying co-morbidities, extent of infection, nutritional status and the success of initial source control procedures. Dividing patients with intra-abdominal infections into lower and higher risk categories is not always simple, but attempting to assess a patient's risk of treatment failure is essential to optimize a treatment plan. In this context adding a standardized evaluation of the clinical condition, represented by the sepsis grading, may be extremely helpful.

Key messages

• The burden of resistance increased dramatically for 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which indicates a rise in ESBL-producing bacteria.

• This increase has been followed by a doubling of carbapenem use from 2001 through 2008.

• Greater carbapenem use harbours the risk of greater selection of carbapenem resistance and is associated with permeability mutations in strains already producing ESBLs or KPCs.

• Because treatment options for infections with multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria and KPC-producing organisms are limited, besides tigecycline, old antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, fosfomycin, and colistin with or without rifampicin will have to be re-employed.

• Adopting appropriate infection control strategies becomes paramount to prevent transmission to other patients.

### Carbapenem-resistant and extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacterales in children, United States, 2016-2020 [^7c6db8dd]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains a critical public health threat. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) have been identified as an urgent public health threat and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E) as a serious public health threat. Both bacteria types remain of concern because of transmissibility of the AMR genes they harbor and limited treatment options. Particularly concerning are plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms in which genes encoding carbapenemases and ESBLs, as well as other resistance determinants, can disseminate between different organisms, thus furthering the spread of CRE and ESBL-E. Knowledge of the burden of these infections has implications for public health and the control strategies needed to prevent spread in adult and pediatric populations.

Most US studies have focused on risk factors for infection or colonization of CRE and ESBL-E in adults; national epidemiologic data for children are comparatively lacking (–). Moreover, attention to antimicrobial-resistant bacterial infections in children has perhaps been further disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and trends have potentially worsened over the past 3 years. Few antimicrobial drugs can treat CRE and ESBL-E infections, and limited pediatric-specific clinical trials of antimicrobial drugs contribute to a scarcity of knowledge with regard to children compared with adults. A small number of studies have described the continued emergence of AMR mechanisms in US children (–) and identified variations in epidemiology by hospital and bacteria species across multiple pediatric medical centers (–). However, most studies were conducted in earlier years and were not designed to characterize the clinical and molecular features of cases identified from community and hospital settings on a population level.

CONSIDERATIONS ON ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP AND RAPID DIAGNOSTICS

As newer agents with activity against carbapenem-resistant organisms become available for clinical use, approaches to treatment selection and optimization become important considerations. Challenges that are unique to these agents from the antibiotic stewardship point of view relate to their rapid streamlined development, which resulted in fewer clinical trials being conducted before regulatory approval. These challenges include (i) insufficient high-quality clinical data to guide their use in the target patient population; (ii) often delayed approval of susceptibility testing methods; (iii) complexity of their antibacterial spectra; and (iv) high acquisition costs.

First, the pivotal clinical trials supporting the approval of these agents are typically noninferiority trials that do not specifically target infections from carbapenem-resistant organisms. Although more pathogen-directed trials targeting carbapenem-resistant gram-negative infections are being conducted for agents seeking approval, these studies are not powered to allow for statistical inference of superiority of the study drugs over the comparators. Therefore, postmarketing clinical experience will likely play an important role in informing appropriate use of the new agents. Second, approval of clinical breakpoints and susceptibility testing methods may lag behind the approval of the new agents by a year or more. In such cases, patients could potentially be treated with a new agent that lacks in vitro activity, therefore risking treatment failure. It is encouraging to see that more efforts are now being made to address this issue, and it is hoped that susceptibility testing methods will be available at the time of product launch in the future. Third, beyond their shared activity against KPC-producing organisms, the spectrum of activity is nuanced, even within the same class. For example, ceftazidime-avibactam has activity against organisms producing OXA-48 carbapenemase, whereas meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-relebactam lack activity. Finally, the costs of the new agents will be considerably higher than those that have been on the market, and this will likely preclude their empiric use in most circumstances unless the likelihood of infection from a carbapenem-resistant pathogen is compellingly high and the clinical condition does not allow for any delay in appropriate therapy. The last 2 points in particular highlight the crucial role of antimicrobial stewardship led by infectious diseases pharmacists and physicians in promoting appropriate and rational use of the new agents against carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens.

### Combination versus monotherapy for the treatment of infections due to carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^6dc69a1f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Combination therapy is a common strategy for treatment of multidrug resistant infections. Despite the strong twin rationales of improving efficacy and reducing resistance development, the evidence supporting this strategy remains controversial. The aims of this review are to assess the most recent studies supporting the use of combination therapy for treating infections because of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and to highlight relevant areas for further research.

Recent Findings

Evidence supporting the use of combination therapy for the treatment of CRE remains limited to in-vitro experiments and observational studies with considerable risk of bias. Very few antibiotic combinations have been tested in well designed randomized controlled trials, making it difficult to draw general conclusions for clinical practice.

Summary

Further studies are urgently needed to test the most promising synergistic combinations. New drugs potentially active against CRE should also to be tested in studies with adequate sample size and truly representative of the general patient population.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^df8e6b94]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

SIS guidelines—empiric treatment options for resistant gram-negative pathogens in HA-IAI state that carbapenems are generally considered the empiric agents of choice for the most common ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, with de-escalation to piperacillin–tazobactam, cefepime, an aminoglycoside, a cephamycin, a fluoroquinolone, or tigecycline considered once susceptibilities are known, although ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are frequently resistant to these other agents and clinical experience with ceftolozane–tazobactam or ceftazidime–avibactam is still limited. Patients with extensive hospital exposure may be infected with AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacter or other Enterobacteriaceae, for which broad-spectrum carbapenems are generally considered the treatment of choice; ceftazidime–avibactam shows good in vitro activity and cefotaxime–tazobactam has activity against 70% of these strains, but clinical experience is quite limited. For KPC-producing strains, combining a carbapenem with an aminoglycoside, a polymyxin, or tigecycline has been associated with the highest efficacy when the minimum inhibitory concentration to carbapenems is not too high, and ceftazidime–avibactam has activity against KPC-producing strains. Treatment of MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae is more problematic because these bacteria are resistant to nearly all β-lactam antibiotic agents, although aztreonam may be an exception, and combination therapy using agents such as a polymyxin, tigecycline, or fosfomycin is generally advocated. For these MDR, XDR, and PDR pathogens, combination regimens are generally used and may or may not include a broad-spectrum β-lactam antibiotic agent, an aminoglycoside, a polymyxin, tigecycline (not applicable for Pseudomonas), rifampin, or fosfomycin.

### WSES / GAIS / SIS-E / WSIS / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with intra-abdominal infections [^5e527d47]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Among Gram-positive bacteria, enterococci may play a significant role in IAIs. Some studies have demonstrated poor outcomes among patients with documented enterococcal infections, particularly in those with post-operative IAIs where enterococci coverage should be always considered.

The acquisition of glycopeptide resistance by enterococci has seriously affected the treatment and control of these organisms. Affected patients usually have multiple and relevant co-morbidities, with prolonged hospital stay and received long courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

IAIs may be managed by either single or multiple antibiotic regimens. Beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, including, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ticarcillin/clavulanate, piperacillin/tazobactam, have an in vitro activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. Increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance to amoxicillin/clavulanate among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae worldwide, during the last decade, has compromised the clinical utility of this agent for empiric therapy of serious Gram-negative infections and therefore should be used based on local rates of resistance. Broad-spectrum activity of piperacillin/tazobactam, including anti-pseudomonal and anaerobic coverage, still make it an attractive option in the management of severe IAIs.

Most isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae remain susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and in combination with metronidazole and may be options for empiric therapy of non-severe IAIs. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) have been widely used in the treatment of IAIs because of their excellent activity against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and tissue penetration. In recent years, the resistance of E. coli to FQ has risen over time. The worldwide increase in FQ resistance among E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae has limited the use of FQ for empirical treatment of IAIs.

For decades, carbapenems have been the antibiotics of first choice for ESBLs. The best option for targeting ESBLs (although lacking coverage of P. aeruginosa) is ertapenem, a once-daily administered carbapenem that otherwise shares the activity of imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem against most species, including ESBL producing pathogens. Imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem provide coverage for Gram-negative non-fermenting bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii). The use of carbapenems should be limited to preserve the activity of this class of antibiotics because of the concern of emerging carbapenem resistance.

In fact in critically ill patients the possibility that the normal flora may be modified and that the IAI could be caused by several unexpected pathogens and by more resistant flora must be considered. In these patients antimicrobial regimens with broader spectrum of activity are recommended.

Therefore in a stable and low risk patient a simpler antibiotic choice, not including ESBL in the spectrum of activity is correct, while in critical and high risk patients any antibiotic regimen must take into account the risk of ESBL.

The available therapeutic options for the treatment of ESBL-associated infections are limited by drug resistance conferred by the ESBLs. The frequently observed co-resistances include various antibiotic classes (fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Carbapenems, stable against hydrolyzing activity of ESBLs, are considered as the drug of choice for the treatment of these infections. Tigecycline and polymyxins have a strong in vitro antimicrobial activity against ESBL-producing bacteria, and the first should be considered a reasonable alternative. This is particularly true from an epidemiological point of view; in fact today any large hospital should implement carbapenems-sparing stewardship programs to control the spread of carbapenemase producing gram negative bacteria.

Although in the prospective French survey by Montravers and coll, a higher percentage of isolation of Enterococcus faecalis in non surviving patients was reported (23% versus 9%), empirical treatment against Enterococci and has not been generally recommended for patients with community-acquired IAI. In fact in several clinical trials comparing different therapeutic options inclusion/exclusion of agents with enterococcal coverage provides no impact in outcomes for patients with community-acquired infections.

In the setting of community acquired IAIs, antimicrobial therapy for enterococci should be considered on a patient-by-patient basis, mainly in high risk patients, in immunocompromised patients and in patients with valvular heart disease or prosthetic materials.

Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is not commonly isolated from patients with community-acquired intra-abdominal infection. Therefore empirical treatment against MRSA is not recommended in this setting.

### Hospital-acquired infections in the neonatal intensive care unit – Klebsiella pneumoniae [^12b72f7b]. Seminars in Perinatology (2002). Low credibility.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is medically the most important organism of the Klebsiella species. It is responsible for a significant proportion of hospital-acquired infections including septicemias, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and soft tissue infections especially in the immunocompromised hosts such as the neonate. The hands of healthcare workers and the gastrointestinal tract of hospitalized infants serve as reservoirs for the transmission of the organism and are responsible for multiple hospital outbreaks. In recent years, there has been an increase in the incidence of outbreaks caused by multidrug resistance K. pneumoniae organisms or the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae. The problems associated with extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms include difficulties in accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing, limited treatment options and increased morbidity and perhaps mortality. Hence, prevention through implementation of strict infection control guidelines, effective hand washing and judicious use of antimicrobials such as third generation cephalosporins is important to effectively reduce the morbidity associated with this infection.

Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (third-generation cephalosporin-resistant), ESCMID 2021 guidelines recommend to avoid using new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors for the treatment of infections caused by third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacterales due to antibiotic stewardship considerations. Reserve these antibiotics for extensively resistant bacteria.

MBL-producing Enterobacterales—preferred antibiotics and outcomes: Preferred antibiotic options for NDM-producing Enterobacterales (or other metallo-β-lactamase [MBL] producers) include ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam or cefiderocol, with the ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam combination active against approximately 90% of MBL-producing Enterobacterales isolates. A cohort indicated that approximately 92% of isolates were susceptible to cefiderocol, and in a clinical trial of patients with MBL-producing Enterobacterales infections, clinical cure occurred in 80% (8 of 10) with cefiderocol versus 0% (0 of 4) with alternate therapy, with day 28 mortality of 10% (1 of 10) versus 75% (3 of 4), respectively. Observational data found 30-day mortality of 19% with ceftazidime-avibactam/aztreonam versus 44% with alternate regimens, and in a separate cohort from 2019–2022 including 215 receiving ceftazidime-avibactam/aztreonam, 33 cefiderocol, and 26 colistin-containing regimens, unadjusted 30-day mortality was 22%, 33%, and 50%, respectively. Clinical trial data comparing ceftazidime-avibactam/aztreonam vs cefiderocol are not available and both agents are considered preferred treatment options for MBL-producing Enterobacterales infections. The CLSI has endorsed a broth disk dilution method to evaluate susceptibility to ceftazidime-avibactam/ aztreonam, and tigecycline or eravacycline are alternative options for infections not involving the bloodstream or urinary tract.

### Point-counterpoint: piperacillin-tazobactam should be used to treat infections with extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-positive organisms [^e6ccd2ec]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTIONBeta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination antimicrobials (BLBLIs) are among the most controversial classes of antibiotic agents available for the treatment of infections caused by extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Gram-negative bacteria (ESBL-GNR). Piperacillin-tazobactam (PTZ) is one of the most frequently utilized antibiotic agents for empirical Gram-negative bacterial coverage and remains active against a large proportion of ESBL-GNR strains. Furthermore, good antimicrobial stewardship practices encourage the use of carbapenem-sparing treatment regimens for infections due to ESBL-GNR. As rapid diagnostics are increasingly used in the clinical microbiology laboratory and have the capability of detecting CTX-M type or other ESBL resistance mechanisms, this issue continues to be pertinent. Some data imply reduced efficacy of PTZ against ESBLs. Several factors may affect a clinician's choice to use BLBLIs, including the isolate's MIC, the site and severity of infection, and the type of resistance mechanism. These factors are explored in this review of the pros and cons of BLBLI treatment of invasive infections due to ESBL-producing bacteria, as well as how laboratories should report results for BLBLIs for these organisms as they relate to antimicrobial stewardship. In this Point-Counterpoint, Audrey Schuetz provides the pro point of view and Sergio Reyes and Pranita Tamma provide the con, counterpoint view.

### Challenges in the management of infections due to carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae [^52849881]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2014). Low credibility.

Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections are increasing and are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Members of the Emerging Infections Network treating CRE encountered difficulties in obtaining laboratory results and struggled with limited treatment options. In addition, many treated patients experienced an alarming degree of drug toxicity from CRE therapies.

### The use of a combination antibiogram to assist with the selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae infections [^e74311f8]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2015). Low credibility.

Combination antibiograms can be used to evaluate organism cross-resistance among multiple antibiotics. As combination therapy is generally favored for the treatment of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE), combination antibiograms provide valuable information about the combination of antibiotics that achieve the highest likelihood of adequate antibiotic coverage against CPE.

### Role of new antibiotics in extended-spectrum β-lactamase-, ampC-infections [^bd930a92]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL)- and ampicillinase class C (AmpC)-producing Enterobacterales represent one of the major public threats of the current era. As a consequence, during the last decades there have been great efforts to develop new therapeutic agents against these microorganisms. The aim of this review is to summarize the clinical features associated with novel antibiotics with activity against ESBL- and AmpC-producing isolates.

Recent Findings

There a number of therapeutic agents with activity against ESBL and AmpC than have been introduced and approved over the past few years. Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam are both carbapenem sparing agents that appear interesting alternatives for treatment of serious Gram-negative infections. Other new β-lactams/ β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. cefepime-enmetazobactam; ceftaroline fosamil-avibactam; aztreonam-avibactam and cefepime-zidebactam) as well as eravacycline, omadacycline, and plazomicin are also promising agents for treatment of ESBL- and AmpC- infections, but further clinical data are needed to establish their efficacy in comparison to carbapenems. The role of carbapenems/ β-lactamase inhibitors remains to be clarified.

Summary

New therapeutic agents against ESBL- and AmpC-producing Enterobacterales have distinctive specificities and limitations that require further investigations. Future randomized clinical trials are required to define the best strategy for their use in patients with serious infections due to ESBL- and/or AmpC- infections.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^b0c72375]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative guidance—KPC-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections outside the urinary tract: Meropenem-vaborbactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, and imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are preferred treatment options, with cefiderocol an alternative option. Preferred agents for KPC-producing infections include these three agents, and all 3 agents appear to have greater than 95% activity against KPC-producing Enterobacterales in the United States. Although all 3 are preferred, the panel slightly favors meropenem-vaborbactam, followed by ceftazidime-avibactam, and then imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, based on available clinical outcomes data and likelihood of resistance emergence. In an observational comparison, clinical cure and 30-day mortality among patients who received meropenem-vaborbactam versus ceftazidime-avibactam were 85% and 61% and 12% and 19%, respectively; although these differences were not statistically significant, they numerically favor meropenem-vaborbactam. Among patients with recurrent CRE infections, 0% (0 of 3) after meropenem-vaborbactam versus 20% (3 of 15) after ceftazidime-avibactam had subsequent CRE isolates resistant to initial therapy, and other clinical experiences found a slightly higher likelihood of clinical cure and survival and a lower risk of resistance emergence with meropenem-vaborbactam. Limited clinical data are available for imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam in KPC-producing Enterobacterales; among Enterobacterales infections, favorable clinical response occurred in 40% (2 of 5 patients) with imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam versus 100% (2 of 2 patients) with imipenem-cilastatin plus colistin, and it is difficult to draw conclusions due to small numbers. Over 95% of KPC-producing Enterobacterales test susceptible to cefiderocol, and cefiderocol is suggested as an alternative agent for treating KPC-producing pathogens due to limited clinical outcomes data and to reserve it for infections caused by metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacterales or glucose non-fermenting gram-negative organisms.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^dc8c195b]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Further addressing the question of whether PTZ is clinically as efficacious as carbapenems in the treatment of bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing organisms, investigators compared 14-day mortality when PTZ versus a carbapenem was used as empiric therapy (defined in this trial as antibiotic therapy administered to a patient before their ESBL status was known) in a cohort of 331 patients with ESBL bacteremia who received definitive therapy with a carbapenem. The adjusted risk of death was 1.9 times higher for patients receiving empiric PTZ compared with empiric carbapenem (95 % confidence interval 1.07–3.45).

It is important to acknowledge that the data regarding the role of PTZ in the treatment of ESBL-producing bacteria may not be an accurate predictor of how new β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. avibactam or relebactam) or new combinations (e.g. ceftolozane/tazobactam) may perform in the treatment of these infections. Ceftolozane/tazobactam in combination with metronidazole was shown to be noninferior to meropenem in a multinational, double-blind randomized phase 3 trial of adult patients hospitalized with complicated intraabdominal infections. Of the isolated pathogens, 7.2 % were ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and for this group of patients clinical cure rates were 95.8 % in the ceftolozane/tazobactam group and 88.5 % in the meropenem group. Similar findings were reported from a randomized trial of adult patients hospitalized with complicated lower urinary tract infections or pyelonephritis, in which 7.6 % of the isolated pathogens were ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.
