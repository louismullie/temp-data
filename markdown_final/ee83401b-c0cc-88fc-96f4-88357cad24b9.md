## Question

Parapisums

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "parapisums". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "parapisums" is a misspelling and what the intended term most plausibly is. Then, I should verify the most relevant evidence base and extract key clinical points. Next, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful answer with appropriate caveats and citations. Finally, I will double-check for any alternative interpretations and ensure the response aligns with the best available references.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "parapisums" does not map to a recognized medical entity in the provided corpus. Wait, let me verify the closest matches: the most plausible intended term is "parapsoriasis", given its repeated appearance and centrality to the documents, with "paraphimosis" as a distant second possibility; given the dermatologic context and frequency of "parapsoriasis" in the references, I will proceed assuming parapsoriasis unless new information contradicts this assumption.

> I will now examine the core definition and subtypes to anchor the discussion. Parapsoriasis refers to a spectrum of chronic, relapsing papulosquamous dermatoses historically divided into small-plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP), with LPP carrying a recognized risk of progression to mycosis fungoides, the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, whereas SPP is generally considered benign with minimal malignant potential [^55573c0c] [^0631caa4].

> Next, I should review malignant transformation risk and how it differs by subtype. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: while older teaching emphasized a broad risk, more recent expert summaries indicate that LPP progresses to overt MF in up to about 35% of cases, whereas SPP rarely if ever transforms, which is why many clinicians monitor LPP more closely and may avoid labeling SPP as premalignant in routine practice [^55573c0c] [^0631caa4].

> Let me consider diagnostic uncertainty and overlap with early mycosis fungoides, because this is where mislabeling can occur. I should confirm that distinguishing early MF from parapsoriasis often requires correlation of clinical morphology, multiple biopsies, and ancillary testing such as T-cell receptor gene rearrangement, with validated algorithms like ISCL/Guitart criteria aiding diagnosis; importantly, some patients labeled initially as parapsoriasis are later reclassified as early MF, underscoring the need for longitudinal follow-up and repeat biopsies when suspicious features evolve [^55573c0c].

> I need to check emerging etiologic clues that might refine risk stratification. Recent studies report a significant association between cutavirus (Cutavirus, CuV) and LPP, with higher detection rates in LPP lesions than in other inflammatory dermatoses; however, I should emphasize that association does not prove causality, and prospective studies are needed to determine whether CuV positivity predicts progression or simply reflects a permissive inflammatory milieu [^24cc8883] [^24cc8883].

> Now, I will examine treatment principles and prognosis. For SPP, narrowband UVB phototherapy achieves high response rates and favorable safety, with relapses common but manageable; for LPP, many clinicians favor phototherapy as first-line to control disease and facilitate surveillance, while maintaining vigilance for evolution to MF and escalating to MF-directed therapies if transformation occurs; importantly, limited-patch stage MF generally has an excellent prognosis and does not alter life expectancy, which supports careful, stage-appropriate counseling and follow-up rather than overtreatment [^c6c42a2d] [^55573c0c] [^ecb22404].

> But wait, what if the original query truly meant "paraphimosis"? I should double-check that possibility. Paraphimosis is a urologic emergency in uncircumcised males with the foreskin trapped behind the corona, requiring urgent reduction and prevention strategies; this is mechanistically and clinically unrelated to parapsoriasis, so if the user intended paraphimosis, the management and implications would be entirely different and would pivot to emergency urologic care rather than dermatologic surveillance [^dfff614c].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Assuming the intended term is parapsoriasis, it is a chronic papulosquamous dermatosis with two main subtypes: SPP, which is benign and responds well to phototherapy, and LPP, which carries a meaningful risk of progression to mycosis fungoides and warrants closer follow-up; diagnosis relies on clinicopathologic correlation and, when uncertain, TCR clonality studies, and emerging data suggest a possible association with cutavirus in LPP that may inform future risk biomarkers but currently does not change standard management [^55573c0c] [^c6c42a2d] [^22ea1509].

Parapsoriasis is a **chronic, relapsing dermatosis** with two main subtypes: small-plaque parapsoriasis (SPP), which is benign and rarely progresses, and large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP), which has a **significant risk of progression to mycosis fungoides** (MF) [^55573c0c] [^0631caa4]. Diagnosis is clinical, supported by histopathology and T-cell clonality studies; LPP shows atypical lymphocytes and frequent clonal T-cell rearrangements, whereas SPP is typically polyclonal [^55573c0c] [^b8089fe9]. Management is individualized: SPP often responds to narrowband UVB [^c6c42a2d], while LPP may require phototherapy, topical corticosteroids, or low-dose methotrexate, with close surveillance for transformation to MF [^notfound]. Recent data suggest cutavirus may be associated with LPP, but causality remains unproven [^22ea1509] [^24cc8883]. Prognosis is excellent for SPP; LPP carries a 10–30% risk of progression to MF, warranting long-term follow-up [^55573c0c] [^0631caa4].

## Clinical classification and features

Parapsoriasis is classified into **two main subtypes** based on clinical morphology and risk of progression:

| **Subtype** | **Clinical features** | **Risk of progression** |
|-|-|-|
| Small-plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) | - Chronic, asymptomatic or mildly pruritic, erythematous, scaly patches < 5 cm <br/> - Often digitate (finger-like) on the trunk and proximal extremities <br/> - Stable or slowly progressive | Benign; rarely progresses to MF [^55573c0c] |
| Large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) | - Larger (> 5 cm), irregular, erythematous, scaly patches with atrophy, poikiloderma, and telangiectasia <br/> - Often on the trunk and buttocks <br/> - May be pruritic or asymptomatic | Significant risk (10–30%) of progression to MF [^55573c0c] [^0631caa4] |

---

## Histopathology

Histopathology distinguishes SPP from LPP and helps assess **malignant transformation risk**:

- **Small-plaque parapsoriasis (SPP)**: Mild chronic dermatitis with minimal lymphocytic infiltrate; no significant atypia or epidermotropism [^notfound].
- **Large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP)**: Atypical lymphocytes, epidermotropism, and a lichenoid infiltrate; features overlap with early MF, making differentiation challenging [^notfound].

---

## Molecular and immunohistochemical markers

Molecular studies and immunohistochemistry aid diagnosis and risk stratification:

- **T-cell clonality**: LPP frequently shows clonal T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements, whereas SPP is typically polyclonal [^854b7445].
- **Immunophenotype**: LPP may show aberrant expression of T-cell markers (e.g. loss of CD7, CD5) and increased PD-1 expression, supporting a clonal process [^b8089fe9].
- **Cutavirus (CuV)**: Recent studies associate CuV with LPP, suggesting a possible viral trigger, though causality remains unproven [^22ea1509] [^24cc8883].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis

Diagnosis is based on **clinical-histopathologic correlation**, with exclusion of other dermatoses. The **International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL)** provides criteria integrating clinical, histopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features to distinguish early MF from parapsoriasis [^55573c0c]. Key differentials include psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, lichen planus, and other chronic dermatoses [^6aeae4d1].

---

## Management strategies

Management is tailored to subtype, disease extent, and risk of progression:

- **Small-plaque parapsoriasis (SPP)**: Narrowband UVB phototherapy is effective and safe, with high response rates and low relapse [^c6c42a2d].
- **Large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP)**: Phototherapy (PUVA or narrowband UVB), topical corticosteroids, or low-dose methotrexate are options; close surveillance for transformation to MF is essential [^notfound].
- **Follow-up**: Regular clinical examinations and repeat biopsies are recommended for LPP to detect early MF transformation [^55573c0c].

---

## Prognosis and risk of malignant transformation

SPP has an **excellent prognosis** with minimal risk of progression, whereas LPP carries a **10–30% risk of progression to MF**, particularly in lesions with poikiloderma or atypical histology. Early detection and treatment of transformed disease improve outcomes [^55573c0c] [^0631caa4].

---

## Recent advances and controversies

Recent research has clarified the **parapsoriasis-MF spectrum**, with single-cell studies showing LPP shares molecular features with early MF, supporting its premalignant potential [^b8089fe9]. The role of cutavirus in LPP is under investigation, and preliminary data suggest a possible association, though causality remains unproven [^22ea1509] [^24cc8883]. Controversy persists regarding the necessity of aggressive therapy in LPP; current guidelines favor conservative management with close surveillance [^notfound].

---

Parapsoriasis is a chronic dermatosis with two distinct subtypes: benign SPP and potentially premalignant LPP. Accurate diagnosis and risk stratification, supported by histopathology and molecular studies, guide management. SPP responds well to phototherapy, while LPP requires vigilant surveillance and individualized therapy due to its risk of progression to MF.

Should Lymphomatoid Parapsoriasis Become a Synonym for a Clinically Defined Parapsoriasis Subset That has the Histopathology of Patch Stage MF?

The early assignation of patch stage MF as a diagnosis provides a significant burden to patients and for parents in the case of children particularly as MF limited patch stage disease does not affect life expectancy but represents chronic relapsing dermatoses.

The adoption of lymphomatoid parapsoriasis as a synonym for a subset of parapsoriasis that lack the clinical features of cMF despite the histopathology of patch stage MF would address this issue. All presentations with the histopathology of patch stage MF including those defined clinically as cMF usually respond to current therapy but can pursue a chronic relapsing course shared by other prototypic dermatoses. The life expectancy of lymphomatoid parapsoriasis corresponds to that of cMF stages 1A and 1B and is unaltered, and no further staging procedures are currently recommended.

The preservation of parapsoriasis as a clinically based diagnosis and the incorporation of lymphomatoid parapsoriasis with the histopathology of patch stage MF may form a tribute to Brocq and his astute clinical observations. This provided a conceptual template, adopted in this critical review, to incorporate dermatological and immunological advances over a century later.

### Subsequent cancers, mortality, and causes of death in patients with mycosis fungoides and parapsoriasis: a Danish nationwide, population-based cohort study [^17c79363]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Data on subsequent cancers, prognostic factors for mortality, and causes of death are limited in mycosis fungoides (MF) and parapsoriasis.

Objectives

To assess subsequent cancers, mortality, and causes of death in MF and parapsoriasis.

Methods

Using the Danish nationwide population-based registries, we identified 368 MF patients and 582 parapsoriasis patients and compared them with the general Danish population for subsequent cancers, mortality, and causes of death.

Results

Subsequent cancers were significantly increased in parapsoriasis patients (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 2.0 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.6–2.5]), and a trend was observed in MF (SIR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.9–1.5]). Mortality was significantly increased in MF (SIR, 2.0 [95% CI, 1.8–2.3]) and parapsoriasis (SIR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1–1.5]). Excess mortality from MF was highest during the first 5 years of follow-up, and causes of increased death included both malignant and nonmalignant diseases.

Limitations

We have no information regarding clinical stage, treatments, and patient lifestyles.

Conclusion

Patients with parapsoriasis had a significantly increased risk of subsequent cancers and increased mortality. In addition, the highest excess mortality in the MF group was observed during the first 5 years of follow-up, which suggests that MF exists in both an aggressive and a more indolent form.

### Single-cell sequencing delineates T-cell clonality and pathogenesis of the parapsoriasis disease group [^b8089fe9]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Mycosis fungoides (MF), the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, is often underdiagnosed in early stages because of similarities with benign dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis (AD). Furthermore, the delineation from what is called "parapsoriasis en plaque", a disease that can appear either in a small- or large-plaque form, is still controversial.

Objective

We sought to characterize the parapsoriasis disease spectrum.

Methods

We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of skin biopsies from patients within the parapsoriasis-to-early-stage MF spectrum, stratified for small and large plaques, and compared them to AD, psoriasis, and healthy control skin.

Results

Six of 8 large-plaque lesions harbored either an expanded alpha/beta or gamma/delta T-cell clone with downregulation of CD7 expression, consistent with a diagnosis of early-stage MF. In contrast, 6 of 7 small-plaque lesions were polyclonal in nature, thereby lacking a lymphomatous phenotype, and also revealed a less inflammatory microenvironment than early-stage MF or AD. Of note, polyclonal small- and large-plaque lesions characteristically harbored a population of NPY + innate lymphoid cells and displayed a stromal signature of complement upregulation and antimicrobial hyperresponsiveness in fibroblasts and sweat gland cells, respectively. These conditions were clearly distinct from AD or psoriasis, which uniquely harbored CD3 + CRTH2 + IL-13 expressing "T H 2A" cells, or strong type 17 inflammation, respectively.

Conclusion

These data position polyclonal small- and large-plaque parapsoriasis lesions as a separate disease entity that characteristically harbors a so far undescribed innate lymphoid cell population. We thus propose a new term, "polyclonal parapsoriasis en plaque", for this kind of lesion because they can be clearly differentiated from early- and advanced-stage MF, psoriasis, and AD on several cellular and molecular levels.

INTRODUCTION

The spectrum of dermatoses defined as parapsoriasis by Brocq in 1902, continues to be controversial and enigmatic. A recent perspective on parapsoriasis has even proposed that this histopathological diagnosis should be removed from the medical dictionary as it represents cutaneous mycosis fungoides (cMF). Parapsoriasis can be clinically distinctive and is retained as a diagnosis by dermatologists. The enigmatic link with tumorous cMF was recognized by Bazin in 1870. These inflammatory dermatoses that were subsequently defined by Brocq as parapsoriasis, preceded clinically overt cMF but could also be simultaneously present and to subsequently emerge as new inflammatory lesions. A major shift, in reference to the status of parapsoriasis as a set of inflammatory dermatoses, occurred in 1979, when Sanchez and Ackermandefined the histopathological features of patch stage cMF. They concluded that there was no role for any subset of parapsoriasis or other primary inflammatory dermatosis to be a precursor of cMF.

Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a key in exploring the relationship of parapsoriasis and MF. In 1968, Macaulaydefined LyP to accommodate his observation of a paradoxical combination of a self-resolving and recurring inflammatory papulonodular dermatosis that usually pursued a chronic course but was histopathologically diagnosed as cutaneous lymphoma.

Two national LyP databases of LyP, with long-term follow-up of patients have indicated that either cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (cALCL) or cMF and not Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) emerged in a subset of LyP. LyP could precede, occur simultaneously, or continue to appear at times of remission of these lymphomas. This is similar to that observed in reference to clinical parapsoriasis and MF. Most patients with LyP did not develop either cMF or cALCL.

Critical Analysis of Brocq's Definition of Parapsoriasis and an Integrated Revised Template

In 1902, many inflammatory dermatoses had not been defined and those classified by Brocq as seborrheides psoriasiformes and seborrheides pityriasiques would have been heterogeneous entities (Fig. 3). Significantly, both of these potentially related seborrheic dermatoses, in contrast to lichen planus and psoriasis, were directly linked to parapsoriasis. This raises the potential that additional inflammatory variants of parapsoriasis were embedded within the spectrum of inflammatory seborrheic dermatoses. There are variants of parapsoriasis that lack the histopathogical defining features of patch stage MF such as digitate dermatosis and chronic superficial dermatitis that could have been considered clinically to represent seborrheic dermatoses. As a group, these dermatoses could be considered simply as parapsoriasis or as forms of epidermotropic T-cell dyscrasia.

FIGURE 3.
Updated Brocq's template incorporating the complex web representing LyP and incorporating iSALT Treg lymphomatoid parapsoriasis as a clinically defined subset patch stage MF.

Brocq also included pityriasis rubra benin that probably incorporated pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) previously defined in 1857 by Devergie.PRP as a follicular-related dermatosis provided an opportunity to include a follicular hub without relationship to PRP. Follicular mucinosis, and folliculotropic T-cell dyscrasia (folliculotropic T-cell lymphocytosis), could be included in the hub and also incorporate follicular lymphoproliferative and lymphomatoid dermatoses that now include lymphomatoid CD30 + T-cell–defined follicular LyP, – CD30 − folliculotropic MF including a Treg-derived stem cell basaloid folliculolymphoid hyperplastic variant of CD30 − follicular MF.

### Hypopigmented parapsoriasis en plaque, a new, overlooked member of the parapsoriasis family: a report of 34 patients and a 7-year experience [^d8d53018]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In the past 7 years we have extensively studied an uncommon hypopigmented disorder that, apart from hypopigmentation, showed many common features with parapsoriasis en plaque (PSEP), both clinically and histopathologically.

Objective

We sought to verify whether this disorder should be considered a hypopigmented variant of PSEP and thus be referred to as hypopigmented PSEP.

Methods

A total of 34 patients presenting with this peculiar hypopigmented disorder were included (2003–2010). Patients were subjected to a predesigned algorithm excluding all possible differential diagnoses of hypopigmented lesions.

Results

Our findings indicated that this disorder can be diagnosed as hypopigmented PSEP. These findings included: (1) exclusion of all other disorders causing similar hypopigmented lesions; (2) shape and size of the lesions being very similar to those of classic small PSEP (small-plaque parapsoriasis [SPP]); (3) similar distribution of the lesions (trunk, proximal upper and lower limbs) to the classic PSEP; (4) digitiform extensions of most the lesions (70.5% of our patients) as in SPP; (5) absence of itching as in PSEP (SPP type); (6) good response to narrowband ultraviolet B in 76.4% of the patients (n = 26); and (7) during follow-up 5 patients (14.7%) converted into hypopigmentd mycosis fungoides.

Limitations

A limitation in our study is that we did not perform clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement because of limited resources.

Conclusion

Based on our findings we believe that this hypopigmented disorder is a well-defined new variant of the PSEP family that shows, apart from the hypopigmentation, all the features of PSEP, particularly the SPP variant, and accordingly could be referred to as hypopigmented PSEP.

### Critical review – A tribute to louis brocq lymphomatoid papulosis, the key in exploring the relationship of parapsoriasis and mycosis fungoides [^18309517]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

A paradigm shift in cutaneous immunodermatology can be linked with the discovery of inducible skin-associated lymphoid tissue (iSALT), hubs incorporating regulatory T cells (Tregs) that have been shown to have pleiotropic functions. These hubs have the capacity to modulate relapsing epidermotropic inflammatory and lymphomatoid dermatoses driven by overlapping immunological pathways and also control T-cell clonal expansion. This represents a central inhibiting force modulating the evolution of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) within lymphoproliferative pathways.

In this immunological setting, LyP can be a recast as activated inducible Treg derived inhibitory lymphomatoid hubs that are inflammatory and inhibit aberrant T-cell clones in all 3 major LyP subtypes. LyP type C is recognized as a CD30 + lymphoproliferative spectrum linked to cALCL. In contrast, LyP type B relationship to cMF is more complex as CD30 + status is variable and defined by its papulonodular presentation and regression as LyP. Progression of CD30 + LyP type B is to CD30 − patch/plaque form of cMF as an alternative route to parapsoriasis. Both pathways ultimately may belong to memory-based inhibitory lymphomatoid pathways that clinically appear as distinct chronic relapsing paradoxical inflammatory dermatoses linked to cMF.

In this critical analysis, LyP was the key in exploring the paradoxical relationship of parapsoriasis to MF.

### Clonal T cell receptor gamma-chain gene rearrangement by PCR-based geneScan analysis in the skin and blood of patients with parapsoriasis and early-stage mycosis fungoides [^854b7445]. The Journal of Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) and reactive T cell skin diseases represent opposite ends of a spectrum of diseases ranging from overtly malignant to persistently benign. Within this spectrum, the parapsoriasis group is not clearly defined regarding malignant potential. In contrast to consistent findings in advanced-stage CTCL, clonality analysis of parapsoriasis has produced conflicting results in previous studies. As T cell receptor gamma-chain polymerase chain reaction GeneScan analysis (TCR-gamma-PCR-GSA) stands out by its sensitivity, its accuracy in size determination of PCR products, its capacity to identify false positives by repeated analysis and its easy applicability, this approach was used to analyse the clonality status of 41 patients with borderline T cell lymphoproliferative skin diseases, including parapsoriasis (n = 27) and early-stage mycosis fungoides (MF) (n = 14). A monoclonal T cell infiltrate was demonstrated by repeated TCR-gamma-PCR-GSA in lesional skin specimens in 19.2% of parapsoriasis patients and in 66.6% of early-stage MF cases (p = 0.013). In peripheral blood, a monoclonal T cell population was found in a similar percentage of parapsoriasis and of early-stage MF patients (26.7% versus 12.5%; p = 0.611). A detailed analysis of parapsoriasis subentities, namely small and large plaque parapsoriasis, and parapsoriasis lichenoides, revealed monoclonality in 2(6)/2(5), 3(14)/2(8) and 0(6)/0/(3) of the skin and peripheral blood specimens, respectively. The high detection rate of false positive cases by repeated analysis (20–37.5%) provides a corrected perspective for the high rates of dominant T cell clones found by others in the peripheral blood of such patients. From the results obtained, three major conclusions can be drawn: firstly, CTCL is clearly associated with detection of monoclonality, even in its early stages; secondly, monoclonality is not a prerequisite for potential CTCL precursor entities; and thirdly, recirculating malignant T cells identical to the skin clone are not readily detected in parapsoriasis or early-stage MF, but may rather indicate disease progression.

Abstract:

Both parapsoriasis and LyP appear clinically as inflammatory dermatoses with a paradoxical link to cMF. A key element in addressing the relationship of parapsoriasis and MF were the results of the French and Dutch long-term registries tracking the emergence of lymphomas in the setting of LyP. Both cMF and cALCL emerged almost equally in these long-term studies. This ultimately supports that the stem cells in both cMF and cALCL are probably derived from a common stem cell shared by CD4+/CD8+ memory stem cells defining cMF and CD30+ stem cells defining cALCL. The discovery of inducible Skin Associated Lymphoid Tissue (iSALT) mesenchymal hubs incorporating Tregs, with their pleiotropic functions represents a paradigm shift and formed a translational tool in this analysis of the paradox. LyP can be recast as activated inhibitory lymphomatoid T-cell hubs derived from inducible iTregs in iSALT and the source of the common stem cell LyP line. iSALT Treg integrated mesenchymal hubs provided an emerging translational tool in redefining integrated lymphomatoid pathways. Brocq's complex scheme defining parapsoriasis as hybrid inflammatory dermatoses with a paradoxical link to cMF became a template to preserve parapsoriasis as a clinical diagnosis. Two major iSALT Treg generated inhibitory integrated lymphomatoid hubs emerged. The major CD30+TNF lymphomatoid hub has been linked to cALCL. Clinically defined chronic regressing and relapsing parapsoriasis with the histopathology of patch stage MF can be redefined as lymphomatoid parapsoriasis. This twin inhibited oncogenic memory based hub is defined by Treg modulated, CD4+/CD8+memory linked PD-1/DL-1 cytoxic complex and lichenoid histopathology.

Programmed Memory Tregs Linked to Lymphomatoid cMF and Lymphomatoid cALCL Differ from Reactive Pseudolymphoma Counterparts

Experimental contact dermatitis models were used to define iSALT and also establish the induction of hapten-specific memory Tregs. Contact dermatitis can present as a reactive lymphomatoid pseudolymphomas with cMF histopathology. In this setting, the memory-based hapten pathway does not incorporate cMF. Similarly, the other cMF pseudolymphomas emerging in defined inflammatory dermatoses also do not incorporate cMF into memory-based Treg-modulated aberrant immunological pathways defining these dermatoses. In contrast, both cMF and cALCL within the context of LyP represent oncogenic lymphomatoid lymphomas.

Variants of Parapsoriasis and Their Relationship Both to Prototypic Epidermal Dermatoses and MF According to Brocq in 1902

Brocq's scheme that defines parapsoriasis and their relationship to prototypic dermatoses and their links to MF (Fig. 2) represents a complex conceptual and largely clinically based template. Key morphological features defining prototypic inflammatory dermatoses such as lichen planus, psoriasis, and chronic pityriasis lichenoides (PL) had already been defined in 1902. A morphologically heterogenous group of inflammatory dermatoses also appeared in a subset of patients who developed cMF. Brocq simplified these potentially oncogenic dermatoses into 3 subtypes of parapsoriasis that morphologically differed but were interlinked to the prototypic dermatoses.

FIGURE 2.
Brocq's conceptual scheme (1902) defining variants of parapsoriasis and their relationship to each other, known papulosquamous dermatoses and MF. Solid lines represent directly linked dermatoses; broad hatched bridges represent dermatoses with shared features that are not linked. Fully hatched and bridged central area with provisional lines represent complex overlapping relationship of the variants of parapsoriasis to be explored.

In his scheme, the variants of parapsoriasis are centrally placed with an outer group of prototypic inflammatory papulosquamous dermatoses. The variants of parapsoriasis were characterized by their unknown etiology, relapsing chronic state and poor response to therapy shared by the outer rim of inflammatory papulosquamous dermatoses.

In his scheme, solid lines were used to highlight prototypic dermatoses that were definitely linked to either parapsoriasis en plaque or parapsoriasis lichenoides. Broad hatched bridges were used for dermatoses, particularly psoriasis and lichen planus, which shared blended morphological features but were not directly linked to the parapsoriasis variants. There are also a complex series of shaded and dotted lines present with respect to parapsoriasis that Brocq included requiring future clarification.

Parapsoriasis en plaque and parapsoriasis lichenoides had direct transformational links to MF. Brocq also included a third guttate form of parapsoriasis that was previously defined by Juliusbergin 1899 as pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) without a transformational oncogenic link to MF. Brocq's scheme explored the relationship of parapsoriasis to other defined inflammatory papulosquamous dermatoses. Overt clinical transformation to MF was not a defining feature for the variants of parapsoriasis. These relationships have been subsequently been the subject of several studies,– including their relationship to LyP.

The diagnostic value of parakeratosis is reviewed, with special emphasis on associated inflammatory tissue reaction patterns and the geometric pattern of the scale. Parakeratosis may also occur in disorders not primarily inflammatory in nature and those associations are addressed. Topics are divided into 6 categories: parakeratosis in the settings of spongiotic and interface dermatitis, disorders in which neutrophils are a prominent feature, "patterned" parakeratosis, parapsoriasis, and disorders of keratinization. The entities considered are diverse and major diagnostic features of each are reviewed.

LyP can be recast as activated inhibitory lymphomatoid T-cell hubs derived from inducible iTregs in iSALT and the source of the common stem cell LyP line. iSALT Treg integrated mesenchymal hubs provided an emerging translational tool in redefining integrated lymphomatoid pathways. Brocq's complex scheme defining parapsoriasis as hybrid inflammatory dermatoses with a paradoxical link to cMF became a template to preserve parapsoriasis as a clinical diagnosis. Two major iSALT Treg generated inhibitory integrated lymphomatoid hubs emerged. The major CD30+TNF lymphomatoid hub has been linked to cALCL. Clinically defined chronic regressing and relapsing parapsoriasis with the histopathology of patch stage MF can be redefined as lymphomatoid parapsoriasis. This twin inhibited oncogenic memory based hub is defined by Treg modulated, CD4+/CD8+memory linked PD-1/DL-1 cytoxic complex and lichenoid histopathology.

SYNOPSIS

Both parapsoriasis and LyP appear clinically as inflammatory dermatoses with a paradoxical link to cMF.
A key element in addressing the relationship of parapsoriasis and cMF were the results of the French and Dutch long-term registries tracking the emergence of lymphomas in the setting of LyP.
Both cMF and cALCL emerged almost equally in these long-term studies but all 3 major LyP subtypes included in the registries were not specifically linked to each lymphoma.
LyP Hodgkin-like variant A did not progress to cHL but instead a subset progressed to either cMF or cALCL.
This ultimately supports that the distinct stem cells in both cMF and cALCL are probably derived from a common stem cell allied to inducible regulatory T cells transforming into the mutant CD4 + /CD8 + memory stem cells defining cMF and mutant CD30 + stem cells defining cALCL.
The question related to this shared oncogenic pathway was the immunological relationship in the skin of CD4 + /CD8 + memory and CD30 + T-cell phenotypes that are expressed in both prototypic inflammatory and lymphomatoid dermatoses.
This was made possible by the progress in defining iSALT mesenchymal hubs incorporating Tregs, with their pleiotropic functions defined by Rosenblum. These key skin-based domains represent a paradigm shift and formed a translational tool in this analysis.
These hubs have the capacity to modulate chronic relapsing T-cell–defined inflammatory and lymphomatoid dermatoses and control T-cell clonal expansion and also modulate stem cell pathways to maintain tissue homeostasis and repair.
The complex relationships that have emerged in regards to CD30 + T cells, CD4 + /CD8 +, and Tregs in the thymus are shared by the peripheral thymus-like iSALT hubs.
Integrated CD30 + TNF/TNF-L super family complexes and CD4 + /CD8 + T-cell, PD-1/PDL-1–modulated cytotoxicity within iSALT is shared by prototypic inflammatory and lymphomatoid dermatoses.
These potent hubs are central to cutaneous homeostasis, peripheral adaptive tolerance, and creation of T stem cell memory pathways that define chronic relapsing prototypic inflammatory and lymphomatoid dermatoses.
LyP can be recast as activated inhibitory T-cell hubs that are created by inducible iTregs in iSALT and responsible for immune surveillance shared by inflammatory and lymphomatoid dermatoses.
LyP ultimately is a disorder representing inhibited oncogenesis expressed histopathologically as involuting cHL, cMF, and cALCL. The clinical course is shared by chronic relapsing inflammatory dermatoses and are adaptive inhibitory pathways that are memory based induced by the homeostatic iSALT Treg system.
In 1968, LyP was defined within the context of a nondistinctive, chronic resolving and recurring papulonodular inflammatory process with a paradoxical histopathology of cutaneous lymphoma.
In contrast, parapsoriasis was defined in 1902 by Brocq as a clinically distinctive spectrum of chronic relapsing lichenoid dermatoses.
In 1979, Sanchez and Ackerman defined the histopathological features of early patch stage cMF in the setting of parapsoriasis and recommended abandoning parapsoriasis as these dermatoses were not simply inflammatory.
This discovery could have also resulted in reclassifying parpsoriasis en plaque as lymphomatoid parapsoriasis and address the long-standing paradox and enigma related to parapsoriasis and its relationship to cMF.
The oncogenic lymphomatoid presentations of cMF would now also incorporate the classic evolution cMF that is not defined by the nondistinctive relapsing papulonodular presentation shared by all 3 major stem cell–linked cutaneous T-cell lymphomas in the LyP domain.
In this setting, Brocq's integration of parapsoriasis en plaque with parapsoriasis lichenoides is significant as lichenoid reactions signify antitumor immunity leading to regression and define autoimmune inflammatory dermatoses.
Brocq's complex schematic chart defining parapsoriasis in relationship to known prototypic dermatoses and MF provided a template that was able to be adapted to accommodate both the lymphomatoid parapsoriasis and the LyP domains.
Lichen planus and psoriasis are retained as prototypic dermatoses that are distinctive and used by Brocq to introduce the hybrid presentations of parapsoriasis.
Brocq's inclusion of inflammatory guttate parapsoriasis (PLC) provided a link to the complex LyP network and an alternative but interlinked inhibitory lymphomatoid cMF subset.
The CD4 + /CD8 + memory stem cells defining cMF are shared within immunological pathways linked to inflammatory dermatoses that are rarely oncogenic and instead manifest as transitory cMF-like pseudolymphomas.
iSALT Treg-integrated mesenchymal hubs provided an emerging translational tool that was used in redefining integrated lymphomatoid pathways.
These represent activated inhibitory T-cell hubs incorporating the complex relationship bridging CD30 + and CD4 + /CD8 + memory T cells incorporating thymic-related iSALT immunoregulation.

Prototypic Inflammatory Dermatoses, Lymphomatoid Parapsoriasis, and Mycosis Fungoides and the Biologics

The difficulties in separating prototypic inflammatory dermatoses, lymphomatoid parapsoriasis, and mycosis fungoides within their lymphoproliferative and immunological pathways is inherent to the iSALT Treg hubs and their complex integrated homeostatic, immunological, and nonimmunological functions.

This is also now reflected by the advent of biologics that have revolutionized both cancer therapy and the management of prototypic chronic relapsing dermatoses and modify iSALT Treg immunological pathways modulating inflammatory and oncogenic processes. This applies to a broad range of prototypic inflammatory dermatoses treated by biologics where the emergence lymphomatoid parapsoriasis and MF has now been documented. Biologics modulating TNF axis linked with CD30 + lymphocytes and checkpoint inhibitors modulating the PD-1/PDL-1 axis linked the CD4 + /CD8 + cytotoxic T cells and integral to Treg-modulated pathways. This also includes folliculotropic T-cell dyscrasia presenting as a follicular eruption as a result of anti-TNF alpha therapy. Large numbers of lymphocytes expressing CD30 and producing Th2 cytokines have been found in acute atopic dermatitis. and CD30 + cutaneous lymphoma has emerged in association with atopic eczema. The same phenomenon has also occurred with duplimumab modulating interleukin-4 receptor in atopic dermatitis.

### Risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with mycosis fungoides and parapsoriasis: a Danish nationwide population-based cohort study [^93a137f8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Mycosis fungoides (MF) and parapsoriasis are characterized by malignant proliferation and chronic inflammation, which may affect the risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Objectives

To examine the risk for VTE in patients with MF and parapsoriasis.

Methods

We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study in Denmark to examine the relative risk (RR) of VTE in 525 patients with MF and 634 patients with parapsoriasis compared with that in sex- and age-matched controls from the general population.

Results

In patients with MF, the 10-year absolute risk for VTE was 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–5.4). The adjusted RRs were 2.41 (95% CI, 1.49–3.90) for VTE and 4.01 (95% CI, 2.16–7.46) for pulmonary embolism. Notably, within the first 5 years after diagnosis with MF, the RR of pulmonary embolism was increased 6.7-fold (to 6.71 [95% CI, 2.86–15.72]). Patients with parapsoriasis had a 2.7-fold increased RR of VTE (to 2.67 [95% CI, 1.32–5.40]) in the absence of other established VTE risk factors.

Limitations

We had no information regarding disease stage of MF and prescribed drugs.

Conclusion

Patients with MF and parapsoriasis had an increased RR of VTE, although the absolute risk remained low. These findings should increase awareness of comorbidities in patients with MF and parapsoriasis.

### Critical review – A tribute to louis brocq lymphomatoid papulosis, the key in exploring the relationship of parapsoriasis and mycosis fungoides [^3788dfc7]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Regression in parapsoriasis including the lymphomatoid variant can occur without postinflammatory changes, but in chronic persistent disease, this is expressed as epidermal atrophy, dyspigmentation, and poikiloderma. Brocq's inclusion parapsoriasis lichenoides as a variant of parapsoriasis en plaque is significant as lichenoid reactions are surrogate markers for autoimmunity and are an expression of iSALT Treg-derived inhibitory pathways shared with inflammatory and lymphomatoid dermatoses.

A major challenge in the revised template was to integrate LyP within Brocq's scheme. Brocq's redefined PLC/guttate parapsoriasis proved to be the variant that could form a link to the complex LyP domain incorporating subsets including cHL-like type A that the large registry studies had shown to have the potential progress to either cALCL or cMF and was not subtype restricted.

Acute pityriasis lichenoides was defined in 1925 as pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) by Mucha and Haberman. Macaulay had noted that PLEVA could share clinical features with LyP without a lymphomatoid histopathology. The lack of transformation of PL/guttate parapsoriasis to MF observed by Brocq has subsequently been borne out by long-term studies of PL, particularly in childhood. However, this lack of relationship of PL to cMF has changed as clinical variants of PL with atypical lymphomatoid histopathologylinked to cMF have been documented. More recently, a CD30 + lymphomatoid variant of PLEVA has also been defined. These changes to the spectrum of PL also support the existence of twin lymphomatoid paths defining cMF and cALCL. The shared immunological and oncogenic Treg immunomodulatory pathways that connect CD30 + and CD4 + /CD8 + T cells ultimately may define 2 oncogenic lymphomatoid domains representing LyP and lymphomatoid parapsoriasis that are now included in the revised template with their iSALT Treg affiliation.

### Paraphilias-where do we go from here? [^3468e07c]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Paraphilias and paraphilic behavior appear to be rooted in human history and the past has shown that the concepts of paraphilias, their theoretical basis, and their treatment options are constantly changing. For example, at the very beginning, every sexual orientation that was not heterosexual was regarded as an illness. Over time, science and society had to learn to distinguish between paraphilic interest, paraphilic behavior, and paraphilic disorder as well as between non-harmful sexual interests and sexual behaviors that are a threat to others and/or imply criminal acts. Thus, diagnostic criteria have always been discussed and criticized by experts and are then further developed. Similarly, stereotypes must always and constantly be overcome, like for example the idea that only men can have a pedophilic interest. Because of this assumption, pedophilia in females has been neglected in research for a long time giving the impression that it rarely exists in women. Indeed, recent research addressing this topic has been shown that women with sexual interests exist and that they have a problem in being seen as they perceive themselves as minority within a minority. Taking into account these constant changes over time, the question that might arise is where does it take us in the future?

### Significant association of cutavirus with parapsoriasis en plaques: high prevalence both in skin swab and biopsy samples [^85b3f40c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) are rare skin malignancies of mature T cells that are more often diagnosed in men than in women, and usually in middle-age. The most common subtype of CTCL is mycosis fungoides (MF), accounting for 60% of CTCL cases. Although MF can occur de novo, many patients with MF first present with longstanding reactive inflammatory conditions such as parapsoriasis en plaques (PP). Parapsoriasis en plaques is divided into 2 clinically different entities: small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and large plaque parapsoriasis (LPP). The exact cause of CTCL remains unknown, but it has been speculated that chronic antigen stimulation with long-lasting inflammatory responses possibly could induce T-cell proliferation, which would develop into malignancy. A viral etiology for CTCL has therefore long been sought but not found.

In 2012–2016, metagenomic analysis of pediatric stools revealed 3 novel parvoviruses of the Protoparvovirus genus named bufavirus (BuV), tusavirus (TuV), and cutavirus (CuV). CuV was also found in skin biopsies exclusively from 4 patients with CTCL/MF. Soon thereafter, our group and others detected CuV DNA in CTCL lesions, whereas the skin biopsies of other skin lymphomas and of healthy subjects were CuV-DNA negative, indicating a significant association of CuV with CTCL. CuV immunoglobulin G (IgG) was further detected in serum sampled up to 20 years prior to the biopsy, revealing that CuV infection is persistent. If CuV could induce a persistent antigenic T-cell stimulation, it would be present in the pre-CTCL PP stage. Hence, the aim of our current study was to elucidate the prevalence of CuV DNA in the skin of patients with nonmalignant PP, as compared with healthy controls.

Thus, patients may be treated until several lines of therapy have failed before MF diagnosis or referral to a specialized center is considered. Moreover, some may not receive specialist care, such as those with limited or no medical insurance. In some countries, treatment cost is sometimes reimbursed only with a definitive MF diagnosis. While this may be difficult for the patient, it enables optimal treatment and avoids the use of inappropriate or sometimes harmful therapies. In other countries, suspicion of MF is enough to access guideline-recommended therapy.

Historically, 'parapsoriasis' has been used to describe conditions that clinically resemble psoriasis but lack some histopathologic MF features and are resistant to therapy. Large-plaque parapsoriasis is now generally considered to be the earliest MF stage; up to 35% of patients advance to unequivocal, well-defined MF. Conversely, the small-plaque subtype (SPP) is considered by many authors as a nosologically separate entity that rarely progresses to MF. SPP shows a distinct clinical presentation characterized by yellow/brown digitate patches located on the flank and proximal extremities. In some regions, the term parapsoriasis continues to be used when a definitive MF diagnosis is difficult, offering the advantage of ongoing monitoring of patients who might develop MF and otherwise be lost to follow-up.

Steps to Arrive at a Correct Diagnosis

Physical and Histopathological Examination

Critical diagnostic steps include thorough physical examination, identification of suspected lesions, taking multiple biopsies from representative lesions, and appropriate evaluation of pathologic specimens. Crucially, there must be a correlation between clinical and histopathologic findings, sometimes achieved using validated scoring systems.

The International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma (ISCL) score for early MF diagnosis is based on clinical, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical findings, as well as T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement. These features can be useful for physicians who see few patients and emphasize the clinical/pathologic correlation in MF. The Guitart et al. criteria allows scoring of pathology based on assessments such as infiltrate density, nature, and extent of epidermotropism, and lymphocytic atypia grade. However, both algorithms are useful for conventional forms of MF, but not variants.

This paper critiques changes in the diagnositic criteria for the paraphilias as set out in the DSM-5. In addition to general areas of concern, five specific problem areas are identified. This includes: definitions by exclusion; culturally based criteria; ignoring etiology; minimizing consent issues; and lack of field trials. A suggestion to improve the diagnostic criteria is offered.

### Significant association of cutavirus with parapsoriasis en plaques: high prevalence both in skin swab and biopsy samples [^22ea1509]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

All 24 paired skin biopsies available from the 12 patients with PP who underwent biopsy were negative for DNA of BuV, TuV, BKV, and all 9 herpesviruses (Supplementary Materials and Methods), thus corroborating the specificity of CuV PCR and lack of contamination. Parvovirus B19 (B19V) and MCPyV are known to persist in skin of both diseased and healthy individuals, even though MCPyV is associated with Merkel-cell cancer. However, parapsoriasis skin has not previously been studied for other parvoviruses or polyomaviruses. In our study, the healthy biopsy sample of patient P3 harbored MCPyV DNA, and both biopsies of patient P2 harbored B19V DNA.

In conclusion, we report here the first observation of CuV DNA in the skin of patients with plaque-type parapsoriasis, a precursor of CTCL/MF. In contrast to the infrequent detection of other parvoviruses, herpesviruses, or polyomaviruses, CuV DNA was observed in high prevalence both in skin biopsies (66%) and in skin swabs (46%) of patients with PP, whereas the skin swabs of only a single healthy individual (1.96%) harbored CuV. This difference was statistically significant, indicating that human CuV was associated with plaque-type parapsoriasis. CuV-DNA positivity was further localized to both the epidermis and dermis. Prospective studies with more patients together with functional experiments are needed to assess whether this relationship between CuV, PP, and CTCL/MF is causal or consequential; perhaps instead of being caused by CuV, PP skin could merely provide a good habitat for the virus. Intriguingly, in both cases, this persistence could eventually lead to malignancy. The presence of CuV in parapsoriasis skin may serve as a biomarker for the development of CTCL/MF.

### Cutavirus infection in large-plaque parapsoriasis, a premalignant condition of mycosis fungoides [^0631caa4]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Cutavirus (CuV) is a recently discovered human parvovirus with a single-stranded linear DNA genome of approximately 4.5 kb. Using metagenomics, this virus was discovered initially in fecal specimens from Brazilian children with diarrhea. Since then, our group and others have detected CuV DNA in biopsy specimens from patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, especially mycosis fungoides (MF). Moreover, we have shown the potential impact of CuV on the unfavorable outcome of patients with MF. Although these findings suggest an association between CuV and MF, the pathogenetic relevance of CuV remains to be fully delineated.

Studies have also reported the detection of CuV DNA in 9 of 237 (3.8%) and 127 of 678 (18.7%) surface skin swabs collected from healthy individuals from Germany and Japan, respectively. These findings suggest that CuV is found in the human skin virome in healthy individuals, although the prevalence may vary according to ethnicity.

MF is more often diagnosed in men and elderly persons than in women and young individuals. Etiologically, MF is believed to result from chronic antigenic stimulation with long-standing inflammation responses, leading to uncontrolled clonal expansion of T-helper cells in the skin. Many patients with MF present a long history of previous reactive inflammatory conditions such as parapsoriasis en plaques (PP). PP is a rare chronic papulosquamous dermatosis with asymptomatic recalcitrant patches that may persist for many years. This disorder is divided into 2 subtypes: small-plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP). SPP is considered a benign disorder with no or minimal risk of malignant transformation, whereas LPP can progress to overt MF in up to 35% of cases. Because LPP and MF overlap considerably clinically and histopathologically, most dermatologists consider the 2 conditions to be different clinical stages of the same disease.

### Human herpesvirus 8 is not detectable in lesions of large plaque parapsoriasis, and in early-stage sporadic, familial, and juvenile cases of mycosis fungoides [^802d97ac]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Human herpesvirus (HHV) 8, an essential etiologic agent of Kaposi sarcoma, is also associated with several lymphoproliferative disorders. The involvement of HHV 8 in mycosis fungoides (MF) and large plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) is controversial, with contradictory reports from various countries worldwide.

Objective

We sought to investigate the presence of the HHV 8 genome in skin lesions of LPP and early-stage sporadic, familial, and juvenile MF in patients in Israel.

Methods

Archival paraffin-embedded and frozen samples from skin biopsies of untreated patients with LPP and early-stage MF performed in 1990 through 2006 were randomly collected from the department of dermatology of a tertiary medical center in central Israel. DNA was extracted, and a TaqMan-based real-time polymerase chain reaction assay specific for the K6 gene region was used to detect the HHV 8 genome.

Results

A total of 46 biopsies were sampled from 11 patients with LPP and 35 with early-stage MF (17 adults with sporadic MF, 10 children, and 8 patients with familial MF). In all, 44 samples were negative for HHV 8 DNA; two samples from adults with sporadic MF were positive.

Limitations

The presence of HHV 8 antibodies or virus sequences was not assessed in peripheral blood.

Conclusion

The results of this study, conducted in a region relatively endemic for HHV 8, support most earlier studies showing a lack of association of HHV 8 infection with LPP and sporadic adult-type MF. To our knowledge, the lack of association of HHV 8 infection with juvenile and familial MF has not been previously reported.

Abstract

Cutavirus (CuV) is associated with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), of which parapsoriasis is a precursor. Our study reveals a significantly higher CuV-DNA prevalence in skin swabs of parapsoriasis patients (6/13; 46.2%) versus those of healthy adults (1/51; 1.96%). Eight patients (8/12; 66.7%) had CuV DNA in biopsied skin, and 4 developed CTCL.

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^73e366fd]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The term "paraphilias" consists of two Greek words: 1. "para" which is translated as various meanings like besides, beyond, abnormal, defective, irregular, or altered; and 2. "philias" which means love, friendship, brotherly love or affection. Thus, commonly understood, paraphilia describes "love beyond the usual to abnormal love or sexuality". Since the late 19th century, the construct of paraphilias and paraphilia diagnoses have always been discussed by experts in the field. Simultaneously, the treatment of paraphilic disorders has evolved over time – from barbaric methods to ethically justifiable medicinal and psychotherapeutic methods. To understand paraphilias in today's time, a look back in history discovering the developments regarding paraphilias in the past is deemed necessary. Therefore, the following unstructured literature review includes selected studies on the history of paraphilias describing paraphilias in ancient times, outlining the development of paraphilia diagnoses including current critical aspects mentioned by experts, and presenting the evolvement of treatment approaches for individuals with paraphilic disorders and individuals who commit sexual offenses. The article ends with a conclusion.

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^3faa6c09]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

This unstructured review is based on a comprehensive literature search leading to a variety of selected studies that summarize the historical development of paraphilias. Firstly, paraphilias in ancient times are discussed. Secondly, the development of paraphilia diagnoses, including current critical aspects, is outlined. Finally, a short description of the development of treatment approaches for individuals with paraphilic disorders and those who commit sexual offenses, including medical and psychotherapeutic approaches as well as online intervention programs, is presented. The destigmatization of people with deviant sexual interest is deemed necessary. However, it is also recommended to always strive for a balance between protecting paraphilic individuals' rights and protecting vulnerable groups to whom paraphilic people can pose a danger.

### Treatment of small plaque parapsoriasis with narrow-band (311 nm) ultraviolet B: a retrospective study [^c6c42a2d]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Narrow band (311 nm) ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for psoriasis and other inflammatory skin diseases. We have therefore employed NB-UVB in the treatment of small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) since 1996. All patients (16/16) responded with complete remission of the disease after a mean number of 32.8 exposures and a mean total dose of 35.4 J/cm². Unwanted side-effects were rare (3.3%) and always mild. Relapse of the disease occurred after an average of 29 weeks in those patients who came for follow-up visits. Therefore, NB-UVB is an effective, comparably safe and convenient alternative to psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy or other treatment modalities in the suppression of SPP.

### What is "eczema"? [^c05f0385]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Papuloerythroderma

Papuloerythroderma, described by Ofuji et al.initiates with multiple solid papules, which are coalesced gradually to form erythroderma. It was originally reported to be associated with internal malignancies. Recent studies, however, have shown that it is a manifestation of cutaneous T‐cell lymphomaor a type of drug eruption.

In cases of drug eruption, it is revealed that papuloderma is evoked by the causative drug, but the eruption cannot be completely alleviated by its discontinuation. Moreover, in some patients, an eczematous eruption is antecedent to drug eruption, and drug intake exacerbates the eruption, evolving into papuloerythroderma. It was found that the number of circulating Th2 cells is markedly increased in patients with papuloerythroderma. There is a notable tendency for the lymphocyte transformation to test positive to the culprit drug but negative to the patch test, suggesting that reactive T cells are Th2 cells rather than Th1 cells. This suggests that drug‐induced papuloerythroderma is mediated by Th2 cells infiltrating in the precedent eczema. Accordingly, such a Th2 skewing condition is also seen in papuloerythroderma of cutaneous T‐cell lymphoma.

5.4 Eczematide (eczematid)

This term appears to be derived from French dermatology and not well characterized in other countries. However, it may be used in daily clinics even in Japan to denote a certain eczematous condition. Eczematides or eczematids are itching dermatoses showing indistinct redness and pityriasiform scalesand share features with pityriasis rosea Gibert, pityriasis lichenoides (subacute or chronica), patch parapsoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. Some infections may trigger this condition and autosensitization may even occur. Meanwhile, eczematid‐like purpura of Doucas‐Kapetanakis is proposed as a subtype of chronic pigmentary purpura.

### Cutavirus infection in large-plaque parapsoriasis, a premalignant condition of mycosis fungoides [^24cc8883]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Cutavirus (CuV) is associated with mycosis fungoides; however, the CuV status in parapsoriasis en plaques (PP), a premalignant inflammatory condition of mycosis fungoides, has not been fully delineated.

Methods

Fifty-five Japanese patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases, including 13 patients with PP, were studied.

Results

CuV DNA was detected significantly more frequently in biopsies of the lesional skin from patients with PP (38%; 4 of 13) than in those from patients with other inflammatory skin diseases (2%; 1 of 42; P = 0.009). All CuV-positive PP cases were of the large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) subtype. The viral loads ranged from 83 450 to 2 164 170 copies/10³ cells. We recovered near-full-length CuV sequences from the CuV-positive LPP biopsies, all of which were of the Japanese/Asian genotype. The CuV genome appeared to be present within lymphoid cells infiltrating the epidermis and dermis. CuV NS1 and VP1 gene transcripts were also detected in the affected tissues.

Conclusions

The detection of high levels of CuV DNA with the expression of viral mRNA suggests a potential role for CuV in the pathogenesis of LPP, making it necessary to study further the impact of CuV, especially regarding the viral genotype, on the outcomes of patients with CuV-positive LPP.

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^dab480b0]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Constantly changing social and cultural conditions determine how sexual behavior is assessed in the field of sexual medicine. Today, society and experts deem it necessary to protect the rights of people with atypical non-harmful sexual interests and therefore contribute to the minimization of stigmatization and discrimination against them. Thus, to clearly distinguish between paraphilic behaviors that are harmful to individuals and consensual deviant sexual behavior is becoming more and more important. However, even though there have already been so many changes in terms of paraphilic diagnoses, there are still challenges addressed by several authors (e.g.). Most important, the safety of especially vulnerable population groups, such as children, needs to be guaranteed in todays and future societies. Therefore, a balance between protecting paraphilic individuals' rights and protecting vulnerable groups should always be pursued.

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^4e47d94b]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Finally, few experts fundamentally question why medicine even pathologizes sexual interests by including paraphilia diagnoses in diagnostic manuals like the DSM and the ICD (e.g. 4, 12, 34]. They argue that no data basis justifies the previous and current dealing with individuals who have paraphilic interests. The diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder promotes stigmatization and causes individuals to experience bias in healthcare, psychotherapy, the workplace, as well as political and social spheres. In addition, they state that current diagnostic criteria pose the danger of abuse in forensic contexts. People who have committed a sexual offense and are placed in psychiatric institutions because of a paraphilia diagnosis can continue to be unjustly imprisoned based on the diagnosis - even if they have long since served their prison sentence. In contrast, there is the question on what basis practitioners could help people who, for example, suffer from their sexual interest in children and/or are at risk of committing sexual assaults on children if there was no diagnosis for their condition.

Due to the ongoing disagreement between experts, the debate on paraphilias will probably continue in the future. However, the fact that paraphilic interests play a role in clinical practice ever raises the question of how to treat individuals who suffer from their sexual interests or who commit sexual offenses related to paraphilias. In the following, a short description of the development of treatment approaches for paraphilic disorders is provided.

### Cutavirus infection in large-plaque parapsoriasis, a premalignant condition of mycosis fungoides [^7ae09176]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Cutavirus (CuV) is associated with mycosis fungoides; however, the CuV status in parapsoriasis en plaques (PP), a premalignant inflammatory condition of mycosis fungoides, has not been fully delineated.

Methods

Fifty-five Japanese patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases, including 13 patients with PP, were studied.

Results

CuV DNA was detected significantly more frequently in biopsies of the lesional skin from patients with PP (38%; 4 of 13) than in those from patients with other inflammatory skin diseases (2%; 1 of 42; P = 0.009). All CuV-positive PP cases were of the large-plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) subtype. The viral loads ranged from 83 450 to 2 164 170 copies/10³ cells. We recovered near–full-length CuV sequences from the CuV-positive LPP biopsies, all of which were of the Japanese/Asian genotype. The CuV genome appeared to be present within lymphoid cells infiltrating the epidermis and dermis. CuV NS1 and VP1 gene transcripts were also detected in the affected tissues.

Conclusions

The detection of high levels of CuV DNA with the expression of viral mRNA suggests a potential role for CuV in the pathogenesis of LPP, making it necessary to study further the impact of CuV, especially regarding the viral genotype, on the outcomes of patients with CuV-positive LPP.

### Can clinicians use dimensional information to make a categorical diagnosis of paraphilic disorders? An ICD-11 field study [^dfb1cd68]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The diagnosis of paraphilic disorder is a complicated clinical judgment based on the integration of information from multiple dimensions to arrive at a categorical (present/absent) conclusion. The recent update of the guidelines for paraphilic disorders in ICD-11 presents an opportunity to investigate how mental health professionals use the diagnostic guidelines to arrive at a diagnosis which thereby can optimize the guidelines for clinical use.

Aim

This study examined clinicians' ability to use the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for paraphilic disorders which contain multiple dimensions that must be simultaneously assessed to arrive at a diagnosis.

Methods

The study investigated the ability of 1,263 international clinicians to identify the dimensions of paraphilic disorder in the context of written case vignettes that varied on a single dimension only.

Outcomes

Participants provided diagnoses for the case vignettes along with dimensional ratings of the degree of presence of five dimensions of paraphilic disorder (arousal, consent, action, distress, and risk).

Results

Across a series of analyses, clinicians demonstrated a clear ability to recognize and appropriately integrate the dimensions of paraphilic disorders; however, there was some evidence that clinicians may over-diagnose non-pathological cases.

Clinical Translation

Clinicians would likely benefit from targeted training on the ICD-11 definition of paraphilic disorder and should be cautious of over-diagnosing.

Strengths and Limitations

This study represents a large international sample of health professionals and is the first to examine clinicians' ability to apply the ICD-11 diagnostic guidelines for paraphilic disorders. Important limitations include not generalizing to all clinicians and acknowledging that results may be different in direct clinical interactions vs written case vignettes.

Conclusion

These results indicate that clinicians appear capable of interpreting and implementing the diagnostic guidelines for paraphilic disorders in ICD-11. Keeley JW, Briken P, Evans SC, et al.

### Searching for the impossible: parapsychology's elusive quest [^f9165c86]. The American Psychologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, American Psychologist published a review of the evidence for parapsychology that supported the general claims of psi (the umbrella term often used for anomalous or paranormal phenomena). We present an opposing perspective and a broad-based critique of the entire parapsychology enterprise. Our position is straightforward. Claims made by parapsychologists cannot be true. The effects reported can have no ontological status; the data have no existential value. We examine a variety of reasons for this conclusion based on well-understood scientific principles. In the classic English adynaton, "pigs cannot fly". Hence, data that suggest that they can are necessarily flawed and result from weak methodology or improper data analyses or are Type I errors. So it must be with psi effects. What we find particularly intriguing is that, despite the existential impossibility of psi phenomena and the nearly 150 years of efforts during which there has been, literally, no progress, there are still scientists who continue to embrace the pursuit.

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^aa3e5691]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

This article is no systematic review and does not claim completeness. The author chose a comprehensive literature search leading to a variety of selected studies that summarize the historical development of paraphilias in research and clinical practice. The selected studies mainly included reviews which led the author to corresponding articles on the topic of paraphilias that were also taken into account. In the selection of all studies on the history of paraphilias, the author aimed to present the development of the construct of paraphilias as well as the development of diagnoses and treatment approaches. Search terms included "paraphilias", "paraphilic disorder", "history", "diagnoses", "DSM", "ICD", "sexual offenses", and related terms. All literature searches were performed in suitable databases devoted to peer-reviewed literature in the behavioral sciences and mental health (PsychInfo, PubMed). Additional references were used where it seemed useful or necessary (e.g. Google Scholar).

### Paraphimosis: current treatment options [^dfff614c]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Paraphimosis is a urologic emergency, occurring in uncircumcised males, in which the foreskin becomes trapped behind the corona and forms a tight band of constricting tissue. Often iatrogenically induced, paraphimosis can be prevented by returning the prepuce to cover the glans following penile manipulation. Treatment often begins with reduction of edema, followed by a variety of options, including mechanical compression, pharmacologic therapy, puncture technique and dorsal slit. Prevention and early intervention are key elements in the management of paraphimosis.

### The experimental evidence for parapsychological phenomena: a review [^25f164e8]. The American Psychologist (2018). Low credibility.

This article presents a comprehensive integration of current experimental evidence and theories about so-called parapsychological (psi) phenomena. Throughout history, people have reported events that seem to violate the common sense view of space and time. Some psychologists have been at the forefront of investigating these phenomena with sophisticated research protocols and theory, while others have devoted much of their careers to criticizing the field. Both stances can be explained by psychologists' expertise on relevant processes such as perception, memory, belief, and conscious and nonconscious processes. This article clarifies the domain of psi, summarizes recent theories from physics and psychology that present psi phenomena as at least plausible, and then provides an overview of recent/updated meta-analyses. The evidence provides cumulative support for the reality of psi, which cannot be readily explained away by the quality of the studies, fraud, selective reporting, experimental or analytical incompetence, or other frequent criticisms. The evidence for psi is comparable to that for established phenomena in psychology and other disciplines, although there is no consensual understanding of them. The article concludes with recommendations for further progress in the field including the use of project and data repositories, conducting multidisciplinary studies with enough power, developing further nonconscious measures of psi and falsifiable theories, analyzing the characteristics of successful sessions and participants, improving the ecological validity of studies, testing how to increase effect sizes, recruiting more researchers at least open to the possibility of psi, and situating psi phenomena within larger domains such as the study of consciousness.

### Paraphilic disorders, psychopathy, and those who sexually offend: a narrative review of treatment modalities [^19082988]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite its critical importance, the treatment of paraphilic disorders remains an often-overlooked domain both in clinical research and practice. Challenges have arisen in the morphing understanding of paraphilias and paraphilic disorders, now considered separate concepts, and efforts at developing a more nuanced understanding of these conditions is ongoing, resulting in a muddled history that can frustrate efforts at study and treatment. These populations are by nature more heterogeneous than may first be obvious-particularly among those with comorbid psychopathic traits-and may require a more nuanced and individualized approach based on risk, needs, and responsivity to treatment. Until recently, there were few guidelines to assist clinicians when confronted with these complicated clinical pictures and a sea of discrete studies investigating various biological and non-biological interventions. Treatments range from several variations of psychotherapy and behavioral therapies to SSRIs, anti-androgenic medications, to orchiectomy, all displaying varying degrees of effectiveness and evidence across decades of research. Fortunately, recent efforts to collate these studies supported by a task force of the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) have helped form a better-focused and better-evidenced picture of effective treatments and the unique challenges faced by (and with) these populations.

### Paraphilia from a dissociative perspective [^af1fad93]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

A dissociative structural model of the psyche can account for a wide range of symptoms across many DSM-IV categories, including sexual compulsions and addictions. The model leads to a distinct overall plan of treatment and a set of operationalized interventions aimed at integration of the self, rather than suppression of impulses. The model could be tested first in epidemiological studies and later in treatment outcome studies.

### Diagnostic issues in the paraphilias [^be504b3c]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To examine the empirical bases underlying the diagnoses of the paraphilias. We address issues concerning the reliability of these diagnoses and their implications for etiology, treatment, and prognosis.

Recent Findings

Research on these issues with the paraphilias is quite limited except for those paraphilics whose interests lead them to sexually offend. Even among these clients, research has, for the most part, failed to distinguish those who meet criteria for a paraphilia from those who do not, thereby limiting the possibility of drawing firm conclusions regarding the value of a paraphilic diagnosis. Speculations regarding the etiology of the paraphilias are for the most part limited to those who sexually offend and these theories do not distinguish those who do, or do not, meet paraphilic criteria. Treatment of sex offenders, when effective, appears to have the same impact regardless of whether or not clients meet criteria for a paraphilia. In terms of prognosis, it was only among untreated child molesters that a paraphilic diagnosis (in this case "pedophilia") predicted long-term outcome. In the face of these problems, we suggest a dimensional approach to diagnoses may represent an improvement over the current categorical model.

### Demonstration of characteristic skin surface contours of extramammary Paget's disease and parapsoriasis en plaque by image analysis of negative impression replicas [^381fdde1]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2002). Low credibility.

The surface contours of lesional skin of certain skin diseases, such as parapsoriasis en plaque (PEP) and extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD), in which there is a massive infiltration by non-epidermal cells, looks somewhat different from that of the adjacent normal skin, needless to state that they are apparently different from that of ordinary chronic inflammatory dermatoses where we found acanthotic epidermis accompanied by hyperkeratosis. We attempted to objectively characterize these unique skin surface changes qualitatively and quantitatively using non-invasive methods. Negative impression replicas were taken from the lesional skin of patients with EMPD or PEP as well as from the adjacent uninvolved skin. The findings were confirmed histologically. The replicas were examined by using computerized image analysis. Several parameters were analyzed that correlate with the changes in the anisotropy of the skin furrows (VC1), average skin roughness (KSD), average length of skin furrows (LEN), and number of skin furrows (NUM). There were significant decreases in KSD and NUM in EMPD, indicating a smoother skin surface in the lesional skin than in the adjacent normal skin. In contrast, the PEP lesion had an increase in VC1 and LEN and a decrease in NUM, which suggests larger skin ridges in the lesional skin than in the uninvolved skin. Thus the unique skin surface of the cutaneous disorders accompanied by epidermal invasion by non-epidermal cells, such as EMPD and PEP, was characterized both qualitatively and quantitatively using computerized image analysis of negative impression replicas.

### Interleukin-15 expression in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome) [^1aeb976c]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cytokines are of potential importance in the pathogenesis of cutaneous T-cell mediated disorders, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).

Objectives

To compare interleukin (IL)-15 expression in certain inflammatory cutaneous diseases, with that in CTCL (mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome).

Methods

IL-15 mRNA and protein expression were examined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively, on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsies of normal human skin, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, parapsoriasis and CTCL.

Results

Despite similar expression of IL-15 mRNA, we found differences in IL-15 protein expression between normal human skin, atopic dermatitis and psoriasis on the one hand, and parapsoriasis and CTCL on the other. IL-15 protein expression was not detected in normal human skin, atopic dermatitis or psoriasis, but was detected, mainly at low levels but in a few patients at higher levels, in epidermal keratinocytes in parapsoriasis, mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome.

Conclusions

Induction of keratinocyte IL-15 expression appears to be a feature of CTCL. The factors stimulating such an expression remain unknown.

### Assessment of the paraphilias [^dafbf6af]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Paraphilias are recurrent, persistent, and intense sexual interests in atypical objects or activities. The most commonly encountered paraphilias in sexological or forensic settings are pedophilia, sexual sadism, exhibitionism, and voyeurism. Paraphilias are often comorbid with other sexual, mood, and personality disorders. Assessment and diagnosis require an integration of multiple sources of clinical information, given the limits and biases of self-report (through clinical interview or questionnaires). Clinicians ideally have access to more objective assessment methods, such as phallometric testing of sexual arousal. The accurate assessment and diagnosis of paraphilias is essential to effective treatment and management.

### Paraphilias and paraphilic disorders in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review of the literature [^f648f7f3]. Movement Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Paraphilias are intense urges or behaviors involving non-normative sexual interests. The newly approved diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) have established that, although paraphilias should not be regarded as inherently pathological, they ought to be qualified as paraphilic disorders if resulting in distress, impairment, or harm to the affected individual or others. Recent evidence documents that both phenomena can emerge as relatively uncommon iatrogenic consequences in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. To outline the clinical characteristics of paraphilias and paraphilic disorders in PD patients, we summarized the available evidence on these phenomena. The review encompasses all studies on paraphilias in PD patients identified by a search on the Pubmed and Scopus online databases through May 2014. Twenty-two case reports on a total of 31 PD patients with paraphilias or paraphilic disorders were identified. These phenomena were typically associated with dopaminomimetic treatment (with a mean levodopa-equivalent daily dose of 1,303 ± 823 mg/d) in male patients with motor complications, young age at PD onset, and long disease duration. Paraphilias were highly concomitant with impulse-control disorders or dopamine dysregulation syndrome. Although evidence on paraphilias and paraphilic disorders in PD patients remains anecdotal, available data point to these phenomena as likely sequelae of high-dose dopaminomimetic treatment. Accordingly, the intensity of paraphilic urges is typically attenuated by the reduction of dopaminomimetic doses, sometimes in association with atypical antipsychotics. Failure to recognize paraphilic disorders may significantly impair the relational functioning of the affected PD patients. Practitioners should routinely inquire about paraphilias during their clinical assessment of PD patients.

### The pathology of paraphrenia [^56028c14]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

The term paraphrenia refers to a condition characterized by a strong delusional component with preservation of thought and personality. Most affected patients are women. Although a late age at onset (> 60 years) has been proposed in the literature, evidence for this assertion remains debatable. Deterioration of cognitive functions occurs very slowly but may lead to mild dementia over a period of years. Pathological studies indicate the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), primarily within the entorhinal cortex. Compared with the severity of neuritic changes, amyloid deposition remains scant. Pyramidal cells affected by NFTs appear to be preserved. Both the clinical history and neuropathology of paraphrenia are similar to those aspects described for NFT-predominant senile dementia. Risk factors, including organic lesions, may precipitate an earlier onset of symptomatology in patients exhibiting this pathology. Many of the symptoms in paraphrenia can be explained by involvement of the entorhinal cortex.

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^eda9bd71]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Physicians of the 19th century began to have a very powerful position in society, comparable to clergy. For example, they were often called by police for guidance on how to deal with people who committed sexual offense. In addition, psychiatry became a medical discipline and illness was no longer limited to the body but also to the mind. In the further course, a definition of insanity was developed that included disorders of the will and the emotions. Finally, this led to a psychiatric account for sexually deviant interests. In that time, paraphilias were called "perversions"; a term dated back to the Middle Ages and the Renaissance when "any act that violated the laws of God was considered a perversion". With the publication of Krafft-Ebing's "Psychopathia Sexualis", paraphilias were proposed to be considered as medical conditions. Since then, researchers and clinicians have debated paraphilias for a long time (and will probably continue to do so in the future). Numerous changes have taken place regarding the definitions and diagnoses of paraphilias. In the following, a brief description of how paraphilia diagnoses arise is presented. In addition, several points of criticism mentioned by researchers and clinicians are delineated.

### Cutavirus infection in large-plaque parapsoriasis, a premalignant condition of mycosis fungoides [^ef67e451]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

CuV DNA Detection and Quantification

We evaluated 55 biopsies obtained from patients with chronic inflammatory skin diseases for the presence and viral loads of CuV. The CuV DNA was found in 4 of 13 biopsies from PP (31%), a detection rate significantly higher than that from other types of inflammatory skin diseases (1 of 42; 2%; P = 0.009; Table 1). Notably, all CuV-positive PP patients (patient numbers PP3, PP8, PP9, and PP12) were of the LPP subtype. The viral loads ranged from 83 450 to 2 164 170 copies/10³ cells and 1409 to 71 541 copies/μg (Table 2). We also evaluated 40 swabs obtained from the lesional skin of patients with inflammatory skin diseases (Table 1). The CuV DNA was detected in 1 of 7 swabs from PP (14%) and 1 of 33 swabs from other types of inflammatory skin diseases (3%), which was not statistically significantly different (P = 0.323). This lack of statistical significance could be attributed to the fact that, except for 1 patient (PP8, with LPP), all patients with PP enrolled in this swab study were negative for CuV DNA in their biopsy specimens. Therefore, we assumed that the CuV DNA detection rate in the PP swabs was apparently low. Of note, patient PP8 had CuV DNA in his biopsy and swab from the lesional skin, which was analyzed blinded (Table 3). The CuV DNA was also detected in his 2 swabs collected from the nonlesional skin at different sites. The viral loads in the swabs from the nonlesional skin (15 966 copies/μg from forehead skin and 1042 copies/μg from trunk skin) were much lower than in the swab from the lesional skin (6 014 259 copies/μg).

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^0a7a2e74]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Over time and due to societal development and the efforts of several organizations built by gay and lesbian communities, paraphilias became the subject of critical debates. The accusation addressed the fact that some paraphilic behaviors can take place without any clinical distress or threat to others. For example, individuals can engage in consensual sado-masochistic activities. By pathologizing such behavior, some people even were put on trial and found guilty of assault in the past. Therefore, researchers and clinicians began to agree that some paraphilia diagnoses in the DSM and ICD are outdated and highly stigmatizing, such as fetishism and sadomasochism (e.g.). Thus, the latest diagnostic manuals (ICD-11:; DSM-5:) distinguish between paraphilias as paraphilic disorders taking into account that paraphilic interests do not necessarily indicate clinical distress and/or a threat to others. Therefore, the diagnoses of fetishism, fetishistic transvestism, and sadomasochism have been removed from the ICD-11. Instead, the new paraphilic disorder "coercive sexual sadism disorder" was added to differentiate between the disorder and consensual sadomasochistic behaviors that do not include harm or risk. A paraphilic disorder can only be diagnosed if the individual has acted on these thoughts, fantasies or urges or is markedly distressed by them. Similarly, in the DSM-5, the term "paraphilia" is defined as any intense and persistent atypical sexual interest. "Paraphilic disorder" is in addition related to personal distress, personal harm, social impairment, and/or risk of harm to others. Moreover, the personal distress about the paraphilic interest should not be merely distress resulting from society's disapproval. Hence, the DSM-5 takes into account that people can engage in atypical sexual behaviors without being defined as having a mental disorder. The paraphilic disorders included in the DSM-5 and the ICD-11, their description, and diagnostic criteria are presented in Table 1. For prevalence rates of the different paraphilic disorders, we refer the reader for example to Beech et al. Although diagnostic criteria for paraphilias have undergone continuous changes in the past taking account proposals by numerous experts in the field, some clinicians and researchers still criticize current developments. Some of them are described in the following.

### Dupilumab-associated cutaneous adverse events among adult patients with atopic dermatitis: a retrospective study [^be69bbed]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibiting interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-13, is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in children aged ≥ 6years, adolescents, and adults. Both clinical trials and real-life data demonstrate its efficacy and safety. However, some cutaneous adverse events (cAEs) have been observed during real-world experiences. The authors' aim was to analyze the spectrum of cAEs in patients receiving dupilumab for the treatment of AD in a real-world setting. A retrospective review of electronic medical records was conducted for 916 patients (475 males and 541 females; mean age, 50.23 ± 19.66years [range, 18-91years]) who had received dupilumab for a minimum of 1 month for the treatment of AD from December 2018 to November 2022 at the Department of Dermatology of University Federico II of Naples (Italy). The mean duration of dupilumab treatment was 27.31 ± 21.26months. A total of 148 of 916 (16.15%) (90 males; mean age, 50.91 ± 15.34years) patients reported other cAEs apart of AD flare; namely, facial redness (82 of 916; 8.95%), psoriasis (39 of 916; 4.25%), alopecia areata (11 of 916; 1.2%), skin peeling (11 of 916; 1.2%), parapsoriasis (three of 916; 0.32%), and vitiligo (two of 916; 0.21%). Thirty-one of 916 (3.38%) patients discontinued dupilumab because of cAEs (18 of 916; 1.96%) for facial redness, 10 of 916 (1.09%) for psoriasis, and three of 916 (0.32%) for parapsoriasis. In our population, most of the cAEs were mild and did not require discontinuation of dupilumab. These findings would enable dermatologists understand the cutaneous side effects of dupilumab better, resulting in improved treatment plan decisions in clinical practice.

Results and discussion

Paraphilias in ancient times

Although it is considered difficult to ascertain whether paraphilias existed before the Renaissance, paraphilic behavior might be as old as civilized humanity. For example, paraphilic behavior has even been described in the Bible. Exhibitionistic behavior has existed since the description of Adam and Eve. Since civility, undressing in public has been viewed as pathological and often associated with madness. Moreover, transvestism was prohibited in the Bible: "The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment". Sadistic and masochistic behaviors have been described in the Kamasutra (e.g. consensual erotic slapping) which was probably written between 200 and 300 A.D. In ancient Greece, it was common for boys to be sexually exploited by adult men. These abusive acts were disguised as mentoring relationships between teachers and students. Later, during the 4th century B.C. Plato advocated that sexual acts with children be punished.

### Pharmacologic treatment of paraphilias [^83d05099]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

The treatment of paraphilias remains a challenge in the mental health field. Combined pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatment is associated with better efficacy. The gold standard treatment of severe paraphilias in adult males is antiandrogen treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used in mild types of paraphilia and in cases of sexual compulsions and juvenile paraphilias. Antiandrogen treatments seem to be effective in severe paraphilic subjects committing sexual offenses. In particular, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs have shown high efficacy working in a similar way to physical castration but being reversible at any time. Treatment recommendations, side effects, and contraindications are discussed.

### Zosteriform mycosis fungoides: a case report and literature review [^0f1213ca]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Primary cutaneous lymphomas are the third most common lymphomas, with mycosis fungoides (MF) being the predominant subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Zosteriform distribution of MF is a rare presentation, complicating diagnosis and management because of its resemblance to other skin disorders. This subtype usually presents with typical lesions of classic MF, including patches and patches that progress to plaques and sometimes tumors, but in a distribution limited to a dermatomal distribution. This case involves a 29-year-old woman with a recurrent, unilateral itchy, and painful rash on her lower back, misdiagnosed for a decade as fungal infection and eczema. The rash evolved into a resistant scaly plaque, unresponsive to steroids and phototherapy. Histopathologic examination of skin biopsies suggested large plaque parapsoriasis. Based on clinical, histologic, and therapeutic response features, a final diagnosis of early-stage MF was established. The patient showed partial improvement after treatment with methotrexate and corticosteroids. Zosteriform MF is a rare and challenging variant, showing relatively good prognosis in most cases. Literature review highlights its occurrence across a wide age range, with prior herpes zoster viral infection proposed as a potential trigger influencing disease onset and distribution. Treatment outcomes vary, with some patients benefiting from immunosuppressive therapies, while others experience recurrence or poor prognosis. Zosteriform MF is a rare, diagnostically challenging variant of MF. This case underscores the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation and the potential for variable treatment responses. Further research is needed to understand its pathogenesis and optimize therapeutic strategies.

### Early mycosis fungoides: molecular analysis for its diagnosis and the absence of p53 gene mutations in cases with progression [^14c6a06a]. Journal of Dermatological Science (2001). Low credibility.

The histological diagnosis of initial mycosis fungoides (MF) and the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for its progression and transformation to the more highly malignant variants of MF remain largely unknown. Because of the rare occurrence of these tumours, the need for snap frozen skin biopsy specimens and the difficulty to obtain suitable material for karyotypic and genotypic analysis, specific cytogenetic and molecular lesions have not yet been identified. In particular the role of known oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, including the p53 gene, in the pathogenesis and clinical progression of MF has not been extensively investigated. The present study was carried out using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique combined with temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) to detect mutations of the p53 gene in 58 patients with MF. TGGE analysis was also used in combination with clonality analysis by means of T-cell receptor gamma (TCRG) gene rearrangement studies to distinguish parapsoriasis en plaque and initial MF from patch/plaque stage MF. More than 83% of the diagnoses of initial MF could be confirmed using PCR-TGGE analysis. However, although the sensitive TGGE analysis was used for all exons, p53 gene polymorphisms were found in 4 and p53 gene mutation in only 1 of 58 biopsy specimens. It appears unlikely that p53 gene mutations play a role in either the pathogenesis of parapsoriasis and initial MF or their progression to advanced stages of MF. However, TCRG gene rearrangement studies by means of TCR-TGGE analysis may be useful for distinguishing histologically discordant cases of initial MF.

### Imaging of surgical paraphernalia: what belongs in the patient and what does not [^34a44807]. Radiographics (2000). Low credibility.

Many radiologists are not familiar with the names of various instruments, surgical sponges, and needles that may be seen on intraoperative and postoperative radiographs. These devices may be intentionally placed for localization or therapeutic intervention, discovered on radiographs obtained to evaluate incorrect sponge or needle counts, or incidentally encountered on postoperative radiographs. These paraphernalia are usually described in vague nonspecific terms in radiology reports. In this article, photographs and radiographs of several instruments commonly used for intraoperative localization or therapy are presented, as well as examples of sponges, needles, and other devices that should not be found on postoperative radiographs. Familiarity with their appearances will allow a more precise and knowledgeable description in radiology reports.

### Dramatic response to brentuximab vedotin in refractory nontransformed CD30mycosis fungoides allowing allogeneic stem cell transplant and long-term complete remission [^dd213c43]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The erythrodermic ulcerated form of mycosis fungoides (MF) is exceptional, and treatment of refractory cases is challenging. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is a monoclonal antibody combined with monomethyl auristatin E, recently approved for the treatment of refractory CD30 + cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. We report a case of refractory MF in a 56-year-old man with a long history of large-plaque parapsoriasis, as revealed by psoriasiform erythroderma, treated initially with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) polychemotherapy, inducing a 2-year complete response. After relapse, interferon and gemcitabine were unsuccessful. Finally, treatment with BV was decided upon, despite the absence of CD30 expression. After three infusions of BV 1.8 mg kg⁻¹, we achieved a complete and stable response, allowing an allogeneic stem cell transplant. The patient is still in complete remission, 19 months after the graft. This case illustrates the possibility of using BV in refractory CD30 - MF as a salvage therapy.

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^ab878afd]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Development of diagnoses for paraphilias

In 1948, the sixth version of the "International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" (ICD-6) contained a large section for mental disorders for the first time which also included paraphilias. Subsumed under "pathogenic personality", they were called "sexual deviation". They were described as non-reproductive sexual behaviors and included exhibitionism, fetishism, homosexuality, pathologic sexuality, and sadism. This classification was carried forward in the ICD-7 and in ICD-8. The term "disorders of sexual preferences" was introduced by the ICD-9 and subsequently classified as a subcategory of "disorders of adult personality and behavior" in the ICD-10. Similar developments emerged regarding the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" (DSM). The first and second versions of the DSM included paraphilias as "sexual deviation" under the category "sociopathic personality disorders". The manuals specified: "Individuals to be placed in this category are ill primarily in terms of society and of conformity with the prevailing cultural milieu, and not only in terms of personal discomfort and relations with other individuals". Diagnoses to be made were homosexuality, transvestism, pedophilia, fetishism, and sexual sadism (including rape, sexual assault, and sexual mutilation). However, no detailed descriptions of specific disorders were made. The DSM-III in 1980 included the term "paraphilias" for the first time which were subsumed under "psychosexual disorders". Back then, paraphilias were described as atypical sexual arousal to objects, situations, or nonconsenting individuals. In the context of DSM-IV, a duration criterion was added for paraphilias that required the symptoms to be present for more than 6 months, causing clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the DSM-IV was driven by the attempt to be more based on research evidence. Thus, work groups consisting of experts in the field were set up to support this process.

### Assessing paraphilic interests among women who sexually offend [^8958b219]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

We examine the state of scientific research on the assessment of paraphilic interests among women who have committed sexual offences.

Recent Findings

Research on the assessment of sexual interests in women using genital measures shows little evidence, overall, that women's genital responses are indicative of sexual interests. Some non-genital measures of sexual interest may be a valid indicator of age interests. Very few studies have focused on women who sexually offend. At this time, there is no validated measure that can be used to assess paraphilic interests among women who sexually offend. Much research is needed to determine if some measures (other than self-report) could validly assess a variety of sexual interests in women in general, and women who sexually offend in particular (e.g. interest in children, interest in sexual violence). This research is needed to determine if paraphilic interests are involved in women's motivation for sexual offending, and to determine if such interests are predictive of sexual recidivism.

### Paraphilias-where do we go from here? [^29d87b31]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

The following is a quote of a man who had an exclusive sexual interest in children as long as he could think. He started a therapy and noticed over time that his sexual interest was more flexible than he had thought in the first place.

"If I stick to my own experience, then one can certainly grow beyond a pedophilic orientation and become open to certain forms of adult sexuality. Pedophilia is by no means as firmly anchored as [some experts] claim. With this in mind, I would also like to encourage other affected people not to give up hope too quickly".

The quote is an excerpt from a post by the man on the German platform[translated: fate and challenge] which addresses individuals with sexual interest in children. He was one of the first administrators of the website which clearly speaks against sexual contact with children. I found this post at the very beginning of my research activity and in addition to many other factors, it influenced my view of pedophilia and, in the broadest sense, also my view of other paraphilias that I have today. Through a variety of research efforts, the field has become very differentiated in recent years regarding the question whether a sexual interest in children is changeable or not. There are indications that this question may be an individual matter as pedophilic men describe their sexual interest in children as more or less flexible. Additionally, there are on the one hand people who report changes of their sexual interest in children, and on the other hand, there are those who describe a rather fixed pedophilic interest over their lifespan. I chose to include the quote above in this editorial as it reflects how the concepts of paraphilias not only change among researchers and society, but also among those who are affected by them — all three interacting with each other in the best case.

Interestingly, some paraphilias got their names from individuals who suffered from them in the past. The French nobleman Marquis de Sade (1740–1814) was aroused by violent fantasies. He became known for his violent pornographic novels, most of which he wrote during decades of stay in prisons and mental asylums. The paraphilia in which a person experiences pleasure in violating the physical or psychological integrity of another living being was called "sadism" later. Another example is the Baron Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1835–1895) who has given his name to the paraphilia "masochism" during his lifetime. The author became famous for his imagination and art of esthetically formulating instinctual desires for pain and submission. In 1905, Freud claimed that sadism and masochism often occur together and introduced the term "sadomasochism". However, both paraphilias are still seen as separate phenomena. Another paraphilic behavior that was described in the 19th century is voyeurism. Even back then, people paid well to look through "peepholes" to watch others having sexual intercourse, especially in Parisian brothels. Furthermore, frotteuristic behavior (i.e. touching and rubbing against non-consenting individuals to gain sexual pleasure) was mentioned in 1887 and considered to be associated with a mental disorder.

### A brief unstructured literature review on the history of paraphilias [^e90ffcc6]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent times and along with the growing digitalization of everyday life, web-based interventions are increasingly being developed for individuals who have paraphilic interests, e.g. sexual interest in children. One website that addresses individuals with a sexual interest in children is the self-guided web-based intervention "Troubled Desire". Users can complete a self-assessment questionnaire via the website and get feedback on their sexual preferences and problematic sexual behavior. Afterward, they have access to the web-based intervention and are supported in seeking further help if needed (e.g. contacting a therapist). "Troubled Desire" is based on a cognitive-behavioral approach including psychoeducation and worksheets. Another offer for individuals with sexual interest in children is "Help Wanted" which uses interactive videos to help people cope with their sexual attraction to children. Other web-based interventions are guided by a professional. The cognitive-behavioral web-based intervention "Prevent It" addresses individuals who consume online abuse material and focuses on the reduction of consumption. The web-based intervention "@myTabu" is also cognitive-behavioral oriented and targets individuals who committed sex crimes against children and are under community supervision. The intervention focuses on reducing the risk of recidivism. In both interventions, users receive individual feedback from a professional for exercises they work on during their participation. Currently, both "Prevent It" and "@myTabu" are still under evaluation.

### Adult-onset spastic paraparesis: an approach to diagnostic work-up [^5ed4c714]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2014). Low credibility.

Adult-onset, chronic progressive spastic paraparesis may be due to a large number of causes and poses a diagnostic challenge. There are no recent evidence-based guidelines or comprehensive reviews to help guide diagnostic work-up. We survey the literature on chronic progressive spastic paraparesis, with special emphasis on myelopathies, and propose a practical, MRI-based approach to facilitate the diagnostic process. Building on neuro-anatomic and radiographic conventions, we classify spinal MRI findings into six patterns: extradural; intradural/extramedullary; Intramedullary; Intramedullary-Tract specific; Spinal Cord Atrophy; and Normal Appearing Spinal Cord. A comprehensive differential diagnosis of chronic progressive myelopathy for each of the six patterns is generated. We highlight some of the more common and/or treatable causes of progressive spastic paraparesis and provide clinical pointers that may assist clinicians in arriving at the diagnosis. We outline a practical, comprehensive MRI-based algorithm to diagnosing adult-onset chronic progressive myelopathy.

VAERS data is accessible by downloading raw data in comma-separated value files for import into a database, spreadsheet, or text editing program, or by using the CDC WONDER online search tool. Information provided to VAERS which identifies a person who received the vaccine or vaccines will not be made available to the public. De-identified VAERS data are available 4–6 weeks after the report is received. VAERS data change as new reports are received, so your results may change if you repeat the same search at a later date. To learn more about interpreting data see Guide to Interpreting VAERS Data. Anyone, including Healthcare providers, vaccine manufacturers, and the public can submit reports to the system. While very important in monitoring vaccine safety, VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness. Vaccine providers are encouraged to report any clinically significant health.

problem following vaccination to VAERS even if they are not sure if the vaccine was the cause. In some situations, reporting to VAERS is required of healthcare providers and vaccine manufacturers. VAERS reports may contain information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental, or unverifiable. Reports to VAERS can also be biased. As a result, there are limitations on. The strengths of VAERS are that it is national in scope and can often quickly detect an early hint or warning of a safety problem with a vaccine. VAERS is one component of CDC's and FDA's multifaceted approach to monitoring safety after vaccines are licensed or authorized for use. There are multiple, complementary systems that CDC and FDA use to capture and validate data from different sources. VAERS is designed to rapidly detect unusual or unexpected patterns of adverse events, also referred to as "safety signals.

" If a possible safety signal is found in VAERS, further analysis is performed with other safety systems, such as the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink and Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project, or in the FDA BEST system. Additionally, reports to VAERS that appear to be potentially false or fabricated with the intent to mislead CDC and FDA may be reviewed before they are added to the VAERS database. Knowingly filing a false VAERS report is a violation of Federal law punishable by fine and imprisonment.

### Sulfasalazine [^de5c388d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

The most common adverse reactions associated with sulfasalazine are anorexia, headache, nausea, vomiting, gastric distress, and apparently reversible oligospermia. These occur in about one-third of the patients. Less frequent adverse reactions are skin rash, pruritus, urticaria, fever, Heinz body anemia, hemolytic anemia, and cyanosis, which may occur at a frequency of one in every thirty patients or less. Experience suggests that with a daily dosage of 4 g or more, or total serum sulfapyridine levels above 50 µg/mL, the incidence of adverse reactions tends to increase.

Although the listing which follows includes a few adverse reactions which have not been reported with this specific drug, the pharmacological similarities among the sulfonamides require that each of these reactions be considered when sulfasalazine tablets are administered. Less common or rare adverse reactions include:

Blood dyscrasias: aplastic anemia, agranulocytosis, leukopenia, megaloblastic (macrocytic) anemia, purpura, thrombocytopenia, hypoprothrombinemia, methemoglobinemia, congenital neutropenia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.

Hypersensitivity reactions: erythema multiforme, epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) with corneal damage, exfoliative dermatitis, DRESS, anaphylaxis, serum sickness syndrome, interstitial lung disease, pneumonitis with or without eosinophilia, vasculitis, fibrosing alveolitis, pleurisy/pleuritis, pericarditis with or without tamponade, allergic myocarditis, polyarteritis nodosa, lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, hepatitis and hepatic necrosis with or without immune complexes, fulminant hepatitis, sometimes leading to liver transplantation, parapsoriasis varioliformis acuta (Mucha-Haberman syndrome), rhabdomyolysis, photosensitization, arthralgia, periorbital edema, conjunctival and scleral injection, and alopecia.

### The role of the entorhinal cortex in paraphrenia [^6140bf3b]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2010). Low credibility.

Evidence derived from postmortem brain studies has implicated the uncal cortex in paraphrenia. In the present review, we expand on the anatomic and physiologic nuances endogenous to this region that make entorhinal cortex pathology an important clinicopathological correlate to paraphrenia. First, we summarize the anatomic landmarks and histologic features that will allow the reader to define the entorhinal region in future research studies. As cortical regions usually project to neighboring cortices, inferences will be drawn as to the function of the entorhinal region based on the surrounding cortical regions. The results will help explain why patients with paraphrenia may exhibit amnestic deficits that stand in contrast to a well-preserved thought process and personality. We also review the results of surgical ablation studies in animals. These studies suggest that some risk factors currently associated with paraphrenia (eg, social isolation) may in reality be an early manifestation of entorhinal pathology. Finally, the author provides a parallelism between the hallucinations observed in some paraphrenic patients and the results of electrical stimulation of the uncal cortex. The results will help explain why hallucinations in paraphrenia are usually limited to the patient's surroundings.

### The paraphilias and medical licensure in the United States [^b4b8a0fd]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

As part of their mission to protect the public from exploitation, state medical boards query physicians about a wide range of topics prior to licensure, including in some cases whether the applicant has been diagnosed with or been treated for paraphilias or paraphilic disorders.

Aim

We investigated the prevalence of questions inquiring about the applicants' history of paraphilias and paraphilic disorders on applications for medical licensure.

Methods

The allopathic medical licensure application forms for each of the 50 United States and the District of Columbia were reviewed. Medical boards with questions pertaining to paraphilias or paraphilic disorders were asked how many affirmative responses had been obtained in the prior 5 years and how they would treat an affirmative response.

Outcomes

Eight medical boards inquired about paraphilias or paraphilic disorders, however there was no evidence of an affirmative response to these questions in the prior 5 years.

Results

Of the 51 applications reviewed, 8 (16%) inquired whether the applicant had, was diagnosed with, or had been treated for a paraphilia or paraphilic disorder. The wording of the questions was variable and often failed to distinguish between paraphilias and paraphilic disorders. All but one medical board responded to requests for further information. The medical board staff members stated that an affirmative response would result in case-by-case review, including request for further information and possibly an in-person appearance before the board. None of the medical boards were willing or able to provide a formal count of affirmative responses in the last 5 years.

Clinical Implications

Medical boards may be contributing to the stigma experienced by both physicians and patients with diverse sexual interests. The benefit of retaining these questions is not clear.

Strengths and Limitations

This study is the first to investigate the use of paraphilias and paraphilic disorders as screening questions for medical licensure. Data regarding the number of affirmative responses were limited by the medical boards' inability or unwillingness to respond to share the information.

Conclusions

Eliminating or modifying physician licensing application questions pertaining to paraphilias and paraphilic disorders may decrease the stigma encountered by persons with diverse sexual interests. Removal also may diminish the barriers to accessing health care services for both physicians and patients with diverse sexualities. If the questions are retained, they should conform to the current DSM-5 nosology, which distinguishes between the mere presence of a paraphilia and a diagnosis of a paraphilic disorder.

### Paraphilic fantasies and behavior in attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and their association with hypersexuality [^1353189f]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Additionally, since we had mentioned in our study call that we would assess different sexual behaviors, it is all the more possible that individuals with a primarily high interest in sexuality-related topics were more likely to participate, possibly leading to a general overestimation of the prevalence of paraphilic fantasies and behaviors. However, all studies assessing sexuality-related constructs have to deal with this problem. Further, we did not specifically assess whether or not ADHD individuals were currently treated with pharmacological agents although especially stimulants, which are frequently prescribed in ADHD, could have an influence on sexual fantasies and behaviors, something that should thus be considered in future research. Moreover, we did not evaluate whether or not paraphilic fantasies and behaviors were generally perceived as positive or negative by our participants and therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions on whether paraphilic disorders are a relevant issue for ADHD adults and should thus be considered during clinical visits. This would be an important topic for future research because sexual issues, despite their importance for mental health, are frequently neglected during clinical visits mainly due to the insufficient knowledge of health care providers.

Altogether we could show that adults with ADHD report about paraphilic fantasies and behaviors only a little bit more often than adults without ADHD. The high prevalence of paraphilic fantasies and behaviors found in the current study clearly underscores the current trend to depathologize paraphilias in the general as well as in clinical populations and to move away from the view that paraphilias should be considered as "unusual" sexual interests.

### Toward a universal decoder of linguistic meaning from brain activation [^0cc1b844]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Humans have the unique capacity to translate thoughts into words, and to infer others' thoughts from their utterances. This ability is based on mental representations of meaning that can be mapped to language, but to which we have no direct access. The approach to meaning representation that currently dominates the field of natural language processing relies on distributional semantic models, which rest on the simple yet powerful idea that words similar in meaning occur in similar linguistic contexts. A word is represented as a semantic vector in a high-dimensional space, where similarity between two word vectors reflects similarity of the contexts in which those words appear in the language. These representations of linguistic meaning capture human judgments in diverse tasks, from meaning similarity judgments to concept categorization. More recently, these models have been extended beyond single words to express meanings of phrases and sentences –, and the resulting representations predict human similarity judgments for phrase- and sentence-level paraphrases.

To test whether these distributed representations of meaning are neurally plausible, a number of studies have attempted to learn a mapping between particular semantic dimensions and patterns of brain activation (see ref.for a perspective on these techniques). If such a mapping can make predictions about neural responses to new stimuli, it would suggest that the underlying model has successfully captured some aspects of our representation of meaning. Early studies demonstrated the feasibility of decoding the identity of picture/video stimuli from the corresponding brain activation patterns, primarily in the ventral visual cortex –. More recently, studies have shown that similar decoding is possible for verbal stimuli, like words –, text fragments, or sentences. To represent meaning, these studies have used semantic features that were postulated by researchers, elicited from human participants, or inferred from text corpora based on patterns of lexical co-occurrence. The main limitation of these prior studies is the use of relatively small and/or constrained sets of stimuli, which thus leaves open the question of whether the models would generalize to meanings beyond those that they were built to accommodate. Further, the use of semantic features elicited from human participants (e.g. asking "is X capable of motion?") is limited to concrete nouns (since we do not have models of what features characterize abstract nouns or verbs), and does not easily scale to a typical vocabulary of tens of thousands of words, or more than a small set of semantic features.

Regarding medical management for parapneumonic effusion and empyema, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, AATS 2017 guidelines recommend to administer a parenteral second- or third-generation cephalosporin (such as ceftriaxone) with metronidazole or parenteral aminopenicillin with a β-lactamase inhibitor (such as ampicillin/sulbactam) in patients with community-acquired empyema.

### Psychogenic nonepileptic "seizures" or "attacks"? It's not just semantics: attacks [^50ff4615]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Since the phrase "psychogenic nonepileptic seizures" has been the term of choice, it has become clear that the word "seizure" here creates confusion. Beyond theoretical arguments, the confusion it creates is detrimental to patients' and families' understanding of the diagnosis, which in turn has a negative impact on treatment.

### Endemic sporotrichosis [^eb4bd923]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Although first reported more than a century ago, sporotrichosis, caused by Sporothrix schenckii, still remains a poorly studied disease. Results from recently published studies on sporotrichosis in endemic areas are summarised and assembled with previous findings, providing a comprehensive review that highlights the needs for further research.

### Hippocampal pathology in two mentally ill paraphiliacs [^5977ba32]. Psychiatry Research (2002). Low credibility.

Paraphilias or disorders of sexual behavior have markedly increased in prevalence during the last decade. Until now no published neuropathological studies on paraphilia have appeared in the medical literature. A computerized search was done on all available medical and autopsy records of a large urban hospital (St. Elizabeths Hospital, Washington, DC) for any mention of deviant sexual behavior. Cases were then reviewed for presence of a history consistent with DSM-IV diagnoses of paraphilia. Two such cases were identified. Neuropathological examination in both cases revealed simple cell atrophy of pyramidal cells confined to different hippocampal subfields. Reactive astrocytosis was present in the outer strata of the affected regions. The pathological changes in the hippocampus resemble those reported after persistent stress or long-term chronic glucocorticoid administration. The accompanying astrocytosis indicates a reactive, ongoing process. The findings suggest new therapeutic interventions in the treatment of paraphilia.

### In defense of the passive voice [^64e5870f]. The American Psychologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Writers of scientific articles are familiar with the advice to avoid using the passive voice. Prescriptivists argue that the passive leads to bloated, indirect, and even evasive writing, and they recommend that the active form be used instead. This article defends the passive voice against these charges and argues that this advice is misguided. The article begins with a summary of the passive construction and the diversity of its forms, many of which are not appreciated in discussions of the passive voice's purported flaws, and is then followed by a summary of why some prescriptivists criticize its use. Three motivations for the use of the passive voice based on findings from psycholinguistic research are then described: First, the passive form allows writers to maintain topic continuity and conform to the given-new principle of communication; 2nd, speakers use the passive voice to accommodate concepts that are accessible; and 3rd, passive sentences are not communicatively equivalent to actives, and therefore active sentence paraphrases will sometimes distort the writer's message. An additional problem with the advice to avoid passive sentences is that people have trouble correctly identifying them and tend to rely on superficial cues that often diagnose other irrelevant grammatical constructions. Just as rules against split infinitives, stranded prepositions, and the singular they have been abandoned, so too should the prohibition against the passive voice. Instead of shunning a perfectly grammatical and useful construction, writers should strive to generate prose that is clear and elegant, using all the linguistic tools at their disposal.

### Palliative care best practices guidelines [^b8bb1d90]. ACS (2017). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord injury (SCI) prognosis and ambulation outcomes indicate that the vast majority of motor recovery occurs over the first two years, and the cumulative 20-year survival rate is 70 percent; however, this figure is likely generous and subject to under-reporting and patients lost to follow-up. Little chance of functional recovery is found in the lower extremities of tetraplegics if the motor and sensory deficits remain complete for greater than one month post-injury. Prognosis for ambulation at one to two years (requires at least one functioning hip flexor and leg braces) is: complete paraplegic 5%, incomplete paraplegic 76%, complete tetraplegic 0%, and incomplete tetraplegic 46%.

### A case of recurrent and paraneoplastic pityriasis rubra pilaris [^59bfadd9]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

In summary, while Type I PRP is usually an idiopathic and self-limited process, our case provides support that Type I PRP may not only be recurrent but also paraneoplastic. It may be prudent to obtain age-appropriate cancer screening in patients with newly diagnosed Type I PRP. In the rare case of recurrent PRP, suspicion for an underlying malignancy should be even higher. In addition to age-appropriate cancer screening, these patients may require an additional malignancy work-up that includes urinalysis, fecal occult blood test, and chest radiograph. Depending on the initial work-up, there should be a low threshold for computed tomography scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

### The APA guidelines for psychological practice with sexual minority persons: an executive summary of the 2021 revision [^617e1ecc]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA Guidelines for Psychological Practice With Sexual Minority Persons — terminology definitions include: Mixed-orientation relationship refers to a relationship where partners in a romantic relationship identify with differing sexual orientations; Monosexism refers to the assumption that people are, or can be, only either heterosexual, lesbian, or gay, and attracted to only one sex/ gender, which minimizes bi+ sexualities and the idea that sexuality exists on a continuum; Pansexual refers to those whose sexual or romantic attraction is not defined by gender; and Plurisexual is a term used to refer to sexual minority orientations that are not explicitly based on attraction to one sex and leave open the potential for attraction to more than one sex/gender. Queer is a formerly pejorative term that has been reclaimed and operates as an umbrella term for any nonheterosexual identity, allowing more inclusivity, particularly for those whose sexuality is more fluid or shifts over time. Sex is typically assigned at birth (or before during ultrasound) based on the appearance of external genitalia; when the external genitalia are ambiguous other indicators (e.g., internal genitalia, chromosomal and hormonal sex) are considered to assign a sex with the aim of assigning a sex that is most likely to be congruent with the child's gender identity, and sex is typically categorized as male, female, or intersex (i.e., sexual anatomy that combines or is atypical of male and female characteristics). Sexuality refers to a broad dimension of human sexual behavior, including sexual values, needs, preferences, and preferred modes of sexual expression, intimacy, and affect. Sexual fluidity refers to changes in attraction, sexual identity, or orientation over time and is bi-directional, meaning a change toward or away from same-sex/gender attraction. Sexual identity refers to the action of claiming through recognition, acceptance, or self-labeling one's sexual orientation as it is relevant to the self. Sexual minority constitutes a group of individuals whose sexual and affectual orientation, romantic attraction, or sexual characteristics differ from that of heterosexuals, and sexual minority persons are inclusive of lesbian, gay, bi+, and asexual identified individuals. Transgender is an adjective that is an umbrella term used to describe the full range of people whose gender identity or gender role do not conform to what is typically associated with their sex assigned at birth, and although the term transgender is commonly accepted, not all transgender and gender nonconforming people self-identify as transgender.
