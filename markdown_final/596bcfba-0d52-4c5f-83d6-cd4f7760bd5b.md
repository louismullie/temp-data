## Question

What is the goal of a functional capacity study?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the goal of a functional capacity study is across occupational, clinical, rehabilitation, normative, and research contexts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how functional capacity is defined within the ICF and WHO healthy ageing frameworks. Then, I should clarify the primary domains and instruments used to assess capacity. Next, I will map the key goals in occupational health, clinical care, rehabilitation, and research. After that, I need to delineate conceptual boundaries between capacity, performance, and perceived function. Finally, I should synthesize the overarching purpose and practical considerations for interpretation and use in decision-making, including issues of effort and protocol differences.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: functional capacity reflects what an individual can do under standardized conditions, not necessarily what they actually do day-to-day; at first glance, I might equate capacity with real-world activity, but wait, that would conflate capacity with performance, which the ICF treats as distinct constructs influenced by environment and context, and the WHO framework also separates intrinsic capacity (composite of physical and mental capacities) from functional ability (what people can do in their environments) [^111vw7m5] [^1178dA2U] [^1136pBgE].

> I need to check the main domains and tools used to quantify capacity; for physical capacity, common measures include submaximal field walk tests such as the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and shuttle walk tests, with ATS guidance underscoring standardized administration and interpretation, whereas METs may be estimated with validated questionnaires like the Duke Activity Status Index to quantify exercise capacity, and measurement properties for walk tests indicate the 6MWT has the strongest evidence base when protocols are standardized, though I should double-check the repeatability and practice effects to avoid over-interpreting single measures [^114RsQk3] [^114PUPc8] [^111HhkQx].

> Now, considering occupational health, I will examine how functional capacity evaluations (FCEs) are used for risk prediction, job matching, and return-to-work decisions; hold on, I should verify the predictive validity — job-specific pre-employment assessments like the JobFit System PEFA have shown associations with longer-term musculoskeletal injury risk, especially back injuries from manual handling, and classification schemes (e.g., no restrictions to cannot meet requirements) support job matching, but I need to ensure we acknowledge that social context and examiner factors can influence FCE performance, so conclusions require caution [^115vQkMx] [^111QgxDs] [^116sBpsF].

> Turning to clinical care, I should confirm that lower functional capacity robustly predicts worse outcomes; indeed, across multiple exercise testing protocols, reduced functional capacity is consistently associated with higher mortality, although equivalent estimated METs are not interchangeable across protocols, and in stable cardiac populations, functional capacity estimated via DASI is prognostically powerful, even incremental to cardiac biomarkers, reinforcing the role of capacity assessment in risk stratification and longitudinal monitoring [^1118HDav] [^116xNUYA] [^116vrf13].

> But wait, let me verify the broader link between objective capacity measures and subsequent health outcomes beyond cardiology; systematic reviews support that objective measures like grip strength and gait speed predict future morbidity and mortality, so integrating capacity testing into routine assessment helps identify high-risk individuals earlier, although heterogeneity in measures and outcome definitions still warrants careful interpretation when comparing across studies [^111QgxDs] [^116sRBXm].

> Next, I will examine how functional capacity studies guide intervention evaluation and rehabilitation planning; prehabilitation in oncology can improve functional capacity as patients await major resections, and for serial monitoring, I should confirm measurement principles — interpretation should be grounded in test variability, standard error, and repeatability, with practice effects addressed by averaging or performing two tests when appropriate, particularly for the 6MWT where standardized encouragement and serial assessments improve confidence in true change [^116Hnrgf] [^111NCTxs] [^113xvBeR].

> I need to check the role of establishing norms and references; normative datasets for FCEs by occupational demand categories allow clinicians to benchmark individual results to population expectations, and age-specific 6MWT references, including pediatric cohorts, enable interpretation relative to peers and inform more precise return-to-work advice or rehabilitation targets, although external validity across settings and countries should be verified [^116Hnrgf] [^1125G41g] [^114RsQk3].

> Hold on, I should verify measurement validity and effort assessment because FCE conclusions hinge on test integrity; determining maximal versus submaximal effort is complex, with only a subset of commonly used tests reliably distinguishing effort levels and overall sensitivity and specificity being imperfect, so labeling patients as nonmaximal requires caution; similarly, in neuropsychiatric contexts, functional capacity instruments have acceptable psychometrics and correlate with cognitive performance, supporting their use as co-primary outcomes when cognitive enhancement is targeted [^111QgxDs] [^114Muw1G].

> Let me consider critical conceptual boundaries to avoid category errors: capacity (what one can do under standardized conditions) must be differentiated from perceived functioning (self-report) and actual physical activity (free-living behavior); in low back pain, perceived functioning and capacity can be impaired while daily activity levels show minimal change, underscoring why triangulating complementary domains yields a more complete functional profile and why bridging the capacity–ability gap often requires addressing contextual barriers and supports, including technology-enabled solutions [^1146p4Go] [^1136pBgE] [^115QxgUq].

> I will now examine test selection nuances, because not all capacity tests are equivalent across diseases; CPET remains the gold standard when diagnostic precision for exercise limitation is required, yet field tests are pragmatic; in NSCLC, the ISWT shows better criterion validity with CPET than the 6MWT, whereas in COPD the 6MWT–CPET relationship can be moderate, reminding me to avoid extrapolating clinimetric properties indiscriminately between conditions and to align the test with the clinical question [^114cKg7e] [^113QnQ3j] [^117JeCHN].

> Let me synthesize the overarching purpose: functional capacity studies aim to provide objective, quantifiable evidence of what an individual can do to inform evidence-based decisions about employment, treatment plans, rehabilitation goals, and policy, to predict health outcomes and identify at-risk individuals earlier, and to optimize functional ability despite intrinsic capacity losses by aligning care with ICF/WHO frameworks and patient goals, including explicit functional targets in mental health care planning where applicable [^111vw7m5] [^1178dA2U] [^114DNCbX].

> Next, I should review practical interpretation caveats: standardize protocols and encouragement, consider protocol-specific prognostic calibration of METs, use serial measurements to distinguish true change from variability, and account for biopsychosocial modifiers — social determinants and examiner behaviors can shift performance, and nonorganic signs may independently predict FCE outcomes; I should double-check that improvements in aerobic capacity do not automatically translate into reduced pain or improved work ability without multifaceted interventions, which may be necessary in occupational settings [^1118HDav] [^115tkB32] [^117WEEpR] [^116A8hVX].

> Finally, let me reconsider the ageing trajectory aspect because timing matters; intrinsic capacity can decline years before overt disability, and once cognitive impairment emerges, recovery to better intrinsic capacity states is less likely, so deploying capacity assessments to screen, stratify, and intervene earlier — particularly around locomotor and cognitive domains — helps slow functional decline and preserve independence where possible [^114kG96q] [^1178dA2U].

The primary purpose of a functional capacity study is to provide an objective assessment [^111QgxDs] of an individual's ability to perform work-related tasks safely and effectively, supporting return-to-work decisions [^111QgxDs] and identifying any necessary job modifications or restrictions. These evaluations are used to determine readiness for work [^115vQkMx], establish baseline function, guide rehabilitation [^113MUFZ3], and inform legal or insurance decisions [^111QgxDs], with results compared to normative data [^116Hnrgf] to ensure accurate, evidence-based recommendations.

## Key objectives of functional capacity studies

- **Objective measurement**: Quantify an individual's physical abilities, including strength, endurance, flexibility, and cardiovascular capacity, using standardized tests [^1178dA2U].

- **Return-to-work assessment**: Determine whether an individual is ready to return to work safely and effectively after injury or illness, and identify any necessary job modifications or restrictions [^11485LpL].

- **Baseline establishment**: Establish a baseline level of functional capacity to monitor progress over time and evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions [^113xvBeR].

- **Legal and insurance documentation**: Provide objective evidence for legal or insurance purposes, such as workers' compensation claims or disability evaluations [^111QgxDs].

These tests are typically administered by **trained healthcare professionals** — such as physical or occupational therapists — in **controlled environments** to ensure accuracy and safety [^114RsQk3].

---

## Clinical and practical applications

- **Rehabilitation planning**: Inform the development of individualized rehabilitation programs tailored to the patient's specific functional limitations and goals [^1177knk2].

- **Occupational health**: Guide employers in making informed decisions about job placement, accommodations, and return-to-work strategies [^115vQkMx].

- **Chronic disease management**: Monitor functional decline or improvement in patients with chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or respiratory disorders [^112BN1rf].

- **Legal and insurance contexts**: Provide objective evidence in legal disputes, workers' compensation claims, and disability evaluations [^116Hnrgf].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Subjectivity and variability**: Patient effort, motivation, and psychosocial factors can influence test results [^111QgxDs], potentially leading to variability in outcomes [^116sBpsF].

- **Safety concerns**: Physical exertion during testing may pose risks, particularly for individuals with underlying health conditions [^114RsQk3].

- **Standardization challenges**: Ensuring consistent administration and interpretation of tests across different settings and populations can be challenging [^111HhkQx].

- **Legal and ethical considerations**: Accurate documentation and ethical conduct are essential, particularly when results are used in legal or insurance contexts [^111QgxDs].

---

## Conclusion

Functional capacity studies are **essential tools** for objectively assessing an individual's physical abilities, **guiding rehabilitation**, and informing **return-to-work decisions**. They provide valuable data for clinicians, employers, and legal professionals but should be conducted with careful attention to **patient safety**, standardization, and ethical considerations [^112BN1rf].

### A new pre-employment functional capacity evaluation predicts longer-term risk of musculoskeletal injury in healthy workers: A prospective cohort study [^11485LpL]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

The JobFit System PEFA score range is from 1 to 4. It is the overall score of the worker's performance in relation to the physical demands of the job for which they are applying. Score 1 indicates that the worker has demonstrated the functional capacity to perform the proposed position as described, with no restrictions. Score 2 means the functional capacity to perform the proposed position is demonstrated with minimal restrictions. Score 3 shows functional capacity with moderate restrictions, while score 4 indicates the worker has not demonstrated the capacity to meet the inherent requirements of the proposed position.

Prior to statistical analysis, raw PEFA data collection sheets from workers who had been injured at work since the time of their PEFA were reviewed and scored by a blinded independent third party. Among the 121 records reviewed, there was disagreement between the original scoring and the reviewer's scoring for 15 participants. Agreement on the scoring was reached through discussion between the researcher and the auditor.

Sociodemographic characteristics, including age, job, and department, were collected. Employment records, including start and finish dates and the job in which the applicant was employed, were provided by the company's human resources department.

### Normative values for a functional capacity evaluation [^116Hnrgf]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2009). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to establish normative values for a functional capacity evaluation (FCE) of healthy working subjects. The research adopted a descriptive design and was conducted in a rehabilitation center. Participants included 701 healthy working subjects, consisting of 448 men and 253 women, aged between 20 and 60 years, from over 180 occupations.

Subjects underwent a 2-hour FCE consisting of 12 work-related tests. They were classified into categories based on physical demands, according to the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. Means, ranges, standard deviations, and percentiles were provided for the normative values of FCE, and a regression analysis for the outcomes of the 12 tests was performed.

Normative FCE values were established for four physical demand categories. These values allow for the comparison of patients' performances to these normative benchmarks. If a patient's performance exceeds the lowest scores in their corresponding demand category, their capacity is likely sufficient to meet the workload. Clinicians can, therefore, provide more precise return-to-work recommendations and set targeted goals for rehabilitation programs. Comparing these normative values is beneficial to the fields of rehabilitation, occupational, and insurance medicine. Further research is needed to test the validity of these normative values concerning workplace assessments and return-to-work recommendations.

### The sensitivity and specificity of functional capacity evaluations in determining maximal effort: a randomized trial [^111QgxDs]. Spine (2004). Low credibility.

Study design - **Randomized trial**: The objective of the study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of maximal effort testing in functional capacity evaluations.

Summary of background data: Functional capacity evaluations are widely used to determine when an injured worker is able to return to work. The accurate assessment of function is dependent on a patient's willingness to exert maximal effort during evaluation. Although many tests are used to suggest the presence of maximal or submaximal effort, it is unclear whether these tests can actually do what they are hoped to do.

Methods: Ninety study participants with low back pain were randomized into either a 100% effort group or a 60% effort group. After a thorough evaluation, the blinded tester was asked to give an overall opinion as to whether or not the participant was giving 100% effort or 60% effort.

Results: The tester's opinion on maximal effort tests within the functional capacity evaluation had an overall specificity of 84.1% and a sensitivity of 65.2%. Only 5 of 17 commonly used maximal effort tests were able to individually differentiate between maximal and submaximal effort. The final logistic regression model was able to find three covariates with reasonable explanation of the proportion of variance in the outcome variable of effort (R 3 0.444) with goodness of fit.

Conclusions: The determination of maximal effort in a functional capacity evaluation is complex. Because of the wide-ranging medicolegal and ethical considerations, caution is recommended in the labeling of patients as exerting either maximal or submaximal effort.

### Transitions and trajectories in intrinsic capacity states over time: A systematic review [^114kG96q]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Among older adults with severe deterioration in intrinsic capacity (IC), those with cognitive impairments often struggle to recover to a better state of IC over time. In contrast, for those whose functional decline is not accompanied by cognitive impairments, the likelihood of recovering to a better IC state is relatively higher. This suggests that once cognitive impairments emerge, they can become a largely irreversible barrier to functional recovery in older adults.

Existing research indicates that cognitive function in older adults begins to decline 15 to 25 years before death, while gait function and hand strength continue to deteriorate throughout the study period. When older adults experience cognitive decline, they are typically at an advanced age, with physiological reserves insufficient to reverse these changes. Under such circumstances, the daily functional status of older adults may deteriorate more rapidly due to the dual decline in cognitive and locomotion abilities. Cognitive decline can lead to a weakening of the ability to perform complex tasks, make decisions, and manage oneself, while a decline in locomotion ability directly affects their mobility and self-care capabilities.

This dual decline can lead to a rapid decrease in the quality of life and independence of older adults. In comparison, older adults who experience a decline in locomotion ability but not cognitive decline may still maintain good self-management and decision-making abilities in daily life. Their degree of deterioration may be relatively mild, as the preservation of cognitive function can help them adapt.

### Measures of attributes of locomotor capacity in older people: A systematic literature review following the COSMIN methodology [^115AbyRy]. Age and Ageing (2023). Low credibility.

Healthy ageing is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as "the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age". Functional ability comprises the health-related attributes that enable people to be and to do what they have reason to value. It is made up of the intrinsic capacity of the individual, relevant environmental characteristics, and the interactions between the individual and these characteristics. Intrinsic capacity is the composite of all the physical and mental capacities of an individual, including visual and hearing capacities, cognitive and psychological capacities, vitality, and locomotor capacity.

Locomotor capacity is an important domain of intrinsic capacity and a key determinant for functional ability and well-being in older age. The WHO expert working group on locomotor capacity, consisting of fifty clinicians and scientists in fields of musculoskeletal health and ageing from all regions of the world, proposed a working definition of locomotor capacity as "a state (static or dynamic over time) of the musculoskeletal system that encompasses endurance, balance, muscle strength, muscle function, muscle power, and joint function of the body". As a next step, this systematic review was conducted to identify valid, reliable, and responsive measures of locomotor capacity and its attributes.

The United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030), endorsed by the World Health Assembly and the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, recognizes the importance of strengthening data for measure.

### Which field walking test should be used to assess functional exercise capacity in lung cancer? An observational study [^117JeCHN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The six-minute walk test (6MWT), incremental-shuttle walk test (ISWT), and endurance-shuttle walk test (ESWT) are commonly used field walking tests that measure functional exercise capacity. These field walking tests serve as alternatives to laboratory-based cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). However, they are often criticized for not being valid or sensitive enough to detect changes in exercise capacity as they may not sufficiently stress the cardiovascular system in individuals without concomitant comorbid disease. Therefore, understanding the validity of these tests in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is vital. While a test may have excellent validity as a measurement tool in one patient group, these findings cannot always be extrapolated to other patient groups.

In NSCLC, specific features such as fatigue, cancer cachexia, and loss of peripheral muscle strength can uniquely influence performance. Therefore, consideration of the ability of the test to measure what it is intended to measure, namely how well the data relate to the gold standard test (CPET) (criterion validity), and how well the test obtains data, as hypothesized, when compared to a test measuring a similar construct (construct validity), is important. The 6MWT is the most commonly used field walking test in NSCLC; however, there is a lack of evidence regarding its criterion validity in NSCLC. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), there is a moderate relationship between the 6MWT and CPET (r = 0.59–0.93). The ISWT and ESWT are less commonly used in NSCLC but have emerged over the last decade as robust measures of exercise capacity in COPD.

### Prognostic value of functional capacity in different exercise protocols [^1118HDav]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

In a large cohort of patients, we have provided insights regarding the prognostic value of numerous exercise protocols. Importantly, regardless of the protocol, lower functional capacity is associated with higher mortality. However, the prognostic value of a specific functional capacity (METs) is not transferable across protocols. In particular, our results suggest that the available exercise protocols are variable with regard to the prognostic value in part because of their poor estimate of the maximum VO2 in individuals. Alternatively, metabolic exercise stress tests provide an accurate VO2 assessment and should be considered.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113AkPo9]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Three authors retrieved data from the included studies using a standardized extraction procedure recorded in a Microsoft Excel sheet. Each author independently evaluated the relevance of each study based on the title and abstract using predetermined inclusion criteria. The eligibility of the articles for final analysis was assessed by all authors through a critical review of the full texts. The extraction sheet recorded the basic characteristics of the included studies, including the first author's name, publication year, the country and continent where the studies were conducted, sample size, study design, study setting, and prevalence of functional disability in BADL and IADL. Any discrepancies that arose during this process were resolved through discussion among the authors.

Functional disability in BADL and IADL among older adults was calculated in this systematic review and meta-analysis using prevalence and their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), evaluating study quality and potential sources of bias. The quality of the studies was assessed based on the representativeness of the sample, methodological quality, ascertainment of exposure or risks, comparability of the study, assessment of outcomes, and statistical tests. Studies that scored 7 or higher out of 10 were considered to be of high quality. All authors independently evaluated and determined the quality of the studies for inclusion.

### A new pre-employment functional capacity evaluation predicts longer-term risk of musculoskeletal injury in healthy workers: A prospective cohort study [^115vQkMx]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

There is limited evidence regarding the validity of functional testing in healthy workers as a predictor of workplace injury. This study indicates that the job-specific JobFit System PEFA is a long-term predictor of workplace musculoskeletal injury risk. The association between the JobFit System PEFA and injury risk was strongest for the risk of back injuries associated with manual handling during the longer term.

### Physical functioning of low back pain patients: Perceived physical functioning and functional capacity, but not physical activity is affected [^1146p4Go]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Physical functioning is a multidimensional construct covering perceived functioning, functional capacity, and actual physical activity. Currently, the assessment of physical functioning in low back pain (LBP) patients has been limited to only one or two of these aspects. This study evaluates the physical functioning of LBP patients by assessing the three individual aspects using questionnaires and ambulant sensor-based measurements.

- **Methods**: Actual physical activity, functional capacity, and perceived functioning were measured in 26 patients undergoing patient-specific treatment before, directly, and 3–4 weeks after the first treatment using, respectively, sensor-based activity monitoring, sensor-based motion analysis tests, and the Oswestry questionnaire. Patients were compared to a healthy control group.

- **Results**: Perceived functioning and functional capacity, but not actual physical activity, is impaired in pre-treatment LBP patients. After treatment, patients improved in perceived physical functioning and functional capacity, approaching healthy levels; however, only slight (p > 0.05) improvements in actual physical activity were found. Moreover, only a few and weak correlations were found between the different aspects of physical functioning.

- **Conclusion**: Perceived functioning, actual physical activity, and functional capacity are three independent outcome dimensions, being complementary but not redundant. Especially, perceived functioning and physical capacity need attention when evaluating LBP patients during rehabilitation.

### The relationship between social determinants of health and functional capacity in adult primary care patients with multiple chronic conditions [^115tkB32]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

- **Purpose**: Social determinants of health (SDoH), including insecure access to food, housing, and financial resources, are critical threats to overall health. We sought to examine this relationship among adult primary care patients with multiple chronic conditions.

- **Methods**: We obtained cross-sectional data on 2,763 adults with chronic medical and behavioral conditions, or more than two chronic medical conditions, from a survey of participants in "Integrating Behavioral Health and Primary Care", a multicenter randomized trial.

- **Results**: The prevalence of one or more insecurities was reported in 29% of participants, including food (13%), housing (3%), or financial (25%) insecurities. Functional capacity ranged from 2.74 to 9.89 metabolic equivalents (METs) with a median of 6.05. The distribution of functional capacity was significantly lower for those with any one or more SDoH than for those without. Each insecurity independently affected functional capacity in multivariable analysis.

- **Conclusions**: Among primary care patients with chronic conditions, SDoH are associated with poorer functional capacity, independent of other social and demographic factors. Primary care offers a promising, if underused, opportunity to intervene in SDoH. There is a need for future studies to explore the role of screening and intervention by primary care providers to mitigate or prevent the effects of SDoH.

### Functional performance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease declines with time [^116oEYqb]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2011). Low credibility.

It is well known that people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease experience declines in functional performance, but little is known about the rate of decline. The purposes of this research were to describe the rate of decline in functional performance and to examine the contribution of disease severity, body composition, symptoms, and functional capacity. Functional performance was defined as the activities that people choose to engage in on a day-to-day basis.

- **Methods**: People (n = 108) with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were enrolled and followed yearly for 3 years with self-reported functional performance (Functional Performance Inventory), spirometry, lung volumes, diffusion capacity, body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), dyspnea and fatigue (Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire), and functional capacity (6-minute walk distance (6MWD), isokinetic strength of knee flexors and extensors, handgrip strength, and maximal inspiratory pressure). A total of 88 subjects completed a mean ± SD of 2.7 ± 0.9 years of follow-up.

- **Results**: Significant negative slopes were observed for functional performance (P = 0.001), spirometry (the ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC), P < 0.0001), diffusion capacity (P < 0.0001), and muscle strength (P < 0.0001). The slopes for dyspnea, fatigue, and functional capacity were not significantly different from zero, but there was a wide individual variation. Hierarchical regression demonstrated that 31% of the variance in the slope of functional performance was accounted for.

### Prognostic value of estimated functional capacity incremental to cardiac biomarkers in stable cardiac patients [^116vrf13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The key finding of this study is the strong prognostic value of functional capacity estimated by using a simple 12-question evaluation tool in a large, contemporary cohort of stable cardiac patients undergoing coronary angiography. We observed that the functional capacity estimated with the DASI score is incremental and superior to that of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, with or without underlying heart failure. We further established the association between functional capacity estimated by DASI score and markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in a subset of patients. Taken together, our findings underscore the relative importance of objectively determining the functional capacity for purposes of risk stratification in cardiac patients.

Although the DASI questionnaire was developed over two decades ago, the primary focus in using this self-assessment tool thus far has been to estimate functional capacity in the setting of preoperative evaluation or prediction of underlying ischemia. While the original objective of DASI was to estimate functional capacity, the responses can also be used to assess physical limitations relevant to an individual's quality of life and to potentially uncover significant problems related to patients who experienced CAD, PAD, or heart failure. The importance of prognostication of DASI in our study, particularly with its strong incremental value to traditional risk factors and cardiac biomarkers, underscores the need to systematically assess how DASI score can be of clinical utility.

### Does an exercise intervention improving aerobic capacity among construction workers also improve musculoskeletal pain, work ability, productivity, perceived physical exertion, and sick leave? a randomized controlled trial [^116A8hVX]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Objective - To investigate whether an exercise intervention shown to increase aerobic capacity would also lead to less musculoskeletal pain, improved work ability, productivity, perceived physical exertion, and less sick leave.

Methods - Sixty-seven construction workers were randomized into an exercise group training 3 × 20 minutes per week and a control group. Questionnaires and text messages were completed before and after the 12-week intervention.

Results - No significant changes were found in musculoskeletal pain, work ability, productivity, perceived physical exertion, and sick leave with the intervention. Questionnaires and text messages provided similar results for pain and work ability.

Conclusions - Although the intervention improved aerobic capacity, it was not successful in improving musculoskeletal pain and other work-related factors. A detectable improvement presumably requires a more multifaceted intervention, larger sample size, or longer follow-up. Text messages may be a convenient data-collection method in future studies.

### Not daily, sometimes not ever - mixed methods exploration of the contemporary relevance of tasks contained in extended activities of daily living scales [^1117NZA2]. Age and Ageing (2024). Low credibility.

- **Assessment of functional status**: Forms a core part of older adult care and research.
- **Several structured tools exist**: To assess extended Activities of Daily Living (eADLs).
- **Identified issues**: We identified redundant items in existing Activities of Daily Living (eADLs) tools and key missing tasks that are part of everyday life for older people.
- **Collaborative work needed**: Collaborative work is needed to develop Activities of Daily Living (eADLs) measures that are valid and relevant to contemporary older people's activities and priorities.

### Factors associated with frailty in primary care: A prospective cohort study [^115aE53X]. BMC Geriatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Frailty can be defined as a progressive loss of reserve and adaptive capacity associated with an overall deterioration in health that can result in disability, loss of independence, hospitalization, extensive use of healthcare resources, admission to long-term care, and death. Despite the widespread use of the term, there is no agreement on the definition of frailty or an instrument to identify it straightforwardly. The purpose of the study was to explore which factors are associated with frailty-related adverse outcomes in elderly individuals and to propose a suitable tool for identifying such individuals, particularly in primary care settings.

- **Methods**: A prospective open cohort study of community-dwelling, independent individuals aged 75 or over was conducted. These individuals were followed up for 2 years, entirely in a primary care setting. Study variables included independence status measured by Barthel's Index and the Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale, functional performance assessed by Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Gait Speed (GS) tests, and levels of polypharmacy, comorbidity, and social support. Outcome variables were specific frailty-related adverse events, namely, loss of independence and death.

- **Results**: Overall, 215 community-dwelling independent individuals initiated the study. Of these, 46 were lost to follow-up and 50 experienced frailty-related adverse events during the follow-up period. Individuals with adverse events during the study had poorer functional status at baseline. The multivariate model that best explained the occurrence of adverse events…

### Functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in people with asbestos related pleural disease: an observational study [^111VtfLn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Subjects were assessed for functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life in individuals with asbestos-related pleural disease through an observational study. Twenty-eight male participants were evaluated, with 25 included in the study. Three participants were not included due to pain affecting exercise performance (one), neurological impairment (one), and a significant degree of emphysema (one). Mean anthropometric data and pulmonary function were presented.

- **Exercise capacity**: Participants demonstrated reduced functional exercise capacity as measured by the 6MWT compared to predicted values. They also exhibited decreased peak work capacity. Subjective reasons for stopping the ICT included dyspnea in eight participants, leg fatigue in ten participants, and combined dyspnea and leg fatigue in seven participants.

### Which field walking test should be used to assess functional exercise capacity in lung cancer? An observational study [^113QnQ3j]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is emerging evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise training to improve exercise capacity for individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the gold standard measure of exercise capacity; however, this laboratory test has limitations for use in research and clinical practice. Alternative field walking tests are the six-minute walk test (6MWT), incremental-shuttle walk test (ISWT), and endurance-shuttle walk test (ESWT). However, there is limited information about their clinimetric properties in NSCLC.

- **Aims**: In NSCLC, to determine the 1) criterion validity of the 6MWT, ISWT, and ESWT against CPET; 2) construct validity of the 6MWT, ISWT, and ESWT against measures of function, strength, respiratory function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL); and 3) clinical applicability of the tests.

- **Methods**: Twenty participants (40% male, mean ± SD age 66.1 ± 6.5 years) with stage I-IIIb NSCLC completed the 6MWT, ISWT, ESWT, and CPET within six months of treatment. The testing order was randomized. Additional measures included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance-Status (ECOG-PS, function), respiratory function, hand-grip dynamometry, and HRQoL. Correlations and regression analyses were used to assess relationships.

- **Results**: The ISWT demonstrated criterion validity with a moderate relationship between ISWT distance and CPET peak oxygen consumption (r = 0.61, p = 0.007). Relationships between CPET and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (r = 0.24, p = 0.329) or ESWT time (r = 0.02, p = 0.942) were poor.

### The six-minute walk test [^114RsQk3]. Respiratory Care (2003). Low credibility.

The American Thoracic Society has issued guidelines for the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The 6MWT is safer, easier to administer, better tolerated, and better reflects activities of daily living than other walk tests, such as the shuttle walk test. The primary measurement is the six-minute walk distance (6MWD), but during the 6MWT, data can also be collected about the patient's blood oxygen saturation and perception of dyspnea during exertion.

When conducting the 6MWT, do not walk with the patient or assist the patient in carrying or pulling his or her supplemental oxygen. The patient should walk alone, not with other patients. Treadmills where the patient adjusts the speed and/or slope should not be used, nor should an oval or circular track. Use standardized phrases while speaking to the patient, as your encouragement and enthusiasm can make a difference of up to 30% in the 6MWD. Count the laps with a lap counter.

If the 6MWD is low, thoroughly search for the cause(s) of the impairment. Better 6MWD reference equations will be published in the future, so ensure you are using the best available reference equations.

### Has my patient responded? Interpreting clinical measurements such as the 6-minute-walk test [^111NCTxs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To correctly interpret clinical measurements, it is necessary to understand the standard deviation and the standard error. The standard deviation reflects the range or variability of individuals within a sample, while the standard error indicates the precision with which the group parameters have been estimated. When evaluating an individual patient, test measurement properties such as repeatability will assist in concluding whether a repeated test, measured to monitor the response to an intervention, has changed beyond its natural variability.

Using the "best" test has an inherent bias and ignores the natural test variation, whereas the average of repeated tests is more representative of the true value, making it more discriminative to change. Serial measurements to follow progress will increase a clinician's confidence in the observed effects of treatment.

### Contribution of four common pulmonary function tests to diagnosis of patients with respiratory symptoms: a prospective cohort study [^116gc9Ux]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Few studies of the diagnostic value of pulmonary function testing are available. We assessed the diagnostic contribution of four basic pulmonary function tests: spirometry, lung volume, airway resistance, and diffusing capacity.

- **Methods**: In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled patients presenting to a pulmonologist with respiratory symptoms but no clear diagnosis from 33 hospitals in Belgium. Each patient underwent spirometry, lung volume, airway resistance, and diffusing capacity testing, along with all other tests necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Clinical history and pulmonary function data were presented to local focus groups, who established differential diagnoses and a preferred diagnosis after each test. The focus groups were masked to additional investigations. The final diagnosis was established by the attending physician on the basis of all the investigations done, and validated as the gold standard diagnosis by the local focus group. The primary outcome was a score calculated by 1/number of differential diagnoses, corrected for the accuracy of the diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were the number of differential diagnoses for patients with a correct preferred diagnosis and the proportion of preferred diagnoses that were correct. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01297881.

- **Findings**: We screened 1,285 people, of whom 1,023 were enrolled and 979 analyzed. The primary outcome score was 0.226 after spirometry, increasing to 0.296 after the measurement of lung volume, 0.373 after the airway resistance test, and 0.540 after the measurement of diffusing capacity.

### Closing the capacity-ability gap: Using technology to support aging with disability [^115QxgUq]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

The models presented in this paper provide direction for researchers and designers to consider the dynamic between capacity, context, technology characteristics, and functional ability, and how these constructs impact the likelihood of successful performance outcomes for those aging with and without a pre-existing impairment.

### Closing the capacity-ability gap: Using technology to support aging with disability [^1136pBgE]. Innovation in Aging (2018). Low credibility.

While there are many interventions to address the support needs of individuals experiencing normal aging, the needs of people aging with impairments have generally been neglected. These needs include supports for managing chronic diseases and engaging in physical exercise to optimize health; performing daily activities; and participating in community activities. Despite the lack of attention to this population, technology interventions hold much promise for providing the necessary supports to maximize older adults' functional abilities and enable them to participate as fully as possible in society, for as long as possible.

- **The capacity and ability gap**: In 2015, the World Health Organization issued a call to action highlighting the critical and urgent need to bridge the gap between intrinsic capacity (physical and mental potential of an individual based on his/her body structures and functions) and functional ability (health-related characteristics that enable activity performance and participation) of older adults. The WHO report presents a public health framework to spark action for improvements in public health for older people of all capabilities and levels of health by optimizing older adults' trajectory of ability with the ultimate goal of maximizing functional ability despite losses in intrinsic capacity.

The World Health Organization's public health framework for healthy aging emphasizes that intrinsic capacity resides wholly within the individual, while functional ability encompasses the health-related characteristics that enable activity performance and participation.

### Six-minute walk test as an outcome measure: Are two six-minute walk tests necessary immediately after pulmonary rehabilitation and at three-month follow-up [^113xvBeR]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2008). Low credibility.

A three-month prospective, longitudinal, repeated-measures study was undertaken in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The study aimed to determine whether there was a difference in six-minute walk distance (6MWD) when two six-minute walk tests were performed after pulmonary rehabilitation (n = 44) and at three-month follow-up (n = 40), and whether the results reflected the program outcomes. There was a significant increase in 6MWD between two six-minute walk tests before rehabilitation (P < 0.001) and at three-month follow-up (P < 0.001), but not immediately after rehabilitation (P = 0.1). In terms of program outcomes, there was an increase in 6MWD from before to after pulmonary rehabilitation (P < 0.001); however, the increase was greater if the better of two tests was reported. Six-minute walk tests performed twice before and after pulmonary rehabilitation programs and at three-month follow-up assessments ensure accuracy of measurement of the 6MWD and program outcomes.

### Psychometric properties of ability to contribute measurements as a domain of functional ability of older persons: A COSMIN systematic review [^112mh8uC]. Age and Ageing (2023). Low credibility.

Concerning the subdomain 'Voluntary activity', we identified items related to the skills or possibilities to perform such activities, such as 'I can reach out to a person in need on the street', 'I am quick to work with others when I see a need within the community', and 'I support the local school wherever I can', and items that focus on whether they perform such activity, such as 'I do volunteer to work for a charity' and 'Are you involved in volunteer work?' It is important to consider that some items specify the type of activities.

- **Being engaged in the workforce**: We found items that capture whether this paid activity is carried out, its importance, and the way it is done, such as 'Keeping a paid job' and 'I get/keep a paid job, I do paid or unpaid work or activities that give me a role in life'. Other instruments like the Work Ability Index measure job skills with respect to demands ('work ability in relation to the demands of the job') and about the past ('work ability compared with the lifetime best'). An item was found related to how you feel about what you can do ('Feel you have done what you are capable of doing'), which was identified in the Work Role Functioning Questionnaire. Also, two items were identified in the Participation Scale ('Do you work as hard as your peers do?' and 'Do you contribute to the household economically in a similar way to your peers?') that measure ability through comparison with peers.

In relation to the subdomain 'Caring for family members', items are related to participation: 'Do you provide help to relatives?'

### Functional co-primary measures for clinical trials in schizophrenia: Results from the MATRICS psychometric and standardization study [^114Muw1G]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

During the consensus meetings of the National Institute of Mental Health Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (NIMH-MATRICS) Initiative, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration took the position that a drug for this purpose should show changes on: 1) an accepted consensus cognitive performance measure, and 2) an additional measure (i.e. a co-primary) that is considered functionally meaningful. The goal of the study was to describe steps to evaluate four potential co-primary measures for psychometric properties and validity.

As part of the five-site MATRICS Psychometric and Standardization Study (PASS), two measures of functional capacity and two interview-based measures of cognition were evaluated in 176 patients with schizophrenia (167 of these patients were retested 4 weeks later).

Data are presented for each co-primary measure for test-retest reliability, utility as a repeated measure, relationship to cognitive performance, relationship to functioning, tolerability/practicality, and number of missing data.

Psychometric properties of all of the measures were considered acceptable, and the measures were generally comparable across the various criteria, except that the functional capacity measures had stronger relationships to cognitive performance and fewer missing data. The development and evaluation of potential co-primary measures is still at an early stage, and it was decided not to endorse a single measure for clinical trials at this point. The findings offer the initial steps.

### Normative data for the 6-min walk test in 11–14 year-olds: A population-based study [^1125G41g]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The six-minute walk test (6MWT) has become a widely used measure for assessing functional exercise capacity at a submaximal level. It is described as the distance a person can walk at a self-paced speed over the period of six minutes. Previous evidence highlights the importance of using the 6MWT, given its safety, reliability, validity properties, and usefulness in functional assessment. It is a powerful prognostic marker for functional capacity in both healthy and unhealthy individuals. Factors associated with shorter and longer six-minute distances have been described previously. The 6MWT has been shown to be an inexpensive and safe tool, often associated with mortality risks in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, cystic fibrosis, and hypertension.

In the past two decades, the 6MWT has been increasingly used in children with chronic diseases. Although its practical implications have been well-documented, little evidence has been provided for normative data in healthy children. Specifically, a study by Cacau et al. identified twelve studies establishing the 6MWT standards. The reference values reviewed in the study were very heterogeneous, particularly due to small sample sizes and different settings. Thus, the findings obtained from the aforementioned studies may not be applicable to the population of children in other countries. Therefore, both country-specific and worldwide normative values for the 6MWT should be generated to track annual changes in functional status within countries and to compare data between countries.

### A new pre-employment functional capacity evaluation predicts longer-term risk of musculoskeletal injury in healthy workers: A prospective cohort study [^111a3npS]. Spine (2013). Low credibility.

Use of functional capacity evaluations in pre-employment is increasing in popularity despite limited evidence of their validity in predicting injury in healthy workers. This study indicates that job-specific JobFit System pre-employment functional assessments predict workplace musculoskeletal injury risk after 1.3 years of employment, particularly for back injuries from manual handling.

### Low-volume exercise rehabilitation improves functional capacity and self-reported functional status of dialysis patients [^1177knk2]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a program of low-volume exercise rehabilitation on the functional capacity and self-reported functional status of nonanemic dialysis patients.

This was a controlled study in a clinical setting with a repeated measures design. Functional capacity and functional status were assessed before and after 12 weeks of exercise rehabilitation or 12 weeks of normal activity for two groups of dialysis patients.

- **Results**: Mixed-model repeated measures analysis of variance revealed significant group by time interactions characterized by improvements for the exercise rehabilitation group alone in total walk, stair-climb, and stair-descent times of 15 ± 5.8%, 22 ± 11%, and 18 ± 12%, respectively. Self-reported walking speed, walking impairment-leg weakness, and walking impairment-shortness of breath were also observed to improve significantly for the exercise rehabilitation group alone by 15 ± 13%, 25 ± 11%, and 28 ± 16%, respectively.

- **Conclusion**: Low-volume exercise rehabilitation can improve activity of daily living-related functional capacity and self-reported functional status of nonanemic dialysis patients.

### Calibrating ADL-IADL scales to improve measurement accuracy and to extend the disability construct into the preclinical range: A systematic review [^117EZyDD]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Interest in measuring functional status among nondisabled older adults has increased in recent years, partly due to the notion that adults identified as 'high risk' for functional decline represent a state that is potentially easier to reverse than overt disability. Assessing relatively healthy older adults with traditional self-report measures of activities of daily living has proven difficult because these instruments were initially developed for institutionalized older adults. Perhaps less evident are problems associated with change scores and the potential for 'construct under-representation', which reflects the exclusion of important features of the construct, such as disability. Furthermore, establishing a formal hierarchy of functional status provides more information than a simple summation of functional loss and may have predictive value for clinicians monitoring older adults. If the sequence of task difficulty is accelerated or out of order, it may indicate the need for interventions.

- **Methods**: This review identified studies that employed item response theory (IRT) to examine or revise functional status scales. IRT can transform the ordinal nature of functional status scales into interval level data, increasing diagnostic precision and sensitivity to clinical change. Furthermore, IRT can rank items unequivocally along a hierarchy based on difficulty. It should be noted that this review is not concerned with contrasting IRT with more traditional classical test theory methodology.

- **Results**: A systematic search of four databases…

### Association between social factors and performance during functional capacity evaluations: A systematic review [^116sBpsF]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to determine the association of different social factors with Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) performance in adults. A systematic literature search was performed in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO electronic databases. Studies were eligible if they examined the association of social factors with the performance of adults undergoing FCE. The studies were assessed based on methodological quality and quality of evidence, and the review utilized best-evidence synthesis methods.

Thirteen studies met the eligibility criteria, evaluating a total of 11 social factors. There was considerable heterogeneity in terms of measurements, populations, and methods among these studies. High quality of evidence was found for the association of FCE performance with the country of FCE and examiner's fear behavior. There was moderate quality of evidence for an association with previous job salary. Conversely, low or very low quality of evidence was found for associations with compensation status, litigation status, type of instruction, time of day (workday), primary or mother language, and ethnicity. Other social factors were not examined.

While evidence for associations of various social factors with FCE performance was identified, robust conclusions regarding the strength of these associations cannot be made. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low. Further research on social factors, particularly within a biopsychosocial context, is necessary to provide a better understanding of FCE performance.

- **Implications for rehabilitation**: Research on Functional Capacity Evaluation (FCE) performance and its association with biopsychosocial factors is limited. Further exploration in this area is essential for gaining insight into FCE performance.

### Assessing the building blocks of function: Utilizing measures of functional limitation [^114Y53su]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

To better understand the health of older people, it is valuable to go beyond conventional measures of disease and self-perceived health and utilize assessments of functional status and disability. Physical decrements can be characterized at the level of organs and body systems (impairments); the organism as a whole (functional limitations); and the person in the context of the environment and its challenges (disability). To understand the dynamics of the pathway leading from disease to disability, it is critical to measure functional limitations that can be assessed through either self-report or standardized objective measures of physical performance. Both of these approaches may be used to evaluate functions such as grasping objects, walking, and climbing stairs.

In aging research, measures of functional limitation are utilized as outcomes that indicate the impact of disease, impairments, and other risk factors on function. In turn, measures of functional limitation can be used to characterize the functional status of individuals and populations and are powerful predictors of various adverse outcomes, including incident disability in people not currently disabled. Functional limitation measures add substantially to our knowledge about older populations, but further work is needed to promote their standardization and use in both clinical and research settings.

### Capability for daily activities in old people with rheumatoid arthritis: a population based study [^115Va3HW]. Annals of the rheumatic diseases (2005). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to describe the functional capacity for daily activities in older individuals with clinical rheumatoid arthritis, including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), within a population-based cohort.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 700 individuals, aged over 75, was randomly selected from a Finnish town. A total of 601 participants (86%) took part in the study. Data were collected through clinical records, interviews, clinical examinations, and questionnaires. The ability to perform activities of daily living (ADL) was assessed using the Barthel index, while the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were evaluated using the Lawton and Brody questionnaire.

- **Results**: Among the participants, 16 individuals had clinical rheumatoid arthritis, including one with JRA, resulting in a prevalence of 16/601 (2.7% with a 95% confidence interval of 1.7% to 4.5%). Eight patients with rheumatoid arthritis (50%) achieved the best possible ADL scores, while three (19%) showed very poor results. Seven individuals (44%) were unable to dress independently, three (19%) could not walk, and five (31%) were incapable of climbing stairs. Results adjusted for sex and age indicated no significant difference in ADL and IADL scores between patients with clinical rheumatoid arthritis and the rest of the cohort. Four patients (25%) had dementia, which correlated with poorer functional capacity.

- **Conclusions**: The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis was unremarkable. While the ability of older individuals with rheumatoid arthritis to undertake daily living activities did not differ significantly from the general population, the disease may lead to severe disabilities on an individual level, particularly when combined with dementia.

### Which field walking test should be used to assess functional exercise capacity in lung cancer? An observational study [^112hJ8TP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

There is emerging evidence regarding the efficacy of exercise training to improve exercise capacity for individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is the gold standard measure of exercise capacity; however, this laboratory test has limitations for use in research and clinical practice. Alternative field walking tests are the six-minute walk test (6MWT), incremental-shuttle walk test (ISWT), and endurance-shuttle walk test (ESWT); however, there is limited information about their clinimetric properties in NSCLC.

- **Aims**: In NSCLC, to determine the 1) criterion validity of the 6MWT, ISWT, and ESWT against CPET; 2) construct validity of the 6MWT, ISWT, and ESWT against measures of function, strength, respiratory function, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL); and 3) clinical applicability of the tests.

- **Methods**: Twenty participants (40% male, mean ± SD age 66.1 ± 6.5 years) with stage I-IIIb NSCLC completed the 6MWT, ISWT, ESWT, and CPET within six months of treatment. The testing order was randomized. Additional measures included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance-Status (ECOG-PS, function), respiratory function, hand-grip dynamometry, and HRQoL. Correlations and regression analyses were used to assess relationships.

- **Results**: The ISWT demonstrated criterion validity with a moderate relationship between ISWT distance and CPET peak oxygen consumption (r = 0.61, p = 0.007). Relationships between CPET and six-minute walk distance (6MWD) (r = 0.24, p = 0.329) or ESWT time (r = 0.02, p = 0.942) were poor. Moderate construct validity was observed.

### Contribution of a multicomponent intervention on functional capacity and independence on activities of daily living in individuals with neurocognitive disorder [^116VB7Xo]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The eligible subjects pool was restricted to individuals with the following characteristics: i) age ≥ 60 years; ii) clinically diagnosed by a physician for at least 6 months with major neurocognitive disorder according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR or DSM-5), or with dementia according to the ICD-10, or the NINCDS-ADRDA; iii) capacity to walk autonomously without an assistive device or human assistance.

Individuals were excluded if the following criteria were present: i) diagnosed with any condition or disorder in which exercise is contraindicated, such as unstable or ongoing cardiovascular and/or respiratory and/or musculoskeletal conditions; ii) recent hospitalization (e.g. previous month) and/or in recovery from surgery or rehabilitation; iii) presenting an advanced stage of major neurocognitive disorder (e.g. ≤ 10 points on MMSE) that could affect physical performance in the exercise training sessions or testing procedures.

### Measures of attributes of locomotor capacity in older people: A systematic literature review following the COSMIN methodology [^1178dA2U]. Age and Ageing (2023). High credibility.

Without strong evidence supporting the validity and reliability of measurement instruments, choosing adequate tools to screen and monitor the health status of older people may be a hazardous endeavor. To the best of our knowledge, this systematic review is the first to assess the measurement properties of tools designed to evaluate all attributes of locomotor capacity. The outcomes of this study will support the WHO Locomotor Capacity Working Group in developing both conceptual and operational definitions of locomotor capacity. Ultimately, these findings will help WHO in providing evidence-based recommendations for suitable tools to be used in clinical and population settings to assess locomotor capacity. Consequently, this will contribute to the adequate monitoring of healthy ageing and the actions undertaken by WHO and the United Nations in the context of the 2021–2030 Decade of Healthy Ageing initiative. In the absence of strong evidence for the validity and reliability of tools addressing most attributes of locomotor capacity in older people, WHO may provide interim recommendations for specific tools, following paradigms for appropriately formulated discordant recommendations.

### The relationship between intrinsic capacity and functional ability in older adults [^112cVLJD]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Studies show that 30% of younger older adults (ages 60–79) and 40% of those over 85 have at least one disability. Activities of daily living (ADLs) are used collectively to describe the basic skills required for independent living, including five essential categories: bathing, eating, dressing, changing, and mobility. However, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) are more complex and require a higher level of personal independence, indicating sufficient decision-making ability and greater interaction with the environment.

Functional disability in old age not only reduces the quality of life but also strains society's limited resources for support. One way to bridge the gap between the increasing demand for healthcare and limited resources is to help older adults continue their lives successfully and independently in later years. The assessment of intrinsic capacity plays a key role as an indicator of the physical and mental health status of older adults and related diseases. Intrinsic capacity seems to be able to show changes in community-dwelling older adults earlier than functional indicators. However, there is limited research analyzing the interplay of the five components of intrinsic capacity as a new framework for negative health outcomes and functional performance in older adults.

While the relationship between intrinsic capacity and functional ability has been studied in other countries, the results of these studies may vary, highlighting the need for further global research to better understand this relationship by examining it in countries with differing social, cultural, and family dynamics.

### Use of a technology-based system to motivate older adults in performing physical activity: a feasibility study [^116Gihi5]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

One of the contributing factors to 'maintaining physical functioning' is maintaining activity and physical capacity. Physical capacity includes "alleviating impairment and functional limitation" and "preventing injury, impairment, functional limitation, and disability". Activity can be described as occupational performance and refers to "the ability to choose, organize, and satisfactorily perform meaningful occupations that are culturally defined and age-appropriate for looking after oneself, enjoying life, and contributing to the social and economic fabric of a community".

It is not only important to maintain activity and physical capacity when aging, but it is also suggested that initiating regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, even when older, can improve health and longevity. The WHO defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. However, when aging, people tend to change their behavior and become more sedentary. According to Fanning et al. (2016), rapid declines in physical function substantially impact the overall quality of life of older adults and also reduce their ability to live independently. Therefore, it is important to stimulate older persons to perform physical activities. According to the WHO, healthy persons of 65 years and above should perform at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity or at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week. Although much research is conducted in older adults with physical exercise programs, many challenges remain in effectively motivating and sustaining physical activity in this population.

### Decline of instrumental activities of daily living is a risk factor for nutritional deterioration in older adults: a prospective cohort study [^111VqqH2]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

The association between functional capacity and the subsequent risk of nutritional deterioration is yet to be understood. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between functional capacity, comprising instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), intellectual activity, and social function, and future decline in nutritional status.

- **Methods**: This study is a two-year prospective cohort study. A total of 468 community-dwelling older adults without nutritional risks were enrolled. We used the Mini Nutritional Assessment Screening Form. Functional capacity, including IADL, intellectual activity, and social function, was assessed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence at baseline. The nutritional status was reassessed at a 2-year follow-up. Risk ratios (RR) of functional capacity for the incidence of nutritional decline were estimated.

- **Results**: Low functional capacity was significantly associated with future deterioration of nutritional status (RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.25). Of the subdomains of functional capacity, IADL decline (adjusted RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.18–4.13) was an independent risk factor for the incidence of nutritional risk. Intellectual and social activities were not significant.

- **Conclusion**: Decline in functional capacity, especially IADL, is a risk factor for future deterioration in nutritional status. Further studies are required to elucidate the effect of interventions for IADL decline on maintaining nutritional status in older adults.

### Genetic influences on functional capacities in aging [^115JRytT]. The Gerontologist (2016). Low credibility.

Older populations are characterized by great heterogeneity in functional capacities, and understanding the factors underlying these differences has been a major area of research for some decades. Genetic differences arguably play an important role in the heterogeneity observed for many outcomes among older individuals. However, the role of genes in the variation and trajectories of functional capacities in older age is poorly understood. This review was conducted to explore the evidence for genetic influences on physical functional capacities in aging.

- **Design and methods**: This rapid review was conducted using the following criteria: journal articles retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, AgeLine, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases. Key words included genetics, genotype, polymorphism, physical or functional performance, functional capacity, activities of daily living, older, and elderly. In total, 118 articles were included for initial review.

- **Results**: The heritability of objective measures of physical function ranges from 30% to 60% in studies of older twins. There is a paucity of evidence about genetic influences on functional capacities, but some candidate genes related to functional capacity have been identified.

- **Implications**: No strong candidate genes exist for functional capacities. Methodologies are beginning to generate new evidence about genetic influences on overall physical function at older ages, but the variety of measures of functional capacity makes evidence difficult to compare.

### Objective measures of physical functional capacity warrant exploration to complement or replace the subjective physician estimated performance status [^115Nenwu]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Performance status, a measure of physical functioning, can be influenced by several undefined physician and patient-related factors and is inherently subjective. Disappointing results in phase 3 trials may reflect a lack of improved outcomes due to biological mechanisms; however, a confounding effect of imbalances in physical functioning cannot be excluded in the context of modest increments in antitumor activity. Consequently, performance status estimation may complicate drug development. An objective measure of physical reserve is desirable, as it may complement or outperform performance status. We explore and discuss attractive candidates for objective measures of physical functioning.

### Objective measures of physical capability and subsequent health: A systematic review [^116sRBXm]. Age and Ageing (2011). Low credibility.

The aim of this review was to examine the associations of variation in levels of objective measures of physical capability at one point in time with subsequent health outcomes. However, it is possible that changes in capability levels over time, which occur with age, are stronger and hence more useful predictors than capability levels at one particular point in time; this should be investigated in future work.

Furthermore, we chose to examine the relationship of each individual physical capability measure to determine whether associations with health outcomes were similar for each measurement. The rationale is that there are various composite scores derived using these measurements in combination, but it is unclear whether results with such scores are driven by one measure in particular or whether they each have similar additive contributions. As levels of these physical capability measures are highly correlated with each other, more studies are required which consider the value of each additional test once the findings for one test are known.

The next stage would then be to investigate whether a derived composite score representing overall lower or upper body function, such as the short physical performance battery score or one of the frailty indices, may be a stronger predictor of subsequent health problems than any of the individual measures alone.

The variation between studies in the way in which each specified outcome had been defined, and the lack of sufficient sets of results from analyses testing any of these measures, highlight areas for further research.

### Towards a core-set of mobility measures in ageing research: The need to define mobility and its constructs [^111vw7m5]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). High credibility.

The terms 'function' and 'functioning' are frequently used in the context of ageing research. Within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), 'functioning' is an umbrella term encompassing all body functions, activities, and participation, including capacity and performance. However, the term 'function' lacks a specific definition and appears contingent on the type being referenced, such as physical or muscle function. This ambiguity contributes to low consensus among respondents regarding definitions of physical function and muscle function.

There was a low consensus on whether 'function' refers to body functions as defined by the ICF, though respondents strongly agreed that 'function' is synonymous with capacity. Additionally, there was moderate agreement that 'function' and 'functioning' may have distinct definitions. We recommend further clarification of these terms in ageing research, specifying whether body functions, capacity, or performance, as well as the type and environment of function(ing), are being assessed.

Respondents identified various mobility constructs within the physical domain, assigning similar relevance scores to each. Despite this, none were deemed very relevant, with few considered moderately relevant when applying cut-offs. There was also low agreement on classifying constructs under the ICF components. Although respondents acknowledged the utility of a mobility constructs overview within the physical domain for research, specific research questions led to wide variability in the constructs.

### The instrumental activity of daily living profile in aging: A feasibility study [^116e9PmK]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Dysfunctions in complex activities of daily living (ADLs) are a normal part of the aging process. However, differentiating functional decline associated with healthy aging from the subtle decline experienced by individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia constitutes a challenge. Finding an appropriate tool that can capture these subtle but important functional changes represents a priority.

- **Objectives**: The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Profile (IADL Profile) with elderly participants and to describe their level of difficulty encountered in each task.

- **Methods**: The tool was administered to a group of 40 elderly participants living in the community.

- **Results**: The IADL Profile was found to be feasible to use in older individuals; the tool also showed sensitivity to the difficulties experienced by this population in everyday functioning.

- **Conclusion**: The IADL Profile is a promising ecological tool to evaluate independence in aging and may help to identify individuals with MCI. This tool may also contribute to the development of tailored interventions to enhance everyday functioning in the older population.

### Association between 6-minute walk test distance and objective variables of functional capacity after exercise training in elderly heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction: A randomized exercise trial [^115x1bBT]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the change in the 6-minute walk test (6-MWT) distance in relation to changes in key functional capacity measures after 16 weeks of exercise training in older patients (≥ 65 years) with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

The design was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded comparison of two groups of HFpEF patients, utilizing hospital and clinic records for ambulatory outpatients. Participants included 47 individuals randomly assigned to an attention control (AC) group (n = 24) or an exercise training (ET) group (n = 23).

The intervention for the ET group involved cycling and walking at 50% to 70% of peak oxygen uptake (V˙o2 peak) intensity, with sessions occurring three times per week, lasting 60 minutes each.

- **Main outcome measures**: V˙o2 peak, ventilatory threshold (VT), and 6-MWT distance were measured at baseline and after the 16-week study period.

At follow-up, the 6-MWT distance was higher than at baseline in both the ET (11%, P = 0.005) and AC (9%, P = 0.004) groups. In contrast, V˙o2 peak and VT values increased in the ET group (19% and 11%, respectively; p = 0.001) but decreased in the AC group at follow-up (2% and 0%, respectively). The change in V˙o2 peak versus 6-MWT distance after training was not significantly correlated in the AC group (r = .01, P = 0.95) or in the ET group (r = .13, P = 0.57). Additionally, the change in 6-MWT distance and VT, an objective submaximal exercise measure, was not significantly correlated in the AC group (r = .08, P = 0.74) or in the ET group (r = .16, P = 0.50).

The conclusions of this study challenge the validity of using the 6-MWT as a significant indicator of exercise training effects in this patient population.

### Functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults globally: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YteWX]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Functional disability in older adults refers to difficulties in performing daily activities. It is usually evaluated based on an individual's ability to carry out basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. Although existing studies provide valuable insights, comprehensive global data on functional disability in these areas remain limited. This study aims to review existing research worldwide to estimate the overall pooled prevalence of functional disability in these areas.

- **Methods**: Systematic searches were conducted across EMBASE, Scopus, PubMed/MEDLINE, and Google Scholar from May 5 to July 11, 2024. Cross-sectional studies worldwide on functional disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living among adults aged 60 and older, published in English up to July 11, 2024, were included. Studies were excluded if they did not report the outcomes of interest, were inaccessible, case reports, low quality, review articles, or published in languages other than English. Data extraction and cleaning were performed using Microsoft Excel, and STATA version 17 was used to compute the pooled effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for functional disability in both basic activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living among older adults. To derive these estimates, we used weighted averages, where each study's prevalence was weighted by the inverse of its variance. Study heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane I² statistic.

### Decline of instrumental activities of daily living is a risk factor for nutritional deterioration in older adults: A prospective cohort study [^111QxW5p]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Low credibility.

The association between functional capacity and the subsequent risk of nutritional deterioration is yet to be understood. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between functional capacity, comprising instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), intellectual activity, and social function, and future decline in nutritional status.

- **Methods**: The study is a two-year prospective cohort study. A total of 468 community-dwelling older adults without nutritional risks were enrolled. We used the Mini Nutritional Assessment Screening Form. Functional capacity, including IADL, intellectual activity, and social function, was assessed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence at baseline. The nutritional status was reassessed at a 2-year follow-up. Risk ratios (RR) of functional capacity for the incidence of nutritional decline were estimated.

- **Results**: Low functional capacity was significantly associated with future deterioration of nutritional status (RR 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02–1.25). Of the subdomains of functional capacity, IADL decline (adjusted RR 2.21, 95% CI 1.18–4.13) was an independent risk factor for the incidence of nutritional risk. Intellectual and social activities were not significant.

- **Conclusion**: Decline in functional capacity, especially IADL, is a risk factor for future deterioration in nutritional status. Further studies are required to elucidate the effect of interventions for IADL decline on maintaining nutritional status in older adults.

### Functional walk tests in individuals with stroke: Relation to perceived exertion and myocardial exertion [^1141oise]. Stroke (2002). Low credibility.

Functional walk tests such as the 6- and 12-Minute Walk Test (i.e. 6MWT and 12MWT, respectively) are submaximal measures used to determine functional capacity in individuals with compromised ability. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between these walk tests and measures of exertion (perceived and myocardial), in addition to impairment in individuals with stroke. The relationship among the 6MWT, 12MWT, and the more traditionally assessed measure of self-paced gait speed (generally assessed over a short distance, e.g. 10 m) was also evaluated.

- **Methods**: Twenty-five community-dwelling individuals with stroke were evaluated for the following: 12MWT distance, 6MWT distance, self-paced gait speed over 8 m, plantarflexion strength, Berg Balance Scale, Ashworth Scale of Spasticity, and Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment. Heart rate (HR), rate-pressure product (RPP), and perceived exertion were assessed during the functional walk tests. Correlational analysis quantified the relationship between gait, impairment measures, and physiological responses during the functional walk tests.

- **Results**: HR reached a steady state after 6 minutes and reflected a moderate exercise intensity of 63% of age-predicted maximum HR. The 6MWT, 12MWT, and self-paced gait speed were all highly correlated with one another (r > 0.90) and were all also related to the severity of impairments. The functional walk distances did not relate either to perceived exertion or actual exertion (increase in the myocardial oxygen demand as measured by RPP).

- **Conclusions**: Stroke impact on functional capacity is evident in both walk tests and gait speed, as these metrics are interrelated but independent of perceived exertion levels.

### Interventions addressing functional abilities of older people in rural and remote areas: A scoping review of available evidence based on WHO functional ability domains [^115gWFcu]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Low credibility.

Both the Decade of Healthy Ageing and the World Report on Ageing and Health emphasized the need to enhance older peoples' intrinsic capacity across five functional ability domains. The framework of the WHO ICG was developed to ensure that integrated care and primary health services are accessible by any ageing group, including ageing populations in rural areas. People residing in rural and remote communities should have an equal opportunity to age in an environment that fosters ongoing lifelong learning and the ability to contribute to their communities while retaining their autonomy and health.

However, existing studies on functional ability or intrinsic capacity in the context of healthy ageing lack consistency in the measurement of the processes or tools used to assess domains of intrinsic capacity among researchers and service providers. Relevant studies conducted in rural and remote areas offer limited insights. A standard measurement of intrinsic capacity for clinical or community settings has yet to be operationalized. Further validation of the concept of intrinsic capacity and standardized measurements of intrinsic capacity in the five domains are needed.

### Developing and validating a novel tool to enhance functional status assessment: The Tennessee Functional Status Questionnaire (TFSQ) [^114NmKti]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Functional status is a major contributor to overall health and reflects both daily activity level (performance) and maximum attainable activity level (capacity). Existing assessment tools evaluate only one domain of function and do not provide insight into contributors to functional decline. We addressed these deficiencies by developing the Tennessee Functional Status Questionnaire (TFSQ), which reports activity levels in metabolic equivalents (METs) and evaluates five key areas: performance, capacity, activity, pain, and acute care. We validated the activity levels reported by the TFSQ against the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI).

In this prospective, observational study, 120 patients completed both the TFSQ and the DASI. TFSQ-reported functional performance and capacity was correlated with DASI-calculated METs. Pearson correlation between TFSQ-reported capacity and DASI-calculated METs was r = 0.69, P < .001. TFSQ capacity was significantly lower in patients who reported recently decreased activity, pain affecting function, or recent acute care exposure.

The TFSQ is a brief and efficient assessment of patient function, standardized to METs and validated against the DASI. Our study suggests that many patients may have the functional reserve to increase daily physical activity and that factors such as changes in activity, pain, and recent acute care interaction may lower functional capacity.

### A qualitative systematic overview of the measurement properties of functional walk tests used in the cardiorespiratory domain [^111HhkQx]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

To perform a qualitative systematic overview of the measurement properties of the most commonly utilized walk tests in the cardiorespiratory domain, researchers examined the 2-min walk test (2MWT), 6-min walk test (6MWT), 12-min walk test (12MWT), self-paced walk test (SPWT), and shuttle walk test (SWT).

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2000) and CINAHL (1982 to December 1999) electronic databases were searched. Bibliographies of the retrieved articles were reviewed.

- **Study selection**: Clinical trials and observational studies were included if they reported data on the validity, reliability, interpretability, or responsiveness of the 2MWT, 6MWT, 12MWT, SPWT, or SWT. Only studies conducted on patients with cardiac and/or respiratory involvement were included.

- **Results**: Fifty-two studies examining measurement properties of the various walk tests were found: 5 studies on the 2MWT, 29 studies on the 6MWT, 13 studies on the 12MWT, 6 studies on the SPWT, and 4 studies on the SWT. Measurement properties were most strongly demonstrated for the 6MWT. Correlations of 6MWT distance and maximal oxygen consumption ranged from 0.51 to 0.90. A change in distance walked of at least 54 m was found to be clinically significant for the 6MWT. Reliability was shown to be optimized when the administration of walk tests was standardized and at least two practice walks were performed. Patients with increased likelihood of postoperative complications, hospitalization, and death were identified by analysis of distance walked.

- **Conclusions**: Measurement properties of the 6MWT have been the most extensively studied and demonstrated to be significant when standardized protocols are followed.

### What is the role of "nonorganic somatic components" in functional capacity evaluations in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain undergoing fitness for work evaluation [^117WEEpR]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

The study utilized an analytical cross-sectional design to investigate the association of "nonorganic somatic components" alongside physical and psychosocial factors on functional capacity evaluation (FCE) in patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP) undergoing fitness-for-work evaluation.

Functional capacity evaluation is increasingly employed for assessing physical fitness for work in patients with chronic NSLBP. However, the outcomes appear to be influenced by both physical and psychosocial factors. The impact of nonorganic somatic components combined with these factors on FCE performance has yet to be thoroughly studied.

The methodology involved 126 patients with chronic NSLBP referred for physical fitness-for-work evaluation. The FCE tests included lifting from floor to waist, forward bend standing, grip strength, and a 6-minute walking test. Nonorganic somatic components were evaluated using the eight nonorganic somatic signs as defined by Waddell. These were adjusted for age, sex, days off work, salary in the previous occupation, pain intensity, fear avoidance belief, and perceived functional ability in multivariate regression analyses.

Results from the study showed that between 42% and 58% of the variation in the FCE tests was explained in the final multivariate regression models. Nonorganic somatic components emerged as consistent independent predictors for all tests. Their influence was most significant on forward bend standing and walking distance, and less so on grip strength and lifting performance.

### Prognostic value of functional capacity in different exercise protocols [^116xNUYA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

There are two main findings from this study. First, across seven different exercise protocols with various workloads, lower exercise capacity was associated with higher mortality irrespective of protocol, even after robust adjustment. Second, an equivalent estimated functional capacity (METs) does not confer the same prognostic value across different protocols. Specifically, with a Bruce protocol as the reference standard, the same estimated functional capacity is associated with a worse prognosis in less intense protocols. These findings can be used to recalibrate our understanding of METs achieved and prognostic implications in different clinically used stress protocols. Across stress tests, including even the least demanding protocols, the good prognostic value of higher estimated functional capacity is maintained. However, for similar patients achieving identical METs, the prognosis is worse with less intense protocols.

### A brief self-administered questionnaire to determine functional capacity (the Duke Activity Status Index) [^114PUPc8]. The American Journal of Cardiology (1989). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Duke Activity Status Index (DASI)" is utilized for perioperative cardiac risk management in noncardiac surgery, cancer-associated fatigue, and palliative care in patients with cancer.

The Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) is a self-administered questionnaire designed to estimate a patient's functional capacity. It is particularly useful for patients with cardiovascular disease, including those with heart failure, coronary artery disease, and post-myocardial infarction. The DASI offers an estimation of a patient's peak oxygen uptake and can be applied to stratify risk in patients undergoing various surgeries, especially cardiac surgery. Furthermore, it serves as a tool to monitor changes in functional capacity over time in response to therapeutic interventions. The DASI may not be suitable for patients with severe cognitive impairment or those unable to comprehend or respond to the questionnaire.

### Cardiopulmonary exercise testing: What is its value [^114cKg7e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Compared with traditional exercise tests, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides a thorough assessment of exercise integrative physiology involving the pulmonary, cardiovascular, muscular, and cellular oxidative systems. Due to the prognostic ability of key variables, CPET applications in cardiology have grown impressively to include all forms of exercise intolerance, with a predominant focus on heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction.

As impaired cardiac output and peripheral oxygen diffusion are the main determinants of the abnormal functional response in cardiac patients, invasive CPET has gained new popularity, especially for diagnosing early heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension. The most impactful advance has recently come from the introduction of CPET combined with echocardiography or CPET imaging, which provides basic information regarding cardiac and valve morphology and function. This review highlights modern CPET use as a single or combined test that allows the pathophysiological bases of exercise limitation to be translated, quite easily, into clinical practice.

### Impact of diabetes mellitus on functional exercise capacity and pulmonary functions in patients with diabetes and healthy persons [^116zSCMm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The test of the ability to walk a defined distance is a quick, inexpensive, and reproducible component of life quality and exercise capacity assessments. The six-minute walk test (6MWT) is currently widely used because it is both simple and reliable as a measure of exercise capacity. This test is a straightforward examination that assesses physical capacity and is readily accepted by patients.

The main advantage of simple exercise tests is that they do not require equipment and may thus be performed in most medical healthcare centers. The 6MWT plays a key role in evaluating functional exercise capacity, assessing prognosis, and evaluating response to treatment. It is most often used for the estimation of physical capacity in pulmonary and circulatory diseases, in both mild and severe conditions. The test measures the six-minute walking distance (6MWD), while the walking pace depends on the patient. It is performed once (single measurement) or before and after the treatment period or medical intervention (multiple measurements), as necessary. The 6MWT allows for the estimation of the maximal exercise capacity of patients, which corresponds to the ability to perform daily activities. The 6MWT serves as an alternative to the maximal exercise test. It can also be performed in elderly persons who have contraindications against tests on a cycle ergometer or treadmill.

Another important point is that diabetes mellitus is associated with abnormal lung function and reduced gas transfer. Chronic hyperglycemia directly increases nonenzymatic protein glycation, leading to the production of reactive compounds.
