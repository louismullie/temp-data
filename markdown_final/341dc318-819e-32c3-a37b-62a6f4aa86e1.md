An equilateral triangle has sides of 12 inches. What is the approximate area of the triangle?

Answer Choices:
A. 62
B. 72
C. 84
D. 112

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the approximate area of an equilateral triangle with 12-inch sides and to choose the closest option among 62, 72, 84, and 112 square inches. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the correct formula for the area of an equilateral triangle. Then, I should verify the exact calculation and decide how to approximate it. Next, I will compare the result to the answer choices and select the closest one. Finally, I should double-check my rounding and make sure I haven't introduced a significant error.

> Let me first confirm the formula. For an equilateral triangle with side length s, the area is given by (√3/4) × s², which is the standard geometric formula derived from splitting the equilateral triangle into two 30–60–90 right triangles and computing the height as (√3/2)s, then using ½ × base × height.

> Now, I will plug in s = 12 inches. Wait, let me verify the arithmetic before I jump ahead: s² is 144, so the exact area is (√3/4) × 144. I know √3 is approximately 1.732, so 1.732 divided by 4 is about 0.433, and 0.433 times 144 is roughly 62.35 square inches. Hold on, I should verify that multiplication: 0.433 × 144 ≈ 62.35, yes, that's correct.

> Next, I should review the answer choices and pick the closest option. 62.35 is closest to 62, which corresponds to option A. Let me consider whether any of the other choices are plausible: 72 would imply an overestimate of about 15%, 84 would be about 35% high, and 112 is nearly double the true value, so A is clearly the best fit here.

> But wait, what if I misremembered the formula or the approximation of √3? I should double-check the formula itself and the constant. The equilateral triangle area formula is indeed (√3/4)s², and using √3 ≈ 1.732 gives 62.35, which rounds to 62; using a slightly more precise √3 ≈ 1.73205 changes the result by less than 0.01, so the approximation is robust for this context.

> Final answer: The approximate area is 62 square inches, so the correct choice is A. 62.

---

The area of an equilateral triangle with 12-inch sides is **approximately 62 square inches**. This is calculated using the formula (Area = [√3/4] × side²), which gives ([√3/4] × 12² = 36√3 ≈ 62.35) square inches. The closest answer choice is **A. 62**.

---

## Calculation of the area

The formula for the area of an equilateral triangle with side length (s) is:

Area = [√3/4] × s²

Substitute (s = 12) inches:

Area = [√3/4] × 12² = [√3/4] × 144 = 36√3

Approximate (√3 ≈ 1.732):

Area ≈ 36 × 1.732 = 62.352 square inches

---

## Comparison with answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Value** | **Difference from calculated area** |
|-|-|-|
| A. 62 | 62 | 0.352 |
| B. 72 | 72 | 9.648 |
| C. 84 | 84 | 21.648 |
| D. 112 | 112 | 49.648 |

---

The closest answer is **A. 62**, with a difference of only 0.352 square inches.

## Conclusion

The approximate area of an equilateral triangle with 12-inch sides is **62 square inches**, corresponding to option A.

Experimental procedures

In the first experiment, designed to measure unbiased thresholds in the area–density space, subjects chose the odd stimulus of three dot clouds, all presented simultaneously at 12° eccentricity at the vertices of a virtual equilateral triangle for 250 ms. Two of the patches (chosen at random) had the same area and density, and comprised the standard. The other (the odd-one-out) differed in either area or density, chosen from the constant stimuli described above. Subjects performed on average 5 sessions of 170 trials each, for a total of about 850 trials per numerosity. In the second experiment, subjects were asked to make an explicit judgment: which of two stimuli had the higher area, density or number (in separate sessions). Stimuli were presented 12° left and right of screen centre simultaneously for 250 ms.

Each subject completed on average 6 sessions of at least 80 trials for a total of 480 trials for each condition yielding a total of approximately 10,000 trials.

### Impact of single eyelid on superior visual field [^111U8hYE]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
Calculation of the SVF. Based on the lengths of the 2 sides " d 1 " and " d 2 " of triangle A1, with an angle of 15 degrees formed at the apex between " d 1 " and " d 2", the area of the triangle can be determined as "[1/2] × sin15° × d₁ × d₂". Area of SVF can be approximated as the sum of the area of the 12 triangles.

Because the important value is not the absolute value of aSVF, but rather the comparison between preoperative and postoperative aSVF, the value of 1/2 sin15° (which can be assumed to represent a coefficient) was omitted from our calculation. We then compared variables, that is, the sum of the product of both sides of triangles (d₁d₂ + d₂d₃ + d₃d₄… d₁₂d₁₃), which we subsequently defined as aSVF.

After defining the visual field of the upper 90-degree meridian on the GP as the superior visual angle (SVA), we inspected differences in ERD, BRD, aSVF, and SVA between preoperatively and postoperatively. To evaluate the difference in SVF between single and double eyelids with an equivalent ERD range, we compared preoperative and postoperative aSVF among patients with ERD, which ranged between 2.0 and 4.0 mm. We then evaluated the correlation both between ERD and aSVF and between ERD and SVA.

This study was approved by our institutional review board (approval no. #424) and adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent for participation was obtained before patient inclusion in the study.

Statistical Analysis

Comparisons between preoperative and postoperative ERD and BRD, and comparisons for SVA and aSVF between preoperative natural, taped, and postoperative values were performed using the Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Correlations between ERD and aSVF and between ERD and SVA were estimated using Spearman correlation coefficient rank test. P values less than 0.01 were considered significant in all statistical tests. All statistical analyses were performed using JMP 10 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Feasibility and coexistence of large ecological communities [^1115CCyo]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Shape of the feasibility domain

So far, we have focused on the volume of the parameter space resulting in feasiblity. However, two systems having the same Ξ can still have very different responses to parameter perturbations, just as two triangles having the same area need not to have sides of the same length (Fig. 1). The two extreme cases correspond to (a) an isotropic system in which if we start at the barycentre of the feasibility domain, moving in any direction yields roughly the same effect (equivalent to an equilateral triangle); (b) anisotropic systems, in which the feasibility domain is much narrower in certain directions than in others (as in a scalene triangle). For our problem, the domain of growth rates leading to coexistence is — once the growth rates are normalized — the (S −1)-dimensional generalization of a triangle on a hypersphere. For S = 3, this domain is indeed a triangle lying on a sphere as shown in Fig. 1. If all the S (S −1)/2 sides of this (hyper-)triangle are about the same length, then different perturbations will have similar effects on the system. On the other hand, if some sides are much shorter than others, then there will be changes of conditions which will more likely have an impact on coexistence than others. We therefore consider a measure of the heterogeneity in the distribution of the side lengths (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Note 10). The larger the variance of this distribution, the more likely it is that certain perturbations can destroy coexistence, even when Ξ is large and the perturbation small. This way of measuring heterogeneity is particularly convenient because it is independent of the initial conditions. Moreover, the length of each side can be directly related to the similarity between the corresponding pair of species (Supplementary Note 10), drawing a strong connection between the parameter space allowing for coexistence and the phenotypic space. As in the case of Ξ, this measure is a function of the interaction matrix and corresponds to a geometrical property of the coexistence domain.

### In silico fragment-based discovery of CIB1-directed anti-tumor agents by FRASE-bot [^112NoCjH]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In the environment-encoding scheme, for each FRASE, we enumerate triplets of protein residues forming approximately equilateral triangles with sides between 8 Å and 12 Å (Fig. 1). Each residue in a triplet is represented by a many-hot 11-bit string expressing its physical properties — charge, H-bond donor/acceptor, aromaticity, size, and hydrophobicity (e.g. position #1 would be set to 1 if the residue has a positive ionizable group, 0 otherwise). Three positions are reserved for respectively size and hydrophobicity (e.g. all three positions are set to 1 for tryptophane and to 0 for glycine). Bitstrings for individual residues are then concatenated into a single fingerprint for the whole triplet. Six distinct fingerprints are being generated for each triplet to make triplet screening invariant to the order of residues. Typically, 6–15 qualifying triplets are being located in a single FRASE. Although the triplet fingerprint explicitly encodes only 1D information about the triplets, it also contains an implicit 3D information due to geometric constraints on the shape/size of the triangle formed by the triplet residues. Same procedure can be applied to a whole protein structure, i.e. that of the target protein, to typically produce ~350 triplets for a medium-size protein (233 triplets were enumerated for CIB1). The triplets enable a FRASE database screening process as shown in Fig. 1. First, every triplet of the target protein is compared with every triplet in the database. Second, matching triplets are used to align the respective FRASE with the protein of interest. Third, the ligand fragment from the matching FRASE is inserted into the target protein. Fourth, the ligand fragment is scored on its fitness to the target environment using a neural network model (see next section). One advantage of the FRASE screening approach is that it allows bypassing an explicit detection and comparison of ligand-binding sites, a non-trivial task, and an area of continued research –.

### Buckling cluster-based H-bonded icosahedral capsules and their propagation to a robust zeolite-like supramolecular framework [^116HaN3z]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Crystalline cluster-based H-bonded icosahedral assembly

Inspection of the rhombic dodecahedral crystal habit in the case of 1 is unexpected among crystalline forms of coinage metallic clusters, which is evocative of an example of icosahedral viruses crystallized into cubic crystals in a similar dodecahedral shape. This inspire us to conjecture that extraordinary arrangement and packing of cluster tectons might exist. To our delight, the most attractive structural feature of 1 is that twelve molecular copper clusters per unit cell self-assemble into an enclosed approximately icosahedral capsule denoted as Cu 60 (Fig. 1d) with an approximate diameter of 3.0 nm. The surface of the pseudo icosahedron contains two types of triangular faces (Fig. 1e): 8 equilateral triangles and 12 isosceles triangles, each equilateral triangle with side lengths of 16 Å (the centroid-centroid distances of two adjacent clusters) and each isosceles triangle with side and base lengths of 16 and 13 Å, respectively. It is worth noting that this is the only possible combinatorial outcome for the pseudo icosahedron buckled from these equilateral triangles and isosceles triangles, based on the ChatGPT prediction. The internal hollow icosahedral capsule Cu 60 could accommodate a sphere with a diameter of about 25 Å, corresponding to a sphere volume of ~8177 Å. Our observation of the supramolecular icosahedral assembly that involves solid-state aggregation of individual clusters is intriguing. It was previously reported that atomically precise metal nanoclusters functionalized with capsid-targeting ligands which were used to label specific components of the surface of enteroviruses created icosahedral arrangement of clusters. But once the absence of capsid-targeting ligands and without linking to the viral surfaces, cluster-based icosahedra are difficult to achieve. More importantly, the atomically accurate cluster-based icosahedral capsule will provide much more detailed information for further identifying the possible assembled origin of the icosahedron as the largest of the Platonic solids.

### The representation of geometric cues in infancy [^112XsiVA]. Infancy (2008). Low credibility.

There is evidence that, from an early age, humans are sensitive to spatial information such as simple landmarks and the size of objects. This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g. Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.

### Molecular basis of host recognition of human coronavirus 229E [^115UfsAH]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The 229E S is about 98 Å in height, and the open RBD measures approximately 45 Å. The top view of the S1 subunit resembles an equilateral triangle with a side length of around 110 Å (Fig. 1c). The overall dimension of our S is close to the previously reported structure (PDB entry 6U7H), except for the RBD up conformation and the shortened height due to the compromised EM map quality at the base of the trimer around the connector domain. The overall structure of our hAPN resembles PDB entry 4FYQ, apart from the expanded width that measures 96 Å (Fig. 1d). The RBD underwent a 60° angular displacement from RBD down (defined by the PDB entry 6U7H) to RBD up (Fig. 2a). For hAPN, a 12° angular displacement was observed for the domain I between our structure and the previously reported structure (PDB entry 6U7G)when the structures were aligned with respect to the domain IV (Fig. 2b). The bending resulted in an increase of the end-to-end distance between the N-termini by 24 Å (from 72 Å to 96 Å), which has been linked to signal transduction within the cytosol, (Fig. 2c). hAPN exists in an open (inactive) or closed (active) conformation to regulate its enzymatic activity. The 229E S can associate with either state as opposed to the PRCoV S protein, which only binds to the open form of pAPN.

### Sagittal cephalometric evaluation without point nasion: sagittal G-triangle analysis [^117XBZ2g]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The second highlight of sagittal G-triangle analysis is that based on the Bo–X line, an equilateral triangle framework is constructed. In this framework, its 3 sides (Bo–X, X–K, and K–Bo) and 3 altitudes are of equal importance in reference as the Bo–X line. For example, in the sagittal G-triangle analysis, angle AXK has an equal role as angle AXBo in determining the maxilla position, but angle AXK has a much smaller absolute value. With this equilateral triangle framework as reference, any target line in the cephalometric film could find its nearest neighboring reference line among the 6 lines in the G-triangle framework (3 sides and 3 altitudes). All the measuring results in the G-triangle analysis are between −15° and 15°, a number range much easier for measuring and memory.

The third highlight of the sagittal G-triangle analysis is that the X–K side of the G-triangle could be used as a guided goal line for the sagittal evaluation. Based on the statistical analysis, our study revealed that both angles AXK and BXK have a normal range of approximately 0°. In an ideal case, as point B in the mandible is a bit posterior to point A in the maxilla in the sagittal direction, the conventional cephalometric measurements of points A and B have little difference. For example, in Steiner's analysis, the normal value of SNA is 82° and that of SNB is 80°. However, in the sagittal G-triangle analysis, the reference X–K line is sloping at a certain angle, so angles AXK and BXK have almost the same normal range. According to the position of points A and B to the X–K line, an easy sagittal evaluation could be deduced. The intermaxillary relationship of the maxilla and mandible could also be evaluated. Because sagittal G-triangle analysis provides a more precise reliable parameter for the assessment of the sagittal jaw relationship according to the harmonious facial profile, it can be a valuable tool when planning maxillofacial surgery for patients with sagittal skeletal deformities.

### Endoscopic vascular decompression for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia: clinical outcomes and technical note [^1168tXgV]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 2
A skin incision was made behind the ear (approximately 3 cm in length) and a 2 cm bony opening was created (A). A bone flap approximately 2 cm in diameter (B).

First, we opened the subarachnoid space and slowly released the cerebrospinal fluid; we used small pieces of cerebral cotton to provide sufficient operating space for the endoscope. At this time, we used a rigid 30° endoscope with an outside diameter of 4 mm (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany); when combined with a high-definition camera, this endoscope provides excellent visualization. By adjusting the angle of the 30° endoscope, it was possible to observe any hidden structure within the operating area without having to retract the brain. The endoscope was attached to the operating table using a Mingjie Minimally Invasive Surgical Robot (Deming, DR0502, Hefei, Anhui, China) (Figure 3A and B); this released our hands so that we could concentrate on fine dissection. We believe that one of the major technical challenges to EVD is the potential risk of instruments clashing with the endoscope within the limited scope of cerebellopontine angle (CPA). By maintaining a strict triangle during the introduction and placement of the endoscope and the right- and left-hand instruments, we were able to minimize confusion and conflict between instruments within the tight confines of the CPA. The endoscope was placed at the vertex of a virtual equilateral triangle that was constructed in the surgical field of view; the vertex represented the "12 o'clock" position. The aspirator and micro-instrument passed underneath the endoscope at the "5 o'clock" and "7 o'clock" positions. In this way, we were able to maximize surgical safety while maintaining good operability.

### Shape morphing of plastic films [^115LBEY1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Polygons

The adhesive layer was parallelly aligned with certain intervals. The width of the adhesive layer (wₐ) was calculated from the interior angles ɵ and the diameter of the peeled-off film, d, where wₐ = [(180 − ɵ)πd/360]. The intervals are equal to the corresponding side length. Taking right triangle with interior angles of 60° and the shortest side length of 10 mm as an example, the diameter of peeled-off PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) with Kapton tape as the adhesive layer and a peeling angle of 180° is 2 mm; thus, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.62, 1.57, 2.09 and 2.62 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 17.3, 10 and 20 mm, respectively (Fig. 3e). The PTFE film (thickness of 80 μm, width of 4 mm) was adhered vertical to the adhesive layer and peeled off at peeling angle of 180°. For an isosceles right triangle with a short side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.36, 1.57, 2.36, and 2.36 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10, and 14.1 mm, respectively. For an equilateral triangle with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers should be 2.09, 2.09, 2.09, and 2.09 mm, respectively, and the corresponding intervals should be 10, 10 and 10 mm, respectively. For the equilateral polygon with a side length of 10 mm, the widths of adhesive layers are 1.57, 1.26, and 1.05 mm with intervals of 10 mm for quadrangle, pentagon and hexagon, respectively.

### Numerosity tuning in human association cortices and local image contrast representations in early visual cortex [^116BbBsq]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

We also determined how well the relationship between aggregate Fourier power and numerosity generalizes across a much greater range of item sizes, spacings, and shapes that were not included in our fMRI experiments. We tested single circles from 1–240 pixels diameter placed at the image center. We then tested images of seven circles, each of diameter 16 pixels, spaced randomly but evenly within a 50–528 pixel diameter circular area. The minimum center-to-center distance increased with the group area. We then tested images of 16-pixel diameter circles from numerosity 1–175 within a 700-pixel diameter circular area, placed at least 24 pixels apart (edge-to-edge).

We then tested regular convex polygons from three corners (equilateral triangle) to ten corners (regular decagon), plus a circle (i.e. infinite corners), with all corners 30 pixels (radius) from the image center. We also tested regular stars with 3–10 points (at 30 pixels radius), interleaved with concave corners at 10 pixels radius. Spatial frequency differs with orientation in these shapes, so we determined the frequency of the first harmonic separately at each orientation and summed the PSD within the resulting area.

We finally tested pairs of dots with and without connecting elements to determine whether the effects of these connecting elements on Fourier power predict their effects on perception. All dots we 30 pixels in diameter. All bars were 4 pixels wide and the same length as the (edge-to-edge) distance between dots. Illusory contour inducers were 4 pixels wide, the same color as the background, and extending 10 pixels into the dot. To separate effects of connected configurations from changes to image properties, we included conditions where the bar or illusory contour inducer was split in the middle and rotated around the dot center.

To model predictions of the mean fMRI response to aggregate Fourier power (or any other non-numerical feature), we took the mean value over all displays of the same numerosity and stimulus configuration.

### Backmapping triangulated surfaces to coarse-grained membrane models [^114oHVJx]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Three-dimensional triangulation of a triangle.

a One triangle is divided to four triangles by finding three new vertices in proximity of the mid-point of each of the edges of the original triangle. This increases the vertex number by a factor of 4. b Using the geometrical properties at two neighboring vertexes, an estimate of the geodesic connecting two neighboring vertices can be found (red curve). c By performing several consecutive operations as shown in a, enough points are generated on each triangle for lipid placement.

Step 3: CG protein placement: In this step, each CG protein structure is transferred to its given vertices using. This will guarantee a correct orientation of the proteins both along the normal and on the local plane. To avoid re-equilibration of lipid–protein interactions, instead of transferring only proteins, one can transfer a protein with its neighboring lipids (including lipids underneath for peripheral membrane proteins) from an equilibrated MD structure (Fig. 1).

Step 4: CG lipid placement: We first calculate the number of the required lipids to cover the surface of each monolayer. To do this, we first calculate the total area of the monolayer TS (is monolayer index) aswhereandare the number of proteins and projected area of the transmembrane region of the protein (protein projected area for peripheral membrane proteins). Then, we randomly select a vertex, check if it is in touch with any protein, if not, then place a lipid with a probability of. This step will be iterated untillipids are selected. Our results show a quick convergence of this algorithm (Fig. 1).

Assessment of palpebral parameters for a 22-year-old woman. Red lines indicate palpebral edge to corneal light reflex distance (ERD), and green lines indicate the lower border of the eyebrow to light reflex distance (BRD). Left, Preoperative photograph of the left eye. Right, Photograph of the left eye at 3 months postoperatively.

Goldmann perimetry was performed preoperatively and at 3 months postoperatively by certified orthoptists. All subjects were examined using the same perimeter. For the preoperative evaluations, the first measurement was made with the eyelid in the natural (untaped) position. The measurement was then repeated with the palpebral skin taped up (taped position) to confirm the absence of any causative factors for visual field impairment other than that associated with the eyelid. Postoperative measurements were performed with the eyelid in the natural resting position.

Area of the SVF (aSVF) was defined as the area of the hemiellipse bordered by the horizontal line running from 0 to 180 degrees and the upper half of the V4e isopter of the GP. As an approximation of the hemiellipse, we adopted the area of a polygon inscribed in the V4e isopter, comprising the 12 triangles divided by each meridian line (from 0 to 180 degrees). The area of each triangle was calculated in units of degrees squared using the following equation:

The aSVF was defined as follows:

aSVF = A₁ + A₂ + A₃ +… A₁₂ = [1/2] × sin15° × (d₁d₂ + d₂d₃ + d₃d₄… + d₁₂d₁₃; Fig. 2).

### Cortical thickness systematically varies with curvature and depth in healthy human brains [^117SJzKS]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.1 Mesh decimation and smoothing

The accuracy of quantitative surface measures depends on the quality of the mesh. As surface reconstruction from MR images introduces noise, a more uniform, simplified, and smoothed mesh is necessary to reduce the irregularities of the original mesh (Dahnke & Gaser,) and improve the signal‐to‐noise ratio. To achieve this, we used quadratic edge collapse decimation with a target reduction value of 70% and Laplacian and Taubin smoothing (Ohtake, Belyaev, & Bogaevski; Sorkine; Taubin,) algorithms (Cignoni et al.) (Figure 2a, b). In a previous study, 70% down‐sampling of Freesurfer‐generated pial surfaces yielded an error value below 0.2 mm for both gyri and sulci (Tran & Fang). This decimation results in approximately 40 k vertices and 80 k triangles per hemisphere. Laplacian and Taubin smoothing are applied for 50 and 100 iterations, respectively. These values were found to avoid over‐smoothing and shrinkage of the surface while preserving the original topology (Figure 3). Less convoluted areas are covered with slightly fewer triangles and vice versa. To assess the quality of the decimated mesh, we compared the radius ratio and aspect ratio of its triangular elements before and after mesh decimation and smoothing using open‐source 3D mesh processing software Meshlab (Cignoni et al.). Radius ratio (Tecchio & Basso,) is the ratio of the radii of the circle inscribed in a triangle, and the triangle's circumsphere; it is calculated for triangleaswhere a is the total area of the triangle and, andare its edge lengths. Radius ratio ranges from 0 to 1, with an optimal value of 1 for an equilateral triangle. Aspect ratio is the ratio of a triangle's area to its longest edge length, with low values indicating stretched‐out obtuse triangles. After decimation, we observed 15% improvement in the radius and aspect ratios (Figure 4), particularly by eliminating many of the most distorted triangles.

### An anatomical study of the arteries of the anterior nasal septum [^116BNTKG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

The anterior nasal septum is a clinically important area, yet anatomical descriptions of its arterial pattern are hitherto incomplete. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that the arteries of the anterior nasal septum form a fine random network of vessels.

Study Design

The arterial pattern of the nasal septum was traced by microdissection of 12 cadaveric septa (24 sides).

Setting

Each septum was microdissected with a Watson-Barnet dissecting microscope. Specimens were photographed and the vascular patterns were analyzed.

Results

The anterior septum has a consistent large arterial anastomotic triangle receiving major contributions from sphenopalatine, anterior ethmoidal, and superior labial arteries.

Conclusion

Systematic microdissections clearly demonstrate that the arteries of the anterior septum do not form a random network. Instead, they form a consistent arterial anastomotic triangle consisting of large, thin vessels.

Significance

The study provides background material useful to the understanding of nasal physiology and pathology including epistaxis.

### Ideological differences in the expanse of the moral circle [^112QdWCa]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Procedure

Participants began the task by reading the following instructions:

This is a study about pattern perception. On each of the next 30 screens, you are going to see two boxes. (Do not worry, each screen takes just a few seconds). In each box you will see some dots moving around. After 3 s, three buttons will appear. Please click on the appropriate button to indicate which box you like better. The buttons will disappear 5 s later, so you will have to make your judgments within that 5 s period.

That may seem like an odd judgment to make, but if you just relax and let yourself look back and forth between the two boxes, you will find yourself having some slight feelings in response. You will find yourself liking one box or the other a bit more. Do not think too much about the task, just go with your feelings.

Next, they proceeded to evaluate 30 screens, in which two animations were presented side by side (to view task access:; see Supplementary Fig. 1 for depiction of task). Each animation consisted of six dots that varied on two dimensions: (1) color diversity — all six dots were of the same color (nondiverse) or of all different colors (diverse); (2) looseness-tightness — the six dots either remained fixed as a single shape, a triangle (tight), moved individually, but retained the general shape of a triangle (mobile), or orbited around each other freely (loose). Animations were divided evenly into diverse and nondiverse color patterns as well as tight or loose movement patterns, and were randomly presented next to each other. After three seconds of the animation, participants were asked to select one of three options: "I prefer this one" (presented twice–once under each animation) or an option that said, "I have no preference at all". If participants did not select an option within 5 s, text appeared informing participants they were too slow and asking them to try to click a button within 5 s the next time. After the presentation of these 30 screens, participants answered a question about how hard the task was and an open-ended question on what they thought the purpose of the task was.

### On-site growth of perovskite nanocrystal arrays for integrated nanodevices [^1161gjAV]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To investigate the effect of meniscus asymmetry on the nanocrystal positioning, we fabricated wells of different geometries as shown in Fig. 2a. These include a square, an equilateral triangle, and two isosceles triangles with corner angles (44°, 68°, 68°) and (20°, 80°, 80°). The critical contact angles associated with these well designs are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. To allow direct comparison between the different geometries, the wells are made to support an equal volume of the precursor solution. For this, the well dimensions are selected to yield a constant area corresponding to that of a 150 nm × 150 nm square, while maintaining a constant height of 22 nm for all samples. The wells are further made to have a contact angle of 50° to the precursor solution, through a second functionalization step. This contact angle is controlled by varying the duration of the fluorination step, an example of which is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5a. Nanocrystals, 38 ± 3 nm in lateral dimension, are obtained for all the well geometries, which is as expected given the wells' constant volume (Fig. 2c). Depending on the geometry, instances of multiple nanocrystals per well are also observed. Notably, an asymmetric well geometry favors the formation of single crystals with the yield improving to 80% for the (20°, 80°, 80°) template (Fig. 2d).

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^1176z4TG]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

SPINNA on DNA origami

To account for deviations from the design parameters (15 nm distances), the value of the distances between sites of the origami were left as free parameters of the model and swept for best fit. For the line structure, inter-site distances were swept in the range of 15 nm to 16.5 nm with a step size of 0.1 nm. For the triangle structure, an isosceles triangle was assumed, with its base and sides ranging from 15 to 16.5 nm with a step size of 0.1 nm. Label position uncertainties were tested in the range from 0.8 nm to 1.4 nm with a step size of 0.1 nm. Using the lines- or triangles-only datasets as ground truth, the corresponding stoichiometries were simulated and the resulting KS2 values were reported. The combination of the four structure parameters yielding the lowest KS2 value, as depicted in Fig. 2e, and label position uncertainty of 1.1 nm were found to fit the experimental data the best. To find labeling efficiency for each dataset, the average fraction of detected sites was calculated, which ranged between 92.8% and 95.3%. 250,000 sites were simulated in SPINNA. Granularity was set to 101, such that the proportions of line and triangle structures were iterated by 1%pt.

SPINNA on EGFR

Areas in the cell membrane with homogenous density were selected for the analysis. Dimer and tetramer intermolecular distance and label position uncertainty were assumed constant across oligomers, left as a free parameter of the model and determined from the fit. The distance ranged from 16 nm to 22 nm with a step size of 1 nm and label position uncertainties ranged from 4.5 nm to 7.0 nm with a step size of 0.5 nm. These ranges of values were chosen according to previous values reported in literature. KS2 was reported for each set of parameters and the lowest KS2 value was found for a distance of 21 nm and label position uncertainty of 6.0 nm. Granularity was set to 34, i.e. proportions of structures were iterated by 3%pt. Labeling efficiency of 37% was used, as reported in ref.

### Quantitative verification of the keyhole concept: a comparison of area of exposure in the parasellar region via supraorbital keyhole, frontotemporal pterional, and supraorbital approaches [^112rqtLK]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Object

This study was designed to determine if the "keyhole concept", proposed by Perneczky's group, can be verified quantitatively.

Methods

Fourteen (3 bilateral and 8 unilateral) sides of embalmed latex-injected cadaveric heads were dissected via 3 sequential craniotomy approaches: supraorbital keyhole, frontotemporal pterional, and supraorbital. Three-dimensional cartesian coordinates were recorded using a stereotactic localizer. The orthocenter of the ipsilateral anterior clinoid process, the posterior clinoid process, and the contralateral anterior clinoid process are expressed as a center point (the apex). Seven vectors project from the apex to their corresponding target points in a radiating manner on the parasellar skull base. Each 2 neighboring vectors border what could be considered a triangle, and the total area of the 7 triangles sharing the same apex was geometrically expressed as the area of exposure in the parasellar region.

Results

Values are expressed as the mean ± SD (mm²). The total area of exposure was as follows: supraorbital keyhole 1733.1 ± 336.0, pterional 1699.3 ± 361.9, and supraorbital 1691.4 ± 342.4. The area of exposure on the contralateral side was as follows: supraorbital keyhole 602.2 ± 194.7, pterional 595.2 ± 228.0, and supraorbital 553.3 ± 227.2. The supraorbital keyhole skull flap was 2.0 cm(2), and the skull flap size ratio was 1:5:6.5 (supraorbital keyhole/pterional/supraorbital).

Conclusions

The area of exposure of the parasellar region through the smaller supraorbital keyhole approach is as adequate as the larger pterional and supraorbital approaches. The keyhole concept can be verified quantitatively as follows: 1) a wide area of exposure on the skull base can be obtained through a small keyhole skull opening, and 2) the side opposite the opening can also be visualized.

### Nanoimprinted polyamide membranes for ultrafast and precise molecular sieving with low fouling [^112EtqQW]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The specific topography and dimensions of these pillars are demonstrated via SEM and AFM measurements. As shown in Fig. 1d, e and Supplementary Fig. 12, the radius of the conical pillar on the PIP-based polyamide membrane is 5.6 μm at the top and 8.5 μm at the bottom, whereas the height is 1.7 μm and the distance between neighboring pillars is 10 μm. The dimensions of the pillars on the MPD-based polyamide membrane were also obtained. It has a diameter of approximately 5.2 μm at the top and 7.7 μm at the bottom and a height of 1.5 μm (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 13). The polyamide layer heights (1.7 μm for PIP-based and 1.5 μm for MPD-based) are slightly lower than the pillar height (2.1 μm) on Kevlar substrate, AFM profiles show that PIP-based polyamide layers follow the substrate topography better. The lower height of the MPD-based polyamide layer may result from nanobubbles (~0.3 μm) present at the surface, as observed in Supplementary Fig. 15d, rather than indicating poor contact with the substrate. Assuming that the surface of the pillars is smooth, the increased surface area compared with that of the flat membrane could be calculated on the basis of the above data related to the dimensions of the pillars. As shown in Fig. 1d, the whole membrane surface can be divided into numerous equilateral triangles with an area of 52.09 µm 2, which is much larger than the area of a flat equilateral triangle (43.3 µm 2). This suggests that the surface area increased by 20.3% after being patterned with pillars. This significant increase in surface area is expected to greatly improve the water or solvent permeability of the prepared membrane. By using a similar calculation, the MPD-based polyamide membrane would have a 16.4% surface area enhancement.

Atomic structure and electronic properties of MBE-grown MoSe 2 films on HOPG

Figure 1a shows a typical large-scale STM image of a MoSe 2 film grown by MBE on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate. The whole MoSe 2 surface is decorated by triangle patterns. A close-up STM image of these patterns is displayed in Fig. 1c, and the boundary appears as two bright parallel rows at negative sample voltages (occupied states). Hence the single layer MoSe 2 film is comprised of a mosaic of triangle single-crystalline domains, where neighbouring domains are separated by inversion domain boundaries (IDBs) or mirror twin boundaries (MTBs). These triangle patterns are non-uniform in size, with sizes varying from several to tens of nanometres (nm). Fig. 1b shows the statistical distribution of the triangle domain size (represented by the side lengths of the MTB equilateral triangles) of more than 300 triangles in the samples studied. It is found that these MoSe 2 triangle domains are mostly in the size range of 1.5–4.0 nm, which corresponds to 5–12 lattice constants of MoSe 2 (a 0 = 3.3 Å as determined by nc-AFM measurements). The smaller triangle domains tend to pack in the centre of the MoSe 2 islands while the larger domains are observed closer to the island edges.

Figure 1
Trial structure and exemplar stimuli. Examples of (a) a valid trial, in which a right‐sided target is cued by a large numerical array, and (b) the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays used as numerical cues.

The numerical cue consisted of two‐item or a nine‐item arrays, that were matched for the cumulative area occupied by the items (~8 cm 2) and their total contour length (~34.5 cm), as well as for the size of the virtual square subtended by the items (~52 cm 2). The rectangular‐shaped items composing the two‐item and the nine‐item arrays measured, respectively, 0.5 × 8.1 cm and 0.73 × 1.2 cm; they were arranged randomly within the virtual square, with their shorter side aligned with the horizontal plane. Each numerosity (i.e. 2 or 9) could appear in three different colors (yellow, green, and pink) and four orientations (two leftward, and two rightward), created by rotating the array to the right by 90° three times, which resulted in 12 different arrays per numerosity (Figure 1). On each trial, the displayed numerical cue was selected randomly from the pool of 12 arrays, and the displayed target stimulus was selected randomly from a pool of sixteen different images of a static colorful ball (1.75 cm in radius) varying in color (Figure 1). Trials were administered in blocks, each block composed of eight valid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue) and eight invalid trials (i.e. left‐sided target preceded by a nine‐item cue, and right‐sided target preceded by a two‐item cue). Valid and invalid trials appeared randomly, and cue numerosity and target position were equally distributed within each block. There was no restriction on the number of trial blocks presented to each participant: The experimental session terminated when the infant had looked away from the screen during five consecutive trials.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^113vtrP3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

As noted above (CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY), controlled trials have demonstrated that nitroglycerin ointment can effectively reduce exercise-related angina for up to 7 hours after a single application. Doses used in clinical trials have ranged from 1/2 inch (1.3 cm; 7.5 mg) to 2 inches (5.1 cm; 30 mg), typically applied to 36 square inches (232 square centimeters) of truncal skin.

It is reasonable to believe that the rate and extent of nitroglycerin absorption from ointment may vary with the site and square measure of the skin over which a given dose of ointment is spread, but these relationships have not been adequately studied.

Controlled trials with other formulations of nitroglycerin have demonstrated that if plasma levels are maintained continuously, all anti-anginal efficacy is lost within 24 hours. This tolerance cannot be overcome by increasing the dose of nitroglycerin. As a result, any regimen of NITRO-BID®administration should include a daily nitrate-free interval. The minimum necessary length of such an interval has not been defined, but studies with other nitroglycerin formulations have shown that 10 to 12 hours is sufficient.

Thus, one appropriate dosing schedule for NITRO-BID®would begin with two daily 1/2- inch (7.5 mg) doses, one applied on rising in the morning and one applied six hours later. The dose could be doubled, and even doubled again, in patients tolerating this dose but failing to respond to it. The foilpac is intended as a unit dose package only and is equivalent to approximately 1 inch as squeezed from the tube. Use entire contents of foilpac to obtain full dose and discard immediately after use.

Each tube of ointment and each box of foilpacs is supplied with a pad of ruled, impermeable, paper applicators. These applicators allow ointment to be absorbed through a much smaller area of skin than that used in any of the reported clinical trials, and the significance of this difference is not known. To apply the ointment using one of the applicators, place the applicator on a flat surface, printed side down. Squeeze the necessary amount of ointment from the tube onto the applicator, place the applicator (ointment side down) on the desired area of the skin, and tape the applicator into place.

Surgical technique

Patient positioning and robot set-up

All procedures were performed using the da Vinci® Si or Xi Surgical System (Intuitive Surgery, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and ureteroscopy. Peritoneal and transurethral routes were used. After general anesthesia, the surgical position was selected based on the preoperative assessment of the ureteral stricture location.

Positioning

When the stenosis was located above the crossing of the ureter and iliac vessels, a lateral lithotomy position was used (Fig. 1 A), whereas when the stenosis was located below the crossing of the ureter and iliac vessels, a supine lithotomy position was used, with the head low and foot high (Fig. 1 B).

Fig. 1
Patient positioning A: Lateral lithotomy position; B: Supine lithotomy position

After pneumoperitoneum was established, a longitudinal incision of 10 mm was made at the lateral border of the rectus abdominis muscle of the two transverse fingers above the umbilicus, and a 12 mm puncture sheath was inserted as a laparoscopic channel. Another proximal 8 mm cannula was located in two transverse fingers below the costal margin of the midclavicular line, approximately 10 cm from the laparoscopic channel. The distal 8 mm cannula was placed at the midpoint of the line between the laparoscopic channel and anterior superior iliac spine. The assistant channel positioning was connected with three points of the laparoscopic channel and operation hole, forming an equilateral triangle, one on the left and another on the right. Furthermore, a 5-mm cannula was placed under the xiphoid process during right ureteral surgery to elevate the liver.

Common Volume Geometric Methods Used in the Clinic

Composite midpoint integration method

The commonly used composite midpoint integration method applies to parallel stacks of short‐axis image planes that, ideally, encompass the entire extent of the LV from the mitral valve annulus to the apex (Figure 1). The LVV is estimated by multiplying the observed cavity area on each slice, A, times the slice thickness, h, to get the volume contribution of each slice, and summing these over all slices (Eqn. 1 in Figure 1). This "stack of disks" approach is also commonly referred to as the Simpson's Rule; however, in mathematics the Simpson's Rule refers specifically to integration using quadric polynomials. 22 In this article, the in‐plane cavity area was computed numerically from the user‐selected LV endocardial contour, but in the clinic is often approximated from 1 or 2 user‐defined diameter measurements and a circular or elliptical model for the in‐plane area. A common variant implemented by Wyatt et al 17 models the most apical aspect of the LV as a hemisphere that emanates from the bottom half of the most apical slice (Eqn. 2 in Figure 1).

Fig. 2
Ⓐ Planning the osteotomy angle and osteotomy direction. Ⓑ The length of the osteotomy was 12.6 mm. Ⓒ Confirming the osteotomy length during the operation (marked with red line)

We made a medial incision in the distal femur. An oval window was opened on the medial bone cortex, with a window area of approximately 5 × 1 cm. The diseased tissue in the medullary cavity was scraped off, the medullary cavity was ground with a grinding drill, the medullary cavity was burned with an electric knife, and finally, the tissue was soaked in anhydrous alcohol for five minutes. According to the preoperative design, two Kirschner wires were inserted and served as the osteotomy positioning guide needle. The angle was checked via fluoroscopy and determined to be too small; then, another Kirschner wire was implanted. On fluoroscopy, the osteotomy angle was good. The outermost two Kirschner wires were equivalent to two sides of the isosceles triangle planned in the preoperative design. The Kirschner wires intersected 5–10 mm inside the cortex of the lateral condyle of the femur, which was the hinge point of the osteotomy (Fig. 3 A). The distance between the two Kirschner wires (red lines on Fig. 2 C) was the bottom edge of the isosceles triangle planned preoperatively and was approximately 1.26 cm (Fig. 2 C). A wedge-shaped osteotomy was made with a pendulum saw was used to control the osteotomy depth, stopping when it was close to the contralateral cortex and protecting the contralateral hinge; then the osteotomy end was closed slowly (Fig. 3 B). After fluoroscopic examination indicated that the mechanical axis of right lower limb was satisfactory, the medial plate of the distal femur was implanted (Fig. 3 C). The flexion and extension function of the knee joint was good, and the fracture end was stable. After washing, the broken end medullary cavity was implanted with allogeneic bone, and the drainage tube was placed and sutured layer by layer.

Gold nano-triangles

Gold nanoparticles were produced in a two-step reaction as described in detail in our previous work. In brief, the reaction of HAuCl 4 mixed with Na 2 S was followed spectroscopically to obtain triangles (equilateral prisms) with ~60–80 nm side length and ~8 nm thickness and stopped by the addition of an excess of Na 2 S. Following precipitation in 0.6 M cetyl trimethyl ammonium chloride and purification using 3 centrifugation cycles, the nano-triangle stock solution was centrifuged and the pellet resuspended in destilled water. Unless stated otherwise, the particles were applied to the mica surface at ~0.3 pM concentration, which led to ~50 particles on a 80 × 80 μm 2 surface. When applied to the mica surface together with the DOPC bilayer in our experiments, the smallest distance of ~100 nm between the earliest myo6 hotspots (Fig. 3e) indicated that initially the proximity between bilayer and nano-triangle (60–80 nm side length) must have been ≤ 10–20 nm.

In situ labelling of the gold nano-triangles using TRITC

TRITC-maleimide (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (Sigma) to a concentration of 470 μM. The solution was reacted with 10 mM DTT (Sigma) for 10 min at RT and diluted in LB to obtain a 100-μM thiolated dye solution. Gold nano-triangles diluted to 0.07–1.2 pM in LB buffer were added to a flow cell and left to sediment on the mica surface for 5 min before DOPC vesicles were added to form a bilayer as described above. After 10 min, the bilayer was washed three times with AB buffer supplemented with scavenger. The solution was exchanged by 100 μM thiolated dye in AB buffer and incubated for 10 min. Finally, the flow cell was washed ten times to ensure that all unbound dye was removed.

### Preoperative measurements and planning sheet for an endograft with 3 inner branches to repair aortic arch pathologies [^115gC37V]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To present a methodology for aortic arch anatomy measurement to plan and size an arch endograft with 3 inner branches.

Technique

The arch endograft is custom manufactured with 3 inner side branches. Computed tomography angiography should be used to measure the clock position, the distances between the supra-aortic vessels, and the length and diameter of the proximal and distal landing zones. On the planning sheet, the vertical axis on the grid represents the spiral stabilizing wire at the 12 o'clock position; the horizontal baseline at 0 mm represents the idealized proximal margin of the innominate artery (IA). The first inner branch for the IA would be at 12:30 clock position and -20 mm from the horizontal baseline, while the second inner branch would be at the 11:30 clock position and at 0 mm. The third inner branch would vary among the different potential positions.

Conclusion

Preoperative measurements of aortic arch anatomy can be made using a standard methodology to plan the size and position of inner branches. Future studies will show the potential applicability of a standard 3-inner-branch arch endograft using the planning sheet.

### Tips and tricks for robotic pancreatoduodenectomy with superior mesenteric / portal vein resection and reconstruction [^113byxmH]. Surgical Endoscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical technique

The patient is prepared as for a standard RPD. Part of this standard preparation includes exposure of both groins and the left lateral region of neck, in preparation for procurement of vascular grafts (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
Groin (a) and neck (b) regions are prepped in preparation for possible harvesting of greater saphenous veins and/or left internal jugular vein

Dissection proceeds following the technique recently reported for the "cold" triangle RPD. The specimen is therefore mobilized from all retroperitoneal attachments, but the area of suspected vein involvement, by proceeding along the adventitial plane of large peripancreatic arteries (Figs. 3 and 4). At this time the surgeon has to decide which type of vein resection and reconstruction to perform.

Fig. 3
Following an "artery-first approach" with dissection in the periadventitial plane, the celiac trunk (with the origin of both the common hepatic artery and the splenic artery) and the right side of the superior mesenteric artery are radically divested

For running vascular sutures, we prefer to use expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE). To facilitate intracorporeal handling, two suture legs of approximately 12 cm each are tied together to obtain a shorter double armed suture (Fig. 5). Fine sutures are used (6/0 or 7/0).

### Combined petrosal intertentorial approach: a cadaveric study of comparison with the standard combined petrosectomy [^114q6e6r]. Operative Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Areas of Surgical Exposure

Two areas of exposure (petroclival skull base and brainstem) were calculated by obtaining the sum of areas formed by juxtaposed triangles. For the petroclival area, we identified 4 fixed anatomic landmarks (posterior clinoid process, MC, internal acoustic canal, and jugular foramen) and 2 variables (uppermost and lowest medial clivus). Measuring the coordinates of these 6 points created a hexagonal shape. For the brainstem area, we identified 2 fixed points (trigeminal and facial nerve root entry zone [REZ]) and 3 variables (the lowest medial, the uppermost medial, and uppermost lateral brainstem), obtaining a pentagon-shaped area (Figure 5 A and 5 B drawing). Each polygon was divided along diagonals to create triangles whose area was calculated by the length of each side using Heron's formula. The areas of the 4 triangles of the petroclival skull base and the 3 triangles of the brainstem were then summed to calculate the total area of surgical exposure.

Pneumoperitoneum was established by a Veress needle at an intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg. The five trocars were distributed in the following way. A 10 mm trocar for the camera was placed 2 cm to 3 cm below the umbilicus for the 30° camera. Two trocars were placed at the outer edge of right rectus abdominis, forming a regular triangle with side length of about 10 cm from the umbilicus. The trocar at the upper abdomen was 5 mm and the one at the lower was 12 mm. The rest two trocars were placed in the same way at the outer edge of left rectus abdominis, but the trocar at the upper was 12 mm and the one at the lower was 5 mm.

Left atrial (LA) size — area measurement is defined and qualified. It is measured in four-chamber apical view, at end-systole, on the frame just prior to mitral valve opening by tracing the LA inner border, excluding the area under the mitral valve annulus and the inlet of the pulmonary veins. It is described as more representative of actual LA size than anteroposterior diameter only, but requires a dedicated view to avoid LA foreshortening and assumes a symmetric shape of the atrium.

Atrioventricular (AV) valves morphometric evaluation — measurement of mitral valve (MV) and tricuspid valve (TV) size helps characterize valvar pathology and diagnose ventricular hypoplasia, with annular diameter and area measured by 2D and 3D imaging; annular area may also be estimated from a single-plane diameter using the area formula for a circle, but because the MV annulus is elliptical and saddle-like in shape a more accurate estimate can be obtained with orthogonal diameters using the area formula for an ellipse, and published pediatric normative databases have used annular diameters measured in apical 4-chamber (lateral diameter) and parasternal long-axis (anteroposterior diameter) views to calculate MV and TV elliptical annular areas.

Pearson correlations found during the validation step. The correlations with 95% confidence intervals for method (M) 1 are shown with an x marker, for method 2 with square markers, for method 3 with circle markers and for method 4 with plus sign markers. For each method, except for method 1, the correlations for coronal (Cor), sagittal (Sag) and transversal (Tra) intracranial areas are presented from left to right. The dashed line marks the y-coordinate for correlations of 0.99

Starting side

See Table 1. For method 3 with sagittal ICAs, there was a negligible difference in the correlation to fully delineated ICV between using the position indices consistently from the patients' left and from the right, respectively. When using the indices randomly from either the patients' left or right, the correlation dropped slightly.

Comparison of correlations

Figure 5 visualises the confidence intervals for the differences in correlations among methods 2, 3 and 4. With 95% confidence, method 4 with sagittal ICAs will result in estimates that have a higher correlation to fully delineated ICVs than all other estimates, except those from method 3 with sagittal ICAs.

Fig. 5
Comparison of correlations. With 95% confidence, the actual differences in correlations between methods 2 to 4 (M2–4) are within the height of the plotted boxes. The unit of the y-axes is the Pearson correlation and ranges between −0.1 and 0.1. Above each plot, the confidence intervals are also given in numbers rounded to the nearest thousandth. The titles of the columns tell which correlation was used as minuend and the titles of the rows which correlation was used as subtrahend when calculating the confidence intervals. The planes denote a correlation difference of zero and are red when the confidence intervals pass through zero, indicating that the actual difference between the two compared methods might be zero. C (coronal), S (sagittal) and T (transversal) denote the orientation of the intracranial areas used

Mitral and tricuspid annuli — measurement guidance and recommendations — Acquisition guidance states that "The largest diameters during peak filling in early diastole should be measured at the frame after maximum excursion of the leaflets from inner edge to inner edge at the hinge points of the leaflet attachments". The document notes that "it is unreliable in the setting of congenital MV stenosis", and that "Compared with 3D planimetric assessment in patients with mitral stenosis, 2D planimetry overestimates MV area by as much as 88%, depending on valve geometry (domed vs funnel shape) and the position of the transducer relative to the valve orifice". Recommendations specify: "The recommended methods to assess MV and TV annular size include measurement of lateral diameters in apical 4-chamber views and anteroposterior diameters in parasternal long-axis views and calculation of areas using the area formula for an ellipse".

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^113nbqPR]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Although the mathematical formulation and numerical implementation of our growth model is somewhat complex, our model's conceptual underpinning is relatively parsimonious. Indeed, the atrophy front growth model of equation SI-2 (Appendix 1) is arguably the minimal model of an anisotropically evolving margin. Moreover, as noted previously, although independently derived, our growth model naturally leads to a notion of growth rate that is consistent with the previously proposed square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted growth rate metrics. We argue that this agreement lends support both to our model and to the use of these growth rate metrics. Nevertheless, given the relative intricacies of our model's formulation, it is reasonable to ask what advantages it offers compared with more informal or ad hoc statements of the margin-mediated growth hypothesis. In this regard, we believe that this study makes 2 substantive contributions: (1) our model leads to a precise biophysical statement as to what length-type growth rate metrics measure, something that is reasonably nuanced and not a priori evident, particularly for anisotropic lesion growths; and (2) our model allows quantitative assessments of length-type metric accuracies on realistic lesion geometries and growth patterns, something that is not possible with existing formulations. In particular, the accuracies of length-type metrics have been discussed previously only in the context of simple shapes (e.g. circles) and simple growth patterns (e.g. isotropic growth fields or infinitesimal time intervals, Δ t).

### Aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride (Ameluz) [^116RDhJi]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Note: The RhodoLED XL LED panels should only be used in curved shape and not in fully unfolded form. This is necessary to ensure the application of 37 J/cm² during the illumination.

Figure 13: Treatment area of RhodoLED®XL from the side and in top view.

Note: If less than 5 panels are used for a treatment, it must be ensured that at least three adjacent panels are used. The treatment area is thereby reduced and reaches from the midline of the one outer panel to the other midline of the other outer panel.

If a treatment with less than 5 active LED panels is started, a message dialog appears which must be confirmed.

8.4.7 Adjusting the Treatment Distance

The correct treatment distance for the RhodoLED®XL is 4.9 ± 0.6 inch (12.5 ± 1.5 cm). Each LED panel is equipped with a distance sensor to allow individual adjustment of all panels. The distance sensor is automatically switched on if the panel is switched on. The current distance of each panel is shown on the control unit display above the panel illustration. The following table summarizes the visualization of the treatment distance.

Note: When starting the treatment, the LED panels that are too close or too far away from the treatment area will nevertheless also light up. To disable an LED panel during the treatment it must be switched off on the display (see Figure 12).

### Tuning curves for approximate numerosity in the human intraparietal sulcus [^1157nksz]. Neuron (2004). Low credibility.

Number, like color or movement, is a basic property of the environment. Recently, single neurons tuned to number have been observed in animals. We used both psychophysics and neuroimaging to examine whether a similar neural coding scheme is present in humans. When participants viewed sets of items with a variable number, the bilateral intraparietal sulci responded selectively to number change. Functionally, the shape of this response indicates that humans, like other animal species, encode approximate number on a compressed internal scale. Anatomically, the intraparietal site coding for number in humans is compatible with that observed in macaque monkeys. Our results therefore suggest an evolutionary basis for human elementary arithmetic.

### Anatomical determination of a safe entry point for occipital condyle screw using three-dimensional landmarks [^1126bc6E]. European Spine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

The occipital condyle (OC) is an important area in craniovertebral surgery, but neither its anatomical features nor the procedures concerning the OC have been detailed yet. The morphological analysis of the structures were made in totally 704 sides of the occipital bones of adult skulls by 3D-Doctor Demo version. The length and width of the OC were found to be 23.9 ± 3.4 (right), 24 ± 3.3 (left) and 11.9 ± 2.3 (right), 10.7 ± 2.3 mm (left), respectively. The mean anterior intercondylar distance and the posterior intercondylar distance were measured as 20.9 ± 3.6 and 43.1 ± 4 mm, respectively. The sagittal intercondylar angle was observed as 68.7 ± 10.6º. The sagittal condylar angle was observed to be 32.9 ± 7.6º and 38.2 ± 7.3º in the right and left, respectively. The head circumference was observed to be 65.6 ± 7.8 and 64.4 ± 7.2 mm in the right and left, respectively. The head area was measured as 231.9 ± 53.3 and 214.9 ± 45.1 mm² in the right and left, respectively. The most common type was oval-like (59.67%), whereas the most unusual one was two-portioned condyle (0.32%). In Pearson correlation analysis, it was significant that a statistically strong relation was noticed between the length and area, and the circumference and area. The findings suggest that the oval type was more successful to work with, while the triangular, circular and two-portioned types were highly risky for the fixation resonance as the surface got quite smaller. As a result, we suggest that by resecting nearly half of the OC, the border of the hypoglossal canal can be involved.

### Use of platelet-rich plasma solution applied with composite chondrocutaneous graft technique: an experimental study in rabbit model [^114ist74]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Composite chondrocutaneous grafts have been used widely for patients with cleft lip nasal deformity, alar defects, and septal perforations; however, the graft viability can be easily compromised. The aim of the present study was to extend the safe length of the composite chondrocutaneous grafts by enhancement of angiogenesis and re-epithelialization through platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and to investigate the changes that occur when PRP is administered to the graft and the recipient site.

Materials and Methods

Composite grafts of critical sizes (1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 cm) were planned on the rabbit ears on 1 side. Group A consisted of grafts pretreated with PRP, group B consisted of recipient beds pretreated with PRP, and group C was the control group in which defects 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 cm in size were formed on the right ears of the rabbits. On postoperative day 7, matching size chondrocutaneous grafts were adapted to the defect areas without PRP. In all groups, graft viability was evaluated 7 days after graft adaptation in group C and 14 days after PRP administration in groups A and B. Wound healing was scored histopathologically and immunohistologically using hematoxylin and eosin, CD34, and smooth muscle actin staining. The terminal transferase fluorescein-dUTP nick end labeling assay was performed to quantitatively demonstrate the apoptosis ratio among the groups.

Results

In groups A, B, and C, the mean graft survival of the 2.0-cm equilateral triangle-shaped composite grafts was 65.43% ± 15.7%, 78.12% ± 12.8%, and 41.31% ± 37.4%, respectively (P = 0.0364).

Conclusions

PRP pretreatment accelerated composite graft survival in the 2.0-cm equilateral triangle grafts by increasing epithelial regeneration and fibrosis, inducing neovascularization, and ameliorating apoptosis rates.

Basic stereological measurements — first-order parameters and probes identify that "First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D])". Measurements "are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D)". These probes create countable events in the image, and "Raw counts provide ratios… that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute measures for the lung or subcompartment".

### Comparative analysis of posterior approaches to the medial temporal region: supracerebellar transtentorial versus occipital transtentorial [^116c9K1C]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Cortical and subcortical lesions in the posterior portion of the medial temporal region (MTR) are routinely resected through the supracerebellar transtentorial (SCTT) or occipital transtentorial (OCTT) route. We compared the exposures provided by these 2 approaches to this region.

Methods

Eight sides of injected cadaver heads were dissected using both approaches. Identical deep target points were collected for SCTT and OCTT routes while accepting variations in initial exposures. Data gathered with the P2-P3 junction as an apex created 2 adjoining triangles (anterior and posterior) in the middle and posterior MTR. Real, projected, and freedom areas were calculated for comparison.

Results

The approach-related differences for the real and projected areas were expressed in relative values. There were no differences in the percentage of projected area between the 2 approaches (e.g., working in the middle of the opening, anterior triangle: SCTT, 5.2 ± 4.1%; OCTT, 8.4 ± 5.6%; P = 0.313; posterior triangle: SCTT, 8.6 ± 3.8%; OCTT, 8.8 ± 6.3%; P = 0.937). Freedom areas for the SCTT approach were smaller than those for the OCTT approach at many deep points (P < 0.05), except in the posterior margin of the MTR (P = 0.21).

Conclusion

The SCTT and OCTT approaches provided no differences in surgical views to the MTR. However, the OCTT approach provides a wider corridor for surgical manipulation compared with the SCTT approach in most parts of the MTR. These data may help neurosurgeons to select a favorable approach to specific lesions of the MTR.

### Aqueous proton-selective conduction across two-dimensional graphyne [^11139tcW]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The membrane thickness and the mean step distance for proton penetration are estimated using the length of vacuum phase at the interphase, as shown in Supplementary Figures 27 and 28. The values are 4.85 Å and 4.82 Å for graphyne (n = 3) and graphyne (n = 4), respectively. Here we take κ = 2 for the penetration process, thus for proton conduction across graphyne at room temperature with proton concentration of 1, the estimated area-normalized proton conductance for graphyne (n = 3) and graphyne (n = 4) are 9.66 × 10 4 S cm −2 and 2.15 × 10 6 S cm −2, respectively.

An alternative approach to estimate the proton conductance is adopting the ionic conductance model across nanopores, which assumes that ion mobility inside the nanopore is identical to the bulk mobility without restraint –. For single triangular pore, the conductance can be predicted as:whereis the bulk proton conductivity, d is the membrane thickness, a is the side length of the triangular pore, and k is the geometrical factor (k = 2.5 for triangular pores). The area-normalized proton conductance can be estimated as:where ρ is the density of pores, which can be calculated from the atomic geometries of graphyne as:The ρ value adopted for n = 3 and n = 4 graphyne membranes are 2.39 × 10 18 cm −2 and 1.64 × 10 18 cm −2, respectively. We adopted thevalue calculated from the above-mentioned Nernest–Einstein relation using = 9.31 × 10 −5 cm 2 s − 1 and = 1 M. d is length of vacuum phase at the interphase as obtained before. a was substituted by the mean length of the triangular pores filled with aqueous phase, as shown in Supplementary Figures 27 and 28 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4. The area-normalized proton conductance estimated using this method are 8.99 × 10 4 S cm −2 and 3.94 × 10 5 S cm −2 for graphyne (n = 3) and graphyne (n = 4), respectively. For both graphyne (n = 3) and graphyne (n = 4), the area-normalized proton conductance estimated using both methods qualitatively agree with each other, indicating that when the pore size reaches 1.20 nm, the proton conduction behavior inside the pores is similar with that in the bulk phase.

### Patency of the lenticulostriate and pontine arteries after stenting of the intracranial arteries [^116VumWE]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

The next step is to multiply the green figure area by 4 and introduce the trigonometric function of theangle.

Thus, the area of the part of the ellipse uncovered by the rectangle is as follows:

Obviously, the formula can be used only when the stent strut width is no greater than the perforating artery ostium width, i.e.

In the case of Model 2, the coverage of the perforating artery ostium by two parallel stent struts can be calculated similarly. The area of the ellipse covered by two rectangles amounts to four times the area of dark blue figure minus four times the area of light blue figure. The areas of blue figures are calculated in the same way as the area of the green figure in Model 1. Finally, the formula is as follows:

Again, the formula can be used only when the stent strut width is no greater than half of the perforating artery ostium width, i.e.

### Noninvasive bioelectronic treatment of postcesarean pain: a randomized clinical trial [^112uFZ8j]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Procedures

Application of the functional or sham device occurred a total of 3 times beginning on postoperative day 0. The first application was accomplished as soon as was practical following cesarean delivery and no more than 2 hours after arrival in the recovery area. The second application occurred 12 (acceptable range 10–14) hours after the first application. The third and final application occurred 12 (acceptable range 10–14) hours after the second application. The range for the second and third applications was intended to avoid waking the patient when sleeping or interrupting clinical care. Aside from device application, participants received usual inpatient care postoperatively, including standard scheduled nonopioid medications and as needed opioid pain medications at the discretion of the clinical team.

Each application lasted a total of 12 minutes. The probes were placed perpendicular to the skin line approximately 1 inch (to convert to centimeters, multiply by 2.54) from the abdominal skin incision (Figure 1). The probes were initially placed with 1 probe superior to and 1 inferior to the incision, then lifted and moved to a new location every 2 minutes, moving longitudinally along the length of the incision. For the final 2 minutes, one probe was placed at each lateral edge of the incision (Figure 2). All applications were performed by trained clinical research personnel (D.D.M. B.K. J.R. and K.R.).

### Overestimation of numerical distances in the left side of space [^117VcwSR]. Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Normal subjects presented with a middle number and two left- and right-sided outer numbers overestimate the numerical distance between the middle number and that positioned at its left side. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the right posterior parietal cortex specifically counteracts this bias, suggesting that the mental representation of space defined by numbers is shifted toward the left side depending on a greater activity of the right hemisphere.

### The oculomotor-tentorial triangle. part 1: microsurgical anatomy and techniques to enhance exposure [^112mAXdr]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Access to the ventrolateral pontomesencephalic area may be required for resecting cavernous malformations, performing revascularization of the upper posterior circulation, and treating vascular lesions such as aneurysms. However, such access is challenging because of nearby eloquent structures. Commonly used corridors to this surgical area include the optico-carotid, supracarotid, and carotid-oculomotor triangles. However, the window lateral to the oculomotor nerve can also be used and has not been studied. The authors describe the anatomical window formed between the oculomotor nerve and the medial tentorial edge (the oculomotor-tentorial triangle [OTT]) to the ventrolateral pontomesencephalic area, and assess techniques to expand it.

Methods

Four cadaveric heads (8 sides) underwent orbitozygomatic craniotomy. The OTT was exposed via a pretemporal approach. The contents of the OTT were determined and their anatomical features were recorded. Also, dimensions of the brainstem surface exposed lateral and inferior to the oculomotor nerve were measured. Measurements were repeated after completing a transcavernous approach (TcA), and after resection of temporal lobe uncus (UnR).

Results

The s1 segment and proximal s2 segment of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) and P2A segment of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) were the main contents of the OTT, with average exposed lengths of 6.4 ± 1.3 mm and 5.5 ± 1.6 mm for the SCA and PCA, respectively. The exposed length of the SCA increased to 9.6 ± 2.7 mm after TcA (p = 0.002), and reached 11.6 ± 2.4 mm following UnR (p = 0.004). The exposed PCA length increased to 6.2 ± 1.6 mm after TcA (p = 0.04), and reached 10.4 ± 1.8 mm following UnR (p < 0.001). The brainstem surface was exposed 7.1 ± 0.5 mm inferior and 5.6 ± 0.9 mm lateral to the oculomotor nerve initially. The exposure inferior to the oculomotor nerve increased to 9.3 ± 1.7 mm after TcA (p = 0.003), and to 9.9 ± 2.5 mm after UnR (p = 0.21). The exposure lateral to the oculomotor nerve increased to 8.0 ± 1.7 mm after TcA (p = 0.001), and to 10.4 ± 2.4 mm after UnR (p = 0.002).

Conclusions

The OTT is an anatomical window that provides generous access to the upper ventrolateral pontomesencephalic area, s1- and s2-SCA, and P2A-PCA. This window may be efficiently used to address various pathologies in the region and is considerably expandable by TcA and/or UnR.

### The anatomic rationale for transforaminal endoscopic interbody fusion: a cadaveric analysis [^1176eRkz]. Neurosurgical Focus (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The authors describe a cadaveric analysis to determine the ideal dimensions and trajectory for considering endoscopic transforaminal interbody implantation. METHODS The soft tissues of 8 human cadavers were removed from L-1 to the sacrum, exposing the posterior bony elements. Facetectomies were performed bilaterally at each lumbar level with resection of the pars interarticularis, revealing the pedicles, nerve roots, and interbody disc space. Each level was digitally photographed with a marker for scale and evaluated with digital analysis software. The traversing and exiting nerve roots and pedicle margins were identified, and the distances between these structures and their relationships to the surrounding structures were documented. RESULTS The dimensions of 2 areas were measured: the working triangle and safe zone. The working triangle is the triangle between the exiting and traversing nerve roots above the superior margin of the inferior pedicle. The safe zone is the trapezoid bounded by the widths of the superior and inferior pedicles between the exiting and traversing nerve roots. The mean surface area for the working triangle was 1.83 cm(2), with L5-S1 having the largest area at 2.19 cm(2). The mean surface area of the safe zone was 1.19 cm(2), with L5-S1 having the largest area at 1.26 cm(2). At the medial border of the pedicle extending superiorly, there were no nerve structures within 1.19 cm at any level. On the lateral border of the pedicle, the exiting nerve root was closer superiorly, with the closest being 0.3 cm. CONCLUSIONS The working triangle is a relatively large area. The safe zone, just superior to the pedicle, is free of nerve structures. By utilizing the superior border of the pedicle, the disc space can be accessed within this safe zone without risk of injury to the nerves. A thorough understanding of foraminal anatomy is fundamental for considering how to safely access the disc space, thereby utilizing less invasive endoscopic techniques, and is an important first step in considering what shapes and sizes of interbody implants and retractors are feasible for use in the foramen.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^111DrJCQ]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) linear and area measurements — the most widely used linear dimension is the anteroposterior (AP) measurement in the parasternal long-axis using M-mode or, preferably, two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE), but the AP linear dimension should not be used as the sole measure of LA size; LA area can be planimetered in apical four- and two-chamber views, and optimal contours should be obtained while avoiding foreshortening.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^111eXWpk]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.

15 g tube length × width + 4

Using the calculations for ulcer size in centimeters, each square centimeter of ulcer surface will require approximately a 0.25 centimeter length of gel squeezed from a 15 g tube. For example, if the ulcer measures 4 cm by 2 cm, then a 2 cm length of gel should be used for a 15 g tube [14 × 21 + 4 = 21. The amount of REGRANEX to be applied should be recalculated by the physician or wound caregiver at weekly or biweekly intervals depending on the rate of change in ulcer area. The weight of REGRANEX from 15 g tubes is 0.65g per inch length and 0.25 g per centimeter length.

To apply REGRANEX, the calculated length of gel should be squeezed on to a ciean measuring surface, e.g., wax paper, and measured to the correct length with a ruler. The measured REGRANEX is transferred from the clean measuring surface using an application aid and then spread over the entire cleaned ulcer area to yield a thin continuous layer of approximately 1/16 of an inch thickness. The site(s) of application should then be covered by a saline moistened gauze dressing and left in place for approximately 12 hours. The dressing should then be removed and the ulcer rinsed with saline or water to remove residual gel and covered again with a moist primary dressing (without REGRANEX gel) for the remainder of the day. REGRANEX should be applied once daily to the ulcer until complete healing has occurred. If the ulcer does not decrease in size by approximately 30% after 10 weeks of treatment or complete healing has not occurred in 20 weeks, continued treatment with REGRANEX should be reassessed. The step-by-step instructions for applying REGRANEX in a home care setting can be found in the FDA-approved Instructions for Use.

### Invariance properties of bacterial random walks in complex structures [^1115ZNSY]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The effect of size and shape

We have demonstrated that, for a fixed shape, the density of obstacles has a strong effect on the distribution of path lengths while leaving the mean value unchanged as long as the total internal accessible area remains the same.

We will now investigate the effects of shape and size on the path length distributions and again conclude that, although path distributions are very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the domain, mean path lengths and residence times can be accurately predicted using only the surface to perimeter ratio. We fabricate microstructures of circular, squared and triangular shapes all in four different sizes as shown in Fig. 2a. In all structures the obstacle density is fixed to N / S = 0.016 μm −2. All recorded trajectories are also plotted in Fig. 2a with a color map encoding the scaled path length L /. In Fig. 2b we plot for each structure the histogram of path lengths normalized by the expected valuein Eq. 4. As we move from circles to squares and then to triangles we observe that the corresponding histograms are characterized by larger frequencies for both short and long path lengths. The probability of short paths increases as we introduce convex corners and reduce their angle, as evidenced by the blue-violet color of the corners in squared and triangular structures. The presence of longer paths in triangles can be also understood noting that the normalized maximum straight paths for circles, square and triangles are respectively 4/ π,/ π and/ π (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Despite these qualitative and quantitative differences between histograms, mean path lengths are always close to 1 when normalized by the predicted valueas shown in Fig. 2b. The observed path length distributions can be very well reproduced by a Lorentz gas model where collisions with obstacles are described as instantaneous reorientation events. These events are assumed to occur with a constant probability per unit path length given by, where/ π is the rotational average cross section of line obstacles with length b (see Methods). For perfectly straight trajectories, circles and squares have path length distributions with a vertical asymptote. A strong peak is found at the location of this divergence and is progressively smeared as the linear size of the domain becomes larger than the mean free path. Upon increasing the size of the region a peak aroundappears due to bacteria that scatter close to the boundary, reorient and exit. The mix of these two types of trajectories gives rise to the observed double-peak structure. Differently for the triangle no asymptote is present in the P (L) for large λ, therefore only a peak atprogressively appears. These results show that P (L) depends strongly on the random walk properties (as the mean free path), and on the domain features (shape and size). Differently the mean valuesanddepend only on the surface to perimeter ratio of the domain as expressed by Eq. 4. Experimental values ofare shown Fig. 3a for all shapes and sizes. We find an excellent agreement with theory using the same value s = 6.3 μm 2 that was used previously to predict the experimental values ofas a function of the number of obstacles (see Fig. 1c). This value of s has also been used to calculateaccording to Eq. 5 which captures quantitatively well the experimental data as shown in Fig. 3b.

Aortic annulus measurement orientation and pitfalls: Correct measurement uses a centrally positioned diameter and central closure of leaflets with the long axis of the ascending aorta providing orthogonal orientation of the annular diameter; incorrect approaches include eccentric annular measurement with hinge points slightly displaced upward and not corresponding to the nadir of cusp attachments, and oblique annular measurement; the annulus is "virtual" and only defined by the hinge-points of the three aortic valve leaflets, with its plane approximately perpendicular to the long-axis of the aorta; attempting to measure 2 hinge-points typically measures within the sinuses of Valsalva and overestimates the annulus.

### Nitroglycerin (Nitro-bid) [^113rvtBj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR APPLICATIONS

Measure desired dosage of Nitroglycerin Ointment 2% by means of the dose measuring applicator supplied with the tube. Place the applicator on a flat surface, printed side down. Squeeze the necessary amount of ointment from the tube onto the applicator, and place the applicator (ointment side down) on the desired area of the skin.
Spread the ointment using the dose measuring applicator lightly onto the chest or other areas of skin if preferred. Do not rub into the skin. Coverage of an area approximately the size of the dose measuring applicator (31/2′′ by 21/4′′) should be sufficient to obtain the desired clinical effects. A larger area may be used.
Tape the applicator into place.

NOTE: NITRO-BID®can stain clothing. Care should be taken to completely cover the dose measuring applicator with a plastic kitchen wrap.

Dosage Instructions: Dosage instructions should be obtained from your physician. One appropriate dosing schedule for NITRO-BID®would begin with two daily1/2 inch (7.5 mg) doses, one applied on rising in the morning and one applied six hours later. The dose could be doubled, and even doubled again, in patients tolerating this dose but failing to respond to it. The foilpac is intended as a unit dose package only and is equivalent to approximately 1 inch as squeezed from the tube. Use entire contents of foilpac to obtain full dose and discard immediately after use.

INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS: Your daily regimen of NITRO-BID administration should include a nitrate-free period. Studies have shown 10–12 hours is sufficient. The most common side effect which is encountered is headache. Faintness, flushing and dizziness may occur, especially when suddenly arising from the recumbent (lying horizontal) position. If these latter symptoms do occur, it may warrant discontinuation of therapy, and your physician should be notified. For changes in dosage and frequency of application consult your physician.

TUBE: KEEP TUBE TIGHTLY CLOSED.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

Fig. 7
The radar map reflecting the anti-interference performance of FE OS. The radar map integrates the five parameters reflecting the variation by the interference of cpDNA-Cy5 or AIEgens after infiltration and after 2 V driving. The five parameters are considered as the resistance increment from step 1 (or step 2) to step i (AA ΔR), gating ratio (AA gr), fluorescent intensity (AA FI), fluorescent FWHM (AA FWHM). The calculated formulas are listed as AA ∆ R = (∆ R (process 2) − ∆ R (process 3))/∆ R (process 2), AA FI = (FI (process 2) − FI (process 3))/FI (process 2), AA FWHM = (FWHM (process 2) − FWHM (process 3))/FWHM (process 2), AA ∆gr = (∆gr (process 2) − ∆gr (process 3))/∆gr (process 2) (where the Δgr were calculated by taking R B as 100%). The fifth parameter is the area of triangle in Supplementary Fig. 23 to value the integrated anti-interference ability after 2 V driving. The bigger area of the polygon, the greater anti-interference of OS

Coincidentally, in a nuclear pore complex, the similar divisions of function exist naturally. Analogous to the OS, the densely packed Phe-Gly Nup meshwork at the entrance of nuclear pore complex physically exclude spurious macromolecules into nuclear pore complex (analogous to FE OS), avoiding the interference on the gating properties of nuclear pore complex (Supplementary Fig. 24). Overall, this work could be to blaze a trial not only for the role of FE OS at OS in nanochannels, but even for the biomimetic system in the porous membrane.

### Statistical determination of the optimal subthalamic nucleus stimulation site in patients with parkinson disease [^114qg9fo]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Object

The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is currently recognized as the preferred target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). If there is agreement in the literature that DBS improves motor symptoms significantly, the situation is less clear with respect to the side effects of this procedure. The goal of this study was to correlate the coordinate values of active electrode contacts with the amplitude of residual clinical symptoms and side effects using a mathematical approach.

Methods

In this study the investigators examined a cohort of 41 patients with PD who received clinical benefits from DBS after stimulating electrodes had been implanted bilaterally into the STN. The combined scores of residual clinical symptoms plus side effects, including speech disturbance, postural instability, and weight gain, were fitted by using either inverted ellipsoidal exponefitials or smooth splines. These analyses showed evidence of lower combined scores for stimulating contacts at an x coordinate approximately 12.0 to 12.3 mm lateral to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line and at a z coordinate approximately 3.1 to 3.3 mm under the AC-PC line. There was insufficient evidence for a preferred y coordinate location.

Conclusions

The authors propose a "best" therapeutic ellipse area that is centered at an x, z location of 12.5 mm, -3.3 mm and characterized by an extension of 1.85 mm in the x direction and 2.22 mm in the z direction. Therapeutic electrode contacts located within this area are well correlated with the lowest occurrence of residual symptoms and the lowest occurrence of side effects independent of STN anatomical considerations. The lack of a significant result in the y direction remains to be explored further.

### Improved corpus callosum area measurements by analysis of adjoining parasagittal slices [^117We32H]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

The corpus callosum (CC) is a bundle of approximately 180 million axons connecting homologous areas of the left and right cerebral cortex. Because CC projections are topographically organized, regional CC morphological abnormalities may reflect regional cortical developmental abnormalities. We assess the variance characteristics of three CC area measurement techniques by comparing a single midsagittal slice versus three slices (midsagittal plus one parasagittal on each side) and five slices (midsagittal plus two parasagittal on each side). CC images were partitioned into five subregions using the Hofer-Frahm scheme under the three methods and variance was examined via two complementary data sets. In the first, to control for intersubject variability, 12 scans were acquired from a single subject over the course of 3 h. In the second, we used scans from 56 healthy male volunteers between the ages of 10 and 27 years (mean = 17.47, S.D. = 3.42). Increasing the number of slices from one to three to five diminished the coefficient of variation (CV) within subregions and increased the power to detect differences between groups. A power analysis was conducted for the sample under each method to determine the sample size necessary to discern a given percent change (delta) ranging from 1 to 20% iteratively.

### Early sagittal shape of the spine predicts scoliosis development in a syndromic (22q11.2DS) population: a prospective longitudinal study [^1126F8Dz]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

The PIT

All of the radiographic measurements were performed with Surgimap imaging software (version 2.3.2.1; Nemaris), which has been validated for measuring spinopelvic parameters. A single trained observer blinded to the outcome analyzed the freestanding lateral full-spine radiographs, which had been made in a standardized manner, of every patient at inclusion. At that time, all of the patients were skeletally immature, and those with scoliosis on the coronal radiograph were excluded. First, the observer utilized Surgimap's Spinal Wizard software to segment both femoral heads and all vertebral body end plates; manual adjustments were made where necessary (Fig. 1). Second, the software automatically calculated the inclination of each vertebral body based on the upper end plate in the sagittal plane, and the centroids of the most cranial and most caudal posteriorly inclined vertebrae were annotated. Third, the right-angled triangle between these 2 points and the vertical was drawn, and 3 parameters were determined: (1) the PIT area was calculated with the basic formula formula for the area of a triangle, 0.5 × width × height, (2) the PIT length was calculated as the length of the hypotenuse, and (3) the PIT inclination was calculated as the angle between the hypotenuse and the vertical (Fig. 1). Finally, the pelvic incidenceand the length of the spine from T1 to S1 were measured, also in the sagittal plane, using the same Surgimap software. The T1-S1 spinal length was used to normalize the PIT area to account for absolute body size. This was done by calculating the ratio between the T1-S1 length of each patient and the study's population mean, with no distinction between sexes since the T1-S1 length was not significantly different between boys and girls. Using this ratio allowed the PIT area and the PIT length to be normalized for the patient's size but still retain their physical units (cm and cm 2).

### Two-dimensional tessellation by molecular tiles constructed from halogen-halogen and halogen-metal networks [^114L1voT]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Enlarged views of STM images (Fig. 4e–g) reveal the detailed structures around the tessellation vertices. In structure A, the polygons that cross at the interwoven vertex (black circle in Fig. 4e) consist of one red triangle, two parallelograms, and two blue triangles. The red triangle is perfectly aligned with one of the blue triangles (highlighted by dashed white lines), leading to 60° and 120° interior angles in the parallelogram. The angular sum of the polygons involved is therefore 360°, resulting in perfect tessellation. The tile representation in Fig. 4h highlights the interwoven vertex, which is consistent with the observations in Fig. 4e. According to the nomenclature defined by Grünbaum and Shephard, the lattice can be named using a set of integers in the form (n 1 α1. n 2 α2.···) to represent a vertex surrounded by polygons in a clockwise sequence; n i represents the number of sides on the polygon, and α i denotes the number of adjacent polygons of the same type. Since we have two triangle types with different side lengths, we differentiate them as 3 α and 3 β. Therefore, structure A can be described as tiling (3 α.4.3 β 2.4). Apparently, this packing geometry has a chiral structure. The STM images of two enantiomorphous domains are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Because structure B can be interconverted to structure A by exchanging red and blue lines, it can be described as tiling (3 α 2.4.3 β.4) (see tile representation in Fig. 4i). Structure C contains two types of interwoven vertex configurations (Fig. 4j). As shown in Fig. 4g, the vertex marked by the yellow circle has an arrangement identical to that in structure B (Fig. 4f), while the vertex marked by the black circle is the chiral isomer of that shown in structure A (Fig. 4e). This complex configuration can be expressed as tiling (3 α.4.3 β 2.4); (3 α 2.4.3 β.4).

### Is the middle between both halves? midpoint location and segment size estimation in neglect [^115hdkHF]. Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Line bisection errors in neglect are attributed to perceptual size distortions. In order to compare the two segments of the line to determine if they are equal, one might first estimate the location of a midpoint that defines the two line segments to be compared.

Objectives

The authors attempted to determine whether estimating a line's midpoint can be dissociated from comparing the two segments of this line, and if so, what the relative contribution of each of these tasks is to the perceptual bias in neglect.

Methods

The authors studied two patients with hemispatial neglect from right hemisphere lesions by asking them where bisection marks were placed on prebisected lines and whether the two adjacent line segments were equal.

Results

There was a stronger bias judging the position of the bisecting marks ("where" determination) than comparing the size of two adjacent line segments.

Conclusions

These results suggest that perceptual size distortion of line segments alone cannot explain the subjects' line bisection bias, but postperceptual deficits in "where" computations may better account for their errors locating the midpoint. "Where" determinations might require more attentional capacity, depend more heavily on viewer-centered allocation of attention, and be mediated by the right hemisphere's "where" dorsal stream. In contrast, comparing the length of two segments might be mediated by the left hemisphere's "what" ventral stream.

However, the amount of measured current in our experiment is much larger since we utilized the whole loop (the total loop area of ~7 × 10 6 nm 2 for a triangle barrier whose side length is 70 μm and height is 100 nm) compared with a single point tunnel junction (the total junction area of ~80 nm 2 or less, such as STM tips or bowtie-shaped nanogaps) used in most other studies.

In conclusion, we demonstrated a highly nonlinear light-matter interaction, taking advantage of the two-dimensional, lateral geometry of closed-loop quantum barriers, whose lack of macroscopic inversion symmetry plays a vital role in the ultrafast optoelectronics. The ring-shaped quantum barriers introduce a new control method for tunneling currents, further enriched by the femtosecond optical excitation at designated areas and time delays. By implementing the contour-integral concept and lateral symmetry into the conventional one-dimensional tunneling, we realized a multifunctional quantum device, providing a platform for optical transistors, ultra-high bandwidth communications and wireless energy conversion.

### Sacrococcygeal sinus angle: as a new anatomic landmark for the posterior approach of presacral lesions [^112D9C5Q]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

We have discussed the importance of sacrococcygeal sinus angle (SSA), which is a new anatomical landmark in the surgery of presacral lesions. Because of its anatomical structure, the sacrum limits the surgical exposure like a compact barrier for the posterior surgical approach. The main aim of this paper is to explain the anatomical description and clinical importance of SSA in the surgery of presacral lesions.

Methods

Three groups were designated, consisting of ten patients in each group, as early childhood (group 1), late childhood (group 2) and adulthood (group 3). Patients were selected randomly. The degree of SSA measurement was performed between the line tangent to the anterior margin of the first sacral vertebra and the line from the promontorium to the tip of the coccyx. The measurement of SSA was performed on patients' lumbosacral magnetic resonance images. When the SSA forms a triangle via a parallel line starting from the inferior tip of the sacrum and running parallel to the ground, the area of the triangle also covers the field of view of the presacral region. In addition, the sacral region needed to be resected for maximum exposure is also within this area.

Results

The mean SSA was measured to be 53.9 ± 11.4° in group 1, 77.8 ± 11.2° in group 2 and 74.5 ± 12.5° in group 3. Intergroup comparisons revealed a significant difference between group 1 and the other two groups statistically. It was found that the SSA was 20° less in group 1 as compared to the other age groups (p = 0.0005). The area of a triangle is calculated using the sine area formula, and according to this formula the area of a triangle increases when the degree of the angle increases, thus comprising larger part of the sacrum. This condition requires more and wide sacral resection to obtain maximum exposure in the presacral zone.

Conclusions

We have observed that the SSA is significantly smaller during early childhood compared with the other age groups. This feature provides an anatomical superiority in this age group for the posterior approach in the surgical treatment of presacral masses.

### A model for extra-axonal diffusion spectra with frequency-dependent restriction [^114wj6Lx]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

METHODS

Monte Carlo Simulations

This model was applied to the periodically and randomly packed cylinders illustrated in Figure 4. Periodically packed cylinders were chosen for ease of relating model parameters to the cylinder geometry (packing type, cylinder radius, and cylinder separation). Randomly packed cylinders were chosen to approximate axon bundles and test the applicability of this model with more realistic but complex geometries.

Figure 4

Pore boundaries are indicated by straight lines.

We conducted extensive Monte Carlo simulations to define the ground truth for diffusion spectra over a range of geometries surrounding different packings of cylinders. MR signal attenuation was simulated in Camino, for the geometries depicted in Figure 4.

For square and hexagonally packed cylinders, the various environments were explored by varying the cylinder radii and the packing density (specified by p). The cylinder radii were chosen to yield a useful range of EAS cross-sectional areas (EAS areas) under the abutting case. That is, the cylinder radii were chosen such that abutting EAS areas had specific target radii. The value ofreflects the EAS area under the tightest possible packing.is related tofor square and hexagonally cylinders asrespectively. All combinations of{0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5} µm and{1.00, 1.03, 1.06, 1.09, 1.12, 1.25, 1.50, 2.00} were simulated.

### Voxel volume overlap: voxel-size sensitive indicators of subject motion in functional MRI [^115UX3Gh]. Human Brain Mapping (2025). Medium credibility.

Algorithmic implementation: Comparing the moved cube to the reference cube was achieved as follows: each reference cube is described by six planes, constituting inequality constraints. Each plane is defined by one point on each surface and a corresponding norm vector, defining "inside" (and consecutively, of course, "outside"), establishing a set of six cutting planes. The reference cube is then moved, using the rigid‐body parameters from the realignment procedure. This creates the moved cube described by its eight (moved) corners and their connections, which again are vectors. The intersection of these vectors with a given cutting plane can be calculated using linear interpolation, resulting in a new set of (cut) vectors, jointly defining a new (cut) surface. The iterative application of all six cutting planes will remove all parts of the moved cube that are "outside" of the reference voxel's boundaries. The coordinates of the remaining shape can then be used to generate a convex 3D shape using Delauney triangulation. As rotations are involved, the shape may be irregular, but it is a polygon, and every polygon can be triangulated (de Berg et al.). This triangulation will yield a set of tetrahedra whose (sum of) volumes can be calculated. The volume of this remnant of the moved cube can then finally be related to the volume of the reference cube.

Insertion Procedure

To help make sure the implant is inserted just under the skin, the healthcare professionals should be positioned to see the advancement of the needle by viewing the applicator from the side and not from above the arm. From the side view, the insertion site and the movement of the needle just under the skin can be clearly visualized.

For illustrative purposes, Figures depict the left inner arm.

Step 1.	Have the woman lie on her back on the examination table with her non-dominant arm flexed at the elbow and externally rotated so that her hand is underneath her head (or as close as possible) (Figure 1).

Step 2.	Identify the insertion site, which is at the inner side of the non-dominant upper arm. The insertion site is overlying the triceps muscle about 8–10 cm (3–4 inches) from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and 3–5 cm (1.25–2 inches) posterior to (below) the sulcus (groove) between the biceps and triceps muscles (Figures 2a, 2b and 2c). This location is intended to avoid the large blood vessels and nerves lying within and surrounding the sulcus. If it is not possible to insert the implant in this location (e.g., in women with thin arms), it should be inserted as far posterior from the sulcus as possible. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]

### Prevention of drowning [^113auBJW]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Residential pool fencing — effectiveness and implementation — reports that 4-sided fencing that isolates the pool from the house and yard was superior to 3-sided fencing, with "an odds ratio of 0.17 (95% CI: 0.07–0.44)". In an Australian study, 3-sided fencing had higher drowning risk than 4-sided fencing with "(incidence rate ratio, 1.78; 95% CI: 1.40–1.79)". An Australian inspection program "raised the rate of compliance with pool fencing laws from approximately 50% to 97%", and "in the 5 years after enactment of legislation to improve the effectiveness of pool fencing, the number of private swimming pool drowning deaths halved". Design considerations note that "chain-link fences were easily scaled by children, whereas ornamental iron bar fences proved more difficult to climb", and the text states "Fences should be at least 4 feet high, and no opening under the fence should be more than 4 inches (some building codes require a 5-foot fence…)".

### Endoscopic mucoplasty for benign esophageal strictures (multiple schatzki rings) [^111DN7GD]. VideoGIE (2023). Medium credibility.

Procedure

Endoscopic Mucoplasty

The procedure was carried out using a single-channel therapeutic endoscope (GIF-H290T; Olympus Corp, Tokyo, Japan) with a super-soft hood (Space Adjuster; TOP Corp, Tokyo, Japan) as a distal attachment. A longitudinal mucosal incision was made at the 2-cm proximal side from the area of stenosis using a triangle-tip knife with a water jet function (Olympus Corp) to create a submucosal tunnel. The tunnel was extended beyond the area of stenosis, 2 cm distally from the GEJ on the gastric side. The submucosal tunneling method was used to properly evaluate the depth of stricture involvement. No involvement of the esophageal muscle layer was identified. Moreover, the tunneling method enabled a sufficient longitudinal incision with a minimal transverse incision, which was easier for defect closure. A mucosal incision was performed and extended in the longitudinal direction from the initial mucosal entry to the end of the submucosal tunnel. To prevent restenosis, the mucosal defect was approximated and closed in a horizontal, short-axis direction with purse-string suture techniques using "loop 9"and "loop 10"(Fig. 3; Video 1, available online at). This closure prevented restenosis by pulling the esophageal mucosa toward the stomach, which led to stretching and widening of the distal lumen.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^116VTxRM]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Simulations with Simplified Lesion Geometries and Growth Fields

Figure 2 illustrates a hierarchy of simplified, simulated lesion geometries and growths whose rows are arranged according to focality and whose columns are arranged according to a subjective complexity of lesion geometry and growth pattern. All lesions of Figure 2 were constructed to correspond to Δ t = 1 year follow-up intervals to have equal baseline areas of A (t b) = 6 mm 2 and to have equal length-type growth rates of Λ = 0.1 mm/year, the latter of which approximately corresponds to the reported mean of the 1-year perimeter adjusted growth rates of the AREDS dataset. Mathematical specifications of the lesion geometries and growth fields are given in Appendix 5. Using the terminology of Table 1, configurations 1 through 3 represent a progression of geometric complexity, moving from a circle (configuration 1) to an ellipse (configuration 2) to a notched shape (configuration 3). Relevant to growth rate estimation, configurations 1 and 2 both are convex shapes, and therefore isotropic growth never results in intrafocus merging (Appendix 3); however, configuration 2 is noncircular (i.e. has a circularity index of < 1), and therefore results in errors when assessed using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 2). Configuration 3 has a nonconvex geometry, and therefore, lesion growth can lead to intrafocus merging, which has the effect of censoring GA growth, making growth estimation ill-posed for any metric (Appendix 3). Compared with configurations 1 through 3, configuration 4 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, which causes the baseline circular lesion to grow into a more complex, nonconvex geometry. In the second row, although the baseline lesion shapes are all circular, bifocality results in estimation errors when using square-root-transformed metrics (equation 3). Configurations 5 and 6 correspond to different distributions of lesion area between the foci. Configuration 7 corresponds to an anisotropic growth field, constructed so that the lesion growth rate of each lesion focus is constant, but with the rate of the top left lesion being half that of the bottom right lesion. Finally, unlike configurations 5 through 7, configuration 8 involves merging of the 2 lesion foci (i.e. interfoci merging). Evaluations of metric accuracy were performed by scaling the growth fields (but not the baseline lesion geometries) so as to vary Λ through a range of 0.05 to 0.7 mm/year (Appendix 5).

Left atrial (LA) volume measurement methodology — when assessing LA size and remodeling, the measurement of LA volume is recommended; LA volume should be measured using the disk summation algorithm with LA endocardial borders traced in both apical four- and two-chamber views, while single-plane methods are not recommended for routine use though they can be used when both-view planimetry is difficult, and single-plane apical four-chamber indexed volumes are typically 1 to 2 mL/m2 smaller than apical two-chamber values; a biplane area–length calculation is an alternative.

### Grid-like entorhinal representation of an abstract value space during prospective decision making [^116GcEWT]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Each trial consisted of an observation phase and an active choice. During the observation phase, participants viewed the two options along with their changing values over a sequence of time points (TP). Pictures of the two options were displayed on the left and right sides of the screen, with their associated current values indicated by numbers underneath. Across time points, two aspects changed: First, which of the two value-congruent stimuli of a given option was shown on the screen alternated each time point. Participants were instructed that when a stimulus and its current value were shown on the screen, the other stimulus of the pair currently yielded the same value. Secondly, the values of the two latent options changed over time points. Participants were instructed to carefully track these changes to be able to predict the options' values at the next time point. Each time point was presented for 2.5 s and was directly followed by the next time point. During the observation phase (initial time points), each option stayed on the same side of the screen to facilitate fast tracking of the changes. However, across trials the sides of the options were counterbalanced and distributed randomly. After 3–5 observed time points, only two pictures were presented and participants were asked to choose the option with the higher value at this future time point (choice time point). At the choice time point, the sides of the pictures on the screen (left / right) were random to prevent pure side-value associations. Participants were asked to indicate their choice by pressing the left or the right button on an MRI-compatible button box. Participants were given a maximum of 3 s to respond. After their choice (or the timeout), a fixation cross was presented at the center of the screen for an inter-stimulus interval sampled from a truncated exponential distribution (min = 3 s, max = 8 s, mu = 4 s, sampled mean = 4.1 s). Afterwards, a feedback screen was presented for 2.5 s, showing the pictures and their actual values at the choice time point. The value of the chosen option was highlighted in yellow. Lastly, a fixation cross was presented at the center of the screen for an inter-trial interval sampled from a truncated exponential distribution (min = 3 s, max = 8 s, mu = 4 s, sampled mean = 4.1 s).

### Extended middle fossa approach: quantitative analysis of petroclival exposure and surgical freedom as a function of successive temporal bone removal by using frameless stereotaxy [^111pbpgT]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Object

Conventional wisdom regarding skull base surgery says that more extensive bone removal equals greater exposure. Few researchers have quantitatively examined this assertion, however. In this study the authors used a frameless stereotactic system to measure quantitatively the area of petroclival exposure and surgical freedom for manipulation of instruments with successive steps of temporal bone removal.

Methods

With the aid of high-power magnification and a high-speed drill, 12 cadaveric specimens were dissected in four predetermined, successive bone removal steps: 1) removal of the Kawase triangle; 2) removal of the Glasscock triangle; 3) removal of the cochlea together with skeletonization of the anterior internal auditory canal; and 4) inferior displacement of the zygoma. Step 1 offered 62 ± 43 mm2 of exposed petroclival area, with 84 ± 69 mm2 of surgical freedom; Step 2, 61 ± 22 and 76 ± 58 mm2; Step 3, 128 ± 47 and 109 ± 87 mm2; and Step 4, 135 ± 38 and 102 ± 69 mm2, respectively.

Conclusions

The middle fossa approach provided a means surgically to expose the petroclival area. When examined quantitatively by using a frameless stereotactic device, the authors determined that the removal of the cochlea and skeletonization of the anterior internal auditory canal (Step 3) provided the most significant increase in both exposure and surgical freedom. Removal of the zygoma improved neither exposure nor surgical freedom.
