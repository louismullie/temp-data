## Question

Did the EQUILIBRA trial identify safety signals for florimab in asthma?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether the EQUILIBRA trial identified safety signals for florimab in asthma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the provided documents mention EQUILIBRA or florimab. Then, I should verify if there are plausible synonyms, misspellings, or code names that could map to these terms. Next, I'll assess the scope of the provided materials to ensure I'm not missing an indirect reference. Finally, I'll contextualize by summarizing safety findings from analogous asthma biologics and advise on source verification.

> Let me first confirm whether EQUILIBRA appears anywhere in the supplied literature set. I carefully scanned the document titles and content, and I do not see any mention of a trial named EQUILIBRA; the asthma trials repeatedly referenced include NAVIGATOR and DESTINATION for tezepelumab, a phase 3 Asia-Pacific dupilumab study, and SWIFT-1 for depemokimab, none of which use the EQUILIBRA name.

> Wait, let me verify the drug name next. I need to check whether "florimab" is cited or if there is a reasonable alias or INN that matches it in the provided set. I do not find "florimab" in any of the documents; instead, the texts discuss established or investigational biologics such as dupilumab, omalizumab, tezepelumab, benralizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and IL-33 pathway inhibitors, none of which are labeled as florimab in these sources.

> Hold on, I should verify potential indirect references or near-miss names. Let me consider whether "florimab" might be a placeholder, a developmental code, or a typographical variant of agents like lebrikizumab or tralokinumab (both anti–IL-13), or of trials with name-based branding like NAVIGATOR or DESTINATION. I should double-check those IL-13 programs: lebrikizumab and tralokinumab are discussed here, but neither ties to the EQUILIBRA trial name, and neither is referred to as "florimab" in these materials, which makes an indirect match unlikely based on the provided context [^111B2Bo2] [^114Wd5m4].

> I will now examine the scope of the included documents to ensure I'm not missing contextual safety information that could be misconstrued as pertaining to EQUILIBRA. The set focuses on approved and advanced biologics in asthma and their safety profiles, repeatedly noting class-typical events such as injection-site reactions for dupilumab, and generally similar overall adverse event rates versus placebo for anti–IL-5 agents, while also highlighting specific safety concerns explored for omalizumab in postmarketing evaluations; none of these sections mention EQUILIBRA or florimab specifically [^115Ga495] [^115ro4fM] [^113qF22q] [^116pkw2w].

> Hmm, wait a minute — am I overlooking any trial narrative that might hint at an unnamed program with a different branding? NAVIGATOR's report states no safety signals identified in clinical studies to date for tezepelumab, and DESTINATION was designed to evaluate long-term safety, but again, neither text includes EQUILIBRA, suggesting that attributing their safety findings to EQUILIBRA would be an unjustified leap from the available evidence here.

> Given all that, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. Based on the documents provided, there is no information about a trial called EQUILIBRA or a drug named florimab; therefore, I cannot determine whether EQUILIBRA identified safety signals for florimab from this dataset alone. To answer the question definitively, I would need primary sources specific to florimab and EQUILIBRA, such as a ClinicalTrials.gov record, a peer-reviewed publication, or conference abstracts for that program, which are not included here.

> But wait, what if the intent is to infer from analogous biologics while we seek the primary source? If florimab is purported to be an asthma biologic, analogous programs often report overall AE rates similar to placebo with class-typical signals like injection-site reactions for dupilumab and no consistent increase in serious adverse events for anti–IL-5 agents; however, omalizumab's long-term safety literature underscores dedicated surveillance of anaphylaxis, malignancy, cardiovascular events, and infections, emphasizing that class and agent-specific nuances matter and cannot be assumed for an unverified agent like florimab without direct data [^115Ga495] [^113qF22q] [^111ksJCu] [^116pkw2w].

> Next, I should review a practical verification path. I recommend confirming the exact spelling of "florimab", checking for an INN or developmental code, and obtaining a registry identifier (e.g. NCT number) for EQUILIBRA; in parallel, cross-referencing with conference proceedings or sponsor pipelines will help triangulate the dataset. In the interim, if you need safety context for trials in severe asthma, NAVIGATOR and DESTINATION provide representative safety frameworks for tezepelumab programs that you can use as comparators while you locate florimab-specific sources [^114enYUo] [^115af9M6].

I can't find an asthma trial named "EQUILIBRA" or a drug called "florimab" in the available literature. Please **clarify the exact trial name** (e.g. EQUILIBRIUM, EQUATOR, or another) and the drug's correct name or sponsor (e.g. a known biologic such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab, or tezepelumab).

If you meant an established asthma biologic, I can **summarize its safety signals** from the literature. For example:

- **Benralizumab (FASENRA)**: generally well tolerated [^115ro4fM]; no increased overall adverse events vs placebo in meta-analyses [^113qF22q]; FDA labeling notes hypersensitivity, injection-site reactions, and infections [^113qF22q].
- **Omalizumab (Xolair)**: generally well tolerated; postmarketing concerns include [^116pkw2w] rare anaphylaxis, malignancy, cardiovascular events, and infections.
- **Dupilumab**: safety similar to placebo in trials [^115Ga495]; injection-site reactions more common [^115Ga495].
- **Tezepelumab**: no safety signals identified in PATHWAY/NAVIGATOR [^114enYUo]; long-term safety under evaluation in DESTINATION [^115af9M6].

Once you **confirm the exact trial and drug**, I'll provide a precise answer.

### Dupilumab efficacy and safety in patients with persistent asthma: Asia-Pacific region [^115Ga495]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2025). High credibility.

The prevalence of asthma is increasing in the Asia-Pacific region, with China and India accounting for more than 35% of the world's population. These countries are often underrepresented in clinical studies. This phase 3 study (NCT03782532) evaluated the efficacy and safety of dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-4/13 signaling, in patients with persistent asthma from China and India.

- **Methods**: Patients aged 12 years and older were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 200 mg of dupilumab or a matched placebo every two weeks for 24 weeks. The primary analysis population included patients with blood eosinophils ≥ 150 cells/μL or fractional exhaled nitric oxide ≥ 25 parts per billion, without maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS). For the OCS maintenance population, the dupilumab dosage was 300 mg OCS.

- **Primary endpoint**: The primary endpoint was the change from baseline to week 12 in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁). Secondary endpoints included the change from baseline to week 24 in the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5/7) scores, the annualized severe exacerbation rate, and safety.

- **Results**: In the primary analysis population (n = 414), the change in FEV₁ by week 12 was significantly greater for dupilumab compared to placebo (least squares mean difference: 0.31 L [95% CI: 0.23–0.39]; p < 0.0001). At week 24, greater reductions in ACQ-5 score were observed for dupilumab versus placebo (least squares mean difference: -0.20 [95% CI: -0.35 to -0.05]; p = 0.0097). Dupilumab reduced the risk of severe exacerbation by 62% compared to placebo during the treatment period (relative risk: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.21–0.70]; nominal p = 0.002). Safety profiles were similar between treatment arms; however, injection-site reactions were more common with dupilumab treatment (5.0%) compared to placebo.

### Omalizumab safety concerns [^116pkw2w]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2025). High credibility.

IgE and mast cells play key roles in the pathophysiology of allergic diseases. In 2003, omalizumab was the first anti-IgE mAb licensed in the United States when initially US Food and Drug Administration-approved for the treatment of allergic asthma. Since that time, the number of US Food and Drug Administration-approved indications for treatment with omalizumab has grown to include chronic spontaneous urticaria, chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, and food allergy.

Although omalizumab is generally considered relatively safe and well tolerated, a number of safety concerns have been raised since its initial approval. These concerns focus on specific adverse events of interest, including anaphylaxis, pregnancy, malignancy, cardiovascular events, and infections. For each of these issues, data from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance have been evaluated extensively.

In this review, we examine these safety data, provide context for safety and risk assessments, and summarize a safety profile for each of the adverse events of interest. In doing so, we aim to provide a resource for shared decision-making when treatment with omalizumab is being considered.

### Destination: A phase 3, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of tezepelumab in adults and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma [^115af9M6]. Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

In the DESTINATION study, investigators have the opportunity to down-titrate their patients' background asthma medication (in accordance with Global Initiative for Asthma 2018 guidelines) if their asthma symptoms are well controlled and their lung function is stable for at least three months. Investigators may also up-titrate background medication if their patients' asthma symptoms are not well controlled and their lung function is unstable. It is hypothesized that continued treatment with tezepelumab may allow patients to reduce their use of prescribed controller therapies or rescue medication. This approach has also been taken in clinical studies with other biologics in patients with severe asthma.

The primary objective of DESTINATION is to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of tezepelumab; the dosage (210 mg Q4W SC) is the same as that given in the predecessor studies. Per standard practice, safety and tolerability will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs), adverse events of special interest (AESIs), and serious adverse events (SAEs). The secondary endpoint will assess the effect of tezepelumab on asthma exacerbations using the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER), a well-accepted efficacy measure for studies of patients with severe asthma. Indeed, the benefits of tezepelumab compared with placebo were clearly demonstrated using this endpoint in the phase 2b PATHWAY study. DESTINATION aims to provide valuable information about the long-term safety of tezepelumab, its effect after cessation of treatment, and its clinical effect on exacerbations in patients with severe, uncontrolled asthma.

### Efficacy and safety of benralizumab for eosinophilic asthma: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115ro4fM]. The Journal of Asthma (2018). High credibility.

Benralizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the α chain of the IL-5 receptor (IL-5Rα) and is currently being assessed in clinical trials for asthma control. Our systematic review and meta-analysis intend to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of benralizumab in patients with eosinophilic asthma.

- **Data sources and extraction**: Literature searches of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were performed to identify randomized controlled trials of benralizumab and clinic outcomes in asthmatics.

- **Results**: In total, 7 articles with 2,321 subjects met our inclusion criteria. From this pooled analysis, we found that benralizumab significantly reduces exacerbations (RR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.52–0.76, p < 0.00001; I² = 52%, p = 0.06) compared to placebo in eosinophilic asthma. There was no statistical trend for improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second or asthma control indices such as Quality of Life Assessment (AQLQ) and Asthma Control Questionnaire score in benralizumab-treated patients. In addition, safety data indicated that benralizumab administration resulted in no increasing incidence of adverse events and was well tolerated (RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.95–1.05, p = 0.96; I² = 40%, p = 0.13).

These results demonstrate the efficacy and safety of benralizumab for asthma patients with severe or uncontrolled symptoms and elevated eosinophils and provide support for benralizumab as an ideal option to treat asthma in this patient population.

### Fasenra [^112w6Bpr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Fasenra is an interleukin-5 receptor alpha-directed cytolytic monoclonal antibody (IgG1, kappa) indicated for the add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4), Clinical Studies (14.1)].

- **Asthma**: Fasenra is indicated for add-on maintenance treatment of adult and pediatric patients aged 6 years and older with severe asthma and an eosinophilic phenotype. It is not indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

- **Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)**: Fasenra is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Limitations of Use: Fasenra is not for the relief of acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus.

### Navigator: A phase 3 multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezepelumab in adults and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma [^114enYUo]. Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks TSLP from interacting with its heterodimeric receptor, resulting in the inhibition of multiple downstream inflammatory pathways. The phase 2b PATHWAY study demonstrated that blocking TSLP with tezepelumab may be an effective strategy for the treatment of severe, uncontrolled asthma, with reductions in exacerbations observed irrespective of baseline inflammation status. In clinical studies at the time of writing, which have included healthy individuals, patients with asthma, and patients with atopic dermatitis, tezepelumab has been well tolerated with no safety signals identified.

NAVIGATOR aims to further investigate the effect of tezepelumab on exacerbations and build on findings from the PATHWAY study. It also evaluates the effect of tezepelumab on lung function, asthma control, and HRQoL in adults and adolescents with severe, uncontrolled asthma who were receiving medium- to high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without OCS, in addition to evaluating its safety in this patient population. NAVIGATOR will also evaluate the effect of treatment with tezepelumab in patients without an eosinophilic phenotype. The target number of patients for NAVIGATOR (N = 1060) was achieved, making it the largest study in the tezepelumab phase 3 program and the largest clinical study of tezepelumab in severe asthma at the time of writing. This pivotal study will allow the benefit-risk profile of tezepelumab in the treatment of asthma to be characterized further, providing greater understanding.

### A rational approach to compare and select biologic therapeutics in asthma [^112RyVxo]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Objective: To review key literature on asthma biologic therapeutics, both currently available and under investigation, to inform a rational approach for selecting biologics for managing individuals with severe asthma through precision medicine.

Data sources: We used the PubMed database to review literature on biologic therapeutics in asthma.

Study selections: We included published randomized control trials and real-world studies on biologic therapeutics, available in English, up to September 2021.

Results: An increased understanding of asthma endotypes and the roles of various inflammatory mechanisms has led to the development of therapeutic agents that inhibit specific cytokines or immune pathways. Currently, available biologic therapeutics target type 2-high asthma. Grouped by mechanisms of action, there are three types: (1) anti-immunoglobulin E, (2) anti-interleukin (IL)-5 or IL-5 receptor, and (3) anti-IL-4 receptor α. Various potential future biologic therapeutics are also under investigation. Although there remains a paucity of data regarding prospective direct head-to-head comparisons of biologic therapeutics in asthma, some retrospective and indirect comparison data are available.

Conclusion: Precision medicine guides the selection of biologic therapeutics along with shared decision-making. Biomarkers, although not comprehensive, allow for approximations of likely mechanisms. The use of biomarkers, alongside historical levels and trends, in addition to consideration of key clinical characteristics and comorbidities, can greatly aid in guiding biologic selection.

### The new biologic drugs: Which children with asthma should get what [^112vLMzf]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2024). Low credibility.

Asthma affects one in 11 children in the UK, a country with one of the highest prevalences of this condition in Europe. This disease burden has not significantly changed over the last two decades, and the UK has some of the worst asthma outcomes, including childhood asthma deaths, in Europe. Asthma was classically thought to be variable airflow obstruction, caused by inflammation and bronchial hyper-responsiveness. However, more evidence is emerging that asthma is a heterogeneous condition.

Management of severe asthma is challenging, particularly since the evidence base for treatment is largely extrapolated from teenagers and adults with severe asthma, which is recognized to have a different pathophysiology compared to school-aged asthma. Evidence has also emerged that children with mild or moderate asthma may have a different pathophysiology than those with severe asthma. It is estimated that around 2%–5% of children with school-aged asthma have problematic severe asthma (PSA), with poor symptom control despite being prescribed maximum asthma therapy. It is crucial to recognize that children with PSA account for half of the healthcare costs for childhood asthma and are at high risk of asthma-related deaths. Therefore, all children with severe asthma must be referred to a severe asthma specialist center.

### IL-33 receptor inhibition in subjects with uncontrolled asthma: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^113NjNdV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). Low credibility.

The results of this phase IIA study suggest that treatment with GSK3772847 may benefit patients with uncontrolled asthma and is generally tolerable. However, because restrictive LoAC criteria led to many participants discontinuing study treatment, future studies should investigate prevention of exacerbations as the primary endpoint to confirm these preliminary positive results and should also evaluate biomarkers that may identify patients with asthma who will benefit from anti–IL-33 treatment with GSK3772847.

- **Clinical implications**: This phase IIA proof-of-concept study demonstrates that subjects with uncontrolled asthma may benefit from GSK37772847, a human mAb that binds to the IL33R, thereby inhibiting IL-33 signaling.

### A phase 1 study evaluating the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of repeat dosing with a human IL-13 antibody (CAT-354) in subjects with asthma [^116iwox6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

It was planned that eight subjects per dose group were to be evaluated for CAT-354. In addition, it was planned that a minimal number of subjects (6 in total) were to be allocated to placebo as a control for the assessment of tolerability, giving an overall ratio of 4:1 active:control. Cohorts of this size are considered adequate to provide the information required to fulfill the objectives of the study while exposing a minimum number of subjects to investigational product.

All safety and tolerability assessments were based on the safety population, defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study material. No formal statistical testing was performed on safety data due to the exploratory nature of the study. The pharmacokinetic population was defined as all subjects in the safety population for whom sufficient post-dose blood samples were taken to estimate the observed maximum concentration (C max) and was used for pharmacokinetic parameter estimates. The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated for each subject using WinNonlin software (Pharsight Corporation, California, version 5). Non-compartmental analysis was performed to generate parameter estimates using model 202 (intravenous infusion). The elimination phase volume of distribution (Vd) was calculated from clearance and the elimination rate constant.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of reslizumab in patients with eosinophilic asthma [^1132ov4R]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

In placebo-controlled trials, reslizumab, an anti-IL-5 monoclonal antibody, significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and improved lung function and asthma control in patients with eosinophilic asthma.

- **Objective**: This open-label extension study evaluated the safety and efficacy of reslizumab for up to 24 months.

- **Methods**: After participation in one of three placebo-controlled, phase III trials for moderate-to-severe eosinophilic asthma, patients received reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks for up to 24 months. Adverse events (AEs), lung function, and patient-reported asthma control were evaluated.

- **Results**: In the open-label extension, 1,051 patients received at least one reslizumab dose (480 reslizumab-naïve, 571 reslizumab-experienced). Median (range) exposure was 319 (36–840) days for reslizumab-naïve and 343 (36–863) days for reslizumab-experienced patients. Continuous exposure, including during the placebo-controlled studies, was at least 12 months for 740 patients and at least 24 months for 249 patients. The most common AEs were worsening of asthma and nasopharyngitis. Serious AEs affected 78 of 1,051 (7%) patients; 18 of 1,051 (2%) discontinued treatment because of AEs, and there were three deaths (all non-treatment-related). Fifteen adult patients (15 of 1,023; 1%) had malignancies of diverse tissue types. Reslizumab-experienced patients maintained improved lung function and asthma control; reslizumab-naïve patients showed improvements in these measures throughout open-label treatment. Blood eosinophil counts appeared to be returning to baseline after reslizumab discontinuation.

### How to assess effectiveness of biologics for asthma and what steps to take when there is not benefit [^113r6ThU]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Low credibility.

Five biologic medications are approved in the United States for the treatment of asthma that is not well controlled with other therapies. All target asthma with elevated type 2 inflammatory markers, such as elevated eosinophils, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, or total and specific IgE. Asthma severity, phenotype, age, biomarkers, treatment goals/outcomes, comorbid conditions, safety, and cost should all help guide the initial biologic choice. In addition, a shared decision-making process with the patient is needed to optimize adherence, with special attention to patient preference regarding outcomes, safety concerns, and medication administration options.

After a biologic agent is initiated, sufficient time is needed to monitor efficacy and response. For patients who do not respond favorably, patient-, disease-, and medication-related factors should be considered and remedied if possible. Persistent suboptimal responders necessitate a reexamination of asthma phenotype, biomarkers, and the suspected immune response pathways. For some patients, a change in biologic therapy or other therapeutic options may be warranted.

In this review, we examine the clinical approach for choosing an initial biologic for the treatment of asthma, the assessment of response to biologics, and the process of troubleshooting and adjusting biologic treatment for those patients with suboptimal responses.

### Biologics in severe asthma: A pragmatic approach for choosing the right treatment for the right patient [^112WzhtR]. Respiratory Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The development of monoclonal antibody therapies targeting specific components of the pathways relevant to asthma pathophysiology has revolutionized the treatment of severe asthma in both adults and children, and helped to further unravel the heterogeneity of this disease. However, the availability of multiple agents, often with overlapping eligibility criteria, creates a need for pragmatic guidance for specialists undertaking the care of patients with severe asthma. In this review, we provide an overview of the data supporting the clinical efficacy of biologics in distinct asthma phenotypes/endotypes.

- **Role of biomarkers and treatable traits**: We focus on the role of biomarkers and treatable traits, including comorbidities, in the choice of asthma biologics. We highlight which treatments have been demonstrated to be steroid sparing in corticosteroid-dependent asthma, and provide practical guidance that can drive shared decision-making on treatment choice with patients.

In addition, we summarize what is known at the time of writing regarding the long-term safety of these drugs and discuss future directions in biologics research.

### Biomarker-guided withdrawal of inhaled corticosteroids in asthma patients with a non-T2 inflammatory phenotype - a randomized controlled trial study protocol [^113p1HDW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Because of the need for high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe asthma, the adverse effect profile of corticosteroids is a specific issue for these patients. Therefore, to reduce the burden of corticosteroids, non-steroid agents targeting asthmatic inflammation in severe asthma have been developed over the past decades. A panel of biological therapies has thus been approved for severe eosinophilic or allergic asthma, whereas no biological treatment option is available to specifically target patients with non-T2 disease.

Tezepelumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the upstream asthma inflammatory mediator thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), is a potential treatment option for severe non-T2 asthma patients. In a phase II study, tezepelumab reduced exacerbation rates by up to 71% compared to placebo, independently of phenotype. Although tezepelumab is approved for the treatment of severe asthma regardless of inflammatory phenotype, recent studies have shown that tezepelumab is more beneficial in T2 asthma than non-T2 asthma. This may limit the advantages of tezepelumab in non-T2 asthma patients.

Another pharmacological treatment option for patients with more severe non-T2 asthma includes low-dose azithromycin, which has been shown to reduce exacerbation rates in both T2 and non-T2 patients, though with a slight tendency towards being more effective in T2 patients. In an earlier study, however, azithromycin was shown to be efficacious in reducing exacerbations only in non-T2 asthma patients, rendering azithromycin a potential treatment option for non-T2 asthma.

### Fasenra [^111fR2zB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Asthma

	- Of the total number of patients in asthma clinical trials of benralizumab, 13% (n = 320) were 65 and over, while 0.4% (n = 9) were 75 and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

- **EGPA**:

	- Of the 70 patients with EGPA exposed to FASENRA, a total of 13 (19%) were 65 years or older. Clinical studies of FASENRA for EGPA did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects.

### Qvar Redihaler [^115az6Go]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Qvar Redihaler were evaluated in 1,858 patients with asthma. The development program included two confirmatory trials of 12 weeks duration and one confirmatory trial of 6 weeks duration in patients 12 years of age and older, and one confirmatory trial of 12 weeks duration in patients 4 to 11 years of age. The efficacy of Qvar Redihaler is based primarily on the confirmatory trials described below.

- **Trials in the maintenance treatment of asthma**: Two confirmatory clinical trials were conducted comparing Qvar Redihaler with placebo in adult and adolescent patients with persistent asthma (Trial 1 and Trial 2).

	- **Adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older**:

		- **Trial 1 (NCT02040779)**: This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, 12-week, efficacy and safety trial compared Qvar Redihaler 40 and 80 mcg given as one inhalation twice daily with placebo in adult and adolescent patients with persistent symptomatic asthma despite low-dose inhaled corticosteroid or non-corticosteroid asthma therapy. Patients aged 12 years and older who met the entry criteria, including FEV140–85 percent of predicted normal and reversible bronchoconstriction of 15% with short-acting inhaled beta-agonist, entered a 14–21 day run-in period. A total of 270 patients (104 previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids) who met all the randomization criteria, including asthma symptoms and rescue medication use, were discontinued from asthma maintenance medication and randomized equally to treatment with Qvar Redihaler 80 mcg/day, Qvar Redihaler 160 mcg/day.

### Treating asthma in the time of COVID [^111u599K]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). High credibility.

The Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma clinical trials network is actively assessing novel treatments for severe asthma during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and has needed to adapt to various clinical dilemmas posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Pharmacologic interactions between established asthma therapies and novel drug interventions for COVID-19 infection, including antivirals, biologics, and vaccines, have emerged as a critical and unanticipated issue in the clinical care of asthma.

In particular, impaired metabolism of some long-acting beta-2 agonists by the cytochrome P4503A4 enzyme in the setting of antiviral treatment using ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir (NVM/r, brand name Paxlovid) may increase the risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Although available data have documented the potential for such interactions, these issues are largely unappreciated by clinicians who treat asthma or those dispensing COVID-19 interventions in patients who happen to have asthma.

Because these drug-drug interactions have not previously been relevant to patient care, clinicians have had no guidance on management strategies to reduce potentially serious interactions between treatments for asthma and COVID-19. The Precision Interventions for Severe and/or Exacerbation-Prone Asthma network considered the available literature and product information and herein shares our considerations and plans for treating asthma within the context of these novel COVID-19-related therapies.

### Adverse events of anti-IL-5 drugs in patients with eosinophilic asthma: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence-based assessments [^113qF22q]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Anti-IL-5 drugs (mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab), which are also grouped within the scope of respiratory biologic treatments and recommended by the BTS/SIGN British Guidelines for managing severe eosinophilic asthma, are now widely used clinically in Europe. Clinical trials have highlighted their efficacy, particularly in reducing sputum eosinophils and enhancing airway function. Mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab have maintained a consistent safety profile across nearly all randomized placebo-controlled trials, with adverse event (AE) rates similar to those in placebo groups.

The product inserts for mepolizumab and benralizumab list risks including headache, hypersensitivity reactions, infections, injection site reactions, and pyrexia. Reslizumab shares the risk of hypersensitivity reactions in common. Additionally, risks such as back pain, nasal congestion, abdominal pain, increased blood creatine phosphokinase, and myalgia are unique to either mepolizumab or reslizumab. While all targeting IL-5, these drugs exhibit unique yet overlapping safety profiles. Given their limited duration on the market, a comprehensive analysis of safety data from clinical trials and post-marketing experiences is essential. These anti-IL-5 drugs have not yet been used clinically for asthma treatment in China.

This study aims to elucidate the overall safety profile of anti-IL-5 treatments, highlight similarities and differences in their safety profiles, and identify potential novel safety signals to provide a more robust safety reference for future clinical use.

### Application of structured statistical analyses to identify a biomarker predictive of enhanced tralokinumab efficacy in phase III clinical trials for severe, uncontrolled asthma [^114Wd5m4]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Tralokinumab is an anti-interleukin (IL)-13 monoclonal antibody investigated for the treatment of severe, uncontrolled asthma in two Phase III clinical trials, STRATOS 1 and 2. The STRATOS 1 biomarker analysis plan was developed to identify biomarker(s) indicative of IL-13 activation likely to predict tralokinumab efficacy and define a population in which there was an enhanced treatment effect; this defined population was then tested in STRATOS 2.

- **Methods**: The biomarkers considered were blood eosinophil counts, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), serum dipeptidyl peptidase-4, serum periostin, and total serum immunoglobulin E. Tralokinumab efficacy was measured as the reduction in annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) compared with placebo (primary endpoint measure of STRATOS 1 and 2). The biomarker analysis plan included negative binomial and generalized additive models, and the Subgroup Identification Based on Differential Effect Search (SIDES) algorithm, supported by robustness and sensitivity checks. Effects on the key secondary endpoints of STRATOS 1 and 2, which included changes from baseline in standard measures of asthma outcomes, were also investigated. Prior to the STRATOS 1 read-out, numerous simulations of the methodology were performed with hypothetical data.

- **Results**: FeNO and periostin were identified as the only biomarkers potentially predictive of treatment effect, with cut-offs chosen by the SIDES algorithm of > 32.3 ppb and > 27.4 ng/ml, respectively. The FeNO > 32.3 ppb subgroup was associated with greater AAER reductions and improvements.

### Quadrupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid to prevent asthma exacerbations: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial [^112qU54p]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2009). High credibility.

Asthma exacerbations are unpredictable, disruptive, and frightening, thus making prevention crucial. We investigated whether a policy of quadrupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid, when asthma control starts to deteriorate, reduces asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids.

A total of 403 people with asthma were given a self-management plan and randomized to take an active or placebo corticosteroid inhaler in addition to their usual asthma treatment when their PEF fell by 15% on two consecutive days or by 30% on one day. The study inhalers provided a quadrupling or no change in corticosteroid dose.

Eighteen of 197 (9%) and 29 of 203 (14%) participants experienced an exacerbation of asthma requiring treatment with oral corticosteroids in the active and placebo groups, respectively, giving a risk ratio of 0.64 (95% confidence interval, 0.37–1.11, P = 0.11). Of the 94 participants who started the study inhaler, far fewer required treatment with oral corticosteroids in the active group compared to the placebo group: 12 of 56 (21%) in the active group and 19 of 38 (50%) in the placebo group, giving a risk ratio of 0.43 (95% confidence interval, 0.24–0.78, P = 0.004).

Although our primary outcome did not reach statistical significance, quadrupling the dose of inhaled corticosteroid when asthma control starts to deteriorate appears to reduce acute exacerbations of asthma and deserves further investigation. This clinical trial is registered with www.controlled-trials.com (ISRCTN 46018181).

### Response to omalizumab using patient enrichment criteria from trials of novel biologics in asthma [^114b7rCn]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) monoclonal antibody, is the first biologic therapy approved in the United States and European Union for the treatment of moderate to severe allergic asthma in patients sensitive to a perennial aeroallergen and aged ≥ 6 years. Because asthma is a heterogeneous disease, identifying predictors of response to omalizumab may facilitate a more precise approach to treatment. Recent studies suggest that clinical and biologic markers of asthma severity predict variations in response to biologic therapies for asthma treatment.

Our previous work from evaluations of omalizumab clinical trial data indicates that higher levels of type 2 (T2) asthma biomarkers, including fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), serum periostin, and blood eosinophil counts, predict a better response to omalizumab. Similar findings have been noted for other biologic agents recently approved for severe asthma. Studies of an anti-interleukin 5 (IL-5) agent for severe asthma demonstrate increased placebo-corrected reductions in asthma exacerbations among patients with high blood eosinophil counts and a history of multiple asthma exacerbations in the preceding year. However, they do not show clear benefits in asthma subpopulations without such exacerbation history or with lower blood eosinophil counts.

Furthermore, specific thresholds of blood eosinophil counts have been incorporated as inclusion criteria for treatment with other biologic agents.

- **Question 4**: Is there a safety signal in the chosen biomarker subgroup?

Adverse event (AE) reporting for the subgroups of FeNO ≥ 37 ppb and FeNO < 37 ppb were evaluated. Reporting rates of overall AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were similar for the two subgroups. Reporting rates of individual AEs were also similar for the two subgroups (data reported elsewhere).

### Benralizumab for patients with mild to moderate, persistent asthma (BISE): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial [^116m57fC]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2017). High credibility.

Benralizumab is a humanised, anti-interleukin 5 receptor α monoclonal antibody that directly and rapidly depletes eosinophils, reduces asthma exacerbations, and improves lung function for patients with severe eosinophilic asthma. The objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of benralizumab for patients with mild to moderate, persistent asthma.

- **Methods**: In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients aged 18–75 years, weighing at least 40 kg, and with a postbronchodilator reversibility in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of at least 12% at screening, from 52 clinical research centres in six countries. Patients were required to be receiving either low- to medium-dosage inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or low-dosage ICS plus long-acting β2 agonist fixed-combination therapy at screening. They needed to have a morning prebronchodilator FEV1 of more than 50% to 90% predicted at screening, and at least one of the following symptoms within the 7 days before randomisation: a daytime or night-time asthma symptom score of at least 1 for at least 2 days, rescue short-acting β2 agonist use for at least 2 days, or night-time awakenings due to asthma for at least one night. We converted patients' ICS treatments to 180 μg or 200 μg budesonide dry powder inhaler twice daily for the entire duration of the study using the approved dosages in the patients' respective countries and randomly allocated them (1:1; stratified by blood eosinophil count [< 300 cells per μL vs ≥ 300 cells per μL] and region [USA vs the rest of the world]).

### Nucala [^115kg1Ub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

A total of 711 patients with severe asthma were studied in the two confirmatory trials, Trials 2 and 3. In these trials, patients were required to have blood eosinophils of ≥ 150 cells/mcL at screening (within six weeks of dosing) or blood eosinophils of ≥ 300 cells/mcL within 12 months of enrollment. The screening blood eosinophils of ≥ 150 cells/mcL criterion was derived from exploratory analyses of data from Trial 1.

- **Trial 2**: This was a 32-week placebo- and active-controlled trial in patients with severe asthma, with a history of two or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of high-dose ICS plus additional controller(s) with or without OCS. Patients received mepolizumab 75 mg IV (n = 191), Nucala 100 mg (n = 194), or placebo (n = 191) once every four weeks for 32 weeks.

- **Trial 3**: This was a 24-week OCS-reduction trial in patients with severe asthma who required daily OCS in addition to the regular use of high-dose ICS plus additional controller(s) to maintain asthma control. Patients in Trial 3 were not required to have a history of exacerbations in the previous year. Patients received Nucala 100 mg (n = 69) or placebo (n = 66) once every four weeks for 24 weeks. The baseline mean OCS use was similar in the two treatment groups: 13.2 mg in the placebo group and 12.4 mg in the group receiving Nucala 100 mg.

### Use of biologics for the treatment of moderate-to-severe asthma: The age of personalized medicine [^113WXgjG]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

There are multiple FDA-approved biologics to treat poorly controlled moderate-to-severe asthma. Given the heterogeneity of asthma and the lack of head-to-head data between biologics, selecting the best biologic for a patient can be difficult. This review summarizes key literature at the time of writing, in hopes of facilitating an evidence-based approach to selecting the most appropriate biologic for patients with asthma.

Recent findings indicate that, in addition to unique mechanisms of action, there is increasing literature on predictors of response to each biologic, such as sensitizations to aeroallergens, peripheral eosinophil count, total serum IgE, and exhaled nitric oxide. Biologics available for asthma are also being increasingly studied in comorbid conditions with asthma, and this may facilitate selecting the most appropriate biologic for a patient. In the absence of head-to-head studies, there is literature on switching between biologics whenever necessary.

The authors outline an approach to selecting a biologic based on various considerations and hope this suggested approach facilitates selecting the biologic most suitable for each individual with poorly controlled moderate-to-severe asthma.

### Twice-yearly depemokimab in severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype [^112UvVyG]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). High credibility.

The study SWIFT-1 was published by David J. Jackson and colleagues in 2024 in the journal *N Engl J Med*. This study is related to asthma and severe asthma phenotypes. The trial question was: what is the role of depemokimab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population included 382 patients (223 female, 159 male) with severe eosinophilic asthma.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.
- **Exclusion criteria**: Receiving biologic therapy as part of maintenance therapy; anti-IL-5 antibody therapy in the past 12 months; known pre-existing, clinically important lung condition other than asthma; diagnosis of vasculitis; cirrhosis or unstable liver or biliary disease.

The interventions included:

- n = 250 receiving depemokimab (100 mg SC at weeks 0 and 26 plus standard care).
- n = 132 receiving a placebo (matching placebo at weeks 0 and 26 plus standard care).

- **Primary outcome**: Significant decrease in annual rate of exacerbations at week 52 (0.46 vs. 1.11; RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.59).

- **Secondary outcomes**: No significant difference in reduction in St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire score at week 52 (13.03 points vs. 9.67 points; AD 3.36 points, 95% CI -0.39 to 7.11) and no significant difference in reduction in Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 score at week 52 (0.82 points vs. 0.77 points; AD 0.04 points, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.27).

### Adverse events of anti-IL-5 drugs in patients with eosinophilic asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence-based assessments [^111ksJCu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Analysis of adverse events from post-marketing reports (PRR and BNCPP)**: Post-marketing adverse event data for anti-IL-5 drugs (mepolizumab, benralizumab, and reslizumab) were gleaned from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Employed in safety surveillance and on-market product evaluation, and provided by healthcare professionals, consumers, and manufacturing authorization holders globally, FAERS aggregated spontaneous post-marketing adverse event data, as well as reports from studies and programs after marketing, irrespective of whether these events transpired within or beyond U.S. borders. Herein, all reported AEs were codified with Preferred Terms (PTs) according to the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities to facilitate subsequent statistical evaluation.

- **Data extraction and process**: From January 1, 2018, to September 30, 2022, a conjunction of keywords ("mepolizumab", "Nucala", "reslizumab", "Cinqair", "Fasenra", "benralizumab") was deployed to search FAERS, yielding adverse event data related to suspect anti-IL-5 drugs. The top 100 AEs at a PT level, ranked by the number of cases, were then identified through signal detection.

- **Signal detection and evaluation**: Herein, the Proportional Reporting Rate (PRR) and the Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN) were utilized to identify potential safety observations among the top 100 AEs at a PT level. The former is based on the premise that a specific adverse event connected to a certain medicinal product is reported statistically more often in association with that product.

### IL-33 receptor inhibition in subjects with uncontrolled asthma: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1117eaMg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). High credibility.

The human IgG2σ mAb GSK3772847 inhibits IL-33 signaling by binding to the extracellular domain of IL-33R. GSK3772847 was well tolerated by participants with mild asthma in a first-time-in-humans study. The Phase IIA proof-of-concept trial (identifier NCT03207243) utilized a downtitration design that gradually withdrew standard asthma control medications, including inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs), to evaluate the ability of GSK3772847 to prevent loss of asthma control (LoAC). This trial also investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GSK3772847 in participants with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma.

### Novel potential treatable traits in asthma: Where is the research taking us [^1125E4kV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Other therapies that target neutrophil chemotaxis and/or signaling cascades, such as IL-17A or CXC chemokine receptor 2, have not demonstrated efficacy in clinical studies so far. A phase 2 study demonstrated that a mAb blocking the IL-17 receptor, brodalumab, had no treatment effect in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma. However, it is important to note that the study did not select for a TH17 cell–high population. Placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that CXC chemokine receptor 2 antagonists reduce blood neutrophil counts in patients with severe neutrophilic asthma; however, there was no associated improvement in terms of asthma control, lung function, or reduced exacerbation rates in those studies. This suggests that a reduction in blood neutrophil counts may not be correlated with a reduction in airway neutrophil numbers or airway inflammation, limiting the accuracy of this biomarker for monitoring or predicting response to therapy. The aforementioned results call into question the role of circulating neutrophils in asthma and the extent to which non–type 2 asthma is driven by neutrophilic inflammation. Although there is a notable body of evidence implicating neutrophils in non–type 2 asthma, clinical data to support the efficacy of targeted antineutrophil therapies in non–type 2 asthma are lacking. Therefore, there is a need for further clinical trials to be carried out in patients with neutrophilic or TH17 cell–high asthma.

### How to adjust asthma management once asthma is controlled on long-term biologic therapy [^116TYSpt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). High credibility.

Monoclonal antibodies that target IgE, IL-5, the IL-5 receptor, IL-4 receptor α, or thymic stromal lymphopoietin have improved outcomes, reduced exacerbations, minimized symptoms, improved lung function, and facilitated corticosteroid withdrawal. Although it is possible to achieve remission with these biologics, many patients inquire about the feasibility of discontinuing the biologic or inhalers, or considering alternative dosing strategies.

In this commentary, we review available data regarding the safety and efficacy of different asthma medication management options once asthma is controlled with long-term biologic therapy. We evaluate stopping biologics while continuing inhaler therapy, stopping background therapy while continuing biologics, reducing the biologic dose, increasing the biologic interval, and other strategies including seasonal administration of biologics. It is clear that many patients can safely adopt some of these approaches that will make their lives easier and potentially less expensive for patients and payers. More research is needed to determine who, when, and how to adopt these alternative regimens.

### Lebrikizumab in moderate-to-severe asthma: Pooled data from two randomised placebo-controlled studies [^111B2Bo2]. Thorax (2015). Low credibility.

In a subset of patients with asthma, standard-of-care treatment does not achieve disease control, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic approaches. Lebrikizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to and blocks interleukin-13 activity.

- **Methods**: LUTE and VERSE were replicate, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating multiple doses of lebrikizumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma despite the use of medium-to-high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a second controller. Patients received lebrikizumab 37.5, 125, or 250 mg, or placebo subcutaneously every four weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of asthma exacerbations during the placebo-controlled period. Analyses were performed on prespecified subgroups based on baseline serum periostin levels. Following the discovery of a host-cell impurity in the study drug material, protocols were amended to convert from phase III to phase IIb. Subsequently, dosing of study medication was discontinued early as a precautionary measure. The data collected for analysis were from a placebo-controlled period of variable duration and pooled across both studies.

- **Results**: The median duration of treatment was approximately 24 weeks. Treatment with lebrikizumab reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations, which was more pronounced in the periostin-high patients (all doses: 60% reduction) than in the periostin-low patients (all doses: 5% reduction); no dose-response was evident. Lung function also improved following lebrikizumab treatment, with the greatest increase in FEV1 in periostin-high patients.

### A multistakeholder Delphi consensus core outcome set for clinical trials in moderate-to-severe asthma (coreASTHMA) [^116GLqTp]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2021). Low credibility.

Treatments for long-term control of asthma have improved and include a promising but expensive class of biologic therapies. However, the clinical trials evaluating these and other novel treatments have used a variety of different outcomes to evaluate efficacy. The evolution of asthma care calls for a re-examination of outcomes that are most important to patients and other stakeholders.

- **Objective**: To develop a core set of outcomes to be measured in phase 3 and phase 4 clinical drug trials in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma.

- **Methods**: We used a robust and in-depth multistakeholder consensus process bringing together patients, clinicians, regulators, payers, health technology assessors, researchers, and product developers to reach consensus on outcomes. We used a modified Delphi method to reach consensus, an approach adapted from the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative aligned with contemporary methodological standards for core outcome set development.

- **Results**: The following outcomes were included in the final core set: severe asthma exacerbation, change in asthma control, asthma-specific or severe asthma-specific quality of life, asthma-specific hospital stay (i.e. > 24-hour stays at any level of care) or admission, and asthma-specific emergency department visit.

- **Conclusion**: These 5 outcomes represent a minimum set of core outcomes for use in phase 3 and phase 4 clinical drug trials in moderate-to-severe asthma. Consistent collection of these outcomes is essential, independent of whether additional heterogeneous primary or secondary outcomes are included.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^116hJFhh]. Chest (2025). Low credibility.

Assuming a satisfactory and unrevealing workup, four main therapeutic options could be considered at the first patient encounter. In increasing order of expected benefits for the patient, these are as follows:

1. No therapeutic change is implemented, but allergen avoidance is recommended, despite the low likelihood that it will decrease exacerbation frequency. Ordering more ancillary tests may be considered, despite having clearly identified the clinical problem.

2. Optimizing the pharmaceutical care of potentially related comorbidities (e.g. acid reflux, sinus disease), without necessarily addressing the cause of asthma attacks.

3. Prescribing oral medications (e.g. montelukast, sublingual immunotherapy, or theophylline) that are likely to be of very limited proven efficacy in severe asthma.

4. Initiating a monoclonal antibody for asthma. Although all of the options above may be considered, this is likely the best option, assuming an appropriate prescription based on biomarkers and comorbidities, and that the patient meets regional prescription criteria, treatment is reimbursed, and the medications are available.

In considering biologic therapies in this patient and in all ensuing patients, we assume that the extrinsic factors noted in item (4) have been addressed. The first patient is typical insofar as she is eligible for all biologics available: the anti-IgE omalizumab, the anti-IL-5s mepolizumab and reslizumab, the anti-IL-5-receptor (IL-5R) benralizumab, the anti-IL-4-receptor dupilumab, and the anti-thymic stromal lymphopoietin blocker.

### Choosing the right biologic for the right patient with severe asthma [^112ttDaa]. Chest (2025). High credibility.

The development of multiple biologics in asthma has led to major benefits for patients and new therapeutic dilemmas for asthmatologists. Confirming the diagnosis of asthma, conducting an adherence check, and completing the workup with objective measures of the type 2 immune response is necessary for all patients. As demonstrated by this case-based discussion, in the presence of overlapping prescribing criteria and in the absence of head-to-head comparisons, multiple choices often are reasonable to consider, with certain biologics more suited to address specific comorbidities and biomarker profiles than others. The blood eosinophil count and, when available, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), are important aspects of the decision process for patients with purely severe asthma and no other treatable comorbidities. These considerations, including the newer problem of when, why, and how to switch biologics, are important research questions that need to be addressed. It is also hoped that other therapies targeting alternate pathways in severe asthma are developed, which may offer further hope to these patients.

### Biologic therapies targeting type 2 cytokines are effective at improving asthma symptoms and control — a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111Bm9c6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). High credibility.

This systematic review assessed randomized, double-blind clinical trials that included severe eosinophilic asthmatic patients older than 12 years. The trials randomized patients to biologic therapy or a placebo; all participants continued to receive standard treatment.

The review was carried out following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram and analyzed the use of IL-5 inhibitors and IL-4/IL-13 inhibitors as novel biologic treatments for asthma, compared with standard therapy.

Most of the clinical trials included in this meta-analysis were phase 3 studies with fairly large cohort sizes. The inclusion criteria consisted of men and women who were older than 12 years. Observations and outcomes included assessments of asthma control using the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and lung function measured by FEV1. In a subset of studies, asthma exacerbation rates and changes in oral corticosteroid (OCS) use were also assessed. The rate of adverse events associated with these novel biologics was also investigated. Studies performed in animal models of disease as well as review articles were excluded from the qualitative and quantitative analyses.

### Dupilumab is effective in type 2-high asthma patients receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids at baseline [^112n1g9o]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: The phase 2b study (NCT01854047) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study conducted in adults aged 18 years or older with an asthma diagnosis for at least 12 months. This diagnosis was based on the Global Initiative for Asthma 2009 guidelines and included treatment with high-dose (over 1000 µg/day) or medium-dose (500–1000 µg/day) inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus long-acting β2-agonists. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous dupilumab 200 or 300 mg every two weeks (q2w) or every four weeks, or placebo, over a 24-week period. Full details of the study design and conduct, including inclusion and exclusion criteria, have been published previously.

- **Post Hoc Analysis**: For this analysis, only data from patients randomized to dupilumab q2w regimens (the approved dosing regimen) and placebo were included.

- **LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST Study**: This was a phase 3 multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study assessing the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with uncontrolled asthma treated with high-dose (> 1000 µg/day) or medium-dose (500–1000 µg/day) ICS. Patients aged 12 years or older were randomized in a 2:2:1:1 ratio to receive add-on subcutaneous dupilumab 200 or 300 mg q2w or volume-matched placebo for 52 weeks. The study accepted all patients regardless of eosinophilic status or any other biomarker requirement. Full details of study design, methodology, and eligibility criteria have been reported in previous publications.

In both the phase 2b study and the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, atopy was self-reported.

### IL-33 receptor inhibition in subjects with uncontrolled asthma: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1131vVbh]. Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). Low credibility.

Most biologics for severe asthma target only type 2 immunity. Inhibition of IL-33 signaling has the potential to target type 2 and non-type 2 pathways. This multicenter phase IIA study evaluated the safety and efficacy of GSK3772847, a human mAb directed against the IL-33 receptor (IL-33R), in subjects with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma.

Adults with uncontrolled asthma, despite inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist therapy, received equivalent replacement medication (open-label fluticasone propionate/salmeterol [500/50 μg, twice daily]) for two weeks before randomization at week 0. At weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, participants were administered blinded placebo or 10 mg/kg of intravenous GSK3772847. At week 2, salmeterol was discontinued; thereafter, fluticasone propionate was titrated by approximately 50% on weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10. Asthma control was assessed until week 16, and participants with loss of asthma control discontinued treatment. The primary endpoint was loss of asthma control. Secondary endpoints were the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of GSK3772847.

At week 16, loss of asthma control was observed in 56 participants (81%) receiving placebo and 45 participants (66%) receiving GSK3772847, indicating an 18% reduction (95% credible interval = 2%-35%) in loss of asthma control with GSK3772847. Early loss of asthma control prevented a full analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints after week 4. The most frequent classes of treatment-related adverse events were cardiac disorders (n = 3 [4%] in both groups) and musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders.

### Anoro Ellipta [^111Z5WR5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Results from the two active-controlled trials and the two 12-week trials provided additional support for the efficacy of Anoro Ellipta in terms of change from baseline in trough FEV1 compared with the single-ingredient comparators and placebo.

Serial spirometric evaluations throughout the 24-hour dosing interval were performed in a subset of subjects (n = 197) at Days 1, 84, and 168 in Trial 1. Results from Trial 1 at Day 1 and Day 168 are shown in Figure 5.

- **Figure 5**: Least squares (LS) mean change from baseline in FEV1 (mL) over time (0–24 hours) on Days 1 and 168 (Trial 1 subset population)

The peak FEV1 was defined as the maximum FEV1 recorded within 6 hours after the dose of trial medicine on Days 1, 28, 84, and 168. Measurements were recorded at 15 and 30 minutes and 1, 3, and 6 hours. The mean peak FEV1 improvement from baseline for Anoro Ellipta compared with placebo at Day 1 and at Day 168 was 167 and 224 mL, respectively. The median time to onset on Day 1, defined as a 100 mL increase from baseline in FEV1, was 27 minutes in subjects receiving Anoro Ellipta.

### A phase I, randomized, observer-blinded, single and multiple ascending-dose study to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of BITS7201A, a bispecific antibody targeting IL-13 and IL-17, in healthy volunteers [^111ePMFP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Inhibition of interleukin (IL)-13, a Type 2 inflammatory mediator in asthma, improves lung function and reduces exacerbations; however, more effective therapies are needed. A subset of asthma patients also exhibits elevated IL-17, which is associated with greater disease severity, neutrophilic inflammation, and steroid resistance. BITS7201A is a novel, humanized bispecific antibody that binds and neutralizes both IL-13 and IL-17.

- **Methods**: Safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of BITS7201A were evaluated in a phase 1 study. Part A was a single ascending-dose design with 5 cohorts: 30-, 90-, and 300-mg subcutaneous (SC), and 300- and 750-mg intravenous (IV). Part B was a multiple ascending-dose design with 3 cohorts: 150-, 300-, and 600-mg SC every 4 weeks ×3 doses. Both parts enrolled approximately 8 healthy volunteers into each cohort (6 active: 2 placebo). Part B included an additional cohort of patients with mild asthma (600-mg SC).

- **Results**: Forty-one subjects (31 active, 10 placebo) and 26 subjects (20 active, 6 placebo) were enrolled into Parts A and B, respectively. The cohort with mild asthma patients was terminated after enrollment of a single patient. No deaths, serious adverse events, or dose-limiting adverse events occurred. In Part A, 12 active (39%) and 5 placebo subjects (50%), and in Part B, 6 active (30%) and 3 placebo subjects (50%) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The most common adverse events were fatigue (n = 3) and influenza-like illness (n = 2). One injection-site reaction was reported.

### IL-33 receptor inhibition in subjects with uncontrolled asthma: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^1118gS95]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). Low credibility.

Most biologics for severe asthma target only type 2 immunity. Inhibition of IL-33 signaling has the potential to target type 2 and non–type 2 pathways.

- **Objective**: This multicenter phase IIA study evaluated the safety and efficacy of GSK3772847, a human mAb directed against the IL-33 receptor (IL-33R) in subjects with moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma.

- **Methods**: Adults with uncontrolled asthma despite inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2-agonist therapy received equivalent replacement medication (open-label fluticasone propionate/salmeterol [500/50 μg, twice daily]) for 2 weeks before randomization at week 0. At weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, participants were administered blinded placebo or 10 mg/kg of intravenous GSK3772847. At week 2, salmeterol was discontinued; thereafter, fluticasone propionate was titrated by approximately 50% on weeks 4, 6, 8, and 10. Asthma control was assessed until week 16. Participants with loss of asthma control discontinued treatment. The primary endpoint was loss of asthma control; secondary endpoints were the efficacy, safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of GSK3772847.

- **Results**: At week 16, 56 participants (81%) and 45 (66%) receiving placebo and GSK3772847, respectively, had loss of asthma control (an 18% reduction [95% credible interval = 2%-35%]). Early loss of asthma control prevented full analysis of the secondary efficacy endpoints after week 4. The most frequent classes of treatment-related adverse events were cardiac disorders (n = 3 [4%] in both groups) and musculoskeletal/connective tissue disorders.

### Breo Ellipta [^1111fGNh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The efficacy of Breo Ellipta for the maintenance treatment of asthma was based on data from four randomized, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trials (Trial 8 [NCT01165138], Trial 9 [NCT01686633], Trial 10 [NCT01134042], and Trial 12 [NCT01086384]). Although these four trials enrolled pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years, they only support efficacy in adults [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Additionally, patients in these trials were treated with Breo Ellipta 200/25 mcg once daily by oral inhalation, which is not the approved recommended dosage for pediatric patients 12 years of age and older [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Trials 8, 9, and 10 were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Breo Ellipta given once daily in patients who were not controlled on their treatments of ICS or combination therapy consisting of an ICS plus a LABA.

- **Exacerbation trial**: Trial 12, the 24- to 76-week exacerbation trial, was designed to demonstrate that treatment with Breo Ellipta 100/25 mcg significantly decreased the risk of asthma exacerbations, as measured by time to first asthma exacerbation when compared with fluticasone furoate 100 mcg. This trial enrolled patients who had one or more asthma exacerbations in the year prior to trial entry.

### Preclinical and clinical experience with dupilumab on the correlates of live attenuated vaccines [^1177Kmaa]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2022). Low credibility.

The safety and tolerability of live attenuated vaccines in patients administered dupilumab for moderate-to-severe asthma have not been previously evaluated. During the LIBERTY ASTHMA TRAVERSE open-label extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02134028), a yellow fever outbreak in Brazil required the administration of a live attenuated vaccine to at-risk individuals.

- **Objective**: Our aim was to evaluate the immune response to a live attenuated vaccine in the context of IL-4 receptor blockade (REGN1103, a dupilumab surrogate) in mice and in dupilumab-treated patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who participated in TRAVERSE.

- **Methods**: In the preclinical study, mice were co-administered REGN1103/isotype control and live attenuated influenza vaccine/control, followed by an influenza virus challenge. During TRAVERSE, 37 patients discontinued dupilumab treatment and were administered the 17D live attenuated yellow fever vaccine (YFV). Safety and tolerability data, dupilumab serum concentrations, and plaque reduction neutralization titers before and after vaccination were collected.

- **Results**: In the preclinical study, there was no impact of REGN1103 on vaccine efficacy in mice. In TRAVERSE, all 37 patients who received YFV achieved seroprotection despite most having therapeutic levels of dupilumab, with the magnitude of response appearing unrelated to prevaccination dupilumab concentrations. No instances of vaccine-related adverse events or vaccine hypersensitivity were reported in 36 patients; 1 patient reported non-serious body ache, malaise, and dizziness 7 days after vaccination.

### A novel endpoint for exacerbations in asthma to accelerate clinical development: A post-hoc analysis of randomised controlled trials [^112PrKog]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations is the cornerstone of the evaluation of asthma management, but severe asthma exacerbations are rare events. Therefore, trials assessing drug efficacy on exacerbations are conducted late in clinical development programs. We aimed to establish an endpoint capturing clinically relevant deteriorations (diary events) that, when combined with severe exacerbations, create a composite outcome (CompEx). CompEx needs to strongly mirror results seen with the severe exacerbation-validated outcome to allow the design of clinical trials of shorter duration and that include fewer patients than trials assessing severe exacerbations.

- **Methods**: Data from 12 asthma trials of 6-month or 12-month duration, with standardized collection of exacerbations and diary card variables, were used to construct and test CompEx. The study populations had a mean age of 35–53 years, 59–69% were female, and had a mean FEV1 percentage of predicted normal of 63–84%. Using data from five trials, we established a series of diary events based on peak expiratory flow (P), reliever use (R), symptoms (S), awakenings (A), and threshold values for change from baseline and slopes to assess trends. For the development phase, we evaluated different variable combinations and deterioration criteria to select the most robust algorithm to define a diary event for the composite outcome. We defined a composite outcome, CompEx, as the first occurrence of a diary event or a severe exacerbation. We assessed the performance of CompEx in seven trials by comparing the event frequency.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of brodalumab, a human anti-IL-17 receptor monoclonal antibody, in moderate to severe asthma [^115tZ3Mm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

IL-17 signaling has been implicated in the development and persistence of asthma. Cytokine-targeted strategies blocking IL-17 receptor signaling may be beneficial in asthma treatment.

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of brodalumab, a human anti-IL-17 receptor A monoclonal antibody, in subjects with inadequately controlled moderate to severe asthma taking regular inhaled corticosteroids.

- **Methods**: Three hundred and two subjects were randomized to receive brodalumab (140, 210, or 280 mg) or placebo. The primary endpoint was the change in the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) score from baseline to Week 12. Secondary endpoints included FEV1, symptom scores, and symptom-free days. Prespecified subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential responsive subpopulations. The analyses included randomized subjects receiving one or more doses of the investigational product using last-observation-carried-forward imputation.

- **Measurements and main results**: Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally balanced among the groups (n = 302; n = 226 for brodalumab). For the overall study population, no treatment differences were observed. Nine prespecified subgroups were examined without corrections for multiple testing. In only the high-reversibility subgroup (post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement ≥ 20%; n = 112) was an ACQ change with nominal significance noted; ACQ responses were nominally significant in the 210-mg group (estimated treatment difference, 0.53) but not significant in the higher 280-mg group (estimated treatment difference, 0.38). Adverse events were generally balanced among the groups.

### Dupilumab is effective in type 2-high asthma patients receiving high-dose inhaled corticosteroids at baseline [^112ETWdp]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

The least squares mean change from baseline in FEV1 (L) was observed during the 24-week treatment period in the phase 2b study involving patients with uncontrolled, persistent asthma and the 52-week treatment period in the phase 3 QUEST study involving patients with uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe asthma on high-dose ICS at baseline. The results were further stratified by baseline eosinophil and FeNO levels.

† In the phase 2b study, the same amount of placebo was administered regardless of the dupilumab dose, unlike the volume-matched placebo used in the phase 3 QUEST study. ✱✱✱ p < 0.001, ✱✱ p < 0.01, ✱ p < 0.05 vs placebo. FeNO refers to fractional exhaled nitric oxide, FEV1 is the forced expiratory volume in 1 second, ICS stands for inhaled corticosteroids, LS represents least squares, q2w indicates every 2 weeks, and SE denotes standard error.

### Arnuity ellipta [^115GVLtV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The clinical development program for ARNUITY ELLIPTA included four confirmatory trials in adult and pediatric subjects with asthma aged 12 years and older. These trials were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ARNUITY ELLIPTA, administered once daily in the evening, on lung function in subjects who were not controlled on their existing treatments of ICS or combination therapy consisting of an ICS plus a LABA. Study treatments were delivered as inhalation powders.

The primary endpoint in all trials was the change from baseline in evening trough FEV1, measured approximately 24 hours after the final dose of study medication. Trough FEV1, assessed at approximately 24 hours after the previous dose, was also evaluated at clinic visits throughout the trials. Trials 2 and 4 had a co-primary endpoint of change from baseline in weighted mean serial FEV1, measured after the final dose of study medication at 5, 15, and 30 minutes, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 16, 20, 23, and 24 hours post-dose.

Trial 1 (NCT01159912) was a 24-week study that evaluated the efficacy of ARNUITY ELLIPTA 100 mcg compared with placebo on lung function in subjects with asthma. Inhaled fluticasone propionate 250 mcg twice daily was included as an active control. Of the 343 subjects, 59% were female and 79% were Caucasian. The mean age was 41 years. The trial included a 4-week run-in period, during which the subjects were symptomatic while taking their usual low- to mid-dose ICS therapy.

### How to compare the efficacy of biologic agents in asthma [^117DtY5v]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Use of biologics in severe asthma has made substantial strides in disease management and fostered a personalized medicine approach. However, questions remain regarding how, when, and which biologic to choose, forming the focus of this review.

- **Data sources**: The data sources included published literature, such as guidelines available through PubMed searches and online resources.

- **Study selections**: Studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) pertaining to the use of biologics in various phenotypes and/or endotypes of asthma and comparative analyses between biologics in asthma were included.

- **Results**: Inflammatory constructs in asthma are complex and translate differentially into clinical practice for both disease severity and treatment responsiveness. The utilization of biologics, which target selected components of inflammation, has begun to dramatically improve the course of management for many patients with severe asthma. A retuning of our approach to selecting appropriate patient cohorts or phenotypes for studies and the selection of clinically relevant outcomes, which are reflected by existing and novel emerging biomarkers, is enabling a paradigm shift in asthma management. Comparing the efficacy of the available biologics for asthma is challenging, as no direct head-to-head studies are available, and indirect comparisons to this query provide varying results.

Significant progress has been achieved in the management of severe asthma with the treatment of target-specific biologics. Sophisticated algorithms and trial designs are using a combination of a comprehensive approach to personalize treatment strategies.

### Nucala [^113uSu1X]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The asthma development program for Nucala in patients aged 12 years and older included three double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials: one dose-ranging and exacerbation trial (Trial 1, NCT01000506) and two confirmatory trials (Trial 2, NCT01691521 and Trial 3, NCT01691508). Mepolizumab was administered every four weeks in all three trials as an add-on to background treatment. All patients continued their background asthma therapy throughout the duration of the trials.

- **Dose-ranging and exacerbation trial**: Trial 1 was a 52-week dose-ranging and exacerbation-reduction trial in patients with severe asthma with a history of two or more exacerbations in the previous year despite regular use of high-dose ICS plus additional controller(s), with or without OCS. Patients enrolled in this trial were required to have at least one of the following four pre-specified criteria in the previous 12 months: blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/mcL, sputum eosinophil count ≥ 3%, exhaled nitric oxide concentration ≥ 50 ppb, or deterioration of asthma control after ≤ 25% reduction in regular maintenance ICS/OCS. Three intravenous (IV) dosages of mepolizumab (75, 250, and 750 mg) administered once every four weeks were evaluated compared with placebo. Results from this trial and the pharmacodynamic study supported the evaluation of mepolizumab 75 mg IV and 100 mg subcutaneous in the subsequent trials.

Nucala is not indicated for IV use and should only be administered by the subcutaneous route.

### Rates of asthma attacks in patients with previously inadequately controlled mild asthma treated in clinical practice with combination drug therapy: an exploratory post-hoc analysis [^111p8JFB]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The precise roles of drug combinations in the management of asthma and allergic rhinitis remain uncertain. The recommended maintenance therapies for persistent asthma include inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), leukotriene modifiers, and long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). ICSs are the preferred initial therapy for persistent asthma. Leukotriene modifiers, including montelukast (MON), are recommended for mild persistent asthma, as add-on therapy to ICSs for moderate persistent asthma, or as an alternative maintenance therapy for patients unable to tolerate ICSs, and are also effective against co-morbid allergic rhinitis. LABAs are recommended only as add-on therapy to ICSs for moderate or severe asthma but not for mild persistent asthma or allergic rhinitis or as asthma monotherapy. Combinations of more than two medication classes are recommended only for severe persistent asthma. The 2006 GINA and 2007 NAEPP guidelines gave leukotriene modifiers a more prominent role in the treatment of asthma, particularly for those with concomitant allergic rhinitis, and restricted the use of LABAs because of safety concerns.

Although asthma treatment guidelines recommend ICS + LABA as the first-line therapy for patients with severe asthma, there are controversies over the potential safety issues and an excess mortality rate in some studies. The main concern is that chronic administration of LABAs may diminish the acute bronchodilating effect of short-acting beta-agonists, thus leaving the patient vulnerable to acute asthma attacks.

### Adverse events of anti-IL-5 drugs in patients with eosinophilic asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and real-world evidence-based assessments [^1136dAG3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). High credibility.

He, Wang, and Akenroye conducted a meta-analysis of anti-IL-5 therapies, focusing on efficacy and safety; however, the safety analysis lacked details, and adverse events (AEs) were not clearly specified. This underscores the necessity for a comprehensive understanding of the safety profiles of these medications, encompassing both shared and unique safety data for each drug, and the identification of potential safety concerns emerging from post-marketing experiences.

Analysis of AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) revealed no dose-related trends within sub-treatment groups. Consistent with most studies, AE rates in patients receiving anti-IL-5 therapy paralleled those in placebo groups. Significantly, patients treated with anti-IL-5 drugs, particularly with mepolizumab and benralizumab, showed a marked decrease in SAE risk. Overall, anti-IL-5 medications demonstrate strong tolerability in treating eosinophilic asthma.

### Effect of fixed-dose subcutaneous reslizumab on asthma exacerbations in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma and corticosteroid sparing in patients with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma: results from two phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^116tWkDZ]. The Lancet. Respiratory Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Reslizumab 3 mg/kg administered intravenously is approved for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma. We assessed the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg in two trials in patients with uncontrolled severe asthma and increased blood eosinophils. The aim was to establish whether subcutaneous reslizumab 110 mg can reduce exacerbation rates in these patients (study 1) or reduce maintenance oral corticosteroid dose in patients with corticosteroid-dependent asthma (study 2).

- **Methods**: Both studies were randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies. Entry criteria for study 1 were uncontrolled severe asthma, two or more asthma exacerbations in the previous year, a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells per μL or more (including no more than 30% of patients with an eosinophil count < 400 cells/μL), and at least a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids with one or more additional asthma controllers. Patients in study 2 had severe asthma, a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells per μL or more, daily maintenance oral corticosteroid (prednisone 5–40 mg, or equivalent), and high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another controller. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to subcutaneous reslizumab (110 mg) or placebo once every 4 weeks for 52 weeks in study 1 and 24 weeks in study 2. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. Primary efficacy outcomes were frequency of exacerbations during 52 weeks in study 1 and categorised percentage reduction in daily oral corticosteroid dose from baseline to weeks 20–24 in study 2.

### Systematic literature review of systemic corticosteroid use for asthma management [^1137ycVX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the availability of these new well-tolerated, effective, targeted biologic add-on treatments and the well-recognized adverse effects associated with systemic corticosteroid (SCS) use, oral corticosteroids (OCS) are still treatment options in asthma treatment guidelines. The 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines recommend that if OCS are prescribed, they should be prescribed at lesser dosages. Prescribers should be fully aware of and monitor for adverse effects. OCS should be considered, along with targeted biologic treatments, for add-on treatment for patients with uncontrolled asthma despite the use of high-dosage inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy (GINA step 5 treatment).

The GINA guidelines also recommend short-term OCS use for patients experiencing a severe exacerbation who do not respond to treatment. However, this guidance is relatively unspecific. Patients can repeatedly receive prescriptions for both short- and long-term OCS and ultimately become OCS dependent. The continued inclusion of OCS in guidelines, together with their worldwide easy accessibility, familiarity of use, and low acquisition costs compared with newer targeted treatments, contributes to the ongoing use of SCS for patients with severe asthma. In addition, it is likely that some patients fail to benefit significantly from the OCS-sparing effect of biologic treatments because of differences in their susceptibility to OCS-related adverse effects or their unwillingness to initiate new treatment options and reduce OCS use.

### A study to evaluate safety and efficacy of mepolizumab in patients with moderate persistent asthma [^11311hzQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Accumulation of eosinophils in the bronchial mucosa of individuals with asthma is considered to be a central event in the pathogenesis of asthma. In animal models, airway eosinophil recruitment and airway hyperresponsiveness in response to allergen challenge are reduced by specific targeting of interleukin-5. A previous small dose-finding study found that mepolizumab, a humanized anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody, had no effect on allergen challenge in humans.

The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of three intravenous infusions of mepolizumab, 250 or 750 mg at monthly intervals, on clinical outcome measures in 362 patients with asthma experiencing persistent symptoms despite inhaled corticosteroid therapy (400–1,000 µg of beclomethasone or equivalent).

- **Methods**: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.

- **Measurements and main results**: Morning peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, daily beta(2)-agonist use, symptom scores, exacerbation rates, and quality of life measures. Sputum eosinophil levels were also measured in a subgroup of 37 individuals. Mepolizumab was associated with a significant reduction in blood and sputum eosinophils in both treatment groups (blood, P < 0.001 for both doses; sputum, P = 0.006 for 250 mg and P = 0.004 for 750 mg). There were no statistically significant changes in any of the clinical end points measured. There was a nonsignificant trend for decrease in exacerbation rates in the mepolizumab 750-mg treatment group (P = 0.065).

Mepolizumab treatment does not appear to significantly impact the clinical outcomes measured in this study.
