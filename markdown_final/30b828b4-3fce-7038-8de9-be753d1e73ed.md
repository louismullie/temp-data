## Question

11. (10 points) On Qingming Festival, students take a bus to the martyrs' cemetery to pay respects. If the bus increases its speed by one-fifth after driving for 1 hour, it can arrive 10 minutes earlier than the scheduled time; if the bus first drives 60 kilometers at the original speed and then increases its speed by one-third, it can arrive 20 minutes earlier than the scheduled time. How many kilometers is it from the school to the martyrs' cemetery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to determine the distance from the school to the martyrs' cemetery based on two scenarios involving speed changes and time savings. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining variables and converting time units consistently. Then, I should translate each scenario into a distance–time equation. Next, I will solve the resulting system of equations, ideally by substitution. After that, I should verify the solution against both original conditions. Finally, I will state the answer clearly and double-check that the units and logic align throughout.

> Let me first confirm the variables and units so I don't mix minutes and hours. Let the total distance be D kilometers, the original speed be v kilometers per hour, and the scheduled time be T hours. I need to ensure that any time differences are expressed in hours; 10 minutes is 1/6 hour and 20 minutes is 1/3 hour, which will simplify the algebra later.

> Now, Scenario 1: the bus drives for 1 hour at speed v, then increases speed by one-fifth to 1.2v and arrives 10 minutes early. Wait, let me verify the speed increase: one-fifth of v is 0.2v, so the new speed is indeed 1.2v. The distance covered in the first hour is v kilometers, leaving D − v kilometers at the faster speed. The actual total time is 1 hour plus (D − v)/(1.2v), and this equals T − 1/6. So the equation is 1 + (D − v)/(1.2v) = T − 1/6. I should rearrange this to express T in terms of D and v for later substitution.

> Next, Scenario 2: the bus drives 60 kilometers at speed v, then increases speed by one-third to 4v/3 and arrives 20 minutes early. Hold on, I should verify the speed increase: one-third of v is v/3, so the new speed is v + v/3 = 4v/3. The time for the first 60 km is 60/v, and the time for the remaining D − 60 km is (D − 60)/(4v/3) = 3(D − 60)/(4v). The actual total time is 60/v + 3(D − 60)/(4v), and this equals T − 1/3. So the equation is 60/v + 3(D − 60)/(4v) = T − 1/3. Again, I will keep this ready for substitution.

> I will now solve the system. Let me substitute the expression for T from Scenario 1 into Scenario 2. From Scenario 1, T = 1 + (D − v)/(1.2v) + 1/6. Plugging this into Scenario 2 gives 60/v + 3(D − 60)/(4v) = 1 + (D − v)/(1.2v) + 1/6 − 1/3. Simplifying the right side, 1/6 − 1/3 = −1/6, so the right side becomes 1 + (D − v)/(1.2v) − 1/6. I should double-check that arithmetic before proceeding.

> Let me multiply through by 12v to eliminate denominators and reduce errors. On the left, 12v × 60/v = 720 and 12v × 3(D − 60)/(4v) = 9(D − 60). On the right, 12v × 1 = 12v, 12v × (D − v)/(1.2v) = 10(D − v), and 12v × (−1/6) = −2v. So the equation becomes 720 + 9(D − 60) = 12v + 10(D − v) − 2v. I should expand and collect like terms carefully.

> Expanding both sides, I get 720 + 9D − 540 = 12v + 10D − 10v − 2v. Simplifying, the left is 180 + 9D, and the right is 12v − 10v − 2v + 10D = 0v + 10D = 10D. Wait, that can't be right; I initially thought the right side would retain a v term, but 12v − 10v − 2v cancels out to zero. So I have 180 + 9D = 10D, which implies D = 180. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify this result against both original scenarios to ensure consistency.

> Verification for Scenario 1: if D = 180 km, I need to find v and T. From Scenario 1, T = 1 + (D − v)/(1.2v) + 1/6. Substituting D = 180 gives T = 1 + (180 − v)/(1.2v) + 1/6. But I should also use Scenario 2 to find v. From Scenario 2, 60/v + 3(180 − 60)/(4v) = T − 1/3. Substituting T from above and solving, I get 60/v + 360/(4v) = 1 + (180 − v)/(1.2v) + 1/6 − 1/3. Simplifying the left gives 60/v + 90/v = 150/v, and the right simplifies to 1 + (180 − v)/(1.2v) − 1/6. Multiplying through by 1.2v to clear denominators yields 180 = 1.2v + 180 − v − 0.2v, which reduces to 180 = 180, confirming consistency. I should double-check that this implies v cancels and is not uniquely determined, which is acceptable because the distance is the target variable and the system is consistent for any positive v, with T adjusting accordingly.

> Verification for Scenario 2: using D = 180 km, the left side is 60/v + 3(120)/(4v) = 60/v + 90/v = 150/v. The right side is T − 1/3, and from Scenario 1, T = 1 + (180 − v)/(1.2v) + 1/6. So T − 1/3 = 1 + (180 − v)/(1.2v) − 1/3 = 2/3 + (180 − v)/(1.2v). Setting 150/v equal to 2/3 + (180 − v)/(1.2v) and multiplying by 1.2v gives 180 = 0.8v + 180 − v, which again simplifies to 180 = 180, confirming the solution holds across both conditions. I should confirm that this cross-check increases confidence in D = 180 km as the unique distance satisfying both scenarios.

> Therefore, the distance from the school to the martyrs' cemetery is 180 kilometers. I need to ensure the final statement is precise and reflects the derivation and verification steps I just completed.

The distance from the school to the martyrs' cemetery is **180 kilometers**. This is found by setting up two equations based on the given speed changes and time savings, then solving the system for the total distance. The key steps are to define variables for distance and original speed, express the scenarios as time equations, and solve the resulting system algebraically.

---

## Define variables

Let:

- (D) = total distance from school to cemetery (km)
- (v) = original speed of the bus (km/h)
- (T) = scheduled time for the trip (hours)

---

## Formulate equations based on given scenarios

### Scenario 1: Speed increase by one-fifth after 1 hour

- **Distance covered in the first hour**: v × 1 = v km
- **Remaining distance**: D − v km
- **New speed**: v + [1/5]v = [6/5]v km/h
- **Time taken for remaining distance**: (D − v)/([6/5]v) = [5(D − v)/6v] hours
- **Total time taken**: 1 + [5(D − v)/6v] hours
- **This arrives 10 minutes (i.e. [1/6] hour) early, so**:

1 + [5(D − v)/6v] = T − [1/6]

Rearranging gives:

T = 1 + [5(D − v)/6v] + [1/6] = [7/6] + [5(D − v)/6v]

---

### Scenario 2: Drive 60 km at original speed, then increase speed by one-third

- **Distance at original speed**: 60 km
- **Time for this part**: 60/v hours
- **Remaining distance**: D − 60 km
- **New speed**: v + [1/3]v = [4/3]v km/h
- **Time for remaining distance**: (D − 60)/([4/3]v) = [3(D − 60)/4v] hours
- **Total time taken**: ([60/v] + [3(D − 60)/4v]) hours
- **This arrives 20 minutes (i.e. [1/3] hour) early, so**:

[60/v] + [3(D − 60)/4v] = T − [1/3]

Substitute the expression for (T) from Scenario 1:

[60/v] + [3(D − 60)/4v] = ([7/6] + [5(D − v)/6v]) − [1/3]

Simplify the right-hand side:

[7/6] − [1/3] = [7/6] − [2/6] = [5/6]

So:

[60/v] + [3(D − 60)/4v] = [5/6] + [5(D − v)/6v]

---

## Solve the equation

Multiply both sides by 12v to eliminate denominators:

12v ([60/v] + [3(D − 60)/4v]) = 12v ([5/6] + [5(D − v)/6v])

Simplify:

720 + 9(D − 60) = 10v + 10(D − v)

Expand and collect terms:

720 + 9D − 540 = 10v + 10D − 10v

180 + 9D = 10D

Subtract (9D) from both sides:

180 = D

---

## Conclusion

The total distance from the school to the martyrs' cemetery is **180 kilometers**.

This narrative explores my experience as a family doctor deeply embedded in a rural community comprising 9 villages. The regional cemetery, a symbol of mortality, serves as a focal point for meditations on what it means to bear witness as a family doctor, depicting some of the joys and sorrows I have witnessed over the last quarter of a century serving this community. Grounded in the philosophy of "to cure-sometimes, to relieve-often, and to comfort-always", I underscore the importance of presence and compassion in family medicine, ultimately embracing mortality as a shared human journey that shapes both patients and their caregivers.

### Seed dispersal by martu peoples promotes the distribution of native plants in arid Australia [^114mLMJ6]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

On return to their homelands, Martu reinvigorated their customary subsistence and landscape burning practices, and many remote-living families continue to maintain fundamental aspects of their foraging livelihoods, typically spending about 25% of their days in hunting or gathering activities. People often go out foraging on day trips to various locales, which includes establishing a temporary 'dinner camp' for the purpose of bush food preparation, cooking and consumption. We have previously reported quantitative details of foraging time allocation, labor decisions, bush food yields, return rates from regular hunting and gathering practices, the role of cultural burning in facilitating hunting strategies, the ecological role of these practices, and significant changes in subsistence over the last half-century.

While the three remote communities in the Martu Native Title lands have semi-permanent infrastructure — including housing, a primary school, a small shop, and a health clinic — it would be misleading to describe Martu as "settled" or even "semi-settled". Most exercise extremely high mobility, shifting residence many times over the course of a year across the remote communities and throughout settlements and towns beyond the Native Title boundaries. The composition of Martu residential communities and foraging groups is thus constantly fluctuating. Their mobility and foraging activities are vital in maintaining the landesque capital of their estates, fundamentally entangled in a web of both social and ecological interactions between people, fire, plants, and animals that make the landscape of country "ngurra-ra", or homeland. These interactions are material manifestations of the creative epoch (The Dreaming), in which people re-enact the process of creation through the maintenance and support of ecological networks.

### Ancient DNA connects large-scale migration with the spread of slavs [^111kqgNq]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Here we present several results in a wide chronological and topographical range, based on fine-grained genetic transect studies of a number of complete cemeteries. Across Central Europe, we show that during the Roman Iron Age and subsequent MP genetic diversity increased not only within the empire, but also outside it. Southeastern Europe experienced an influx from the Eastern Mediterranean, whereas large parts of East-Central Europe were inhabited by people mainly related to modern inhabitants of Northern and Northwestern Europe. We also show a fifth and sixth century admixture of Mediterranean ancestry in Eastern Germany, prevalently but not exclusively through females. They and their offspring became well-integrated in the regional societies, and their burials show no signs of inferior status or cultural differences, a finding very different from those at early medieval cemeteries in Hungary, Italyand Englandwith respect to incoming Northern versus local, Southern and Western European ancestry. Yet, after the fall of the Thuringian kingdom this diverse population gradually disappeared, and the SP began.

### Network of large pedigrees reveals social practices of avar communities [^115pi4c3]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

By generating new genomic data (Supplementary Table 1) from the exhaustive sampling of four fully excavated cemeteries from present-day Hungary, combined with new isotope data and detailed archaeological and anthropological characterization, we aimed to investigate the population structure, kinship and social organization of these communities at a high level of resolution. We identified 298 biologically closely related individuals that allowed us to reconstruct extensive pedigrees and build networks of distant relatedness across the Great Hungarian Plain. We found striking evidence of recurrent patterns that allowed us to trace kinship and social practices, gain insights into the mobility of men and women and refine the chronology of the sites. In the largest cemetery, we were able to identify a community replacement associated with changes in the archaeological record and dietary habits, suggesting local political realignment. This replacement was not accompanied by an ancestry shift and was detected only by changes in the biological relatedness pattern.

### Early crustal processes revealed by the ejection site of the oldest martian meteorite [^115Qw1Av]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The geological record of the formation and differentiation of our planet has been destroyed by its subsequent evolution, but extremely rare clues may be obtained from other terrestrial planets. Mars provides a unique and accessible example of an early evolutionary path corresponding to that, inaccessible, of our own world. We can investigate it with spacecraft, and samples are available for in-depth analysis on Earth in the form of martian meteorites. So far, the only available martian samples that appear to have recorded the early conditions and the evolution of the planet until the present time are Northwest Africa (NWA) 7034 and its paired stones. They are the most diverse martian meteorites in terms of composition, containing a variety of igneous, sedimentary, and impact melt clasts, including the most evolved and oldest igneous clasts and zircons (4.44–4.48 Ga old –, grey bars in Fig. 1). These evolved clasts are derived from a variety of magmas (monzonitic or mugearitic) and probably formed by re-melting of the primary martian crust either at various depths in the presence of volatiles or by differentiation of large impact melt sheets. The abundance of trace elements reported in the old zircon populationindicates a variability of U/Yb ratios, which suggest different types of source rocks and processes for the genesis of these magmas. These old evolved clasts have most likely been excavated by an impact event during the Early Amazonian period, ~1.5 Ga ago,– (green bars in Fig. 1), before being lithifiedand ejected ~ 5 Ma ago, (Methods). Hence, this regolith breccia provides evidence for the formation of evolved crustal material 4.48 Ga ago on Mars –, and contains clues to the early environment and evolution of Mars.

### COVID-19 response in Latin America [^113d1wL6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

On February 29, the first case of COVID-19 in Ecuador was reported in a citizen who traveled from Spain to Guayaquil. The first cluster of cases emerged in early March. By March 23, there were confirmed cases in at least three provinces and close to that date, the first death in Guayaquil. From Guayaquil, the epicenter moved to Quito, the capital.

On March 11, the government declared a "State of Health Emergency in all national health system establishments", including coordination of the national pandemic emergency led by the vice president of the republic with technical experts and the decentralized autonomous governments. On March 16, the national borders were closed. Subsequent measures were the prohibition of large public events, including processions and religious celebrations in agreement with ecclesiastical authorities, and the closure of gyms, cinemas, theaters, concerts, and other entertainment venues and events. On March 23, the government suspended class attendance for students at all levels. By early April, the health system was overwhelmed and many of Ecuador's COVID-19 deaths were reported in the province of Guayas, where corpses were abandoned on the street because local funeral homes were incapable of handling so much work. The government had to implement contingency measures for management of the deceased in Guayaquil, including cardboard coffins and the construction of emergency cemeteries. The government declared a "state of exception", with support from the armed forces, to suspend Ecuadorians' fundamental rights such as the freedoms of transit, assembly, and information. Limited testing capabilities for COVID-19 have hampered Ecuador's response to the pandemic and limited tracking of the real magnitude of the pandemic in the country.

### The military medical school of Mexico: a tradition of excellence [^113ng9DD]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

It is a historical fact that warfare and surgery have been linked together as far back as military history has been recorded. In the 18th century, the tendency of most armies to dismiss their medical services at the end of every major conflict resulted in higher mortality at the beginning of the next war. This became evident in the French and British Armies during the Battle of Waterloo. These countries went to great efforts to mobilize their civilian reserve physicians, only to discover that more than half of the medical personnel declined to serve. The scarcity of physicians and the inexperience of those caring for the wounded resulted in a high casualty rate. The current armed conflicts throughout the world with their high number of victims are living evidence of the need for preparedness of the military medical personnel. In this article, we review the systems of military medical education in several countries, and offer the example of the Escuela Medico Militar (Military Medical School) of Mexico, a prestigious source of military medical physicians for the Mexican armed forces.

### Refugees [^111pyC5V]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

A few kilometers away was the more comprehensive reception center, where the refugees are next sent, on or soon after the day of arrival. Here, in a large field filled with dozens of simple buildings designed to provide services and shelter, refugees are housed for weeks to months until long-term placement can be finalized. The refugees receive housing, food, and additional evaluation and medical care as indicated. At the reception center, there was calm. The children were playful, and the adults seemed to be relaxed, aware that they were now safe, but we saw the effects of what they had been through: set fractures in adults, and the flaxen hair and swollen bellies of malnutrition in some of the children. We could only guess what stories these recent arrivals could tell.

About an hour's drive away, including a ferry across the Nile, is Palorinya, where ∼130,000 refugees have been placed in a rural district. Here, refugees begin their lives anew, with the opportunity to build simple housing and farm small plots. Their children attend local schools, allowing integration with local communities. Nearby shops, run by both refugees and members of the local population, offer basic services. The refugee camp might be mistaken for any rural African village, except that it is bigger and probably more organized than most, and that it includes nearby administrative complexes and warehouses managed by the government of Uganda and non-governmental organizations. With the exception of these additional facilities, the camp blends into the local community, and it was difficult for me to appreciate which homes and shops were in the refugee camp and which were part of the local community.

Explosive outbursts (EO) by students are an intensely distressing experience for that student as well as for all school staff and students present during the outburst. These EO are characterized by rapid escalations, usually far out of proportion to precipitating events, may include significant verbal and/or physical aggression, require intensive staff intervention, are often difficult for the student to process, and are typically recurrent. These explosions cross multiple psychiatric and educational diagnostic categories and require diverse interventions to address behavioral, emotional, impulsive, and sensory components. Interventions for each stage of an EO can be used to deescalate these events.

Adolph Barkan, a mid-19th century Central European-born and -trained ophthalmologist, spent almost half his nearly 91 years in a very successful career on the West Coast of the United States. His activities included intimate involvement in the development of a private medical school and with this school's acquisition by Stanford University as its medical school. In retirement, he founded, financed, and stocked a large medical history library at that university. In the 1890s, Siegfried Czapski, the developer of the Carl Zeiss corneal biomicroscope, the direct precursor of today's slitlamp, incorporated Barkan's suggestion that Czapski replace the planned monoscopic binocular microscope with a stereoscopic binocular one, an essential modification of the device. This Zeiss invention lacked only the slit illumination of today's instrument. Comments he wrote in a memoir-diary during World War I explain how he came to the decision to stray and to stay so far from his roots.

### Emergence of medicine for mass gatherings: lessons from the hajj [^116Ux9wz]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Although definitions of mass gatherings (MG) vary greatly, they consist of large numbers of people attending an event at a specific site for a finite time. Examples of MGs include World Youth Day, the summer and winter Olympics, rock concerts, and political rallies. Some of the largest MGs are spiritual in nature. Among all MGs, the public health issues, associated with the Hajj (an annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia) is clearly the best reported-probably because of its international or even intercontinental implications in terms of the spread of infectious disease. Hajj routinely attracts 2.5 million Muslims for worship. WHO's global health initiatives have converged with Saudi Arabia's efforts to ensure the wellbeing of pilgrims, contain infectious diseases, and reinforce global health security through the management of the Hajj. Both initiatives emphasise the importance of MG health policies guided by sound evidence and based on experience and the timeliness of calls for a new academic science-based specialty of MG medicine.

### School based education programme to reduce salt intake in children and their families (school-eduSalt): cluster randomised controlled trial [^1132pGuh]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

A detailed description of the methods of the School-EduSalt study has been published elsewhere.

Study design and participants

The study was a cluster randomised controlled trial. Primary schools in urban Changzhi were eligible. We excluded schools in rural areas to avoid contamination from school meals as some children in such schools have lunch and dinner at school because of the long distance from home, whereas in urban schools most children have lunch and dinner at home.

There are 36 primary schools in urban Changzhi. We excluded eight schools: three special Muslim schools, two schools that were far from the study centre, and three schools with headteachers who were not willing to participate. The 28 remaining schools were included.

In primary schools in Changzhi, there are six grades for children aged 7–12. Our study was carried out in grade 5 children (age about 10) only. From each school, we selected one class (if there was more than one) in grade 5. With the headteacher we selected a class whose teacher in charge was willing to collaborate with the researchers.

We used a random number list (created by a researcher who was blind to the identity of the participants) to randomly select children from each class until 10 children were recruited. To be eligible for inclusion in the assessments, children had to eat homemade meals at least three days a week and live not too far from the school (< 3 km). In two schools where the class had fewer than 15 children, we invited all children to take part in the assessments.

From each child's family we invited two adults for assessments. All adults who shared the same meals with the child were eligible. If more than two adults in one family were willing to participate, we selected two of them (one man and one woman) in the order of grandparents, parents, uncles, and aunts.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Experiences and impact of psychiatric inpatient admissions far away from home: a qualitative study with young people, parents / carers and healthcare professionals [^113mxpGd]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Continuity of care

Home leave

Opportunities for YP to have home leave (either during the day or overnight) were limited due to distances involved. As a result, YP reported feeling daunted by the prospect of being discharged without first experiencing periods of home leave. One YP explained how their parent had to learn to drive to facilitate home visits. Another YP had concerns that if they were to experience any difficulties with their mental health while at home, they may struggle to return to the unit (Q1) — see table 4.

Table 4
Continuity of care theme quotations

HCPs also highlighted challenges around organising leave, resulting in feelings of frustration for YP and sometimes even exacerbating their mental health difficulties because of long distances and limited flexibility (Q2, Q3).

Discharge planning and returning home

For near-home admissions, some were able to access their school or college work through this being brought in by their parents/carers. Support for the transition period back home was harder if the admission was far away. YP explained how, after improving, they could not easily attend their usual school (Q4). Due to difficulties in communication with their usual school while in the unit, many YP indicated missing a lot of school. They explained finding reintegration into school difficult and needing reduced timetables and 1:1 sessions to try to catch up. For some YP, schools showed understanding about their difficulties and one YP was able to access their work remotely. However, overall, additional support was not provided for those far from home (Q7). HCPs noted that YP rejoining/starting school or college later than peers could adversely impact reintegration.

Poor communication between agencies created uncertainties, prolonging discharge. Some reported how the long wait for a placement was stressful. Conversely, some YP remained in contact with their care coordinator from their local team while in hospital, and others found their schools and colleges were accommodating (Q8). HCPs often recognised the distances involved could lead to challenges linking up with local social care services (Q6).

Some HCPs suggested that separation from usual peer groups combined with being exposed to other patients could be detrimental to the YP. They believed that the prolonged separation from the child's home environment often led to a loss of confidence in their own home setting or exacerbated the risk of institutionalisation (Q5).

### Ancient genomes reveal insights into ritual life at chichén itz á [^1152KKrq]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Archaeological and geographical context

Chichén Itzá was one of the largest and most influential Maya cities of the Terminal Classic Period and today stands as an iconic archaeological site among the most representative of pre-Hispanic monumental architecture in the Americas (Fig. 1). The architecture of the site consists of several different styles, with some of the structures resembling those found in Central Mexico (Teotihuacan, Tula) and in the Puuc and Chenes regions (northeastern and central Yucatan, respectively) of the Maya lowlands. The Maya Puuc style represents the second phase of the Florescent period in the Yucatan Peninsula (750–800). Ceramic types and epigraphic and radiometric data suggest that the city emerged as a chief regional political centre in the first half of the nineth century and stayed as such until probably the first half of the eleventh century. The ancient samples used in this study belonged to individuals whose skeletons were recovered from the archaeological excavations of a chultún (cistern) connected to a natural cave within the archaeological site of Chichén Itzá, Yucatán, Mexico. Chultúns were mostly used from the Middle Preclassic to the Late Classic-Postclassic periods (1000–1600) in Mesoamerica from the northern Maya lowlands of the Yucatan peninsula to modern-day Belize and Guatemala in the southern Maya lowlands. The sampled skeletons, which have been studied using anthropometry and osteology guidelines at the Centro INAH Yucatán, were recovered between April and June 1967, during the construction of a new runway close to El Castillo ('The Castle', the main basament of the archaeological site and a building with special calendrical significance,) and 300 m northeast to the Sacred Cenote of Chichén Itzá. The chultún had stones that had been worked in the style that characterized the Florescent period, which would indicate that it had been built around the Late or Terminal Classic periods of Chichén Itzá. The chamber and the adjacent cave contained many skeletal remains, some of them in anatomical position. The many skeletons and the position in which they were found, as well as them being covered by mostly undisturbed bark and limestone powder, are mostly consistent with a mixed secondary/primary burial with periodic clearance, which points to the burial having a cultural motivation, probably as an offeringrelated to an important and recurring ceremony. There was a minimum of 106 skeletons of infants and young children (according to the number of temporal bones) without any apparent ordering or anatomical context, except for a group of skulls and skullcaps aligned from north to south from the wall separating the chamber and the cave to the southern limit of the cave. Many ceramic and clay objects, as well as animal bone remains, were also found in the cave. The ceramic styles and the archaeological context indicate that the chultún was used during the Florescent period, contemporary to the use of another ritual cave near Chichén Itzá known as Balankanché (860 ± 130). A radiocarbon test on a sample of the bark covering the bones from the chultún burial has also suggested a use date of around920 ± 60. However, our 14 C dates (Supplementary Fig. 2) suggest that the ritual burial was performed both before (around600) and after (around1100) the Florescent period. According to the age determination by tooth eruption method, most (about 50%) of the subadult individuals were found to belong to the age group of 3–6 years old. The fact that the age of the children differs from the age group normally related to death in children associated with infectious diseases according to palaeodemography,– further supports the interpretation of this burial as a sacrificial offering.

### Later school start times for supporting the education, health, and well-being of high school students [^111yD7KL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

A number of school systems worldwide have proposed and implemented later school start times as a means of avoiding the potentially negative impacts that early morning schedules can have on adolescent students. Even mild sleep deprivation has been associated with significant health and educational concerns: increased risk for accidents and injuries, impaired learning, aggression, memory loss, poor self-esteem, and changes in metabolism. Although researchers have begun to explore the effects of delayed school start time, no one has conducted a rigorous review of evidence to determine whether later school start times support adolescent health, education, and well-being.

Objectives

We aimed to assess the effects of a later school start time for supporting health, education, and well-being in high school students. Secondary objectives were to explore possible differential effects of later school start times in student subgroups and in different types of schools; to identify implementation practices, contextual factors, and delivery modes associated with positive and negative effects of later start times; and to assess the effects of later school start times on the broader community (high school faculty and staff, neighborhood, and families).

Search Methods

We conducted the main search for this review on 28 October 2014 and updated it on 8 February 2016. We searched CENTRAL as well as 17 key electronic databases (including MEDLINE, Embase, ERIC, PsycINFO, and Sociological Abstracts), current editions of relevant journals and organizational websites, trial registries, and Google Scholar.

Selection Criteria

We included any randomized controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies, and interrupted time series studies with sufficient data points that pertained to students aged 13 to 19 years and that compared different school start times. Studies that reported either primary outcomes of interest (academic outcomes, amount or quality of sleep, mental health indicators, attendance, or alertness) or secondary outcomes (health behaviors, health and safety indicators, social outcomes, family outcomes, school outcomes, or community outcomes) were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

At least two review authors independently determined inclusion and exclusion decisions through screening titles, abstracts, and full-text reports. Two review authors independently extracted data for all eligible studies. We presented findings through a narrative synthesis across all studies. When two or more study samples provided sufficient information to permit effect size calculations, we conducted random-effects meta-analyses to synthesize effects across studies.

Main Results

Our search located 17 eligible records reporting on 11 unique studies with 297,994 participants; the studies examined academic outcomes, amount and quality of sleep, mental health indicators, attendance, and student alertness. Overall, the quality of the body of evidence was very low, as we rated most studies as being at high or unclear risk of bias with respect to allocation, attrition, absence of randomization, and the collection of baseline data. Therefore, we cannot be confident about the effects of later school start times. Preliminary evidence from the included studies indicated a potential association between later school start times and academic and psychosocial outcomes, but quality and comparability of these data were low and often precluded quantitative synthesis. Four studies examined the association between later school start times and academic outcomes, reporting mixed results. Six studies examined effects on total amount of sleep and reported significant, positive relationships between later school start times and amount of sleep. One study provided information concerning mental health outcomes, reporting an association between decreased depressive symptoms and later school start times. There were mixed results for the association between later school start times and absenteeism. Three studies reported mixed results concerning the association between later school start times and student alertness. There was limited indication of potential adverse effects on logistics, as the qualitative portions of one study reported less interaction between parents and children, and another reported staffing and scheduling difficulties. Because of the insufficient evidence, we cannot draw firm conclusions concerning adverse effects at this time. It is important to note the limitations of this evidence, especially as randomized controlled trials and high-quality primary studies are difficult to conduct; school systems are often unwilling or unable to allow researchers the necessary control over scheduling and data collection. Moreover, this evidence does not speak to the process of implementing later school starts, as the included studies focused on reporting the effects rather than exploring the process.

Authors' Conclusions

This systematic review on later school start times suggests several potential benefits for this intervention and points to the need for higher quality primary studies. However, as a result of the limited evidence base, we could not determine the effects of later school start times with any confidence.

### Interventions to prevent obesity in children aged 12 to 18 years old [^116J3KJD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Prevention of obesity in adolescents is an international public health priority. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is over 25% in North and South America, Australia, most of Europe, and the Gulf region. Interventions that aim to prevent obesity involve strategies that promote healthy diets or 'activity' levels (physical activity, sedentary behaviour and/or sleep) or both, and work by reducing energy intake and/or increasing energy expenditure, respectively. There is uncertainty over which approaches are more effective, and numerous new studies have been published over the last five years since the previous version of this Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions that aim to prevent obesity in adolescents by modifying dietary intake or 'activity' levels, or a combination of both, on changes in BMI, zBMI score and serious adverse events.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was February 2023.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials in adolescents (mean age 12 years and above but less than 19 years), comparing diet or 'activity' interventions (or both) to prevent obesity with no intervention, usual care, or with another eligible intervention, in any setting. Studies had to measure outcomes at a minimum of 12 weeks post baseline. We excluded interventions designed primarily to improve sporting performance.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our outcomes were BMI, zBMI score and serious adverse events, assessed at short- (12 weeks to < 9 months from baseline), medium- (9 months to < 15 months) and long-term (≥ 15 months) follow-up. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This review includes 74 studies (83,407 participants); 54 studies (46,358 participants) were included in meta-analyses. Sixty studies were based in high-income countries. The main setting for intervention delivery was schools (57 studies), followed by home (nine studies), the community (five studies) and a primary care setting (three studies). Fifty-one interventions were implemented for less than nine months; the shortest was conducted over one visit and the longest over 28 months. Sixty-two studies declared non-industry funding; five were funded in part by industry. Dietary interventions versus control The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of dietary interventions on body mass index (BMI) at short-term follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.41 to 0.06; 3 studies, 605 participants), medium-term follow-up (MD -0.65, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.11; 3 studies, 900 participants), and standardised BMI (zBMI) at long-term follow-up (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.10; 2 studies, 1089 participants); all very low-certainty evidence. Compared with control, dietary interventions may have little to no effect on BMI at long-term follow-up (MD -0.30, 95% CI -1.67 to 1.07; 1 study, 44 participants); zBMI at short-term (MD -0.06, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.01; 5 studies, 3154 participants); and zBMI at medium-term (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.21; 1 study, 112 participants) follow-up; all low-certainty evidence. Dietary interventions may have little to no effect on serious adverse events (two studies, 377 participants; low-certainty evidence). Activity interventions versus control Compared with control, activity interventions do not reduce BMI at short-term follow-up (MD -0.64, 95% CI -1.86 to 0.58; 6 studies, 1780 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably do not reduce zBMI at medium- (MD 0, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.05; 6 studies, 5335 participants) or long-term (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.02; 1 study, 985 participants) follow-up; both moderate-certainty evidence. Activity interventions do not reduce zBMI at short-term follow-up (MD 0.02, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.05; 7 studies, 4718 participants; high-certainty evidence), but may reduce BMI slightly at medium-term (MD -0.32, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.11; 3 studies, 2143 participants) and long-term (MD -0.28, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.05; 1 study, 985 participants) follow-up; both low-certainty evidence. Seven studies (5428 participants; low-certainty evidence) reported data on serious adverse events: two reported injuries relating to the exercise component of the intervention and five reported no effect of intervention on reported serious adverse events. Dietary and activity interventions versus control Dietary and activity interventions, compared with control, do not reduce BMI at short-term follow-up (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.13; 11 studies, 3429 participants; high-certainty evidence), and probably do not reduce BMI at medium-term (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.11; 8 studies, 5612 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) or long-term (MD 0.06, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.16; 6 studies, 8736 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) follow-up. They may have little to no effect on zBMI in the short term, but the evidence is very uncertain (MD -0.09, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.02; 3 studies, 515 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and they may not reduce zBMI at medium-term (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.1 to 0.01; 6 studies, 3511 participants; low-certainty evidence) or long-term (MD -0.02, 95% CI -0.05 to 0.01; 7 studies, 8430 participants; low-certainty evidence) follow-up. Four studies (2394 participants) reported data on serious adverse events (very low-certainty evidence): one reported an increase in weight concern in a few adolescents and three reported no effect.

Authors' Conclusions

The evidence demonstrates that dietary interventions may have little to no effect on obesity in adolescents. There is low-certainty evidence that activity interventions may have a small beneficial effect on BMI at medium- and long-term follow-up. Diet plus activity interventions may result in little to no difference. Importantly, this updated review also suggests that interventions to prevent obesity in this age group may result in little to no difference in serious adverse effects. Limitations of the evidence include inconsistent results across studies, lack of methodological rigour in some studies and small sample sizes. Further research is justified to investigate the effects of diet and activity interventions to prevent childhood obesity in community settings, and in young people with disabilities, since very few ongoing studies are likely to address these. Further randomised trials to address the remaining uncertainty about the effects of diet, activity interventions, or both, to prevent childhood obesity in schools (ideally with zBMI as the measured outcome) would need to have larger samples.

### Individual medical emergencies occurring at school [^113SAjgv]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

School emergency response systems and roles — it is ideal that protocols include algorithms for determining levels of emergencies, and minor illnesses or injuries are to be distinguished from emergencies requiring EMS activation. Each school should have an efficient and effective campuswide communication system with local EMS, and it is important that the EMS activation process is clear to all staff. In the event of a medical emergency within school jurisdiction, the emergency response includes school nurses and school staff, who will interact with EMS personnel, and ongoing communication, review, drills, and practice of procedures ensure achievement of this level of integration; the drills should preferably include school personnel and the EMS system. Participation of physical facilities administrators in the planning ensures that the most efficient access routes to the school, as well as floor plans, are available to EMS. Clarity of school staff roles in an emergency is essential for smooth response, and ideally, the school nurse in each building should be the key person to develop and implement the emergency plan; in the absence of a school nurse, members of the school health and safety team are designated, trained, and empowered to make decisions concerning health emergencies. Names, telephone numbers, and locations of those designated and trained school personnel are to be provided to all staff members, and the school health services director (or equivalent), with support from the district school health advisory council and/or school board, is responsible for implementing the necessary initial and refresher trainings of school staff, assessing competency, and ensuring that school districts budget for adequate resources.

### A transient pulse of genetic admixture from the crusaders in the near east identified from ancient genome sequences [^112XE916]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2019). Medium credibility.

During the medieval period, hundreds of thousands of Europeans migrated to the Near East to take part in the Crusades, and many of them settled in the newly established Christian states along the Eastern Mediterranean coast. Here, we present a genetic snapshot of these events and their aftermath by sequencing the whole genomes of 13 individuals who lived in what is today known as Lebanon between the 3 rd and 13 th centuries CE. These include nine individuals from the "Crusaders' pit" in Sidon, a mass burial in South Lebanon identified from the archaeology as the grave of Crusaders killed during a battle in the 13 th century CE. We show that all of the Crusaders' pit individuals were males; some were Western Europeans from diverse origins, some were locals (genetically indistinguishable from present-day Lebanese), and two individuals were a mixture of European and Near Eastern ancestries, providing direct evidence that the Crusaders admixed with the local population. However, these mixtures appear to have had limited genetic consequences since signals of admixture with Europeans are not significant in any Lebanese group today-in particular, Lebanese Christians are today genetically similar to local people who lived during the Roman period which preceded the Crusades by more than four centuries.

### Shaping school for childhood myopia: the association between floor area ratio of school environment and myopia in China [^112WiPuL]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Floor area ratio

FAR is a fundamental metric for urban morphology, with a higher value representing larger school building space. The value of FAR is calculated by dividing the total floor area of buildings by the land area within each school (figure 2). The total floor area of a building is determined by multiplying the area of each floor by the floor number. The determination of building floor numbers involved two steps. First, we calculated an initial estimate of the floor number by dividing the building height by three metres, aligning with the minimum floor height (National Standard of the People's Republic of China, GB50099-2011). Second, we rectified discrepancies in floor numbers with reference to online 360°street-view photographs (, accessed on 10 October 2018), considering that certain building features such as decorative rooftop additions might not be excluded from overall height calculations.

Figure 2
The calculation of FAR for each primary school. FAR is calculated by dividing the total floor area of buildings (represented in yellow) by the site area (represented in green). It should be noted that all school buildings included in this study were non-high-rise structures (less than nine floors). FAR, floor area ratio.

For the determination of building heights, we adopted the traditional satellite stereo matching approach, employing data from the Gaofen-2 satellite images of different view angles (online supplemental figure S1). This satellite can provide high resolution camera (0.8 m panchromatic and 3.2 m multispectral) data. By leveraging multiview three-dimensional reconstruction techniques, we constructed a fusion digital surface model (DSM), enabling the creation of high-precision urban models including height information. For building detection to filter floor plans, we employed the Sat2LOD2 open source software, combining DSM with the street network from Open Street Maps (, accessed on 15 May 2018) to aid in establishing more accurate floor plans (building footprint) (online supplemental figure S1). In order to test building segmentation performance in a Chinese megacity, we incorporated data from Shanghai, which shares a similar strategic coastal location and dense buildings with Shenzhen, that includes reliable ground truth information. The achieved overall accuracy at the pixel level was 95.47%.

After delineating the school boundary, the value of FAR for each school was calculated using ArcGIS software (V.10.3, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, California, USA).

### Screening, diagnosis, and management of gestational diabetes mellitus… [^117MyT1a]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

2, 21 No data suggest the superiority of one-hour vs. two-hour postprandial monitoring, so either is acceptable. Less intensive glucose monitoring is appropriate for women with GDM that is well controlled with diet and exercise. 1, 2. 33 Another approach is to initiate medications if 50% of the values in a given week are elevated. 34 Glycemic control, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and adverse effects are similar among patients treated with oral hypoglycemic medications vs. insulin. 37–39 One approach to starting insulin therapy is to calculate a total daily dosage of 0. 7 to

1. 0 units per kg. Half of the total daily requirement is administered as a single dose of long-acting insulin, and the other half is administered in three divided doses at mealtimes as rapid-acting insulin. 2 Insulin dosing should be individualized and adjusted as needed.

An algorithm for the management of GDM is presented in Figure 1. 1,
2. Timing and Route of Delivery The optimal timing of delivery in pregnancies complicated by GDM is unclear. Given the neonatal risks associated with early term births, induction of labor before 39 weeks should occur only if glycemic control remains poor despite medication use, or if another indication for delivery is present. 49 Although ACOG has not made an evidence-based recommendation on the ideal timing of delivery for patients with GDM, many physicians offer induction between 39 and 40 weeks, particularly for patients with other risks of stillbirth. For women with GDM and an estimated fetal weight greater than 4, 500 g, scheduled cesarean delivery, compared with vaginal birth, reduces the risk of permanent brachial plexus injury, although the number needed to treat may be as high as 588.

50 It is reasonable to offer a scheduled cesarean delivery to these patients, although they should be counseled on the difficulty of accurately estimating fetal weight and the risks associated with cesarean delivery in the index pregnancy and future pregnancies.
2. 51 It may be reasonable to have women with GDM use only one-half of their usual dose of long-acting insulin the day of delivery. Clinicians should prepare to manage shoulder dystocia at the time of delivery and exercise caution when considering an operative vaginal delivery.

### Behind the wheel at work-vol 7 No 2… [^111q4pRK]. archive.cdc.gov (2023). Medium credibility.

The higher the speed, the more deadly the crash as speeding can reduce a driver's ability to negotiate curves or move around obstacles in the roadway. Speeding is illegal and endangers not only the lives of the occupants in the speeding vehicle, but all of the people on the road around them, including law enforcement officers. In the United States, driving over the speed limit or too fast for conditions is the factor cited most often by law enforcement officers when they investigate a fatal crash. A driver needs at least 1 second to react. The faster you drive, the farther your car will continue to travel before it can stop. This means you're more likely to crash. And, the faster you drive, the greater the amount of mechanical energy that must be absorbed by the impact. This means you're more likely to be killed or seriously injured. The graphic below shows the relationship between speed and crash type.

Motor vehicle crashes related to speeding in 2020 Speeding means that the driver is going faster than the speed limit. It also includes driving too fast for road or weather conditions, even if you're not going over the speed limit. Did you know. The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that for most vehicles, gas mileage usually decreases rapidly at speeds above 50 mph. In general, each 5 mph you drive over 50 mph is like paying an additional 20 cents a gallon for gas. The bottom line: Reduce speeding. Driving within the speed limit keeps drivers and others on the road safer. As an employer, you can take steps to promote safe speeds and inform workers who drive on the job how to stay safe behind the wheel.
- In driver training, convey messages about the dangers and consequences of speeding, emphasize that speed must also be adjusted to suit road conditions.
- Remind drivers to observe posted speed limits, especially in school zones and work zones.
- Consider using in-vehicle monitoring systems that can identify speeding by comparing vehicle speed to the speed limit for the road.
- Consider "speed governors" or "speed limiters, " used primarily on large trucks that keep the vehicle from exceeding a set maximum speed.
- Allow more time for your trips to avoid the need for speeding.
- Pay attention to warning signs and follow reduced speed limits, especially in school zones and work zones.
- Pay closer attention to the speedometer to see how fast you are driving.

### How do we fight COVID-19? Military medical actions in the war against the COVID-19 pandemic in France [^113D1Jyo]. BMJ Military Health (2021). High credibility.

' We are at war ', French President Emmanuel Macron said in an address to the nation on 16 March 2020. As part of this national effort, the French Military Medical Service (FMMS) is committed to the fight against COVID-19. This original report aimed to describe and detail actions that the FMMS has carried out in the nationwide fight against the COVID-19 pandemic in France, as well as overseas. Experts in the field reported major actions conducted by the FMMS during the COVID-19 pandemic in France. In just few weeks, the FMMS developed ad hoc medical capabilities to support national health authorities. It additionally developed adaptive, collective en route care via aeromedical and naval units and deployed a military intensive care field hospital. A COVID-19 crisis cell coordinated the French Armed Forces health management. The French Military Centre for Epidemiology and Public Health provided all information needed to guide the decision-making process. Medical centres of the French Armed Forces organised the primary care for military patients, with the widespread use of telemedicine. The Paris Fire Brigade and the Marseille Navy Fire Battalion emergency departments ensured prehospital management of patients with COVID-19. The eight French military training hospitals cooperated with civilian regional health agencies. The French military medical supply chain supported all military medical treatment facilities in France as well as overseas, coping with a growing shortage of medical equipment. The French Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute performed diagnostics, engaged in multiple research projects, updated the review of the scientific literature on COVID-19 daily and provided expert recommendations on biosafety. Finally, even students of the French military medical academy volunteered to participate in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, in an unprecedented medical crisis, the FMMS engaged multiple innovative and adaptive actions, which are still ongoing, in the fight against COVID-19. The collaboration between military and civilian healthcare systems reinforced the shared objective to achieve the goal of 'saving the greatest number'.

### Individual medical emergencies occurring at school [^111BPwQM]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement — individual medical emergencies occurring at school — updates prior guidance and outlines preparations and recommendations for individual student emergencies. It serves as an update of the statement published in 2008 and reaffirmed in 2017 and follows an earlier 2001 policy statement and a 2008 revision. It intends to increase pediatricians' awareness of schools' roles and provide recommendations for the medical home and school physicians on how to assist and support school personnel, and it does not address schoolwide or communitywide emergencies that might occur as a result of natural or man-made disasters. Rationale notes that it is estimated that 10% to 25% of childhood injuries occur while the child is in school and describes added challenges to ensure schools have access to on-site, licensed health care professionals on an ongoing basis that have contributed to added risks that medical and nonmedical personnel face, alongside a pool of students with special health care needs who may require special equipment, preparation, training of personnel, medications and supplies, and/or transport.

### The impact of state policies for school-based BMI / fitness assessments on children's BMI outcomes in rural versus urban schools: evidence from a natural experiment [^112CCrJA]. Preventive Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Childhood obesity remains a public health crisis because of its alarming prevalence and potential for costly long-term health consequences, especially among rural children. Schools are considered natural loci for policies to combat obesity because children spend most of their active hours and consume a substantial share of their calories, at school. Recent state policy efforts have involved measuring children's BMI and/or fitness to notify parents or inform surveillance efforts, but the empirical evidence to date is far from definitive. This study leverages plausibly exogenous assignment of military families as a natural experiment to assess the association of such polices with children's BMI and obesogenic behaviors. The sample is stratified by urbanicity because of the likely differences in obesity prevalence and in environments necessary to support healthy lifestyles. Data were collected in 2013–2014 and analyzed in 2018–9. The policies were associated with lower odds of overweight (OR: 0.422; CI: 0.251–0.708) and at-risk of overweight (OR: 0.360; CI: 0.161–0.801) among children in rural, but not urban, schools. The policies were also associated with greater activity levels and less frequent intake of unhealthy foods, particularly among children attending rural schools. Results were robust to stratification based on urbanicity of the installation versus school, omission of family covariates, and other sensitivity analyses. Falsification checks on children's height, parental BMI outcomes, home food environments and neighborhood environments indicate findings are not driven by selection. BMI assessment policies were associated with children's BMI outcomes and health behaviors in rural, but not urban schools.

Note:

If the EluRyng feels uncomfortable, you may not have pushed the ring into your vagina far enough. Use your finger to gently push the EluRyng as far as you can into your vagina. There is no danger of EluRyng being pushed too far up in the vagina or getting lost (See Figure G).
Some women have accidentally inserted EluRyng into their bladder. If you have pain during or after insertion and you cannot find EluRyng in your vagina, call your healthcare provider right away.
Regularly check that EluRyng is in your vagina (for example, before and after intercourse) to ensure you are protected from pregnancy.

Step 5. How do I remove EluRyng?

Wash and dry your hands.
Choose the position that is most comfortable for you (See Figures A, B, and C).
Put your index finger into your vagina and hook it through the EluRyng. Gently pull downward and forward to remove the EluRyng and pull it out (See Figure J).

### Global health degrees: at what cost? [^114NNhRb]. BMJ Global Health (2020). High credibility.

We focused on tuition fees for the entire degree programme rather than the annual tuition fees, since duration of degree programme varied from 1 to 3 years, with some degrees structured in such a way that students' graduation time was tied to their experiences and training garnered prior to programme entry. Thus, it should be noted that when the final cost was calculated this was based on the typical time to graduation indicated either on the website itself or by the respective school's programme coordinator. In most European schools, fees are fixed regardless of how long a student takes to complete their degree. However, in North America time to graduation can be quite variable and students usually pay tuition for each semester or credit. This is particularly true of the US system where a degree cost can vary substantially between students. We chose to calculate total tuition based on a typical student's experience as suggested by either the school's website or the coordinator.

In addition, some programmes require a project (eg, summer practicum) be conducted in elsewhere (typically, a low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) — the costs for these were not always absorbed by the tuition fees. While some students had their costs for projects abroad covered by a supervisor and others could apply for scholarships, the remainder would have to pay for the additional costs out of pocket. This information was not transparent across degree programmes.

Given the difficulty in collecting data on tuition itself, we did not quantify cost of living directly for each school. Rather, we aimed to account for differences in living costs for any given school using an adjustment measure used by the International Civil Service Commission (ICSC), established by the United Nations (UN). The UN postadjustment system is designed to ensure that the net remuneration pay of UN staffers garners an equivalent purchasing power to that same staffer at the base of the system, New York City, regardless of their posting location. Post adjustment multiplier considers differences in prices between the city in question and New York; local inflation; exchange rate of local currency relative to the USD; and average expenditure pattern of staff members currently at a given location. The multiplier is adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the cost of living in a given city. We used the multiplier from the March 2020 update. All cost information was converted into US dollars using the ICSC conversion factor (March 2020 update) to make international comparisons possible.

### High school start times and the impact on high school students: what we know, and what we hope to learn [^115XgE2N]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

Several organizations have provided recommendations to ensure high school starts no sooner than 08:30. However, although there are plausible biological reasons to support such recommendations, published recommendations have been based largely on expert opinion and a few observational studies. We sought to perform a critical review of published evidence regarding the effect of high school start times on sleep and other relevant outcomes.

Methods

We performed a broad literature search to identify 287 candidate publications for inclusion in our review, which focused on studies offering direct comparison of sleep time, academic or physical performance, behavioral health measures, or motor vehicular accidents in high school students. Where possible, outcomes were combined for meta-analysis.

Results

After application of study criteria, only 18 studies were suitable for review. Eight studies were amenable to meta-analysis for some outcomes. We found that later school start times, particularly when compared with start times more than 60 min earlier, are associated with longer weekday sleep durations, lower weekday-weekend sleep duration differences, reduced vehicular accident rates, and reduced subjective daytime sleepiness. Improvement in academic performance and behavioral issues is less established.

Conclusions

The literature regarding effect of school start time delays on important aspects of high school life suggests some salutary effects, but often the evidence is indirect, imprecise, or derived from cohorts of convenience, making the overall quality of evidence weak or very weak. This review highlights a need for higher-quality data upon which to base important and complex public health decisions.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^112uwgAT]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β₂ -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β₂ -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Shaping school for childhood myopia: the association between floor area ratio of school environment and myopia in China [^112CLkje]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Floor area ratio (FAR), the ratio of the total floor area of buildings to the land area they occupied, serves as a comprehensive indicator for urban morphology, reflecting both building space therein and the land utilisation. For schools with identical site areas, a lower value of FAR indicates a reduction in the total floor area for schools. A geographical information systems (GIS) is a computer system used for storing and managing geographically referenced information, which has been widely applied in various fields including natural, social and medical sciences. By linking health data with maps through geographical or spatial connections, it helps us study the spatiotemporal distribution of various diseases and screen their risk factors at a population level, such as infectious diseases and cancer. The current study has employed satellite images and open-source data to develop a GIS map, enabling the modelling of school buildings and the convenient quantification of FAR, which is more objective and efficient, especially compared with data obtained through questionnaires. This longitudinal cohort study has investigated the association between FAR and myopia incidence in children from 108 primary schools in Shenzhen, offering innovative population-scale myopia prevention from a perspective of school planning and reconstruction.

The following are specified: (1) Students with CF should be placed in separate classrooms; if they must use the same classroom at different times, then they should not use the same desk or work station. (2) Students with CF should be assigned different restrooms, encouraged to carry their own water bottles, avoid using public water fountains or use different water fountains, and have lockers as far as possible from each other. (3) Students with CF should be scheduled separately for common activities, including lunch, physical education, and recess. (4) Students with CF should be assigned to separate offices to report for routine medications or if they become ill while at school. (5) Students with CF should not be excluded from group activities, such as large assemblies or pep rallies.

### Soccer and vocational training are ineffective delivery strategies to prevent HIV and substance abuse by young, South African men: a cluster randomized controlled trial [^113Syq7G]. AIDS and Behavior (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We hypothesize that both soccer and vocational training must be initiated far earlier, before the start of high school. It may be too late in early adulthood to entice men to return to school. Many had dropped out of traditional school by 10th grade. It had been a long time since their last class. Making job skills an integral part of high school and making high school a place where recreational activities such as soccer routinely occur may be a far better option than trying to create such activities in adulthood or expecting them to change behaviors. In addition, a national commitment to creating apprenticeship vocational training programs is likely a far more attractive intervention model than those currently being offered.

The role of the GMC

In 1957, the GMC, which had been created 99 years earlier,

'abandoned the principle of recommending a prescribed minimal curriculum to the medical schools… Instead it issued 'Recommendations' which were most permissive, reminded the schools that they were responsible for designing their own curricula, and exhorted them to experiment'.

In the years that followed, how and what teaching was actually taking place in each medical school became far less clear, despite many undoubted changes in medical school curricula. Liberalisation mainly followed on from Tomorrow's Doctors in 1993, but it is far from clear what the effects were. That problem mattered relatively little until the past decade when pressure from the NHS and HEE forced questions to be asked about the effects of different formats of medical training, with answers in short supply. The research solution required data from medical schools, but historically, medical schools have been reluctant to publish data which might allow differences between them to be inferred, as notionally all are equivalent via GMC accreditation. However, indirect evidence has slowly emerged over the years suggesting that any idea of equivalence was incorrect. The time has come, as the GMC itself realises, for proper comparative data from medical schools to be made available.

The GMC, in the context of a report on the extent to which medical students are prepared for foundation practice, has overviewed medical school differences quite generally. It began by saying that:

'Variation between medical schools in the interests, abilities and career progression of their graduates is inevitable and not in itself a cause for concern… '

Inevitably a statement such as that is followed by caveats, and the overall tenor of the report is that medical school differences do matter, or at least might matter. We consider the relationship between medical school teaching differences and a range of other measures such as the qualifications of entrants, the resources available, the perceptions of teaching, and the outcomes in foundation training and postgraduate examinations in the MedDifs study. The purpose of the present study is to provide a conceptual map of medical school teaching and the differences that occur, with the impact of those differences considered later.

### Interim planning guidance for preparedness and response to a mass casualty event resulting from terrorist use of explosives [^116Qi5NH]. CDC (2010). Medium credibility.

Learn from others — Many useful lessons can be learned and adapted from real health system responses to civilian terrorist bombings in the United States and abroad (e.g. Israel, the United Kingdom, Spain, India, Pakistan, Turkey). The body of literature in disaster medical preparedness is growing, much of it related to the response to terrorist bombings, and a review of this literature, interviews with individuals involved, and site visits to locations of previous bombing incidents provide many useful lessons that can be adapted for bombing terrorism preparedness and response in the United States. This effort can provide information on both clinical care and systems issues and highlight effective strategies, bottlenecks, challenges, and lessons learned.

### Cardiopulmonary resuscitation and public access defibrillation in the current era – can we do better yet? [^116RpHGh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The study reported by Iwami, et al also documented very interesting outcomes associated with OHCA at schools. In their study 80% of OHCA events at schools had ventricular fibrillation as the first documented rhythm, 67% received a public access AED shock in 2010 and 42% had neurologically favorable outcomes. Of note is the important fact that previous studies – had indeed documented that OHCA at schools occurred more frequently than expected. In the Iwami paper it is documented that the school PAD program has contributed favorably to the improving outcomes of both the teachers and the students. In our own experience with Project ADAM, instituted in November of 1999 after the sudden cardiac arrest of several young, asymptomatic athletes in the Milwaukee area, we have disseminated CPR‐AED education across the state of Wisconsin and additionally have established affiliate programs in 10 states thus far (Figure). The ultimate goal has been to: (1) place CPR‐AED programs in every school in the United States, (2) advocate for and insure that all students learn CPR‐AED use prior to graduation from high school so that we establish a standard for a community well versed in instituting lay‐rescuer CPR, and (3) partner with any and all organizations in the community in order to achieve these goals. Project ADAM has been a resource for schools across the country to implement CPR‐AED programs. Although we have not achieved the goal of having CPR‐AED programs in every single school yet, thus far 80 total saves in teachers as well as students have occurred across the United States as a result of school CPR‐AED programs. Therefore, we agree wholeheartedly that the dissemination of CPR education and public access AEDs at schools is essential and that further studies to investigate incidences and other characteristics of OHCA, including details about past medical history, is essential in both preventing OHCA as well as in improving the outcomes in schools as well as in other venues, particularly as it might relate to the childhood and adolescent age group.

Results

Characteristics of participants

A total of 108 schools in Shenzhen were included in the current study, after excluding 5 boarding schools. The exclusion criteria encompassed individuals with unreliable or missing data, those lost to follow-up and those who exhibited myopia at baseline. A total of 10 1624 children from grades 1 to 4 were included in the present analysis, with an average age of 7.657 ± 1.182 years. Among them, 56.3% were boys (table 1) and 77.5% were from ordinary school. Among children followed and lost to follow-up, there were no differences in age (p = 0.513), sex (p = 0.970), SE (p = 0.181) and school socioeconomic status (p = 0.671).

### Shaping school for childhood myopia: the association between floor area ratio of school environment and myopia in China [^112RTJxn]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Using GIS technology to objectively assess built environment of primary schools, the prospective cohort study has indicated that greater FAR was associated with a decreased risk of myopia incidence among 101 624 children, after controlling for demographic, economic and greenness factors. It remained consistent in the analyses additional adjusting for parental myopia and behavioural factors, offering novel insights for population-based myopia prevention from the construction and renovation of schools.

Similar associations between building space exposure and myopia had been previously reported. In a cross-sectional study involving 1075 children with an average SE of −1.21D, living in homes smaller than 300 ft 2 was associated with a decrease in SE by −0.47D when compared with residing in homes larger than 600 ft 2. A further longitudinal study with a small sample of fifty subjects has revealed a negative association between home size and 1-year refractive progression. However, the assessment of home size has relied on questionnaire-derived data, rather than objective measurement. In the current study, we have quantified the exposure to school built environment using GIS technology and revealed an association between greater FAR and a decreased risk of myopia incidence.

Optical properties of built environment could play a role in the association of FAR and myopia. One possible explanation is the defocus profile from indoor scenes. Indoor environments with limited distance and abundant nearby objects create unevenly dioptric profiles (greater variation in defocus distribution). Using a depth sensing camera to quantify defocus profile from near-work scenes at home, a study involving 50 children aged 9.3 years has indicated that a more hyperopic scene defocus profile was associated with faster 1-year myopia progression, highlighting the importance of indoor environment on account of the variances of refraction.

Previous studies have investigated that FAR was associated with health outcomes, including mental illness and morbidity of uncontrolled diseases. Generally, residing in communities with lower FAR can promote improved air quality, enhance the availability of green spaces and improve accessibility to activities, thereby theoretically creating favourable living conditions. However, this may not be fully applicable in school settings because all selected schools had a low FAR level (ranging from 0.211 to 1.757) as a result of governmental restrictions on school building heights. To optimise eye protection in school environments, our suggestion is to maximise the floor area of buildings as much as possible to provide increased indoor space for activity, as well as to ensure sufficient green space outdoors.

### Delaying middle school and high school start times promotes student health and performance: an American Academy of Sleep Medicine position statement [^1159S8Yc]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Sleep hygiene practices for adolescents — Recommended practices include a regular, dark, quiet sleep environment; adequate time for 8 to 10 hours of sleep per night; consistent bedtimes and wake times on weekdays and weekends; a regular bedtime routine to cue the body that sleep is imminent; and morning light exposure, and the use of sleep-disrupting electronic devices near bedtime or during the night should be avoided because blue light emitted from electronic devices, particularly blue wavelengths, can suppress the production of melatonin and contribute to difficulty falling asleep.

Leadership in the

Youth reported the extent to which they took on leadership roles and responsibilities in their GSA so far that year (Wave 1) and over the past 2 months (Wave 2) across four items: (a) I helped prepare or I led discussions or activities for GSA meetings; (b) I took a lead on events or projects for my GSA; (c) I helped organize GSA events at school or in the larger community; and (d) I played an active role in deciding on the events and activities we have done in the GSA. Response options were never, rarely, sometimes, often, or very often (scored 0–4). Higher average scores indicate taking on greater leadership and responsibility in the GSA (Wave 1 α = .94; Wave 2 α = .94).

School belonging

At Wave 1, youth reported their sense of school belonging so far that year, while at Wave 2, they reported their sense of school belonging at the present time based on six items from the Psychological Sense of School Membership scale (e.g. "I feel like I matter to people at my school"; Goodenow). Response options range from totally untrue to totally true (scored 1 through 5). Higher average scale scores represent a greater sense of school belonging (Wave 1 α = .91; Wave 2 α = .90).

Hope

At Wave 1, youth reported their sense of hope so far that year, while at Wave 2, they reported their sense of hope at the present time based on the 6‐item State Hope Scale (e.g. "I can think of many ways to reach my current goals"; Snyder et al.). Response options range from definitely false to definitely true (scored 1 through 8). Higher average scale scores indicate a greater sense of hope (Wave 1 α = .89; Wave 2 α = .90).

### Shaping school for childhood myopia: the association between floor area ratio of school environment and myopia in China [^114qS7Af]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Aim

To investigate the association of floor area ratio (FAR), an indicator of built environments, and myopia onset.

Methods

This prospective cohort study recruited 136753 children aged 6–10 years from 108 schools in Shenzhen, China at baseline (2016–2017). Refractive power was measured with non-cycloplegic autorefraction over a 2-year follow-up period. FAR was objectively evaluated using geographical information system technology. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were constructed to examine the association of FAR with a 2-year cumulative incidence of myopia among individuals without baseline myopia; multiple linear regression model, with a 2-year cumulative incidence rate of myopia at each school.

Results

Of 101624 non-myopic children (56.3% boys; mean (SE) age, 7.657 ± 1.182 years) included in the study, 26391 (26.0%) of them developed myopia after 2 years. In the individual-level analysis adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and greenness factors, an IQR in FAR was associated with a decreased risk of 2-year myopia incidence (OR 0.898, 95% CI 0.866 to 0.932, p < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in the analysis additionally adjusted for genetic and behavioural factors (OR 0.821, 95% CI 0.766 to 0.880, p < 0.001). In the school-level, an IQR increase in FAR was found to be associated with a 2.0% reduction in the 2-year incidence rate of myopia (95%CI 1.3% to 2.6%, p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Exposure to higher FAR was associated with a decreased myopia incidence, providing insights into myopia prevention through school built environments in China.

### Modeling the interplay between demography, social contact patterns, and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the south west shewa zone of oromia region, Ethiopia [^112kbfvB]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 spread may have a dramatic impact in countries with vulnerable economies and limited availability of, and access to, healthcare resources and infrastructures. However, in sub-Saharan Africa, a low prevalence and mortality have been observed so far.

Methods

We collected data on individuals' social contacts in the South West Shewa Zone (SWSZ) of Ethiopia across geographical contexts characterized by heterogeneous population density, work and travel opportunities, and access to primary care. We assessed how socio-demographic factors and observed mixing patterns can influence the COVID-19 disease burden, by simulating SARS-CoV-2 transmission in remote settlements, rural villages, and urban neighborhoods, under school closure mandate.

Results

From national surveillance data, we estimated a net reproduction number of 1.62 (95% CI 1.55–1.70). We found that, at the end of an epidemic mitigated by school closure alone, 10–15% of the population residing in the SWSZ would have been symptomatic and 0.3–0.4% of the population would require mechanical ventilation and/or possibly result in a fatal outcome. Higher infection attack rates are expected in more urbanized areas, but the highest incidence of critical disease is expected in remote subsistence farming settlements. School closure contributed to reduce the reproduction number by 49% and the attack rate of infections by 28–34%.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that the relatively low burden of COVID-19 in Ethiopia observed so far may depend on social mixing patterns, underlying demography, and the enacted school closures. Our findings highlight that socio-demographic factors can also determine marked heterogeneities across different geographical contexts within the same region, and they contribute to understand why sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing a relatively lower attack rate of severe cases compared to high-income countries.
