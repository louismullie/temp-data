## Question

Which medications are most effective for pain control in patients with coexisting osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications are most effective for pain control when osteoarthritis coexists with fibromyalgia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mixed pain biology and how it should guide targets. Then, I should identify first-line pharmacologic options that cover both peripheral osteoarthritic pain and central sensitization in fibromyalgia. Next, I will examine second-line agents with stronger fibromyalgia evidence and decide when to add them. After that, I need to flag medications to use cautiously or avoid. Then, I will integrate essential nonpharmacologic therapies. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and monitoring plan that is individualized and reference-aligned [^112NPA7J] [^112SiaVz].

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiological context, because if I get the mechanisms wrong, the pharmacology will miss the mark. Coexisting osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia produce a mixed pain phenotype with peripheral nociception from joint degeneration layered on central sensitization and altered pain modulation, so I need concurrent strategies that address both mechanisms without worsening either condition [^111FmLVG] [^1158ZPu1] [^111zqZx5].

> Next, I should review low-risk, broad-efficacy options that target peripheral OA pain without aggravating central symptoms; topical NSAIDs fit this profile. Wait, let me verify first-line positioning: AAFP guidance recommends topical NSAIDs as first-line for knee and hand OA because they are effective with fewer systemic adverse effects compared with oral NSAIDs, which is advantageous when FM coexists and systemic tolerability is a concern [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL]. Hold on, I should also ensure FM guidance doesn't inappropriately generalize systemic NSAIDs to FM pain; Canadian FM guidance limits NSAIDs to associated peripheral generators like OA, at the lowest dose and shortest duration, which supports keeping NSAIDs topical-first here [^113oD5zg].

> Now, for a central mechanism anchor with cross-condition benefit, duloxetine is the key candidate. I need to check the dual-endorsement: EULAR 2017 supports SNRIs for FM to address central sensitization, and AAFP OA guidance recommends duloxetine after NSAIDs for knee and hand OA pain, which aligns with a combined OA+FM plan [^112NPA7J] [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL]. Let me verify the analgesic signal is not just mood-mediated; pooled analyses in FM with comorbid depression show most of duloxetine's pain improvement is a direct analgesic effect, not solely via mood, and Cochrane-synthesized data support short-term pain relief in FM, which strengthens its role as a foundational agent here [^111EAgPU] [^116V6Nzc].

> If foundational measures are insufficient, I will now examine FM-centric augmentation; pregabalin deserves priority. I should double-check both guideline and comorbidity-specific data: AAFP supports pregabalin for FM, Cochrane overviews rate pregabalin as having moderate short-term benefit, and importantly, pooled randomized trial analyses show pregabalin 450 mg/day improves pain in FM patients regardless of comorbid OA, which is directly applicable to this mixed phenotype [^116EkB7i] [^116V6Nzc] [^1168UWfU]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there were no FM medications studied specifically in FM+OA, but those exploratory data for pregabalin indicate a significant benefit in both subgroups, so I should correct that assumption and highlight pregabalin's unique comorbidity-relevant evidence when augmentation is needed [^1168UWfU].

> For breakthrough or acute exacerbations where non-opioid options have been optimized, I need to consider limited, short-term tramadol with caution. Let me verify alignment: EULAR suggests tramadol in FM, and AAFP OA guidance includes tramadol selectively after NSAIDs, but I must pair this with opioid-sparing principles and reserve use for brief, targeted scenarios while monitoring risks, especially when combined with other serotonergic agents [^114bNnTe] [^114iHfqs] [^1126Yzqj].

> I will now identify medications to restrict or avoid to prevent harm and mis-targeting. Systemic NSAIDs can help OA pain but carry more adverse effects than topical forms and offer no benefit for core FM symptoms, so if they are used at all, they should be short course and carefully selected; strong or chronic opioids should be avoided given guideline recommendations to optimize non-opioid strategies first and observational evidence that FM patients on chronic opioids have worse long-term outcomes, including more side effects and less pain improvement on discontinuation [^117UvspK] [^113oD5zg] [^1126Yzqj] [^114iMZYe].

> Medications alone won't be sufficient, so I need to ensure nonpharmacologic therapy is embedded from the start. Exercise functions as analgesia in OA and is core to FM management; cognitive-behavioral therapy and multidisciplinary strategies address central amplification, coping, and function; and select complementary therapies such as acupuncture, tai chi, yoga, and mindfulness can be considered, with shared decision-making about expectations and adherence to enhance durability of benefit [^1156JrRd] [^113DYtGp] [^113PTUdL] [^113Usw6u] [^116FhGQ6].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and sanity-check each step against guidance. Start with a dual-mechanism foundation of topical NSAID to reduce peripheral OA nociception and duloxetine to modulate central FM mechanisms and OA pain; reassess in 8–12 weeks for at least a 30% pain reduction and functional gains; if inadequate or if sleep and hyperalgesia are prominent, add pregabalin, given its comorbidity-relevant evidence; reserve short, goal-directed tramadol only for breakthrough pain; and escalate to multidisciplinary nonpharmacologic interventions whenever monotherapy fails or multiple concurrent treatments are indicated [^112NPA7J] [^112SiaVz] [^113DYtGp].

> I should confirm individualization and monitoring elements so we avoid premature escalation or persistence with ineffective therapy. Tailor choices to pain intensity, function, fatigue, sleep disturbance, mood, and patient preferences; screen and treat depression and anxiety given their prevalence and impact on outcomes; recognize that duloxetine's analgesia includes but is not limited to mood pathways; reassess efficacy and tolerability regularly because FM patients report side effects more commonly and may require careful dose titration and combination adjustments [^112NPA7J] [^111C1oe9] [^113zkz3y] [^111EAgPU].

> I realize I started to default to acetaminophen as a first-line OA analgesic out of habit, but wait, I should verify whether that still holds. Earlier primary care guidance listed acetaminophen prominently, yet more recent discussions emphasize diminished efficacy and a shift toward topical NSAIDs as the initial pharmacologic approach for peripheral joint OA, so I should correct that inclination and prioritize topical NSAIDs over routine acetaminophen monotherapy in this comorbid context [^114iHfqs] [^1156JrRd].

> In summary, the most effective, evidence-aligned medication strategy for coexisting OA and FM is to combine topical NSAIDs for peripheral OA pain with duloxetine for central FM mechanisms and OA analgesia as first-line; add pregabalin if response is suboptimal or sleep and hyperalgesia are prominent; restrict tramadol to brief, selective use for breakthrough pain; avoid or minimize systemic NSAIDs and avoid chronic strong opioids; and mandate concurrent nonpharmacologic interventions, including structured exercise and cognitive-behavioral approaches, within a multidisciplinary framework and with regular reassessment and mood screening to optimize outcomes [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL] [^112NPA7J] [^116EkB7i] [^1126Yzqj] [^113DYtGp].

The most effective pharmacological treatments for managing pain in concurrent osteoarthritis (OA) and fibromyalgia (FM) are **topical NSAIDs for localized OA pain** [^116wZybL] and **duloxetine or pregabalin for FM-related pain** [^112SiaVz] [^116V6Nzc]. Topical NSAIDs are first-line for knee and hand OA due to efficacy and minimal systemic adverse effects, while duloxetine (an SNRI) and pregabalin (an alpha-2-delta ligand) [^116EkB7i] target central sensitization [^112dUPwt] and are effective for FM pain [^117UvspK] [^111EAgPU]. Tramadol may be considered [^11261TiD] for moderate-to-severe pain unresponsive to other treatments, but **opioids should generally be avoided** [^1126Yzqj] due to limited efficacy and significant risks [^114iMZYe]. Combination therapy is often **necessary** [^114xAmCE], and treatment should be individualized [^112NPA7J] based on patient characteristics, comorbidities, and response to therapy [^111C1oe9].

## Pharmacological treatments for osteoarthritis

OA pain is primarily nociceptive and inflammatory [^1158ZPu1]; therefore, **NSAIDs are first-line** for localized joint pain. Topical NSAIDs are preferred for knee and hand OA [^111iEdX3] because they are effective [^117UvspK] and have minimal systemic adverse effects [^116wZybL]. Oral NSAIDs are effective [^111P7sF8] but have higher risks of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal adverse effects; therefore, use the lowest effective dose [^117UvspK] for the shortest duration [^116wZybL]. Acetaminophen is **less effective than NSAIDs** [^114iHfqs] but may be considered for mild OA pain or when NSAIDs are contraindicated [^1156JrRd]. Duloxetine, an SNRI, is recommended for chronic musculoskeletal pain [^112SiaVz], including OA, especially when central sensitization or comorbid FM is present [^117UvspK] [^116wZybL].

---

## Pharmacological treatments for fibromyalgia

FM pain is primarily due to central sensitization [^112dUPwt]; therefore, **centrally acting agents** are recommended [^112NPA7J]. Pregabalin, an alpha-2-delta ligand, has the strongest evidence for moderate pain relief in FM and is recommended by AAFP guidelines [^116EkB7i]. Duloxetine and milnacipran, both SNRIs, are also effective for FM pain [^111EAgPU] and for associated symptoms, such as fatigue and sleep disturbances [^117UvspK] [^111C1oe9]. Tramadol, a weak opioid with serotonergic and noradrenergic activity, may be considered [^114bNnTe] for moderate-to-severe FM pain unresponsive to other treatments, but **opioids should generally be avoided** [^1126Yzqj] due to limited efficacy and significant risks [^11261TiD] [^114iMZYe].

---

## Combination pharmacotherapy

Given the distinct mechanisms of OA and FM pain [^1158ZPu1], **combination therapy** is often necessary [^114xAmCE]. Combining topical NSAIDs for localized OA pain with centrally acting agents such as duloxetine or pregabalin for FM-related pain is a rational approach [^112NPA7J]. This strategy targets both peripheral and central pain mechanisms, potentially providing superior analgesia and improved function [^114xAmCE].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize a **multimodal approach** tailored to patient characteristics, comorbidities, and response to therapy [^114h67Sz]. EULAR guidelines recommend individualized treatment plans [^112NPA7J] that balance benefits and risks and incorporate both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. Canadian guidelines similarly recommend individualized, symptom-based treatment strategies [^114f8gKA], emphasizing patient education and self-management [^116FhGQ6].

### Does association of opioid use with pain and function differ by fibromyalgia or widespread pain status [^114iMZYe]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Many consider chronic opioid therapy (COT) to be ineffective for fibromyalgia, but empirical evidence is limited. Among patients identified as initiating COT, we examined whether fibromyalgia was associated with different relationships of opioid use to pain and activity interference outcomes 12 months later. We obtained electronic data on diagnoses and opioid prescriptions. We also collected patient self-report data, including pain and activity interference measures, at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months.

Among 1,218 patients, 429 (35%) met our definition of fibromyalgia. Patients with and without fibromyalgia who had intermittent/lower-dose or regular/higher-dose opioid use at 12 months had similar 12-month pain intensity scores. However, among patients with minimal/no opioid use at 12 months, 12-month pain intensity was greater for those with fibromyalgia (adjusted mean = 5.15 [95% confidence interval, 4.80–5.51]; 0–10 scale) than for those without (4.44 [4.15–4.72]). Similar patterns were observed for 12-month activity interference.

Among patients who discontinued opioids by 12 months, those with fibromyalgia were more likely to report bothersome side effects and less likely to report pain improvement as important reasons for discontinuation (P < 0.05). In sum, at 12 months, among patients who had discontinued opioids or used them minimally, those with fibromyalgia had worse outcomes and were less likely to have discontinued because of pain improvement. Among patients continuing COT, pain and activity interference outcomes were worse than those of patients with minimal/no opioid use.

Regarding the medical management of fibromyalgia, specifically concerning general principles, the EULAR 2017 guidelines recommend aiming to improve health-related quality of life (QoL). It is essential to balance the benefits and risks of treatment, often necessitating a multidisciplinary approach. This includes a combination of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities. These treatments should be tailored according to pain intensity, function, associated features (such as depression), fatigue, sleep disturbance, patient preferences, and comorbidities. This tailoring should be done through shared decision-making with the patient.

### Nonopioid pharmacologic management of chronic noncancer pain [^112SiaVz]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pain, defined as pain present for at least three months, is highly prevalent and affects one in five US adults. It can be debilitating. Treatment includes a comprehensive, patient-centered biopsychosocial approach that: identifies pain type, focuses on improving function and quality of life, sets reasonable expectations around pain control, promotes self-management strategies, addresses mental health comorbidities, and includes both pharmacotherapy and nonpharmacotherapy options.

- **Osteoarthritis**: Topical and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide significant pain relief. Limited evidence suggests benefits from serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and gabapentinoids.

- **Chronic low back pain**: No pharmacotherapy offers significant pain or functional benefit, with evidence limited to short-term outcomes. Oral and topical NSAIDs and SNRIs appear to improve pain slightly in the short term.

- **Neuropathic pain**: Duloxetine, gabapentin, pregabalin, and high-concentration (8%) topical capsaicin provide moderate pain benefits.

- **Fibromyalgia**: Pregabalin has the best evidence for moderate pain benefit, followed by the SNRIs duloxetine and milnacipran.

Opioids should be considered only after other strategies have been tried and following a risk-benefit assessment.

### Classification of patients with osteoarthritis through clusters of comorbidities using 633 330 individuals from Spain [^111mTecG]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common chronic condition affecting about 250 million people worldwide. The progressive degenerative nature of the disease causes functional impairment, often severe pain, and loss of quality of life. Given its chronic nature, OA often coexists alongside other chronic conditions, i.e. comorbidities. A systematic review has shown that patients with OA are more likely to have multiple conditions compared with patients without OA. Further studies have demonstrated that this increased likelihood exists both in the years preceding a diagnosis of OA and in the years after.

- **Multimorbidity**: The co-existence of two or more chronic conditions or comorbidities is termed multimorbidity, estimated to affect between 19 and 27% of the UK general population. Studies have shown that increasing multimorbidity is associated with lower socioeconomic status and increasing age. It can drive higher healthcare utilization, including primary care usage, prescription costs, and hospitalization. There is a growing realization of the need to better understand multimorbidity in both clinical practice and the development of clinical guidelines.

- **Comorbidity clusters**: Within the context of multimorbidity, there is increasing recognition of the concept of comorbidities existing in groups or 'clusters'. Examining the exact conditions that co-exist within an individual, rather than simply the number of comorbidities, would allow us to understand whether a patient's chronic comorbid conditions are 'concordant' (may be treated with a unified approach) or 'discordant' (may worsen or compete with treatments).

### Multidisciplinary modalities in the treatment of fibromyalgia [^113Ftz2N]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is a common musculoskeletal pain condition associated with chronic widespread pain, tenderness at various points on the body, fatigue, and sleep abnormalities. Individuals with fibromyalgia often have comorbid anxiety, depression, and/or other pain syndromes. Research into pharmacologic remedies for fibromyalgia has demonstrated efficacy for a variety of agents, but pharmacology is only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to successful management of fibromyalgia. Sensitive and appropriate methods of diagnosis and an integrated treatment plan, including proper patient education, aerobic exercise, and cognitive-behavioral therapy, have been shown to be effective in alleviating fibromyalgic symptoms.

### Management of fibromyalgia and comorbid psychiatric disorders [^111qRqap]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

According to the American College of Rheumatology, fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain of at least three months' duration, coupled with pain at 11 or more of 18 specific tender point sites on the body. Many individuals with fibromyalgia also have comorbid psychiatric disorders, which can present diagnostic dilemmas and require additional treatment considerations to optimize patient outcomes. Fibromyalgia has been found to have a strong association with depressive and anxiety symptoms, a personal or family history of depression, and accompanying antidepressant treatment. Psychiatric comorbidities negatively impact the severity and course of fibromyalgia.

Pharmacotherapy can be employed to control fibromyalgia and comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. Additionally, nonpharmacologic therapies for fibromyalgia and comorbid psychiatric disorders include cognitive-behavioral therapy and aerobic exercise. The efficacy of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments is examined in this article, as well as the diagnostic difficulties that comorbid disorders present.

### Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intraarticular trans-capsaicin for pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee [^117N6LfJ]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) affects over 10% of individuals aged 60 years and older, and treatment options for pain control are considered inadequate. Management includes nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options, many of which have at least short‐term benefits. Intraarticular therapies, including injections of viscosupplements and glucocorticoids, may have limited efficacy. In a randomized clinical trial, intraarticular injection of glucocorticoids every 12 weeks for 2 years was associated with significantly greater loss of cartilage volume compared to placebo, with no significant difference in knee pain. Whether the loss of cartilage volume has clinical significance is unknown. Pharmacologic treatments have been recommended for properly selected patients, but they carry risks of adverse effects involving the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal, and central nervous systems. The presence of comorbidities may make individuals with knee OA more susceptible to these adverse effects, thus limiting treatment options. A total knee joint replacement often provides longer‐term benefits; however, this surgery entails serious risks, and many patients continue to have pain and disability following surgery. In addition, many patients are not candidates for major surgery. Therefore, there is an unmet need for effective therapies to mitigate risks and provide effective pain management.

### Strategies for managing fibromyalgia [^116ahm4o]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The presentation of fibromyalgia is heterogeneous, and the treatment approach should be individualized for each patient, depending on the severity of the patient's pain, the presence of other symptoms or comorbidities, and the degree of functional impairment. The management of fibromyalgia includes the identification and treatment of all pain sources that may be present in addition to fibromyalgia, such as peripheral pain generators (e.g. comorbid osteoarthritis or neuropathic pain) or visceral pain (e.g. comorbid irritable bowel syndrome).

It is also important to address other symptoms or disorders that commonly occur in patients with fibromyalgia, such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment, stiffness, and mood or anxiety disorders. Finally, the treatment should strive to improve the patient's function and global health status. In most cases, the management of fibromyalgia involves both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. This report provides an in-depth review of randomized, controlled trials for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to fibromyalgia therapy.

### Concomitant fibromyalgia complicating chronic inflammatory arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115hPGjJ]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

This review has some limitations. The search was limited to English-language papers and full-text papers so that the content of the articles could be fully understood and assessed for quality. Included studies were mostly cross-sectional in design, which, while enabling the investigation of several associations simultaneously, did not make it possible to infer causality. In studies that compared DAS, there was rarely adjustment or stratification for other important confounding factors. Age, gender, and the number of mental health conditions were shown to be different between groups with and without FM in various included publications. The presence of FM may also act as a proxy variable for underlying mental health problems, since the presence of mental health disorders contributes to the classification of FM by ACR criteria. Regardless, the reported impact associated with comorbid FM was found to be remarkably consistent across numerous studies in chronic inflammatory arthritis.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: Recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^115bVBZ3]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The Bone and Joint Decade (2000–10) initiated the first international drive to prioritize osteoarthritis (OA) and joint pain in older adults and its impact on the Western world. The diagnostic label of OA is ranked 11th in terms of its impact on years lived with disability. However, joint pain in individuals aged 45 years and over is ranked as the number one cause of years with disability worldwide.

According to health leaders and epidemiologists, the population trends are clear for the next 30 years. With the aging population and increased obesity and physical inactivity, joint pain and OA are set to rise. Joint pain and OA are predominantly managed in primary care. There are national and international guidelines for the care and management of OA in adults, such as those from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), EULAR, Osteoarthritis Research Society International, and ACR. However, there is a gap between what we know and what we do.

This paper describes the challenges and gaps in OA care, particularly in relation to population health management, interventions, and outcomes. The discussion is set in the context of competing health priorities and multimorbidity, access to high-quality care, resource limitations, and models of care. The overuse of some therapies and neglect of others will be discussed, as well as the potential for self-management. Many of the challenges are predominantly taken from experiences in the National Health Service (NHS), UK. The role of the healthcare team will be highlighted in enhancing best care for OA and providing solutions for closing the evidence gap.

### Pharmacotherapy of chronic pain: A synthesis of recommendations from systematic reviews [^112ZFTcy]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is one of the most prevalent, costly, and disabling conditions in both clinical practice and the workplace, yet it often remains inadequately treated. Moreover, chronic pain commonly co-occurs with depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorders, and adversely affects the response of these conditions to psychiatric treatments. This article provides an evidence-based approach to the pharmacotherapy of chronic pain.

This narrative review is derived largely from meta-analyses and systematic reviews published since 2005. For a few medications, findings from multiple recent trials are synthesized if a systematic review had not yet been published. Classes of medications are first reviewed, followed by an overview of four common pain disorders: neuropathic pain, low back pain, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis.

A stepped care approach based on existing evidence includes: (1) simple analgesics (acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs); (2) tricyclic antidepressants (if neuropathic, back, or fibromyalgia pain) or tramadol; (3) gabapentin, duloxetine, or pregabalin if neuropathic pain; (4) cyclobenzaprine, pregabalin, duloxetine, or milnacipran for fibromyalgia; (5) topical analgesics (capsaicin, lidocaine, salicylates) if localized neuropathic or arthritic pain; and (6) opioids. Disease-specific recommendations for neuropathic, low back, fibromyalgia, and osteoarthritis pain are reviewed.

A number of medications have proven effective in chronic pain disorders, and their use individually or in combination should improve management.

### Narrative review: The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia [^112dUPwt]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Primary fibromyalgia is a common yet poorly understood syndrome characterized by diffuse chronic pain accompanied by other somatic symptoms, including poor sleep, fatigue, and stiffness, in the absence of disease. Fibromyalgia does not have a distinct cause or pathology. Nevertheless, in the past decade, the study of chronic pain has yielded new insights into the pathophysiology of fibromyalgia and related chronic pain disorders. Accruing evidence shows that patients with fibromyalgia experience pain differently from the general population because of dysfunctional pain processing in the central nervous system.

Aberrant pain processing, which can result in chronic pain and associated symptoms, may be the result of several interplaying mechanisms, including central sensitization, blunting of inhibitory pain pathways, alterations in neurotransmitters, and psychiatric comorbid conditions. This review provides an overview of the mechanisms currently thought to be partly responsible for the chronic diffuse pain typical of fibromyalgia.

A protocol for the overview was published. Amendments to the protocol prior statement are in Supplementary Data S1 and Supplementary Data S2, available at Rheumatology online.

We included Cochrane reviews of pharmacological therapies in adults (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with FMS using an established diagnostic criterion. Reviews of children or mixed populations not reporting outcomes separately were excluded. Any pharmacological therapy and any comparator were eligible. We sought outcomes as close as possible to three months (13 weeks) after treatment; those earlier than one month (four weeks) after beginning treatment were not eligible.

Eligible study designs were RCTs or non-RCTs providing details of inclusion and exclusion criteria, databases searched and search strategies, patient-reported pain or pain relief, and summary results for at least one desired outcome. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2021 issue 12 of Cochrane Library Wiley interface on 1 January 2022, using no limits on date or language, and checked again on 1 May 2024.

Two reviewers independently selected reviews for inclusion, carried out assessments of methodological quality, extracted data, analyzed data if required, assessed how the review authors used the GRADE criteria, and made their own GRADE assessments based on the information provided. Reviewers resolved disagreements by consensus among all authors; all authors saw all data.

Information was collected on the number of included studies and participants, medicine, dose and route of administration, and baseline demographic information.

### The complexities of fibromyalgia and its comorbidities [^112XrZd8]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is defined as chronic, widespread musculoskeletal pain and tenderness with concomitant mood and cognitive dysfunction. Several comorbidities have been reported to be associated with FMS. We reviewed the literature concerning the most noteworthy chronic conditions associated with FMS.

There is mounting evidence displaying the concurrence of fibromyalgia and coexisting medical and psychiatric conditions. Such comorbidities may blur the classical clinical presentations and erroneously lead to misinterpretation of disease activity. The recognition of this fact should be underlined, as misrecognition may lead to excessive therapy and avoidable side effects of medications on the one hand and to a better handling of FMS on the other hand, leading to improved clinical outcomes.

A greater proportion of psychiatric and rheumatologic disorders are associated with FMS patients than the population. Consequently, physicians treating patients with either condition should keep in mind that these patients may have such comorbidities and should be treated accordingly.

### Osteoarthritis year in review 2017: Clinical [^1163QmYZ]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2018). Low credibility.

This review is based on a systematic review of the literature relevant to clinical topics in osteoarthritis (OA) performed for the time period from February 22, 2016, to April 1, 2017. A PubMed search using the terms "osteoarthritis" and "treatment or epidemiology" returned over 800 papers, of which 57 are reviewed here, with inclusion primarily based on relevance to clinical OA.

Epidemiologic studies in this time frame focused on:

- **Incidence and prevalence of OA**: Additionally considering comorbidities and mortality in relation to OA, particularly obesity and cardiovascular disease.
- **Multiple joint involvement**: Exploring the interconnectedness and simultaneous affliction of various joints.

Papers on therapeutic approaches to OA considered non-pharmacologic options, a number of topical, oral, and intra-articular therapies, as well as the cost-effectiveness of some OA treatments. There is an enormous need to identify novel strategies to reduce the impact of this highly prevalent and debilitating condition.

### Fibromyalgia: an overview [^111zqZx5]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, the authors review concepts in fibromyalgia. Findings regarding diagnosis, prevalence, comorbidities, and potential pathophysiologic links are discussed. Although fibromyalgia continues to be a complex disorder, there are specific criteria one must meet. Fibromyalgia questionnaires, along with commonalities of age, gender, menopause status, sleep disturbances, and mood symptoms, may aid in the diagnosis. Additionally, the close relationship between fibromyalgia and other chronic disorders should alert the physician to explore for comorbid illness. The relationship between fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, migraine headaches, and obesity are addressed. The roles of the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis, potential effects of neurotransmitters, and gender-specific hormones all substantiate this diagnosis and provide clues to causality, as well as venues for future treatment.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^1156JrRd]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Since 2002, we have known the benefits of exercise as analgesia for osteoarthritis (OA) pain. Despite substantial evidence for the clinical and cost-effectiveness of exercise, research funders continue to invest in underpowered studies comparing exercise versus no exercise. More attention is needed on adherence to exercise, which is a significant obstacle in exercise programs. Currently, the OA Trial Bank is supporting work to determine subgroups of patients who may respond better to exercise. By 2002, sufficient evidence had accumulated to show the significant benefit of exercise over no exercise in patients with OA, and further trials were deemed unlikely to overturn this result. However, the review highlighted that studies continued to be funded and published after this date. Furthermore, additional studies remain underpowered; in a Cochrane review, 35% of eligible studies recruited fewer than 25 participants in one or both allocation groups.

- **Topical NSAIDs and paracetamol**: Topical NSAIDs have retained their role as first-line analgesia for peripheral joint OA, and electronic templates in general practice are known to enhance their uptake. The role of paracetamol as first-line analgesia has diminished following evidence of poorer efficacy and increased side effects. Despite concerns over paracetamol, clinicians are unaware of the benefits of other therapies. Stopping ineffective therapies presents an implementation challenge. Clinicians continue with paracetamol when an alternative pharmacological or non-pharmacological approach, such as topical NSAIDs, may be more effective.

### Osteoarthritis: Rapid evidence review [^114iHfqs]. American Family Physician (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ankle osteoarthritis, specifically in relation to pain management, the AAFP 2018 guidelines recommend initiating full-strength acetaminophen and topical therapy for the management of OA. These should be followed by NSAIDs and, selectively, tramadol and other opioids. It is important to recognize that while NSAIDs and opioids may reduce pain and improve function, they also have significant potential harms.

### Effectiveness of pharmacological therapies for fibromyalgia syndrome in adults: An overview of Cochrane reviews [^116V6Nzc]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

To summarize and evaluate Cochrane reviews of pharmacological therapies for adults with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) pain, a systematic search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was conducted up to May 2024. The generic quality assessment used AMSTAR-2 criteria. Validity checks were performed, focusing on potentially critical factors in evaluating analgesic efficacy and assessing the susceptibility of results to publication bias. Pain outcomes were measured through participant-reported pain relief of ≥ 30% or ≥ 50%, or as "patient global impression of change" (PGIC) much or very much improved.

The analysis included 21 reviews encompassing 87 trials and 17,631 patients. These reviews were rated as either moderate (15 reviews) or high-quality (6 reviews) according to AMSTAR-2. Thirteen of the 21 reviews met at least seven of the eight critical pain criteria. The diagnosis of FMS followed recognized criteria. Seven reviews identified no trials for carbamazepine, clonazepam, lamotrigine, phenytoin, oxycodone, topiramate, or valproate, while seven reviews had limited and inadequate data for antipsychotics, cannabinoids, combination therapy, gabapentin, lacosamide, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and NSAIDs. Two therapies, amitriptyline and SSRIs, were subject to publication bias. Mirtazapine had moderate evidence of no effect.

Duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin demonstrated moderate to good evidence of substantial pain relief over 4 to 12 weeks in around 1 in 10 adults with moderate or severe FMS pain, but without evidence of efficacy beyond six months. Serious adverse events were no more common than with placebo. However, evidence was lacking regarding who might benefit or experience adverse events, and there was no substantial efficacy evidence for other medicines.

In conclusion, duloxetine, milnacipran, and pregabalin provide moderate to good short-term pain relief in FMS, but their long-term efficacy remains unproven.

### Characteristics of fibromyalgia independently predict poorer long-term analgesic outcomes following total knee and hip arthroplasty [^1178GMx6]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

Patients and methods: University of Michigan Institutional Review Board approval was obtained. The reporting of this prospective, observational cohort study conforms to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement. Between July 27, 2010, and May 31, 2013, adult patients (≥ 18 years old) who were scheduled for primary, unilateral TKA or THA were prospectively recruited prior to surgery. Patients were excluded if they were undergoing bilateral arthroplasty, undergoing revision arthroplasty, did not speak English, were unable to provide written informed consent, or were incarcerated. All patients provided written informed consent. Acute postoperative outcomes (anesthesia/acute pain) from a portion of this cohort were published earlier, but the long-term surgical outcomes explored herein have not been presented previously.

- **Phenotyping battery**: Patients completed validated self-report questionnaires prior to surgery, and other relevant data were obtained from surgical and anesthesia medical records. Additional details of the preoperative phenotyping battery have been described previously.

- **Fibromyalgia survey criteria**: The fibromyalgia survey is a validated self-report measure consisting of two scales, with one assessing widespread body pain and the other evaluating comorbid symptoms. First, the Widespread Pain Index (WPI) was calculated using the Michigan Body Map to assess the 19 specific body areas described in the measure (score 0–19).

### Common questions about the diagnosis and management of fibromyalgia [^1148MUVn]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia has a distinct pathophysiology involving central amplification of peripheral sensory signals. Core symptoms include chronic widespread pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. Most patients with fibromyalgia experience muscle pain and tenderness, forgetfulness or problems with concentration, and significant functional limitations.

Fibromyalgia is diagnosed using an updated set of clinical criteria that no longer rely on tender point examination; laboratory testing may help rule out other disorders that commonly present with fatigue, such as anemia and thyroid disease. Patients with fibromyalgia should be evaluated for comorbid functional pain syndromes and mood disorders.

Management of fibromyalgia should encompass patient education, symptom relief, and regular aerobic physical activity. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics, and muscle relaxants have the strongest evidence of benefit for improving pain, fatigue, sleep symptoms, and quality of life. Multiple complementary and alternative medicine therapies have been used but have limited evidence of effectiveness. Opioids should be used to relieve pain in carefully selected patients only if alternative therapies are ineffective.

### Methods for pragmatic randomized clinical trials of pain therapies: IMMPACT statement [^111dA7PD]. Pain (2024). High credibility.

If the research question demands a broad clinical sample of patients, we propose the following pain-related domains for consideration. As major eligibility criteria, these would be more inclusive than what is usually found in efficacy trials. Indeed, pragmatic trials provide opportunities to conduct research with people from diverse or disadvantaged communities and with co-occurring medical or mental health conditions. Recruiting a representative sample may, in many cases, mean specifically targeting members of certain populations and reducing barriers to trial participation, for example, through early patient partner involvement.

Rather than offering generic advice on desirable eligibility criteria, we encourage researchers to consider what is warranted depending on their individual research objectives. Apart from necessary diagnostic criteria, we recommend:

1. Consider including pain of any intensity, not just ≥ 4/10, balancing clinical relevance with the risk of flooring effects and the ability to detect meaningful changes. Chronic daily mild pain can be burdensome, and few clinical trials have examined treatments for this common clinical condition. Acetaminophen/paracetamol, NSAIDs, and their combination are widely available as over-the-counter medications, but little is known about their efficacy and effectiveness when used to self-treat mild pain.

2. Enrolling patients with mild pain intensity but impaired function or mood may provide adequate assay sensitivity if pain intensity is not the primary outcome, though it is recognized that such pain may have adverse consequences.

### OARSI recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis, part I: Critical appraisal of existing treatment guidelines and systematic review of current research evidence [^1169VN1W]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2007). Low credibility.

As a prelude to developing updated, evidence-based, international consensus recommendations for the management of hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA), the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Treatment Guidelines Committee undertook a critical appraisal of published guidelines and a systematic review of more recent evidence for relevant therapies.

- **Purpose**: Sixteen experts from four medical disciplines (primary care two, rheumatology 11, orthopaedics one, and evidence-based medicine two), two continents, and six countries (USA, UK, France, Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada) formed the guidelines development team. Three additional experts were invited to participate in the critical appraisal of existing guidelines in languages other than English.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, AMED, Cochrane Library, seven guidelines websites, and Google were searched systematically to identify guidelines for the management of hip and/or knee OA. Guidelines that met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were assigned to four groups of four appraisers. The quality of the guidelines was assessed using the AGREE (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) instrument. Standardized percent scores (0–100%) were calculated for scope, stakeholder involvement, rigour, clarity, applicability, and editorial independence, as well as overall quality. Treatment modalities addressed and recommended by the guidelines were summarized. Agreement percentages were estimated, and the best level of evidence to support each recommendation was extracted.

### Concomitant fibromyalgia complicating chronic inflammatory arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117PoAzs]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome is a complex neurosensory disorder characterized by a history of diffuse and persistent musculoskeletal pain, with numerous discrete tender points elicited on clinical examination. Additional symptoms include fatigue, sleep disturbances, and anxiety. FM is strongly associated with female gender and age and has a prevalence of around 1–5% in the general population.

FM is often considered a diagnosis of exclusion; however, patients with inflammatory arthropathies commonly meet the criteria for FM, a phenomenon known as fibromyalgianess. The exact prevalence of this concomitant FM in inflammatory arthropathy is debated. It is also unclear whether FM arises as a complication of the index condition or occurs independently in susceptible individuals. Regardless of the underlying etiology, the presence of concomitant FM and its impact on the underlying inflammatory condition may be important.

Modern rheumatological management is increasingly target-driven, involving escalation of drug therapy to achieve optimum reduction in disease activity or remission. Assessing disease activity in chronic inflammatory arthritis relies, in part, on self-assessment by the patient. Consequently, FM, which causes patients to experience pain independent of the inflammatory processes, may lead to inflated disease activity measures and, thereby, to inappropriate escalation or stopping of treatment in the underlying index rheumatic condition.

The primary aim of this systematic review is to report the prevalence and impact of concomitant FM in inflammatory arthropathies.

### EULAR recommendations for the health professional's approach to pain management in inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis [^114r9LsB]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ankle osteoarthritis, particularly in terms of managing pain through nonpharmacological measures, the EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend offering basic social and psychological management support. This includes the possibility of referring the patient to a psychologist, social worker, self-management support program, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), or a multidisciplinary treatment team. Such referrals are suggested for patients whose social variables or psychological factors interfere with effective pain management and functional status. It is also important to discuss treatment options with the patient and their primary care physician if depression and anxiety are present.

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: Recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^1133CCtk]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is most often managed in primary care, with referral to secondary care typically only in more advanced stages or complex presentations. However, rheumatologists have a key role and opportunity for leadership in OA management. Rheumatologists possess content expertise in the management of OA and can therefore lead health systems in driving appropriate models of care and quality improvement. Leadership in this area is greatly needed, considering the gaps in quality of OA care and often a lack of a champion for the treatment of this health condition. Additionally, OA commonly co-occurs with other rheumatic conditions, particularly among older adults. Therefore, rheumatologists can set an example of delivering the highest quality of OA care, incorporating both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies.

- **Provide education and support in OA management to primary care colleagues**: Because primary care providers are responsible for managing a wide range of health conditions, it is not realistic to expect they will typically be experts in musculoskeletal medicine. Rheumatologists can bridge this gap by providing periodic educational sessions on OA care for primary care providers, covering evidence-based therapies and specific challenging clinical situations. In some health care settings, individual rheumatologists or groups of rheumatology clinicians may be able to provide virtual or electronic consults to provide additional support.

### Placebo effects in osteoarthritis: Implications for treatment and drug development [^115k7pDQ]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of arthritis worldwide, affecting approximately 500 million people, yet there are no effective treatments to halt its progression. Without any structure-modifying agents, the management of OA focuses on ameliorating pain and improving function. Treatment approaches typically have modest efficacy, and many patients have contraindications to recommended pharmacological treatments. Drug development for OA is hindered by the gradual and progressive nature of the disease and the targeting of established disease in clinical trials. Additionally, new medications for OA cannot receive regulatory approval without demonstrating improvements in both structure (pathological features of OA) and symptoms, such as reduced pain and/or improved function.

In clinical trials, people with OA show high 'placebo responses', which hampers the ability to identify new effective treatments. Placebo responses refer to the individual variability in response to placebos given in the context of clinical trials and other settings. Placebo effects refer specifically to short-lasting improvements in symptoms that occur because of physiological changes.

To mitigate the effects of the placebo phenomenon, it is crucial to understand what it is, how it manifests, how to identify placebo responders in OA trials, and how these insights can be used to improve clinical trials in OA. Leveraging placebo responses and effects in clinical practice might provide additional avenues to augment symptom management of OA.

### Concomitant fibromyalgia complicating chronic inflammatory arthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Qi3Bb]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review and meta-analysis describe the prevalence of concomitant fibromyalgia (FM) in adults with inflammatory arthritis and quantify the impact of FM on the Disease Activity Score (DAS). The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched using key terms and predefined exclusion criteria. Proportional and pairwise meta-analysis methods were used to pool results where appropriate.

Forty articles were identified. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the prevalence of FM ranged from 4.9% to 52.4% (21% pooled). In axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA), the range was 4.11% to 25.2% (13% pooled in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) only). In psoriatic arthritis (PsA), the range was 9.6% to 27.2% (18% pooled). The presence of concomitant FM was related to higher DAS in patients with RA and AS (DAS28 mean difference 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.37 in RA; BASDAI mean difference 2.22, 95% CI: 1.86, 2.58 in AS). Concomitant FM was also associated with higher DAS in existing PsA studies. Self-reported components of DAS, rather than objective components, appear to be elevated in the presence of FM (e.g. tender joint count and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores).

Fibromyalgia is common in RA, axSpA, and PsA. Comorbid FM appears to amplify DAS and could, therefore, influence the management of these rheumatic conditions.

### Osteoarthritis: an update with relevance for clinical practice [^111P7sF8]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis is thought to be the most prevalent chronic joint disease. The incidence of osteoarthritis is rising due to the aging population and the epidemic of obesity. Pain and loss of function are the main clinical features leading to treatment, which includes non-pharmacological, pharmacological, and surgical approaches. Clinicians recognize that the diagnosis of osteoarthritis is often established late in the disease process, potentially too late for disease-modifying drugs to be effective.

Despite efforts over the past decades to develop markers for the disease, imaging procedures and biochemical marker analyses require improvement and possible extension with more specific and sensitive methods. This is necessary to reliably describe disease processes, diagnose the disease at an early stage, classify patients according to their prognosis, and monitor the disease course and treatment effectiveness.

In the coming years, a better definition of osteoarthritis is expected through delineating different phenotypes of the disease. Treatment that is more specifically targeted at these phenotypes might lead to improved outcomes.

### Comparative pain and mood effects in patients with comorbid fibromyalgia and major depressive disorder: Secondary analyses of four pooled randomized controlled trials of duloxetine [^111EAgPU]. Pain (2011). High credibility.

The objective of this paper is to better understand the relationship between pain and mood in patients with fibromyalgia and comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD). Pooled data from four double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials of duloxetine hydrochloride (60–120 mg/day) in patients with fibromyalgia were included (N = 1332). Of these, 350 (26% [147 placebo, 203 duloxetine]) had comorbid MDD (per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition Text Revision criteria) and were included in these analyses.

Primary measures included the Brief Pain Inventory average pain, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale or Beck Depression Inventory. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the consistency of treatment effect across various subgroups. Path analysis was used to assess the effect of duloxetine on improvement in pain in the presence of improvement in mood, and vice versa.

Results indicated that 69% of improvement in pain was a direct effect of treatment, with improvement in mood accounting for 31% of the pain response. In conclusion, consistent with our hypothesis, duloxetine produced a substantial direct effect on pain improvement, and change in mood exerted a modest indirect effect on pain improvements in patients with fibromyalgia and MDD. Hence, both direct and indirect analgesic and antidepressant properties appear to be relevant for the treatment of these comorbid patients with duloxetine.

### Combination pharmacotherapy for management of chronic pain: From bench to bedside [^114xAmCE]. The Lancet Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pain, a frequently neglected problem, is treated with different classes of drugs. These agents are often limited by incomplete efficacy and dose-limiting side effects. Knowledge of pain processing implicates multiple concurrent mechanisms of nociceptive transmission and modulation. Thus, the synergistic interactions of drug combinations might provide superior analgesia and fewer side effects than monotherapy by targeting multiple mechanisms.

Several trials in neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, arthritis, and other disorders have assessed various two-drug combinations containing antidepressants, anticonvulsants, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, opioids, and other agents. In some trials, combined treatment showed superiority over monotherapy; however, in others, improved benefit or tolerability was not observed. Despite escalating efforts, the development of novel analgesics that surpass the efficacy of existing treatments has not yet been successful. Therefore, combination therapy remains an important beneficial strategy. Methodological improvements in future translational research efforts are needed to maximize the potential of combination pharmacotherapy for pain.

### Recommendations of the OARSI FDA osteoarthritis devices working group [^113dFZ4r]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis and a major cause of chronic musculoskeletal pain and functional disability. Both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic modalities are recommended in the management of OA. However, when patients with hip or knee OA do not obtain adequate pain relief and/or functional improvement, joint replacement surgery or other surgical interventions should be considered. Total joint arthroplasties are reliable and cost-effective treatments for patients with significant OA of the hip and knee.

Evidence from cohort and observational studies has confirmed substantial improvements in pain relief, with cumulative revision rates at 10 years following total hip arthro-plasties (THA) and total knee arthroplasties (TKA) at 7% and 10%, respectively. Joint replacements have been used in almost every synovial joint, although results for joints other than hip and knee replacement have not been as successful.

The evolution of new device designs and surgical techniques underscores the need to better understand the risk-to-benefit ratio for different joint replacements. It is also critical to identify the appropriate methodologies for evaluating the efficacy and optimal outcomes of these new devices designed to treat OA joints.

### Is osteoarthritis one disease or a collection of many [^1177KYRa]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a multifaceted and heterogeneous syndrome that may be amenable to tailored treatments. There has been an increasing focus within the OA research community on identifying meaningful OA phenotypes, with potential implications for prognosis and treatment. Experimental and clinical data, combined with sophisticated statistical approaches, have been used to characterize and define phenotypes from the symptomatic and structural perspectives. An improved understanding of the existing phenotypes based on underlying disease mechanisms may shed light on the distinct entities that make up the disease. This narrative review provides an updated summary of the most recent advances in this field, as well as limitations from previous approaches that can be addressed in future studies.

### Pregabalin improves pain scores in patients with fibromyalgia irrespective of comorbid osteoarthritis [^1168UWfU]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic pain disorder with patients frequently suffering from comorbid conditions, including osteoarthritis (OA). Data on how FM patients with comorbid OA respond to recommended therapies, such as pregabalin, could help their treatment.

This study was a pooled exploratory analysis of three randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of pregabalin in FM patients, aimed at assessing the impact of comorbid OA on the response to pregabalin. Patients were divided into those with and without comorbid OA. The difference in change in least squares (LS) mean pain score at endpoint (assessed by a 0–10 numeric rating scale, controlled for baseline pain score) with pregabalin (300 mg/day and 450 mg/day) versus placebo was assessed. Changes in Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) responders and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) total score were also assessed.

There were 1,665 patients in the analysis set (558 on placebo, 552 on pregabalin 300 mg/day, 555 on pregabalin 450 mg/day), including 296 with comorbid OA. Pregabalin 450 mg/day significantly improved the LS mean (95% confidence interval) difference in pain score versus placebo in patients with (0.99 [0.44, 1.55], P < 0.001) and without (0.64 [0.39, 0.89], P < 0.001) OA. Improvements with pregabalin 300 mg/day with (0.31 [-0.25, 0.86], P = 0.276) and without (0.51 [0.25, 0.76], P < 0.001) OA were not consistently significant. Improvements in PGIC and FIQ total score were observed in patients with and without comorbid OA.

In conclusion, FM patients with or without comorbid OA respond to treatment with pregabalin.

### Hand osteoarthritis-nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments [^111iEdX3]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Hand osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disease with a high clinical burden. The number of clinical trials in hand OA is limited; therefore, recommendations for management are mostly expert-based instead of evidence-based, and medication is often prescribed off-label. However, in the past five years, this 'forgotten' disease has attracted increasing attention, and a number of high-quality clinical trials have now been performed or are ongoing.

The results from studies conducted to assess nonpharmacological treatment modalities indicate:

- **Education and assistive devices**: Educating patients about self-management, providing assistive devices, and applying splints for thumb base OA are effective for reducing pain and disability.

For pharmacological management, more high-quality trials are needed. Evidence is available for the short-term alleviation of pain symptoms by topical and oral NSAIDs. The role of anti-inflammatory medication, such as corticosteroids and biologic agents, is controversial. The same holds true for the efficacy of symptomatic slow-acting drugs for OA. Disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) for hand OA are currently not available. The results from the ongoing pharmacological trials will enhance our knowledge for evidence-based management of hand OA shortly.

Regarding medical management for ankle osteoarthritis, more specifically with respect to pain management using nonpharmacological measures, the EULAR 2018 guidelines suggest offering orthotics, such as splints, braces, sleeves, insoles, and shoes; daily living aids; assistive devices, such as a cane or rollator; or ergonomic adaptation at home and workplace for patients experiencing pain during activities of daily living that impede functioning. It is also advisable to consider referring patients who desire assistive support to an occupational therapist.

### Characteristics of fibromyalgia independently predict poorer long-term analgesic outcomes following total knee and hip arthroplasty [^115CTRmA]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2015). Low credibility.

The estimated lifetime risk of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis is approximately 45%. Between 1991 and 2010, the number of total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) per capita among US Medicare beneficiaries nearly doubled, and there was a 59% increase in revision TKA. Based on temporal trends in aging and obesity, the numbers of TKA and total hip arthroplasties (THAs) are anticipated to increase substantially in the coming years. Although TKA and THA have been shown to improve chronic pain and function, studies estimate that approximately 20% of TKA and 10% of THA patients fail to derive the desired analgesic benefit. Cross-sectional studies of long-term pain outcomes have identified pain in other locations, as well as negative affect and cognitions (i.e. depression and catastrophizing, respectively), as independent risk factors for lack of improvement in pain following TKA and THA.

One possible explanation for the differences in long-term analgesic outcomes may be mechanistic. There is a growing appreciation of the importance of augmented central nervous system pain processing and other symptoms in many chronic pain states. A number of pain disorders without clear peripheral pathology have been given specific names, such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and interstitial cystitis. The most "systemic" of these conditions, fibromyalgia, is characterized by widespread body pain and comorbid somatic symptoms (i.e. fatigue, poor sleep, depression, and memory difficulties), all of which are thought to be of central nervous system origin.

### Non-inflammatory pain in inflammatory arthritis [^113rKMW5]. Rheumatology (2023). Low credibility.

Joharatnam et al. (2015) concluded that a high prevalence of fibromyalgia features, poorer mental health, and higher patient-reported DAS 28 (DAS28) scores are linked in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The team noted high sensitivity at non-joint points such as the anterior tibia and sternum, indicating that central mechanisms could contribute to pain sensitivity in RA even when inflammation might be under control.

A systematic review based on 19 studies concluded that fibromyalgia was significantly associated with higher disease activity scores, with all but one study reporting higher DAS28 in participants with comorbid fibromyalgia. In 16 of these studies, a statistically significant increase in the DAS in RA patients with comorbid fibromyalgia compared to those without was noted, but not with clinical (swollen joint count) or laboratory (ESR, CRP) markers of disease activity. It concluded that fibromyalgia could lead to inflated disease activity measures, resulting in inappropriate escalation or cessation of treatment in the underlying index rheumatic condition.

This review highlights the limitations of using disease activity indices alone in assessing inflammatory activity in rheumatic patients with concomitant fibromyalgia. It is therefore important that these scores are interpreted in conjunction with knowledge of the presence of concomitant fibromyalgia to ensure optimal management and appropriate drug treatment. Indeed, the European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) definition of difficult-to-treat RA suggested that concomitant non-inflammatory disease…

### Presentation and diagnosis of fibromyalgia [^111io4UK]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Fibromyalgia is challenging to detect and diagnose due to its substantial symptomatic overlap with several other conditions. Although the hallmark symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain, patients often report specific or localized pain symptoms, further complicating the diagnosis. Assessing pain symptoms is the first step in the diagnostic process and must include performing a differential diagnosis and identifying comorbid illnesses. New diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia enable primary care physicians to bypass a time-consuming 18-point physical examination and instead use assessment tools.

### Towards a mechanism-based approach to pain management in osteoarthritis [^1158ZPu1]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Pain is the defining symptom of osteoarthritis (OA), yet available treatment options, of which NSAIDs are the most common, provide inadequate pain relief and are associated with serious health risks when used long term. Chronic pain pathways are subject to complex levels of control and modulation, both in the periphery and in the central nervous system. Ongoing clinical and basic research is uncovering how these pathways operate in OA. Indeed, clinical investigation into the types of pain associated with progressive OA, the presence of central sensitization, correlation with structural changes in the joint, and the efficacy of novel analgesics afford new insights into the pathophysiology of OA pain. Moreover, studies in disease-specific animal models enable the unraveling of the cellular and molecular pathways involved.

We expect that increased understanding of the mechanisms by which chronic OA-associated pain is generated and maintained will offer opportunities for targeting and improving the safety of analgesia. In addition, using clinical and genetic approaches, it might become possible to identify subsets of patients with pain of different pathophysiology, thus enabling a tailored approach to pain management.

### Fibromyalgia syndrome: practical strategies for improving diagnosis and patient outcomes [^11574hNo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Recent advances in the understanding of the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of fibromyalgia must be applied in clinical practice to achieve optimal patient outcomes. Evidence indicates that fibromyalgia is a hyperalgesic state, resulting from a generalized problem with augmented pain processing that likely results from the way the spinal cord and the brain process pain and other sensory information. The descending pain pathway involving serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, as opposed to the descending opioid pain pathway, appears to be selectively attenuated.

Newer treatment options targeted at the pain mechanisms include the alpha(2)-delta pregabalin, which binds to the alpha(2)-delta subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels in neurons, and the serotonin-norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors duloxetine and milnacipran. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran for the management of fibromyalgia.

In addition to pharmacologic therapy, patient education, cognitive behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise, and strength and flexibility training are important components of care. An individualized treatment plan should be developed with consideration of each patient's unique combination of fibromyalgia symptoms, functional level, and the presence of the comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions that are common in patients with fibromyalgia.

This educational activity provides clinicians with the tools necessary to differentiate fibromyalgia syndrome from other chronic pain conditions through a review.

### Development of medical therapeutics in osteoarthritis: Time for action to improve patient care [^114gRB91]. Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Where does this leave us in the management of osteoarthritis (OA)? Stratification tools can be developed to aid in the assessment and management of OA. Enriching patient subgroups through stratification in clinical trials — such as in post-traumatic cases, synovitis, and pain sensitization — may yield more useful results for patients who could benefit from personalized strategies. Such interventions may require one or more drug interventions. Additionally, combining pharmacotherapy with exercise and physical therapy has proven to reduce pain and improve function in knee and hip OA, leading to improved performance, reduced disability, and enhanced quality of life.

Proposing combination interventions is an attractive strategy for OA. This combination therapy model relies on the efficacy of all components for the outcome; critically, pharmacological symptom improvement should enable individuals to gain maximal benefit by facilitating physical therapies and improving outcomes. Novel trial design remains challenging in OA and is crucial for testing such complex interventions. It is also vital in assessing meaningful outcomes and effect sizes, where changes may only become evident over several years. Effective therapies for OA are likely to involve a combination of approaches that modify joint structures and modulate pain symptoms.

### EULAR recommendations for the health professional's approach to pain management in inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis [^114wGi82]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ankle osteoarthritis, specifically in the context of pain management through nonpharmacological measures, the EULAR 2018 guidelines recommend considering a multidisciplinary intervention if monotherapy has failed or if several concurrent treatments are indicated. This may involve addressing psychological distress in combination with a sedentary lifestyle.

### Canadian pain society and Canadian rheumatology association recommendations for rational care of persons with fibromyalgia: A summary report [^114f8gKA]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

To summarize the development of evidence-based guidelines for the clinical care of persons with fibromyalgia (FM), recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of FM, new diagnostic criteria, and new treatment options were considered.

Recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and patient follow-up were drafted according to the classification system of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. Following a thorough review, these were endorsed by the Canadian Rheumatology Association and the Canadian Pain Society.

FM is a polysymptomatic syndrome presenting a spectrum of severity, with body pain as a pivotal symptom. It is a positive clinical diagnosis, not a diagnosis of exclusion, and does not require specialist confirmation. While there are no confirmatory laboratory tests, some investigation may be necessary to exclude other conditions.

Ideal care occurs in the primary care setting, employing nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation. The treatment objectives should focus on symptom reduction and improved function through a patient-tailored approach that is symptom-based. Self-management strategies that combine good lifestyle habits with a strong locus of control are imperative.

Medications provide only modest relief, often at lower doses than commonly suggested, and require combinations based on clinical judgment. Continued reassessment of the risk-benefit ratio for any drug treatment is necessary. The outcome should aim for functioning within a normal life.

### Juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome: A review - Treatment and prognosis [^115WT1oh]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2021). Low credibility.

The primary goal in the treatment of juvenile primary fibromyalgia syndrome (JPFS) is to enhance quality of life through pain relief and improved function. A multidisciplinary approach, combining behavioral and exercise-based modalities, is currently the standard of care for JPFS. Treatment should begin with non-pharmacologic modalities, most importantly exercise. Other non-pharmacologic modalities include movement and meditative treatments, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

Reassurance is very important, including acknowledging that the patient's pain is real and emphasizing that it is not dangerous. Caregivers should communicate that although the pain may last for an unknown period and no immediate cure exists, there are therapeutic options that may reduce the pain over time. Setting goals of leading a full life, stressing the importance of lifestyle factors, and treating emotional symptoms are critical.

Multidisciplinary programs may be implemented in hospital or outpatient settings. In a study comparing an intensive day-hospital rehabilitation program of physical, occupational, and psychological therapies to outpatient treatment for children with significant pain-related disability, those enrolled in the day-hospital rehabilitation had significantly larger improvements in functional disability, pain-related fear, and readiness to change. Intensive, multidisciplinary outpatient programs have also reported improved pain, function, and quality of life in children with JPFS.

A recent article suggested that the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation associated with fibromyalgia (FM) and the modest results…

### Challenges and controversies of complex interventions in osteoarthritis management: Recognizing inappropriate and discordant care [^1163z2HD]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

In primary care, adults 45 years and over consulting with joint pain and limitations in everyday activity are more likely to receive NICE recommendations if a diagnosis of OA has been recorded in the medical electronic record. Delay in diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment and suboptimal care. Overuse of imaging has prompted NICE to highlight the recommendation for diagnosing OA on clinical grounds and setting a quality standard to audit this approach.

Diagnosis and subsequent treatment are often focused on a single, most painful joint rather than multisite joint problems. Yet multisite joint pain is the most common presentation in consultations in primary care, and having more joint sites affected leads to more healthcare consultations irrespective of specialty or site. As summarized in a recent systematic review, there is a paucity of evidence to guide practitioners regarding treatment of multisite joint pain, with few studies describing interventions for considering OA in all affected joints. Comorbidities also often go under-recognized in primary care and the community, which further hampers the holistic assessment recommended by NICE.

Reports have highlighted the impact of language when giving the diagnosis of OA. Health care professionals' views can be perceived to be negative, for example, 'nothing can be done' and 'it is your age'. Unhelpful descriptions and terminology can easily transfer from the X-ray report into the consultation, with people with OA concerned for their 'degenerative meniscal tear'. Use of language to…

### A roadmap for the management of fibromyalgia [^116zR2up]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

The patient is at the center of the treatment roadmap for fibromyalgia, which extends beyond the primary care physician to include multidisciplinary experts and community resources. The physician must create a framework in which a full treatment strategy can be articulated with the input of the patient. Physicians need to help patients with fibromyalgia educate themselves about their illness and its treatment, and understand that treatment success depends on patients' engagement with all components of the treatment roadmap.

### 2015 recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica: A European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^117PkDWi]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). High credibility.

The 2015 guidelines provided by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) emphasize the importance of screening for comorbidities in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). These comorbidities include diabetes or glucose intolerance, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, peptic ulcer disease, osteoporosis, recent fractures, cataracts or glaucoma risk factors, chronic or recurrent infections, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other relevant medications, and risk factors for steroid-related side effects.

### Predictors of change in bodily pain in early rheumatoid arthritis: an inception cohort study [^111SXHJk]. Arthritis Care & Research (2012). Low credibility.

Opinions differ as to whether fibromyalgia should be seen as a comorbidity in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or whether the clinical features of fibromyalgia represent changes in pain processing associated with the arthritis. Viewing fibromyalgia as a comorbidity suggests potential for treatments directed at mechanisms other than joint inflammation in a subgroup of patients. However, the extent to which pain processing is aberrant in RA may occur across a continuum.

Applying fibromyalgia classification criteria in RA may identify a subgroup of patients with the most abnormal pain processing but may also conceal a larger number of patients in whom similar pain mechanisms significantly contribute to their symptoms. In clinical practice, the Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28) is often interpreted with regard to the contribution of the tender joint count (TJC) and general health (GH) to the total score, based on individual clinical judgment rather than standardized or quantifiable criteria.

We propose that a derived measure for the contribution of these patient-reported components to DAS28, measured here as the DAS28-P index, may be a convenient and useful index of noninflammatory pain mechanisms in RA.

Pain is often the most bothersome symptom of RA; however, epidemiologic risk factors for worse pain in RA have been researched less thoroughly than outcomes such as disease activity and radiologic damage. Pain is associated with high disease activity and can be reduced by early effective treatment of inflammatory disease. Female sex may be related to worse pain over time, and psychological factors influence pain reporting in RA. Radiographic changes may be linked to…

### Do comorbid fibromyalgia diagnoses change following a functional restoration program in patients with chronic disabling occupational musculoskeletal disorders [^113hsD3m]. Spine (2014). Low credibility.

A retrospective study was conducted using prospectively collected data. The objective was to determine whether comorbid fibromyalgia, identified in patients with chronic disabling occupational musculoskeletal disorders (CDOMDs), resolves with a functional restoration program (FRP).

Fibromyalgia involves widespread bodily pain and tenderness to palpation. Recent studies indicate that 23% to 41% of patients with CDOMDs entering an FRP have comorbid fibromyalgia, compared to population averages of 2% to 5%. Few studies have examined whether fibromyalgia diagnoses resolve with any treatment, and none have investigated the diagnosis's responsiveness to an FRP.

A consecutive cohort of patients with CDOMDs (82% with spinal disorders and all reporting chronic spinal pain) and comorbid fibromyalgia (N = 117) completed an FRP, which included quantitatively directed exercise progression and multimodal disability management. Diagnosis responsiveness was evaluated at discharge, creating two groups: those who retained the fibromyalgia diagnosis and those who did not. These groups were compared with chronic regional lumbar pain-only patients (LO group, n = 87), who lacked widespread pain and fibromyalgia.

Of the patients with comorbid fibromyalgia, 59% (n = 69) retained the fibromyalgia diagnosis (RFM group), and 41% (n = 48) lost the fibromyalgia diagnosis (LFM group) at discharge. Although all three groups reported decreased pain intensity, disability, and depressive symptoms from admission to discharge, RFM patients reported higher symptom levels than the LFM and LO groups at discharge.
