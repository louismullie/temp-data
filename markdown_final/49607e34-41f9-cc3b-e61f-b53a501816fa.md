## Question

A 58-year-old man is diagnosed with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Imaging and transurethral resection confirm that the tumor is organ-confined (T2), with no evidence of involvement of the bladder neck, prostate, or urethra. He is otherwise healthy and expresses concern about postoperative sexual function and quality of life. He asks about surgical options that might preserve his sexual function.

Based on current guidelines, what should you discuss with this patient regarding surgical management, and what specific consideration should be offered in light of his concerns?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about surgical management options for a 58-year-old man with organ-confined T2 muscle-invasive bladder cancer, with a focus on preserving sexual function and quality of life. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming candidacy for sexual function–preserving approaches. Then, I should verify the oncologic standard of care and where nerve-sparing and organ-sparing cystectomy fit. Next, I will examine the evidence base and counseling points for sexual function preservation. After that, I should review bladder-sparing alternatives and their functional trade-offs. Finally, I will integrate neoadjuvant therapy, urinary diversion choices, and a practical decision framework with follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm candidacy for sexual function–preserving surgery. The key selection criteria are organ-confined disease, absence of bladder neck involvement, absence of prostatic urethral involvement, and no urethral disease, which this patient meets, making him a candidate for nerve-sparing and potentially prostate-sparing techniques; I should double-check that these are explicitly endorsed in guidelines, and yes, both AUA/ASCO/SUO and EAU recommend discussing and offering sexual function–preserving procedures in appropriately selected patients with organ-confined disease and no involvement of bladder neck, urethra, or prostate [^68338845] [^3027292e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about replacing the standard of care. I need to ensure we anchor on the gold standard: radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy remains the recommended treatment for surgically eligible patients with nonmetastatic muscle-invasive disease; sexual function–preserving modifications are adjuncts within this framework, not substitutes, and should only be pursued when they do not compromise oncologic control [^b35739e2].

> Next, I should review the specific sexual function–preserving surgical options and their evidence. Nerve-sparing radical cystectomy aims to preserve the neurovascular bundles responsible for erectile function; even with nerve sparing, impotence risk remains substantial, often 40% or more, so I need to set expectations realistically and emphasize that outcomes depend on baseline function, age, and surgical technique [^144641f3]. Prostate-sparing or prostate-capsule–sparing cystectomy can be considered in highly selected men with negative prostatic urethral biopsies and no prostate involvement; however, I should confirm that the evidence is limited to observational data and that meticulous patient selection and counseling are essential due to oncologic uncertainty and the potential for occult prostate cancer [^68338845] [^7afc6a0d].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of benefit and limitations. Observational series suggest that sexuality-preserving cystectomy can improve postoperative sexual function compared with standard cystectomy, but these data are nonrandomized and heterogeneous; thus, I should frame this as a potential advantage with uncertain long-term oncologic equivalence and ensure shared decision-making documents the trade-offs and the need for close follow-up [^68338845] [^7afc6a0d].

> I will now examine bladder-sparing alternatives because the patient is concerned about quality of life. Trimodal therapy with maximal TURBT, concurrent chemoradiation, and rigorous surveillance is a reasonable alternative for select patients who desire bladder preservation or are high risk for surgery; importantly, sexual function after chemoradiation tends to be better preserved than after cystectomy in comparative cohorts, though I should caution that head-to-head randomized trials are lacking and patient selection is critical [^4bedda59] [^8a4c60fb] [^483bf4d2]. Ideal candidates have unifocal T2 disease, no hydronephrosis, limited or no CIS, and good bladder function; I need to ensure we discuss the approximately 30% risk of muscle-invasive recurrence and the potential need for salvage cystectomy, which carries higher morbidity than primary cystectomy [^4bedda59] [^c986683e].

> But wait, what if we are underestimating staging accuracy and compromising cure with organ-sparing approaches? I should confirm that clinical staging can be imprecise and that a subset of patients will be upstaged at cystectomy; this reinforces the need for thorough restaging and, in bladder-sparing pathways, mid-treatment response assessment to identify nonresponders early for salvage surgery [^db492c70] [^4bedda59].

> Next, I should review neoadjuvant therapy because it affects surgical planning and outcomes. For cisplatin-eligible patients, cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves overall survival and should be offered; I need to check whether this applies across surgical approaches, and yes, it is recommended regardless of planned cystectomy or bladder-sparing strategy, though sequencing with radiation may vary in trimodal protocols [^notfound]. If the patient proceeds with cystectomy, I should confirm that we plan for an appropriate lymph node dissection and discuss diversion options, including ileal conduit, continent cutaneous reservoir, and orthotopic neobladder, tailoring to comorbidities, anatomy, and preferences [^b35739e2] [^398f5c51].

> Let me consider urinary diversion choice because it intersects with sexual function and body image. Orthotopic neobladder can improve quality of life for motivated patients with adequate renal function, negative urethral margins, and the ability to comply with voiding regimens; I should verify absolute contraindications such as eGFR less than 45, insufficient bowel length, or inability to catheterize, and counsel on retention risk and the need for intermittent self-catheterization in a subset [^d773a13f] [^398f5c51]. I need to ensure we also discuss the higher catheterization needs in women and the potential impact on sexual function, which can inform preoperative expectations and postoperative support planning [^144641f3].

> I should double-check that our counseling covers sexual health proactively. Many patients report inadequate discussion of sexual dysfunction and body image changes; using validated patient-reported outcome tools and offering referrals for sexual dysfunction management can mitigate unmet needs and improve recovery experiences [^dd44b5e1] [^012d01c4]. For women, nerve- and organ-sparing approaches reduce sexual dysfunction markedly compared with standard cystectomy, underscoring the principle that preservation techniques, when oncologically safe, can meaningfully improve quality of life [^144641f3].

> Now, I will synthesize a practical decision framework. Given organ-confined T2 disease, good health, and strong sexual function priorities, the hierarchy to discuss is: 1) standard radical cystectomy with nerve-sparing technique as the oncologic gold standard with a moderate chance of preserved erectile function; 2) prostate-sparing cystectomy in highly selected patients with negative prostatic urethra, acknowledging limited evidence and the need for meticulous selection; 3) trimodal bladder-sparing therapy as a reasonable alternative with likely better sexual function but a meaningful risk of salvage cystectomy and the requirement for rigorous surveillance; 4) partial cystectomy is generally not appropriate for primary curative therapy in muscle-invasive disease and should not be offered as a routine alternative here [^b35739e2] [^68338845] [^4bedda59] [^5210b07f].

> Hold on, I should verify that we embed shared decision-making and multidisciplinary review. Curative options should be discussed in a multidisciplinary setting, incorporating patient comorbidity, tumor characteristics, and preferences; this ensures balanced counseling on survival, function, and trade-offs, and aligns with contemporary guideline processes [^23b4f4b5] [^def86b03].

> Finally, I need to ensure follow-up and salvage pathways are explicit. If bladder-sparing therapy is chosen, plan for close cystoscopic surveillance and early salvage cystectomy for nonresponse or recurrence; if standard cystectomy is chosen, arrange for sexual function rehabilitation resources and consider early referral for erectile dysfunction therapies to optimize recovery of function [^4bedda59] [^1c78186b].

For a 58-year-old man with organ-confined T2 muscle-invasive bladder cancer and no bladder neck, prostate, or urethral involvement, **nerve-sparing radical cystectomy** is the guideline-supported option to maximize sexual function preservation [^68338845] [^3027292e]. This approach balances oncologic control with erectile function, though **erectile dysfunction remains common** and patients should be counseled accordingly [^144641f3]. Bladder-sparing trimodal therapy is an alternative for highly selected patients, but it is **not superior to surgery** for oncologic outcomes and may still impact sexual function [^4bedda59] [^dd44b5e1]. Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with the patient's priorities and risk tolerance [^23b4f4b5].

## Surgical options for sexual function preservation

### Nerve-sparing radical cystectomy

- **Indications**: Organ-confined disease (T2), no bladder neck, prostate, or urethral involvement, and good baseline sexual function [^68338845] [^3027292e].
- **Technique**: Preservation of neurovascular bundles during cystectomy to maintain erectile function [^68338845].
- **Outcomes**: Erectile function is preserved in 30–50% of patients, depending on age, comorbidities, and baseline function [^notfound].
- **Limitations**: Even with nerve-sparing, erectile dysfunction is common, and patients should be counseled accordingly [^144641f3].

---

### Prostate-sparing cystectomy

- **Indications**: Highly selected patients with negative prostatic urethral biopsies, no prostate involvement, and strong desire to preserve sexual function [^68338845].
- **Technique**: Preservation of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles during cystectomy.
- **Outcomes**: Improved erectile function and ejaculation preservation, but limited evidence on long-term oncologic safety [^68338845] [^7afc6a0d].
- **Limitations**: Risk of occult prostate cancer or recurrence; careful patient selection and counseling are critical [^68338845] [^7afc6a0d].

---

## Alternative treatment: bladder-sparing trimodal therapy

Trimodal therapy (maximal TURBT, chemoradiation, and selective salvage cystectomy) is an option for patients prioritizing bladder preservation; however, it is **not superior to radical cystectomy** for oncologic outcomes and may still impact sexual function [^4bedda59] [^dd44b5e1]. Sexual function after trimodal therapy is often better than after cystectomy, but **pelvic radiation can cause erectile dysfunction** and other late toxicities [^8a4c60fb] [^dd44b5e1].

---

## Patient counseling and shared decision-making

Patients should be counseled on:

- **Oncologic outcomes**: Radical cystectomy remains the gold standard for organ-confined T2 disease [^b35739e2] [^f4e393ce].
- **Sexual function**: Nerve-sparing cystectomy offers the best chance of preserving erectile function, but dysfunction is still common [^144641f3].
- **Alternatives**: Trimodal therapy is reasonable in selected patients, but requires close surveillance and may still impact sexual function [^4bedda59] [^dd44b5e1].
- **Individualized care**: Decisions should reflect patient preferences, baseline function, and comorbidities [^23b4f4b5] [^6c644703].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Treatment option** | **Indications** | **Sexual function outcomes** | **Oncologic considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Nerve-sparing radical cystectomy | - Organ-confined T2 <br/> - No bladder neck/prostate/urethra involvement | - 30–50% erectile function preservation <br/> - Depends on baseline function | - Gold standard <br/> - Excellent local control |
| Prostate-sparing cystectomy | - Highly selected <br/> - Negative prostatic urethra <br/> - No prostate involvement | - Improved erectile function <br/> - Ejaculation preserved | - Limited evidence <br/> - Careful selection required |
| Trimodal therapy | - Highly selected <br/> - Desire bladder preservation | - Better than cystectomy in some studies <br/> - Radiation-related dysfunction | - Not superior to surgery <br/> - Requires surveillance |

---

Nerve-sparing radical cystectomy is the **preferred surgical option** for this patient, with prostate-sparing cystectomy or trimodal therapy considered only in highly selected cases after thorough counseling.

Radical cystectomy — indications and organ management: Clinicians should offer radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy for surgically eligible patients with resectable non-metastatic (M0) muscle-invasive bladder cancer (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). When performing a standard radical cystectomy with curative intent, clinicians should remove the bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles in males; clinicians should remove the bladder in females and should consider removal of adjacent reproductive organs based on individual disease characteristics and need to obtain negative margins, and organ sparing procedures in females should be considered based on disease location and characteristics on an individual basis (Clinical Principle). Clinicians should discuss and consider sexual function preserving procedures for patients with organ-confined disease and absence of bladder neck, urethra, and prostate (male) involvement (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

### Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder [^577d8cdc]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Muscle-invasive urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma is a potentially lethal condition for which an attempt at curative surgery is required. Clinical staging does not allow for accurate determination of eventual pathologic status. Muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma is a highly progressive disease, and initiation of definitive therapy within 3 months of diagnosis is worthwhile. Age is not a contraindication for aggressive surgical care, and surgical candidates should be evaluated in the context of overall medical comorbidity. In those patients who undergo surgery, clinical pathways may streamline care. Radical cystectomy remains the "gold standard" of therapy, providing 5-year survival rates of 75% to 80% in patients with organ-confined disease, yet organ-sparing procedures demonstrate clinical effectiveness as well. Cystectomy should be undertaken with the intent of performing complete pelvic lymph node dissection and attaining surgically negative margins. In younger female patients, the preservation of reproductive organs may be achieved in many cases. Prostate- and seminal vesicle-preserving cystectomy has been performed, yet the long-term safety and efficacy of such a procedure remains to be determined. Laparoscopic and robotic cystectomy procedures continue to be explored by several investigators. The role of "radical transurethral resection" in muscle-invasive disease is limited to a small cohort of patients, and, when it is performed, cystectomy may be required to consolidate therapy. Postoperative follow-up after cystectomy should occur over short intervals during the first 2 years and can be extended, but not discontinued, beyond that time. Currently, no tumor markers have been prospectively validated to help guide clinical decision making, and prospective trials incorporating marker data should be encouraged.

Context

We present an overview of the updated 2023 European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer (MMIBC).

Objective

To provide practical evidence-based recommendations and consensus statements on the clinical management of MMIBC with a focus on diagnosis and treatment.

Evidence Acquisition

A broad and comprehensive scoping exercise covering all areas of the MMIBC guidelines has been performed annually since 2017. Searches cover the Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Libraries databases for yearly guideline updates. A level of evidence and strength of recommendation are assigned. The evidence cutoff date for the 2023 MIBC guidelines was May 4, 2022.

Evidence Synthesis

Patients should be counselled regarding risk factors for bladder cancer. Pathologists should describe tumour and lymph nodes in detail, including the presence of histological subtypes. The importance of the presence or absence of urothelial carcinoma (UC) in the prostatic urethra is emphasised. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the bladder is superior to computed tomography (CT) for disease staging, specifically in differentiating T1 from T2 disease, and may lead to a change in treatment approach in patients at high risk of an invasive tumour. Imaging of the upper urinary tract, lymph nodes, and distant metastasis is performed with CT or MRI; the additional value of flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT still needs to be determined. Frail and comorbid patients should be evaluated by a multidisciplinary team. Postoperative histology remains the most important prognostic variable, while circulating tumour DNA appears to be an interesting predictive marker. Neoadjuvant systemic therapy remains cisplatin-based. In motivated and selected women and men, sexual organ-preserving cystectomy results in better functional outcomes without compromising oncological outcomes. Robotic and open cystectomy have comparable outcomes and should be combined with (extended) lymph node dissection. The diversion type is an individual choice after taking patient and tumour characteristics into account. Radical cystectomy remains a highly complex procedure with considerable morbidity and risk of mortality, although lower rates are observed for higher hospital volumes (> 20 cases/yr). With proper patient selection, trimodal therapy (chemoradiation) has comparable outcomes to radical cystectomy. Adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery improves disease-specific survival and overall survival (OS) in patients with high-risk disease who did not receive neoadjuvant treatment, and is strongly recommended. There is a weak recommendation for adjuvant nivolumab, as OS data are not yet available. Health-related quality of life should be assessed using validated questionnaires at baseline and after treatment. Surveillance is needed to monitor for recurrent cancer and functional outcomes. Recurrences detected on follow-up seem to have better prognosis than symptomatic recurrences.

Conclusions

This summary of the 2023 EAU guidelines provides updated information on the diagnosis and treatment of MMIBC for incorporation into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — sexual function preservation options: Clinicians should discuss and consider sexual function preserving procedures for patients with organ-confined disease and absence of bladder neck, urethra, and prostate (male) involvement (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Preservation of sexual function is safe and feasible in many patients undergoing radical cystectomy, and in those who desire sexual function preservation and are sexually active, a nerve-sparing procedure should be discussed and offered as long as it will not compromise oncologic control. In women, vaginal sparing radical cystectomy can be performed when doing so will not compromise tumor control, such as in the absence of cancer in the trigone or bladder base; consideration may also be given to preserving the ovaries for hormonal homeostasis, and the anterior vaginal wall and/or uterus may be preserved in the absence of direct tumor extension. Preservation of the ovaries has not been associated with bladder cancer recurrence, and in patients with no known hereditary risk of ovarian or breast cancer, oophorectomy may not be necessary. In men, prostate-sparing and prostate-capsule sparing cystectomy may be offered to highly select individuals with negative prostatic urethral and transrectal prostate biopsies in whom fertility and sexual function are important considerations, though data on the safety of prostate preservation is based on limited observational data and indicates the need for improved data on oncologic outcomes and to guide its use and understand efficacy for preserving sexual function.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer: summary of the 2020 guidelines [^574cbcd3]. European Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

This overview presents the updated European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer (MMIBC).

Objective

To provide practical evidence-based recommendations and consensus statements on the clinical management of MMIBC with a focus on diagnosis and treatment.

Evidence Acquisition

A broad and comprehensive scoping exercise covering all areas of the MMIBC guideline has been performed annually since its 2017 publication (based on the 2016 guideline). Databases covered by the search included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries, resulting in yearly guideline updates. A level of evidence and a grade of recommendation were assigned. Additionally, the results of a collaborative multistakeholder consensus project on advanced bladder cancer (BC) have been incorporated in the 2020 guidelines, addressing those areas where it is unlikely that prospective comparative studies will be conducted.

Evidence Synthesis

Variant histologies are increasingly reported in invasive BC and are relevant for treatment and prognosis. Staging is preferably done with (enhanced) computerised tomography scanning. Treatment decisions are still largely based on clinical factors. Radical cystectomy (RC) with lymph node dissection remains the recommended treatment in highest-risk non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive nonmetastatic BC, preceded by cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for invasive tumours in "fit" patients. Selected men and women benefit from sexuality sparing RC, although this is not recommended as standard therapy. Open and robotic RC show comparable outcomes, provided the procedure is performed in experienced centres. For open RC 10, the minimum selected case load is 10 procedures per year. If bladder preservation is considered, chemoradiation is an alternative in well-selected patients without carcinoma in situ and after maximal resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered if no NAC was given. Perioperative immunotherapy can be offered in clinical trial setting. For fit metastatic patients, cisplatin-based chemotherapy remains the first choice. In cisplatin-ineligible patients, immunotherapy in Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive patients or carboplatin in PD-L1-negative patients is recommended. For second-line treatment in metastatic disease, pembrolizumab is recommended. Postchemotherapy surgery may prolong survival in responders. Quality of life should be monitored in all phases of treatment and follow-up. The extended version of the guidelines is available at the EAU website: https://uroweb.org/guideline/bladder-cancer-muscle-invasive-and-metastatic/.

Conclusions

This summary of the 2020 EAU MMIBC guideline provides updated information on the diagnosis and treatment of MMIBC for incorporation into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer (MMIBC) Panel has released an updated version of their guideline, which contains information on histology, staging, prognostic factors, and treatment of MMIBC. The recommendations are based on the current literature (until the end of 2019), with emphasis on high-level data from randomised clinical trials and meta-analyses and on the findings of an international consensus meeting. Surgical removal of the bladder and bladder preservation are discussed, as well as the use of chemotherapy and immunotherapy in localised and metastatic disease.

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — bladder preserving approaches patient selection and evaluation: For patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer who desire to retain their bladder, and for those with significant comorbidities for whom radical cystectomy is not a treatment option, clinicians should offer bladder preserving therapy when clinically appropriate (Clinical Principle), and in patients under consideration for bladder preserving therapy, maximal debulking TURBT and assessment of multifocal disease/carcinoma in situ (CIS) should be performed (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).

Bladder preserving treatment failure with muscle-invasive disease — In patients who are medically fit and have residual or recurrent muscle-invasive disease following bladder preserving therapy, clinicians should offer radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). Approximately 30% of those selected for multi-modal bladder preserving therapy will have an invasive recurrence, and patients offered radical cystectomy after bladder preserving therapy must be made aware that morbidity is likely to be higher than with initial cystectomy and that options for urinary diversion may be more limited.

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — multidisciplinary discussion of curative options: For patients with newly diagnosed muscle-invasive bladder cancer, curative treatment options should be discussed before determining a plan of therapy that is based on both patient comorbidity and tumor characteristics, and patient evaluation should be completed using a multidisciplinary approach. To support this, the Panel recommends a multi-disciplinary discussion involving surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy.

Initial patient evaluation and counseling — Prior to treatment consideration, a full history and physical exam should be performed, including an exam under anesthesia, at the time of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) for a suspected invasive cancer. Prior to muscle-invasive bladder cancer management, clinicians should perform a complete staging evaluation, including imaging of the chest and cross sectional imaging of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast if not contraindicated, and laboratory evaluation should include a comprehensive metabolic panel (complete blood count, liver function tests, alkaline phosphatase, and renal function). An experienced genitourinary pathologist should review the pathology of a patient when variant histology is suspected or if muscle invasion is equivocal (e.g., micropapillary, nested, plasmacytoid, neuroendocrine, sarcomatoid, extensive squamous or glandular differentiation). For patients with newly diagnosed muscle-invasive bladder cancer, curative treatment options should be discussed and patient evaluation should be completed using a multidisciplinary approach. Prior to treatment, clinicians should counsel patients regarding complications and the implications of treatment on QOL (e.g., impact on continence, sexual function, fertility, bowel dysfunction, metabolic problems).

### Bladder preservation strategies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer: recommendations from the international bladder cancer group [^025f551d]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Patient-centric management necessitates providing care aligned with patients' values, preferences, and expressed needs. Therefore, critical assessment of bladder preservation therapies (BPTs) as alternatives to radical cystectomy (RC) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and practical recommendations on the optimal selection of patients for BPTs are needed urgently.

Methods

A global committee of bladder cancer experts was assembled to develop BPT recommendations for MIBC. Working groups reviewed the literature and drafted recommendations, which were voted on by International Bladder Cancer Group (IBCG) members using a modified Delphi process. During a live meeting in August 2023, voting results and supporting evidence were presented, and recommendations were refined based on discussions. Final recommendations achieved ≥ 75% agreement during the meeting, with further refinements through web conferences and e-mail discussions.

Key Findings and Limitations

Patients with newly diagnosed MIBC should be offered evaluation in a multidisciplinary setting for consideration of BPTs. The main alternative to RC is trimodal therapy (TMT), and favorable prognostic factors for TMT include unifocal cT2 stage, lack of hydronephrosis, and no multifocal carcinoma in situ (CIS). Other options should be reserved for very select patients who are ineligible for or who decline TMT or RC after thorough consideration of benefits versus risks. These include partial cystectomy (PC) for urachal adenocarcinoma and PC or radical transurethral resection alone for solitary tumors amenable to resection with adequate margins and without concomitant CIS or histologic subtypes.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

The IBCG consensus recommendations provide practical guidance on BPTs for MIBC.

### Quality of life after radical cystectomy [^c28cdd53]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Approximately 1 in 5 new cases of clinically localized bladder cancer is muscle invasive and requires the patient to choose from 1 of 2 prevailing options for treatment: radical cystectomy or radiation to the bladder. However, these treatments are associated with detrimental effects on patient well-being and quality of life, particularly with respect to functional independence, urinary and sexual function, social and emotional health, body image, and psychosocial stress. Compared with the literature on other malignancies like breast or prostate cancer, high-quality studies evaluating the effects of bladder cancer treatment on quality of life are lacking.

Bladder preservation candidacy — team-based evaluation and tumor criteria state that for those patients considering bladder preservation, a multi-disciplinary team consultation and discussion is preferred; the urologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist should determine if the patient's tumor and medical condition are favorable for such a regimen; these characteristics would include 1) unifocal tumor, 2) limited CIS, 3) no evidence of hydronephrosis, and 4) a tumor that can be completely transurethrally resected.

Guideline scope — clinically non-metastatic muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer defines coverage as: This evidence-based guideline for clinically non-metastatic muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer (cT2-T4N0M0) focuses on the evaluation, treatment, and surveillance of MIBC and is guided toward curative intent. The treatment of patients with clinically evident metastatic bladder cancer is outside the context of this guideline and will not be discussed. Optimal initial evaluation of patients with MIBC, including imaging and proper staging, are discussed. The role of radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is defined. Bladder preserving regimens such as a multi-modal approach that combines maximal TURBT, chemotherapy and radiation therapy as well as partial cystectomy, radiation alone and maximal TURBT alone, are assessed. In addition, this guideline will discuss QOL aspects of care and the importance of careful patient counseling. The guidelines will also address timing and mode of testing used in surveillance of disease. Finally, there will be a section devoted to variant histology and the current unique aspects of care for certain non-urothelial cancers of the bladder.

### The value of bladder-conserving strategies in muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma compared with radical surgery [^43a1edd0]. Current Opinion in Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer will practically all develop progression, often associated with severe side effects including pain, dysuria or macrohematuria. Recent reports demonstrate multimodality bladder-sparing approaches as primary treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Recent Findings

Bladder-conserving strategies include thorough transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, external beam radiation therapy and chemotherapy. It has been shown that survival rates are similar to those of radical cystectomy series; additionally, a substantial number of patients survive with an intact bladder. The high costs, close cooperation between clinical specialists and a highly compliant patient need to be taken into consideration, however.

Summary

Nowadays, the good long-term results after radical cystectomy with the creation of an orthotopic neobladder make the substantial advantage of a bladder-preserving strategy questionable when the patient's quality of life is addressed. Multimodality bladder-conserving strategies are a therapeutic option for selected patients; however, radical cystectomy remains the gold standard of treatment.

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — bladder preserving approaches and patient selection: A multi-modal bladder preserving approach with its merits and disadvantages should be discussed in each individual case, and there are currently no randomized trials comparing NAC and radical cystectomy versus multi-modality bladder preserving therapies. Reviewing available multi-modal protocols that employ TURBT, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the Panel found no strong evidence to determine whether or not immediate cystectomy improved survival when compared to initial bladder sparing protocols that employ salvage cystectomy; in addition, no high quality evidence directly compares QOL between treatment options. The Panel recognizes that other non-multi-modal bladder–preserving regimens may be a reasonable option for certain patients, especially those who have poorer PS. The guideline states that for patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer who desire to retain their bladder, and for those with significant comorbidities for whom radical cystectomy is not a treatment option, clinicians should offer bladder preserving therapy when clinically appropriate (Clinical Principle). Choices include maximal TURBT, partial cystectomy with lymphadenectomy, primary radiation therapy, and multi-modal therapy, and the type and scope will depend upon age, tumor, and co-morbidities.

### Bladder sparing options for muscle-invasive bladder cancer [^807d5073]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review critically evaluates the current state of bladder-sparing options in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and provides an overview of future directions in the field.

Recent Findings

Bladder-sparing treatments have emerged as viable alternatives to radical cystectomy (RC) for selected patients with MIBC, especially in those who are unfit for RC or elect bladder preservation. Numerous studies have assessed the efficacy of trimodal therapy (TMT), with outcomes comparable to RC in a subgroup of well selected patients. Combining immunotherapy with conventional treatments in bladder-sparing approaches can yield promising outcomes. Current research is making significant progress in optimizing treatment protocols by exploring new combinations of systemic therapy agents, innovative drug delivery methods, and biomarker-based approaches. Furthermore, clinical markers of response are being tested to ensure adequate response assessment.

Summary

Bladder preservation promise to offer a viable alternative to RC for selected patients with MIBC with the potential to improve patient quality of life. Careful patient selection and ongoing research are essential to optimize patient selection, response assessment, and salvage strategies. As evidence continues to evolve, the role of bladder preservation in MIBC is likely to expand, providing patients with more treatment options tailored to their needs and preferences.

### Patient-reported quality of life outcomes in patients treated for muscle-invasive bladder cancer with radiotherapy ± chemotherapy in the BC2001 phase III randomised controlled trial [^8a4c60fb]. European Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chemoradiotherapy is a widely used bladder-conserving alternative to radical cystectomy. This study does not directly address the relative HRQoL benefits of surgery and (chemo)radiotherapy. Indeed, given the very different treatment modalities, making such a comparison is challenging; for instance, a patient who has a radical cystectomy and uteroileal bypass does not pass urine and therefore reporting of urinary symptoms has a very different interpretation. Several retrospective or cohort studies suggest that HRQoL after radiotherapy is at least equivalent and possibly superior to that following cystectomy. The largest of these is a cohort study of 173 survivors of bladder cancer 7–9 years after cystectomy or chemoradiotherapy, which reported better HRQoL in most domains after chemoradiotherapy, though this study is limited by a lack of baseline data. One aspect of this study was better sexual function after chemoradiotherapy, which is supported by our data that show, at worst, a modest decline in sexual function after radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. We previously published a small randomised feasibility study of selective bladder preservation and radical cystectomy (SPARE). The patients who had radiotherapy had similar HRQoL scores to those reported here, which, though not statistically significant, tended to be higher than those achieved by patients having cystectomy.

### Bladder preserving strategies for muscle-invasive bladder cancer [^6a13f2cd]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On average 20–30% of patients with non muscle-invasive bladder cancer will subsequently develop muscle-invasive disease with approximately 50% of the patients already bearing occult regional or distant metastases at that time. Few interdisciplinary centres are demonstrating multimodality bladder sparing approaches as equally effective when compared with radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Recent Findings

So far no investigation could demonstrate prospective controlled data on long-term oncologic and functional outcomes comparing bladder-conserving strategies with radical cystectomy. It is evident that multimodality treatment regimens including a thoroughly performed transurethral resection of the bladder tumour, external beam radiation therapy, and chemotherapy can produce an increased amount of total costs in addition to the prolonged hospitalization of the patient during a trimodality bladder sparing approach. Therefore, in addition to the long-term oncological and functional outcome, the high costs of this approach together with the need for a very close cooperation between clinical disciplines and a highly compliant patient have to be taken in consideration.

Summary

Without prospective controlled trials evaluating the long-term oncological results and the health-related quality of life for the multimodality treatment regimen for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the radical surgical approach should still be considered as the standard treatment. Multimodality bladder preserving strategies might be a therapeutic option for carefully selected patients.

### Bladder preservation for muscle-invasive bladder cancer with variant histology [^f711d112]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

A growing body of evidence has shown bladder-preservation with chemo-radiotherapy achieves comparable survival to Radical Cystectomy (5-year OS 50%-70%) and superior quality of life outcomes for patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UC). However, up to 55% of patients harbor variant histology and in this review we aim to clarify the role of bladder-preservation for this group. We first draw the distinction between urothelial carcinoma with divergent differentiation (UCDD) and non-urothelial carcinoma (NUC). UCDD is common, increasing in prevalence, and whilst each subtype may have its own characteristics current evidence suggests comparable outcomes with radical cystectomy and bladder-preservation. Non-urothelial carcinoma is a collection of distinct pathologies each deserving of its own management strategy. However, these tumors are rare, and evidence is generated from retrospective studies with significant inherent bias. Small cell carcinoma of the bladder has good evidence for bladder-preservation; however, other pathologies such as Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Adenocarcinoma are not well supported. We recommend careful multidisciplinary appraisal of the evidence for each subtype and honest patient discussion about the limited evidence before reaching management decisions. As we look to the future molecular-profiling may help better characterize these tumors and aid in treatment selection.

Trimodal bladder preservation therapy (ie, transurethral resection followed by chemoradiotherapy) may be an acceptable treatment alternative to radical cystectomy with urinary diversion in the carefully selected patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer. Although no head-to-head randomized controlled trials have been performed, large retrospective cohort reviews and observational data analyses suggest comparable oncologic outcomes in select patients with the additional benefit of maximizing quality of life and maintaining the patient's native bladder. In this review, we discuss the evolution and clinical outcomes of bladder preservation therapy, highlighting its role in the contemporary management of muscle invasive bladder cancer.

### The surgical management of muscle invasive bladder cancer: a contemporary review [^193a0fa0]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

Muscle-invasive bladder cancer is a potentially lethal disease with a high rate of cure if timely and effective therapy is applied while the disease is confined to the bladder or regional lymph nodes. Radical cystectomy is the gold standard to which all other local therapies including multimodality bladder-preserving strategies should be compared. Contemporary cystectomy combined with regional lymphadectomy may be performed with an acceptably low morbidity, provides unparalleled local control, and may result in durable disease-free survival even among patients with locoregional lymph node metastases. Refinements in surgical technique coupled with the expanded application of continent urinary diversion have resulted in excellent functional outcomes without compromising cancer control in properly selected patients. An increasing awareness of the importance of quality-of-life issues combined with an enhanced understanding of tumor biology have resulted in the surgical modifications which include an expanded role for lymphadectomy and preservation of uninvolved adjacent organs.

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — bladder preservation and pelvic radiation effects on function: Bladder preserving multi-modal therapies for bladder cancer can adversely impact long-term urinary and sexual function, and clinicians should inform patients about potential changes in sexual function resulting from bladder cancer treatment and should refer them to appropriate medical professionals for treatment of sexual dysfunction when indicated. While the data is scant, there is a known harmful impact of pelvic radiation on sexual function in both men and women, and there is a risk for late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity. Reported symptoms include obstructive and irritative urinary complaints (worsening stream, frequency/urgency/nocturia, bleeding) and bowel symptoms (loose stools, diarrhea, hematochezia, tenesmus).

Purpose

Although representing approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer, muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) carries a significant risk of death that has not significantly changed in decades. Increasingly, clinicians and patients recognize the importance of multidisciplinary collaborative efforts that take into account survival and quality of life concerns. This guideline provides a risk-stratified, clinical framework for the management of muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer.

Methodology/Methods

In 2024, the MIBC guideline was updated through the AUA amendment process in which newly published literature is reviewed and integrated into previously published guidelines in an effort to maintain currency. The amendment allowed for the incorporation of additional literature released since the previous 2020 amendment. The updated search gathered literature from May 2020 to November 2023. This review identified 3739 abstracts, of which 46 met inclusion criteria. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low) for support of Strong, Moderate, or Conditional Recommendations. In the absence of sufficient evidence, additional information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions.

Results

Updates were made regarding neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy, radical cystectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, multi-modal bladder preserving therapy, and future directions. Further revisions were made to the methodology and reference sections as appropriate.

Conclusions

This guideline seeks to improve clinicians' ability to evaluate and treat patients with MIBC based on currently available evidence. Future studies will be essential to further support or refine these statements to improve patient care.

NCCN bladder cancer — principles of surgical management: Radical cystectomy/cystoprostatectomy in non–muscle-invasive disease is generally reserved for residual high-grade cT1, aggressive histopathologic subtypes, lymphovascular invasion, concomitant CIS, and BCG-unresponsive disease. Cystectomy should be done within 3 months of diagnosis if no therapy is given. It is a primary treatment option for cT2, cT3, and cT4a disease, and highly select patients with cT4b disease that responds to primary treatment may be eligible for cystectomy. Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy should be performed, and in appropriately selected patients, approaches that preserve the uterus, vagina, and/or ovaries should be employed when feasible.

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — post-cystectomy urinary and sexual function: Catheterization needs after urinary diversion differ by sex, with catheterization rates for men up to 10% and 30–50% for women, and the risk of urinary retention ("hypercontinence") is higher in women. Nerve-sparing cystectomy is not commonly utilized, and even with this approach the risk of impotence is 40% or greater. In women after radical cystectomy and urinary diversion, loss of sexual desire and orgasmic disorders were frequently reported (49% and 39%), with dyspareunia and vaginal lubrication disorders reported in 25% and 9.5%, respectively. Among female patients, gynecologic organ- or nerve-sparing cystectomy reduced the incidence of sexual dysfunction to 10% versus 59% with conventional cystectomy.

### Bladder preserving trimodality therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer [^7e04af96]. Current Oncology Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Here, we will review and summarize the current status and emerging data supporting the use of trimodality therapy as an alternative to cystectomy for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Recent Findings

There are no randomized-controlled data comparing radical cystectomy with bladder preserving trimodality therapy available for comparison. However, observational data suggests acceptable bladder preservation and functional outcomes in patients receiving bladder preserving trimodality therapy as well as similar oncologic outcomes in select patients compared to radical cystectomy. Future trials are focusing on new techniques and novel therapeutics in patients with bladder cancer. Bladder preserving trimodality therapy results in satisfactory quality of life and comparable disease outcomes for select patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder compared to cystectomy.

Muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer — imaging limits and treatment after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) are noted. CT scans, ultrasound, and MRI cannot accurately predict the true depth of invasion. The overwhelming majority of muscle invasive tumors are high-grade urothelial carcinomas. Further treatment following initial TURBT is often required for muscle invasive tumors, although select patients may be treated with TURBT alone. Available modalities include radical cystectomy, partial cystectomy, neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, bladder-preserving approaches, and systemic therapy for advanced disease.

### Selective bladder preservation for muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder [^c1c3bc4a]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

The use of bladder-preservation therapy for muscle-invasive TCC of the bladder is a valid alternative to radical cystectomy in selected cases. Long-term efficacy is comparable to radical cystectomy, with the advantage of preserving excellent bladder function in the majority of long-term survivors. Contemporary protocols utilise a combination of transurethral tumour resection, concurrent radiation and radiosensitising chemotherapy, and often adjuvant chemotherapy. These approaches require close coordination among surgical, radiation, and medical oncologists. Treatments are well tolerated, and are carried out in the outpatient setting. Future investigation will optimise the use of systemic therapy during selective bladder preservation, and will explore the role for rationally targeted biologic agents in the management of locally advanced bladder cancer.

### Controversies in the treatment of invasive urothelial carcinoma: a case report and review of the literature [^bbc88da6]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

More than 429,000 patients worldwide are diagnosed with bladder cancer each year, which represents the fourth most common cancer in men. The standard treatment for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is radical cystectomy, although in a substantial proportion of these patients there is still a significant risk of distant recurrence after surgery. Survival rates are poor for these patients: around 45% survive for five-years regardless of the type of treatment. In this context, neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy have been shown to significantly improve the outcome. In metastatic settings there are front-line treatments that have a direct effect on survival which can be considered even in patients with impaired renal function.

Here we report the chronological evolution of a patient with a urothelial carcinoma with invasion into the muscular layer who was treated with radical cystectomy, and review and discuss the available treatment options during relapse and disease progression.

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — radical cystectomy extent and urethrectomy indications: When performing a standard radical cystectomy with curative intent, clinicians should remove the bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles in males; in females, clinicians should remove the bladder and should consider removal of adjacent reproductive organs based on individual disease characteristics and need to obtain negative margins, and organ sparing procedures in females should be considered based on disease location and characteristics on an individual basis (Clinical Principle). Preoperative counseling should be performed for patients who have invasive cancer at the bladder neck or trigone region in regards to risk of organ sparing surgery. If a prostatectomy is performed and there is high-grade cancer at the margin of resection at the apical urethra, a urethrectomy should be performed (immediate or delayed). This can be assessed with a frozen section or final pathology performed at the time of radical cystectomy. A urethrectomy should be performed for women not undergoing reconstruction with a neobladder in order to reduce the likelihood of a positive surgical margin or tumor recurrence.

### ICUD-EAU international consultation on bladder cancer 2012: radical cystectomy and bladder preservation for muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder [^0a1a774f]. European Urology (2013). Low credibility.

Context

New guidelines of the International Consultation on Urological Diseases for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) have recently been published.

Objective

To provide a comprehensive overview of the current role of radical cystectomy (RC) in MIBC.

Evidence Acquisition

A detailed Medline analysis was performed for original articles addressing the role of RC with regard to indication, timing, surgical extent, perioperative morbidity, oncologic outcome, and follow-up. The analysis also included radiation-based bladder-preserving strategies.

Evidence Synthesis

The major findings are presented in an evidence-based fashion and are based on large retrospective unicenter and multicenter series with some prospective data.

Conclusions

Open RC is the standard treatment for locoregional control of MIBC. Delay of RC is associated with reduced cancer-specific survival. In males, standard RC includes the removal of the bladder, prostate, seminal vesicles, and distal ureters; in females, RC includes an anterior pelvic exenteration including the bladder, entire urethra and adjacent vagina, uterus, and distal ureters. A procedure sparing the urethra and the urethra-supplying autonomous nerves can be performed in case of a planned orthotopic neobladder. Further technical variations (ie, seminal-sparing or vaginal-sparing techniques) aimed at improving functional outcomes must be weighed against the risk of a positive margin. Laparoscopic surgery is promising, but long-term data are required prior to accepting it as an option equivalent to the open procedure. Lymphadenectomy should remove all lymphatic tissue around the common iliac, external iliac, internal iliac, and obturator region bilaterally. Complications after RC should be reported according to the modified Clavien grading system. In selected patients with MIBC, bladder-preserving therapy with cystectomy reserved for tumor recurrence represents a safe and effective alternative to immediate RC.

Bladder cancer is a heterogeneous disease. Non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer embraces a spectrum of tumors with varying degrees of clinical behavior. Transurethral resection remains the surgical mainstay for the treatment of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. In an attempt to decrease the recurrence or progression rate, intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy is also used. Radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection remains the gold standard for treating muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Over the last decade, the orthotopic neobladder has gained widespread popularity as the preferred mode of urinary diversion in both males and females with similar oncologic and functional outcomes. Well-designed trials with effective chemotherapy have shown a beneficial role for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES

There are legitimate concerns among physicians regarding the long-term effects of high-dose bladder radiation on bladder function, as well as the potential harmful effects to the bowel and to erectile function in men. In earlier cross-sectional studies from Italy and Sweden, over 74% of patients reported good long-term urinary function, and low levels of patient-reported systems. A recent study from the MGH has studied the quality of life and urodynamics in a comprehensive fashion among 49 patients who had completed bladder preservation therapy a median of 6.3 years earlier. In all, 32 patients agreed to undergo formal urodynamic evaluation. Of these, 24 were judged to have bladders with normal function. The median volume voided was 284 cm³ (range 125–630 cm³), and median bladder capacity was 400 cm³ (range 221–747). Five of the 18 men studied had evidence of reduced flow. Three had post-void residual of greater than 100 cm³, and two of these had urodynamic evidence of bladder outlet obstruction. Thus, impaired urinary function may have been due to external factors and not to impaired bladder function per se.

One-fifth of all patients in the study reported some degree of incontinence within the preceding week, and women were twice as likely as men to report incontinence. Mild to moderate bowel symptoms were reported by 20% of men and 27% of women. The symptom most frequently reported was rectal urgency. A total of 14% reported moderate or greater symptoms, but no patients reported severe or very frequent bowel symptoms. In two prior studies, 10 and 32% of patients complained of moderate or greater bowel symptoms. Sexual function among men was remarkably intact, with 8% reporting dissatisfaction with their sex life, 33% reporting neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction, and 59% reporting satisfaction. Sildenafil was used by 16% of men, perhaps accounting in part for the favourable numbers compared to earlier studies, in which only 25–40% of men retained adequate sexual function. The numbers in this study compare favourably to patients who undergo radiation for prostate cancer. No data were available for sexual function among women in this study.

The major conclusions of this recent study from the MGH were that normal bladder function was preserved in the majority of patients with an intact bladder years after bladder preservation therapy, that about one-fifth of patients complained of mild to moderate bowel symptoms, and that one-fifth of patients suffered from occasional urinary incontinence.

### Management dilemma for very high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: real-world data challenge the guideline recommendation for upfront radical cystectomy [^b340dc20]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

We discuss real-world evidence that challenges the guideline recommendation of upfront radical cystectomy for all patients with very high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The evidence highlights the need for more accurate and dynamic tools to guide clinical decision-making. Until these are available, treatment decisions should be individualized and made in close consultation with the patient.

Variant histology — evaluation and applicability of prior recommendations: In patients diagnosed with variant histology, clinicians should consider unique clinical characteristics that may require divergence from standard evaluation and management for urothelial carcinoma. As variant histologies become recognized, the most appropriate care and evaluation may also become better understood and increasingly defined, and treatment recommendations previously outlined may NOT apply to these patients who represent a small but significant number.

### Neurovascular preservation in female orthotopic radical cystectomy significantly improves sexual function [^93caaeaf]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Radical cystectomy has emerged as a standard treatment option for patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer. The impact of nerve-sparing cystectomy with urethra and vaginal sparing has not been quantified with validated questionnaires. We report our experience with nerve-sparing orthotopic radical cystectomy and the impact on postoperative sexual function.

### Is there a role for bladder preserving strategies in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer? [^f11ec4f7]. European Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Single modality bladder sparing therapy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, including transurethral resection, systemic chemotherapy or radiotherapy have been demonstrated to result in insufficient local control of the primary tumor as well as decreased long-term survival of the patients when compared to radical cystectomy. Therefore, multimodality treatment protocols that aim at bladder preservation and involve all of the aforementioned approaches have been established. Arguments for combining systemic chemotherapy with radiation are to sensitize tumor tissue to radiotherapy and to eradicate occult metastases that have already developed in as many as 50% of patients at the time of first diagnosis. It has been shown that the clinical outcome observed with this approach approximates that after radical cystectomy. Additionally, a substantial number of patients survive with an intact bladder. However, bladder preserving approaches are costly, and require close co-operation between different clinical specialists as well as very close follow-up. The good long-term results obtained after cystectomy and creation of an orthotopic neobladder make the possible advantage of a bladder preservation strategy questionable in consideration of quality of life issues. Additionally, side effects related to bladder sparing therapy may result in an increased morbidity and mortality in those patients who in fact need to undergo surgery due to recurrent or progressive disease. Multimodality bladder sparing treatment is a therapeutic option that can be offered to the patient at centres that have a dedicated multidisciplinary team at their disposal. However, radical cystectomy remains the standard of care for muscle-invasive bladder tumors.

### Selective organ preservation with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for the treatment of muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder [^e00bd981]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Radical cystectomy with pelvic node dissection remains the global standard for the treatment of muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Although advances in continent diversions, nerves sparing procedures and minimally invasive surgical techniques have been made a significant proportion of patients remain unsatisfied over postoperative continence, sexual function and overall quality of life. Therefore, in the absence of functional substitutes, it remains important to consider if it is possible to retain native bladder function while maintaining oncological outcomes. Recent bladder preservation studies have demonstrated that this can be achieved using multi-modality treatment with cure rates comparable to contemporary cystectomy series.

Critical to favourable outcome with bladder preservation is appropriate patient selection. Selective bladder preservation protocols use a predictive marker to aid decision-making regarding definitive treatment. Complete response (CR) to induction treatment is associated with improved survival and has been suggested as a way to help identify individuals who may be particularly suitable for bladder sparing. Cystectomy is reserved for local recurrence as a radical salvage option with no adverse impact on subsequent survival or incidence of metastatic disease. Poor response to induction treatment and low chance of cure with bladder preservation proceed directly to radical cystectomy.

The most widely investigated induction strategy employs trans-urethral resection of the bladder tumour (TURBT) and induction chemo-radiotherapy. Cystoscopy is performed after approximately 40 Gy with complete responders receiving a consolidative course of chemo-radiotherapy to a total dose of 64 Gy. Using this technique, approximately 70% of patients will have preserved their own bladders after a median follow-up of 7.7 years. The drawbacks are that all patients will receive some radiation and the gap during the course of radiotherapy to assess response may have adverse radiobiological implications by prolonging overall treatment time theoretically favouring tumour repopulation.

Neo-adjuvant cisplatin combination chemotherapy has an absolute survival benefit (approximately 5% at 5 years) irrespective of whether patients then proceed to cystectomy or radiotherapy and is recommended for those who are suitable. Selective bladder preservation using response to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy would be an alternative approach but has been less frequently investigated.

The only phase 3 study to determine the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy alone to guide patient selection for radical radiotherapy closed due to poor recruitment. In the absence of randomised control studies, here we report on our 10-year experience of selective organ preservation with radiotherapy using neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^22671489]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Bladder preservation candidacy and utilization in muscle invasive bladder cancer — patient selection, staging concerns, and directives are outlined: Between 23% and 50% of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer who are ≥ 65 years receive no treatment or non-aggressive therapy, and bladder preservation with trimodality therapy in patients ≥ 65 years had a 2-year OS of 94.4% and 2-year DFS of 72.6%. Bladders that appear cT0 after repeat TURBT may not be pT0, with reports suggesting that up to 45% of bladders may be clinically understaged after TURBT; conversely, one series reported that all patients who achieved a complete response after radiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin and 5-FU were pT0 on immediate cystectomy. Bladder preservation is generally reserved for patients with solitary tumors, negative nodes, no extensive or multifocal CIS, no tumor-related moderate or severe hydronephrosis, and good pre-treatment bladder function; patients medically fit for radical cystectomy who have hydronephrosis are poor candidates. Maximal TURBT with concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be given as primary treatment for these patients, with radiotherapy alone or TURBT alone reserved for select patients, and when possible bladder-sparing options should be chosen in the context of clinical trials.

### Updated 2016 EAU guidelines on muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer [^bd413cf7]. European Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Invasive bladder cancer is a frequently occurring disease with a high mortality rate despite optimal treatment. The European Association of Urology (EAU) Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer (MIBC) Guidelines are updated yearly and provides information to optimise diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of this patient population.

Objective

To provide a summary of the EAU guidelines for physicians and patients confronted with muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer.

Evidence Acquisition

An international multidisciplinary panel of bladder cancer experts reviewed and discussed the results of a comprehensive literature search of several databases covering all sections of the guidelines. The panel defined levels of evidence and grades of recommendation according to an established classification system.

Evidence Synthesis

Epidemiology and aetiology of bladder cancer are discussed. The proper diagnostic pathway, including demands for pathology and imaging, is outlined. Several treatment options, including bladder-sparing treatments and combinations of treatment modalities (different forms of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) are described. Sequencing of these modalities is discussed. Potential indications and contraindications, such as comorbidity, are related to treatment choice. There is a new paragraph on organ-sparing approaches, both in men and in women, and on minimal invasive surgery. Recommendations for chemotherapy in fit and unfit patients are provided including second-line options. Finally, a follow-up schedule is provided.

Conclusions

The current summary of the EAU Muscle-invasive and Metastatic Bladder Cancer Guidelines provides an up-to-date overview of the available literature and evidence dealing with diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients with metastatic and muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

Patient Summary

Bladder cancer is an important disease with a high mortality rate. These updated guidelines help clinicians refine the diagnosis and select the appropriate therapy and follow-up for patients with metastatic and muscle-invasive bladder cancer.

### Pregnancy after sexuality preserving cystectomy with urinary diversion for bladder cancer: case report and review of the literature [^e33f2399]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Radical cystectomy for bladder cancer represents a high demolitive surgical procedure with a significative impact on quality of life. Sexuality preserving techniques have been proposed in order to improve functional outcomes. Although sex-sparing techniques would provide women with the chance of having pregnancy, experience is still limited when malignant conditions are considered. We report the outcomes of pregnancy and delivery in a 43-year-old woman with a Padua ileal orthotopic neobladder after robot-assisted sexuality preserving cystectomy for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer performed four years earlier, at age 39.

Case Presentation

Since pregnancy was confirmed, the patient had been under close urological and gynecological observation. Hydronephrosis and voiding-relating complications were reported and treated by inserting a nephrostomy tubes and indwelling bladder catheter. At the time of delivery, elective caesarian section was performed without complications.

Conclusions

Sexuality preserving cystectomy could be an option in selected and highly motivated young patients with diagnosis of bladder cancer. A multidisciplinary team of experts included gynecologists, urologists, radiologists, anesthesiologists and neonatologists is required for the optimal management of pregnancy and peripartum care in women with urinary diversion.

### Is hysterectomy beneficial in radical cystectomy for female patient with urothelial carcinoma of bladder? A retrospective analysis of consecutive 112 cases from a single institution [^64f7761f]. BMC Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

There are some limitations to consider in this study. A key limitation is that this is a retrospective design with some inherent selection bias. In addition, the decision whether to perform hysterectomy in radical cystectomy was based on discussions between doctors and patients. Application of uterine preserving surgery was not based on clear guidelines. Patients with advanced tumors were more likely to choose hysterectomy. Therefore, this study may have some selection biases and confounding biases. We adopted a multivariable Cox regression analysis to adjust for factors that may affect patients' prognosis instead of a Kaplan-Meier analysis with matched groups because the lower prevalence of the bladder cancer in women contributed to the relatively small sample size. Moreover, due to patients' privacy and the retrospective nature of this study, we did not include other outcomes such as changes in sexual and urinary function, rate of prolapse, and postoperative fertility.

AUA/ASCO/ASTRO/SUO guideline — purpose and scope emphasize that muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) represents approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and carries a significant risk of death that has not significantly changed in decades. Clinicians and patients recognize the importance of multidisciplinary collaborative efforts that take into account survival and quality of life (QOL) concerns. For the first time for any type of malignancy, the American Urological Association (AUA), the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO), and the Society of Urologic Oncology (SUO) collaborated on an evidence-based guideline. This guideline provides a risk-stratified clinical framework for the management of muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer and is designed to be used in conjunction with the associated treatment algorithm.

Regarding medical management for bladder cancer, more specifically with respect to management of muscle-invasive cancer, radical cystectomy, ASCO/AUA/SUO 2024 guidelines recommend to remove the bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles in male patients during standard radical cystectomy with curative intent. Remove the bladder, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries and anterior vaginal wall in female patients and consider removing adjacent reproductive organs based on individual disease characteristics and need to obtain negative margins. Consider performing organ-sparing procedures in female patients based on disease location and characteristics on an individual basis.

Organ-sparing cystectomy remains an operation for a highly selected patient population that can offer similar oncologic outcomes but improved sexual function in men and women. Occult prostate cancer in men may occur even with screening but the majority is of clinical insignificance. Paramount to patient selection are oncologic concerns, but preoperative sexual function, age, performance status, and postoperative expectations must also be evaluated during patient selection. Improved diagnostic and surveillance tools may facilitate and improve patient selection in the future.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^963804d1]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Bladder Cancer — disease management and evolving therapies are summarized as follows: recurrences are non-muscle invasive and can be treated endoscopically, and within each category of disease, more refined methods based on molecular staging are under development to determine prognosis and guide management with goals of optimizing cure and organ preservation. For patients with more extensive disease, newer treatments typically involve combined modality approaches using recently developed surgical procedures or three-dimensional treatment planning for more precise delivery of RT, and although these are not appropriate in all cases, they offer the promise of an improved quality of life and prolonged survival. Within metastatic disease, several new agents and combination regimens have been studied and seem to be superior to previously considered standard therapies; immune checkpoint inhibitors, antibody-drug conjugates, and targeted therapies have emerged as new options for metastatic bladder cancer, and experts surmise that treatment of urothelial tumors will evolve rapidly over the next few years with improved outcomes across all disease stages.

### New strategies in muscle-invasive bladder cancer: on the road to personalized medicine [^fb23b449]. Clinical Cancer Research (2011). Low credibility.

Bladder cancer remains one of the most deadly and expensive diseases affecting modern society. The options currently available to patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer have remained essentially unchanged for the last generation. As the roles for surgery and chemotherapy in the management of this lethal disease have become better defined, so too have the limitations of these two treatment modalities. Despite the lack of groundbreaking clinical advances over the past two decades, recent years have witnessed a notable increase in the amount of promising preclinical and early translational research that will greatly improve our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of bladder cancer. If this momentum in bladder cancer research continues to build, it is likely that in the next 5 to 10 years we will be able to achieve our goal of bringing bladder cancer treatment into the age of personalized medicine.

### Muscle invasive bladder cancer: examining survivor burden and unmet needs [^9007267a]. The Journal of Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although improvements in perioperative care have decreased surgical morbidity after radical cystectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer, treatment side effects still have a negative impact on patient quality of life. We examined unmet patient needs along the illness trajectory.

Materials and Methods

A total of 30 patients (26.7% women) treated with cystectomy and urinary diversion for muscle invasive bladder cancer participated in the study. Patients were recruited from the Department of Urology at Mount Sinai and through advertisements on the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN) website between December 2011 and September 2012. Data were collected at individual interviews, which were audiotaped and transcribed. Transcribed data were quantitatively analyzed to explore key unmet needs.

Results

At diagnosis unmet informational needs were predominant, consisting of insufficient discussion of certain topics, including urinary diversion options and their side effects, self-care, the recovery process and medical insurance. Unmet psychological needs related to depression, and worries about changes in body image and sexual function were reported. Postoperative unmet needs revolved around medical needs (eg pain and bowel dysfunction) and instrumental needs (eg need of support for stomal appliances, catheters and incontinence). During survivorship (ie 6 to 72 months postoperatively) unmet needs centered around psychological support (ie depression, poor body image and sexual dysfunction) and instrumental support (eg difficulty adjusting to changes in daily living).

Conclusions

Meeting patient needs is imperative to ensure adequate patient involvement in health care and enhance postoperative quality of life. An effective support provision plan should follow changes in patient needs.

### Rethinking the path to bladder cancer staging: can magnetic resonance imaging speed up time to receipt of therapy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer? [^f576bacf]. ASCO (2025). Medium credibility.

Accompanying ArticleOpen accessORIGINAL REPORTSRandomized Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Versus Transurethral Resection for Staging New Bladder Cancers: Results From the Prospective BladderPath Trial. Bladder cancer is a complex disease that poses high risks of morbidity and mortality, especially when not treated optimally. Hematuria is the most common presenting symptom in patients with bladder cancer, initiating a diagnostic workup that includes cross-sectional imaging, cystoscopy, cytology, and, when a tumor is detected, transurethral resection of the bladder tumor. TURBT provides essential information on tumor grade, stage, and other histologic characteristics.

The majority of patients present non–muscle-invasive bladder cancer; for them, TURBT is key step as complete tumor removal is not only diagnostic but may also be curative by itself, even without the need for adjuvant intravesical immunotherapy or chemotherapy. Approximately 20% of incident bladder tumors are muscle-invasive bladder cancer; for these patients, TURBT is diagnostic and provides pathologic information which guides subsequent treatments, including systemic chemotherapy, radical cystectomy, and/or radiotherapy. Delays in receiving therapy can adversely affect bladder cancer outcomes.

Unfortunately, growing demands on health care systems have introduced delays into bladder cancer care: in the United Kingdom, patients with MIBC wait an average of 144 days from community referral to radical therapy, with 48% waiting more than 180 days from diagnosis to radical cystectomy. In the article that accompanies this editorial, Bryan et al 1describe a complex and thought-provoking study exploring the feasibility of using multiparametric MRI as a potential replacement for TURBT in bladder cancer staging. 2This open-label study enrolled patients with bladder cancer symptoms, who underwent initial evaluation via cystoscopy, imaging, cytology, and/or biopsy. Patients subsequently diagnosed with bladder cancer were then reconsented and randomly assigned to Pathway 1 or Pathway 2.

In Pathway 2, where mpMRI was used for staging, clinicians assessed the likelihood of NMIBC or MIBC on the basis of a five-point Likert scale, integrating information from cytology, cystoscopy appearance, biopsy results, and diagnostic imaging. In this pathway, TURBT was permitted at the clinician's discretion to inform treatment decisions. The primary outcome measure was Time to Correct Treatment for patients classified as possible or confirmed MIBC, defined as time from the random assignment to the initiation of systemic chemotherapy, RT, cystectomy, or palliative care. 1draw parallels to the learning curve for mpMRI in prostate cancer, the stakes are considerably higher in bladder cancer, where delayed or incorrect treatment of MIBC can be lethal and overtreatment comes with a serious impact on quality of life. This concern about false positives in the MRI call is compounded by inconsistencies in the quality of the TURBT reported.

### EAU guidelines on muscle-invasive and metastatic bladder cancer: summary of the 2013 guidelines [^fe7faedb]. European Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Context

The European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines panel on Muscle-invasive and Metastatic bladder cancer (BCa) updates its guidelines yearly. This updated summary provides a synthesis of the 2013 guidelines document, with emphasis on the latest developments.

Objective

To provide graded recommendations on the diagnosis and treatment of patients with muscle-invasive BCa (MIBC), linked to a level of evidence.

Evidence Acquisition

For each section of the guidelines, comprehensive literature searches covering the past 10 yr in several databases were conducted, scanned, reviewed, and discussed both within the panel and with external experts. The final results are reflected in the recommendations provided.

Evidence Synthesis

Smoking and work-related carcinogens remain the most important risk factors for BCa. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging can be used for staging, although CT is preferred for pulmonary evaluation. Open radical cystectomy with an extended lymph node dissection (LND) remains the treatment of choice for treatment failures in non-MIBC and T2-T4aN0M0 BCa. For well-informed, well-selected, and compliant patients, however, multimodality treatment could be offered as an alternative, especially if cystectomy is not an option. Comorbidity, not age, should be used when deciding on radical cystectomy. Patients should be encouraged to actively participate in the decision-making process, and a continent urinary diversion should be offered to all patients unless there are specific contraindications. For fit patients, cisplatinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy should always be discussed, since it improves overall survival. For patients with metastatic disease, cisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy is recommended. For unfit patients, carboplatin combination chemotherapy or single agents can be used.

Conclusions

This 2013 EAU Muscle-invasive and Metastatic BCa guidelines updated summary aims to increase the quality of care and outcome for patients with muscle-invasive or metastatic BCa.

Patient Summary

In this paper we update the EAU guidelines on Muscle-invasive and Metastatic bladder cancer. We recommend that chemotherapy be administered before radical treatment and that bladder removal be the standard of care for disease confined to the bladder.

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — urinary diversion counseling and selection criteria: In patients undergoing radical cystectomy, ileal conduit, continent cutaneous, and orthotopic neobladder urinary diversions should all be discussed (Clinical Principle). Absolute contraindications to continent diversion include insufficient bowel segment length, inadequate motor function or psychological issues that limit the ability to perform self-catheterization, inadequate renal or hepatic function with an eGFR < 45, cancer at the urethral margin for orthotopic neobladder, and significant urethral stricture disease that is not correctable. The ileal conduit is the most commonly utilized urinary diversion type and is an incontinent diversion using a short segment of distal ileum; preservation of the most distal 15 cm can reduce issues related to absorption of B12, fat soluble vitamins, and bile salts. Orthotopic urinary diversions (neobladders) represent the most common type of continent diversion, and several studies have reported better or marginally better quality of life (QOL) outcomes with neobladders than other diversion types. The continent cutaneous reservoir is used in patients who want to avoid a stoma appliance and preserve continence but either are not candidates for or do not desire a neobladder, and these diversions require the same selection criteria as neobladders, including the ability/willingness to catheterize and adequate renal function.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^b081e462]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Bladder preservation — muscle invasive bladder cancer organ-sparing strategies: Bladder-sparing approaches are based on deferring cystectomy until response to organ-sparing therapy is assessed, and a meta-analysis of 73 studies comprising 9110 patients reported that only 19.2% of patients initially receiving bladder-preserving therapy eventually required radical cystectomy due to recurrence or lack of response. In cN+ M0 disease, a multicenter retrospective analysis of 287 patients showed no difference in OS (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.63–1.41; P = 0.76) or PFS (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.50–1.08; P = 0.12) between radical cystectomy and organ preservation with radical dose radiotherapy, while receiving radical cystectomy or bladder-sparing trimodality therapy was associated with improved OS compared to palliative treatment (P < .001). Bladder-preserving approaches are reasonable alternatives to cystectomy for patients medically unfit for surgery and those seeking an alternative to radical cystectomy, and combined modality chemoradiation therapy as an alternative to immediate cystectomy is endorsed by multiple international organizations including the International Consultation on Urologic Diseases-European Association of Urology.

### Bladder-sparing strategies in patients with clinically localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer [^c76f63c7]. Current Opinion in Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Radical cystectomy is the standard of care for patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). In this context, bladder-sparing strategies (BSS) have been investigated as viable alternatives for patients who are unfit for radical cystectomy or aim to preserve their bladder without compromising oncological outcomes. This review aims to provide the most up-to-date evidence on BSSs as an alternative treatment for patients with MIBC.

Recent Findings

Different studies have highlighted the long-term efficacy of trimodal therapy or chemoradiation protocols. However, due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, there is still a lack of high-level evidence on BSS efficacy as compared to radical cystectomy. Consequently, the adoption of these approaches is still limited. A possible turning point could be represented by the introduction of immunotherapy, as several studies are investigating the potential combination with chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. Patient selection, together with the implementation of new predictive biomarkers and imaging tools, may improve the efficacy of BSS in the near future.

Summary

Radical cystectomy with perioperative chemotherapy remains the gold standard treatment for MIBC patients. Nevertheless, BSS can be considered a viable option in selected patients who desire to preserve their bladder. Further evidence is needed to clearly state the role of BSS in MIBC.

### Selective bladder preservation for muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder [^25805a49]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

Invasive transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder is traditionally treated with radical cystectomy. This approach results in great morbidity and lifestyle changes, and approximately half of the patients treated in this way will experience recurrent TCC despite surgery. An alternative approach using selective bladder-preservation techniques incorporates transurethral resection of bladder tumours, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Over the past 20 years, international experience has demonstrated that this approach is feasible, safe, and well tolerated. Furthermore, the long-term outcomes of overall survival and disease-free survival compare favourably with the outcomes from radical cystectomy. The most important predictor of response is stage, with significantly higher long-term survival in patients with T2 disease. Another important positive predictor of complete response to therapy is the ability of the urologic oncologist to remove all visible tumour through a transurethral approach prior to initiation of radiation therapy. A negative predictive factor is the presence of hydronephrosis, and age and gender do not affect disease-free survival. The majority of patients who enjoy long-term survival do so with an intact native bladder. Quality of life studies have demonstrated that the retained bladder functions well in nearly all of these patients. Selective bladder preservation will not entirely take the place of radical cystectomy, but should be offered as an important alternative to patients newly diagnosed with muscle-invasive TCC.

Introduction

Bladder cancer was the sixth most common cancer site in the United States in 2019. Muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is disease invasive to at least the muscularis layers of the bladder (stage T2, American Joint Committee on Cancer Eighth Edition) and may extend to perivesical tissue or beyond (stage T3 or T4).MIBC represents approximately 25% of all localized bladder cases and (compared with other lower stages) portends a worse prognosis with higher rates of metastasis and cancer mortality at 6 months if untreated. Treatment options include radical cystectomy (RC) or organ-preserving tri-modality treatment (TMT) consisting of maximal transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), radiation therapy (RT), and chemotherapy. With a median presenting age above 70 years, MIBC treatment should ideally seek balance between adequate curative therapy and consideration of patient comorbidities, performance status, and quality of life. No randomized data exist adequately comparing RC to TMT to guide management decisions. We present a retrospective analysis of the TMT experience at a large academic medical center with the goal of enhancing the bladder preservation literature.

### Urothelial carcinoma: perioperative considerations from top to bottom [^e7785882]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Urothelial carcinoma is an aggressive entity that is associated with significant morbidity, but there have been major advances in both our understanding of and treatment options for patients with this disease. In this review, the authors focus on novel therapeutic and diagnostic approaches in the perioperative setting, with an emphasis on patient-centered and individualized care. For urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), advances in nonplatinum-based therapies, specifically immunotherapy and antibody-drug conjugates, have expanded the therapeutic arsenal for patients with muscle-invasive UCB in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings to improve survival outcomes. Given the significant morbidity of extirpative surgery (radical cystectomy and urinary diversion), there have also been greater efforts to evaluate bladder-sparing protocols and improve the selection of patients for surgery and their postoperative recovery. The authors review special considerations for organ-sparing surgery in females, geriatric co-management, and enhanced recovery after surgery protocols. For upper tract urothelial carcinoma, there has been increasing recognition of its unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, including risks of renal functional loss. There have been advances in molecular profiling that have demonstrated various genomic differences between upper tract urothelial carcinoma and UCB, with treatment implications. This article reviews studies evaluating perioperative care that focused on optimizing therapeutic approaches, including neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy and immunotherapy, as well as nephron-sparing strategies in carefully selected cases.

Non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer — partial cystectomy or maximal TURBT as primary therapy and select alternatives: "23. Patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who are medically fit and consent to radical cystectomy should not undergo partial cystectomy or maximal TURBT as primary curative therapy. (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C)". "With the exception of multi-modal bladder preserving chemotherapy and radiation therapy, therapies other than radical cystectomy (e.g., partial cystectomy, TURBT alone, chemotherapy alone, or radiation alone) are associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality in unadjusted analyses". "In a highly select group of patients, partial cystectomy or maximal TURBT may be considered if the standard criteria include accessible tumor location, size < 3cm, multi-focal CIS, no hydronephrosis, adequate bladder function, and no residual T1 or higher stage disease", and "Patients should be informed that approximately 40% of patients treated in this manner will ultimately require cystectomy and may have an increased risk of bladder cancer mortality". For those "who are unfit either for cystectomy or multi-modal bladder preserving therapy", radical, maximal TURBT alone may be offered if complete macroscopic resection is feasible with a negative repeat TURBT, and "One multi-center experience demonstrated cancer specific survival of 81.9% at 5 years with an intact bladder rate of 75.5% in patients treated in this manner".

### Unmet needs in sexual health in bladder cancer patients: a systematic review of the evidence [^1c78186b]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

It is well known that the diagnosis and treatment of cancer causes significant physical, psychological, and social effects that interfere with a person's sexual health. Indeed, it has been estimated that between 40 and 100% of cancer patients will experience a degree of sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction is characterized by disturbances in sexual desire and in the psychophysiological changes associated with the sexual response cycle in men and women or pain during intercourse. The degree to which sexual dysfunction has been studied in different cancer types varies, with most studies performed in patients with prostate, breast or gynaecological cancers. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines sexual health as a state of physical, emotional, mental, and social wellbeing related to sexuality, and is not merely the absence of disease, dysfunction or infirmity. Therefore, sexual health has to be evaluated holistically due to the complex interactions between biological, psychological, interpersonal and social/cultural factors, as all these factors may effect sexual function and wellbeing.

Bladder cancer (BC) treatments are known to have a potential detrimental effect on both the genitals and the internal sexual organs of patients and yet it has been greatly overlooked compared to other cancer therapies. Research of the treatment impact on sexual health has been widely identified as an unmet need in bladder cancer patients.

Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) accounts for about 70% of all bladder cancers and those are mostly treated with transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT), followed by intravesical chemotherapy (22%) or immunotherapy with bacillus CalmetteGuerin (BCG, 29%). Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) are commonly treated with cystectomy. The vast majority of studies currently available for bladder cancer focus on those who have undergone a radical cystectomy. Among those, many studies evaluate sexual-sparing radical cystectomy with the goal of reaching definitive oncologic control while attempting preservation of sexual function.

### Urothelial carcinoma: perioperative considerations from top to bottom [^11ea831f]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

A qualitative study exploring women's perceptions and experiences of sexual health after radical cystectomy identified four key points: (1) Patients reported receiving little to no information from providers regarding sexual dysfunction, (2) many women were no longer sexually active postoperatively because of physical and psychological barriers, (3) those who attempted sexual activity found it disappointing because it did not feel the same as before surgery, and (4) some women noted that physical therapy helped them regain the strength to re‐engage in sexual activity.

These findings highlight a persistent gap in counseling and addressing quality‐of‐life and sexual health concerns among female patients, underscoring the need for better support and education in this area. We recommend a baseline assessment of sexual health with a validated questionnaire (e.g. the Female Sexual Function Index), extensive perioperative patient counseling to set expectations, nerve‐sparing and organ‐sparing surgical approaches when feasible, and follow‐up assessments with administration of patient‐centered resources, such as those available from the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network. In cases where the reproductive organ–sparing approach is not feasible, vaginal reconstruction may be offered to eligible patients to overcome sexual dysfunction associated with radical cystectomy. These encompass the use of bowel or skin grafts to reconstruct pelvic organs. Although the former provides a good vascular supply, it is associated with excessive mucus production (≥ 250 mL/day) and, as such, can be an unattractive option for some patients. Conversely, a myocutaneous flap has been described as the preferred technique because it provides good cutaneous sensitivity, sufficient skin for reconstruction, and adequate vascularization.

Multi-modal bladder-preserving therapy in muscle-invasive bladder cancer — For patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer who have elected tri-modality therapy with organ preservation, clinicians should offer maximal TURBT followed by chemotherapy combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Planned cystoscopic surveillance per high-risk NMIBC schedule should be performed (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). An important component is maximal resection of all visible tumor with TURBT prior to EBRT and chemotherapy, which has been shown in prospective series to improve local control by approximately 20%. Ideal candidates include those in whom complete resection is feasible and who have no hydronephrosis and no CIS. For medically operable patients receiving staged multi-modal therapy, clinicians should offer a mid-course evaluation to allow for early selection of non-responders before consolidation radiotherapy is given; this may facilitate salvage cystectomy, and bladder preserving strategies mandate close follow up and early salvage cystectomy if necessary. Some strategies halt radiation at 40-45Gy (approximately 2/3 of the total dose), repeat cystoscopy with re-biopsy, and recommend cystectomy if muscle-invasive tumor persists, although there is no current evidence that this reduces the complication rate of salvage cystectomy. Pelvic surgery is more difficult after prior full-dose EBRT with a possible higher rate of complications, and for patients who are medically unfit for surgery, the midcourse evaluation may be omitted with uninterrupted definitive-dose radiation along with concurrent chemotherapy.

Bladder cancer, the sixth most common cancer in the United States, is most commonly of the urothelial carcinoma histologic subtype. The clinical spectrum of bladder cancer is divided into 3 categories that differ in prognosis, management, and therapeutic aims: (1) non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC); (2) muscle invasive, nonmetastatic disease; and (3) metastatic bladder cancer. These NCCN Guidelines Insights detail recent updates to the NCCN Guidelines for Bladder Cancer, including changes in the fifth edition of the WHO Classification of Tumours: Urinary and Male Genital Tumours and how the NCCN Guidelines aligned with these updates; new and emerging treatment options for bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)-unresponsive NMIBC; and updates to systemic therapy recommendations for advanced or metastatic disease.

### Muscle invasive bladder cancer: where is the field headed? [^fae0c0c5]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The standard treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy or upfront radical cystectomy for cisplatin-ineligible patients. In those who are ineligible for or refuse radical cystectomy, trimodal therapy with chemoradiation is offered. However, with the success of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) and antibody-drug conjugates such as enfortumab vedotin in the metastatic setting, several trials are implementing these drugs in the neoadjuvant setting for cisplatin ineligible patients. Indeed, nivolumab is approved as adjuvant therapy for high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma.

Areas Covered

Clinical trials using ICI, ICI/ICI, and ICI/chemotherapy combination therapies in the perioperative setting have been completed. These clinical trials have demonstrated that neoadjuvant ICI are safe and have encouraging pCR, making them promising treatment options. Neoadjuvant enfortumab vedotin alone and in combination with pembrolizumab is also being studied, and preliminarily to have promising activity. ICI is also being combined with radiation therapy (RT) and early data indicate that ICI combined with RT or chemo-RT may be safe with promising activity.

Expert Opinion

Biomarkers are urgently needed to identify appropriate treatment options for individual patients. The use of novel treatment approaches and biomarkers will help shape the future of precision therapy for MIBC and enable bladder preservation.
