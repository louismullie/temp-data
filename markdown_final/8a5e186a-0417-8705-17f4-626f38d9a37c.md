## Question

Why can a pacer not capture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why a pacemaker can fail to capture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition of capture failure and how it differs from failure to pace. Then, I should categorize the etiologies by system level: generator, leads, electrode–myocardium interface, and programming. Next, I will prioritize the most common and clinically urgent causes, including electrolyte disturbances, lead problems, and threshold changes. After that, I should consider special contexts like perioperative settings, conduction system pacing, and temporary wires. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic approach and synthesize a concise, prioritized answer with safety margins and follow-up considerations.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't conflate terms. Failure to capture means the pacemaker delivers pacing spikes, but the myocardium does not depolarize, so there is no paced beat despite appropriate output delivery, whereas failure to pace means no spikes are delivered at all. This distinction guides troubleshooting and urgency, and I should keep it front and center as I proceed [^240d3dce] [^f56d4298].

> Now, I will organize etiologies by system level, starting with the generator and programming. Wait, let me verify the key issues here: low output settings below capture threshold, autocapture algorithms that may misclassify capture, battery depletion or rapid battery failure, and electromagnetic interference causing inhibition or output changes are the principal generator/programming causes of loss of capture. I should also remember that perioperative magnet placement can suspend autocapture and that device recalls for battery or connection defects have caused real-world capture failures, so I need to check for advisories and battery status early [^240d3dce] [^00fe4cbd] [^f5cdfcc1] [^7731270c].

> Next, I should review lead-related problems, because these are common and often progressive. Lead fracture, insulation breach, and microdislodgment can all raise capture thresholds or create intermittent capture loss. I need to check impedance trends and look for noise on the electrogram, since conductor fracture often shows very short, nonphysiologic R-R intervals and intermittent high-frequency signals, while insulation failure may show oversensing of physiologic or nonphysiologic signals. Hold on, I should verify that device diagnostics can help flag these patterns before I jump to invasive testing [^de53efba] [^5dbf729c] [^37702203].

> I will now examine the electrode–myocardium interface, because this is where threshold physiology and acute changes often explain capture failure. Hyperkalemia reduces myocardial excitability and can acutely abolish capture. Hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis can also worsen thresholds. Acute ischemia or infarction, perioperative edema and inflammation, and fibrosis or exit block can all increase the energy required to capture. Let me double-check that calcium gluconate can rapidly reverse hyperkalemic capture failure in emergencies, which it can, though definitive potassium lowering is still required [^2c931246] [^05c112c6] [^94c6ed12] [^0b11a68f].

> But wait, what if the threshold itself is the problem rather than a structural fault. Chronic threshold rise, rate-dependent threshold increases, and drug effects can all push the capture threshold above the programmed output. Flecainide is a classic culprit and can double thresholds. I should confirm that guidelines advise checking thresholds before, one week after, and periodically during therapy, and that a 2–3× safety margin is customary, though some modern devices use smaller margins with autocapture. Hold on, I should verify that even with nominal safety margins, intermittent threshold rises can still cause loss of capture in dependent patients, which they can [^358ee1d0] [^86bf4076] [^00fe4cbd] [^c7dc6910].

> Let me consider special contexts that change the pretest probabilities. In the perioperative setting, monopolar electrosurgery can damage leads or the generator, and magnet use can suspend autocapture. I should confirm that bipolar electrocautery, strategic pad placement, and temporary output increases are recommended mitigations. In CRT, loss of LV capture is common and often reflects fusion, ectopy, or threshold changes. In conduction system pacing, His bundle capture thresholds can be higher and less stable, and guidelines recommend documenting selective capture and planning for threshold rises. For temporary epicardial wires after surgery, edema and fibrosis progressively raise thresholds, so I need to anticipate daily threshold checks and plan for early removal when feasible [^c9f38dc5] [^00fe4cbd] [^98f30d55] [^2b06f63f] [^4513e0ba] [^94c6ed12].

> I should double-check the diagnostic approach so it's actionable. First, confirm failure to capture on ECG with pacing spikes not followed by paced beats. Then interrogate the device for battery, lead impedance, sensing integrity counts, and threshold history. Next, perform threshold testing at implant settings and again after reprogramming output upward. Obtain a chest X-ray to assess lead position and integrity. Check electrolytes, especially potassium, and review medications, particularly antiarrhythmics like flecainide. In perioperative patients, consider EMI and magnet effects. If CRT, use ECG criteria to verify LV capture and look for fusion or ectopy. If temporary wires, reassess thresholds daily and plan for removal or alternative pacing if thresholds rise [^f56d4298] [^240d3dce] [^18a979fe] [^8b4c869d].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety margins without reconciling practice patterns. Traditional teaching supports a 2–3× threshold safety margin, and many centers still use this in pacemaker-dependent patients, yet some contemporary devices employ autocapture with smaller margins. I should confirm that even with autocapture, device-verified thresholds should be checked regularly and output adjusted if thresholds rise, especially in dependent patients or when drugs like flecainide are used [^00fe4cbd] [^c7dc6910].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy of causes so the answer is clinically prioritized. The most common and urgent reasons a pacemaker fails to capture are: 1) electrolyte disturbances, especially hyperkalemia; 2) lead problems including fracture, insulation breach, or microdislodgment; 3) threshold changes from ischemia, inflammation, fibrosis, or drugs like flecainide; 4) programming issues such as low output or autocapture malfunction; 5) generator issues including battery depletion or hardware failure. Less common contributors include EMI, perioperative lead–myocardium interface injury, and device recalls. I should emphasize that rapid identification and correction of reversible causes, especially hyperkalemia and lead integrity, are critical to restore capture and prevent hemodynamic collapse [^2c931246] [^de53efba] [^358ee1d0] [^f5cdfcc1] [^c9f38dc5].

> Finally, I need to ensure the management implications are explicit. Immediate steps include increasing output to a 2–3× safety margin or the maximum allowable, treating hyperkalemia with calcium and potassium-lowering strategies, and securing alternative pacing if the patient is dependent. Definitive steps include lead revision or replacement for structural failure, generator replacement for battery or hardware failure, and ongoing surveillance for threshold changes with routine device follow-up and remote monitoring when available. I should confirm that device interrogation, chest radiography, and electrolyte assessment are the cornerstone of the initial workup in any patient with suspected loss of capture [^240d3dce] [^2c931246] [^227010e9] [^e728c865].

A pacemaker may fail to capture because the **output is too low** (below the myocardial capture threshold), the **lead is dislodged or fractured**, or the **myocardium is unresponsive** due to ischemia, fibrosis, or electrolyte disturbances (notably hyperkalemia) [^f56d4298] [^2c931246]. Other causes include **battery depletion**, **device malfunction**, or **interference from electromagnetic sources** [^7731270c] [^c9f38dc5]. Capture failure is confirmed when pacing spikes are present without corresponding P waves or QRS complexes; management includes increasing output, correcting reversible causes, repositioning or replacing the lead, or using temporary pacing if needed [^240d3dce] [^6a6a1289].

---

## Physiological basis of pacemaker capture

Capture depends on delivering sufficient current to depolarize the myocardium at the lead tip; the **minimum current required is the capture threshold**, which varies with lead position, myocardial properties, and systemic factors [^8b4c869d]. Stable capture generally requires an output at least 2–3 times the threshold to allow for daily variation and safety [^00fe4cbd].

---

## Common causes of pacemaker failure to capture

### 1. Inadequate output settings

- **Low output**: Programmed voltage or pulse width below the capture threshold.
- **Autocapture algorithms**: Misclassification or malfunction can reduce output below threshold [^c7dc6910].
- **Battery depletion**: Reduced available energy lowers effective output [^7731270c].

---

### 2. Lead-related issues

- **Dislodgement**: Migration from the optimal position increases threshold or causes loss of contact [^308fc1b7].
- **Fracture**: Conductor break interrupts current delivery [^de53efba].
- **Insulation breach**: Current leakage or shunting reduces effective myocardial stimulation [^08d086d7].
- **High impedance**: Indicates poor lead connection or tissue interface problems [^notfound].

---

### 3. Myocardial factors

- **Ischemia**: Acute MI or ischemia raises capture thresholds or causes exit block [^notfound].
- **Fibrosis**: Chronic scarring increases thresholds and impairs conduction [^notfound].
- **Electrolyte disturbances**: Hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, and acidosis alter excitability and thresholds [^2c931246] [^358ee1d0].

---

### 4. Device malfunction

Device malfunction includes **generator failure** — such as electronic faults, rapid battery depletion, or firmware issues — and **electromagnetic interference** from electrosurgery, MRI, or other sources that can transiently disrupt output or sensing [^c9f38dc5] [^631403fa].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

- **ECG findings**: Pacing spikes without P waves (atrial) or QRS complexes (ventricular) indicate failure to capture [^notfound].
- **Symptoms**: Bradycardia, dizziness, syncope, or fatigue in pacemaker-dependent patients [^9a61ea14].
- **Device interrogation**: Reveals high thresholds, impedance changes, or low battery [^227010e9].
- **Chest X-ray**: May show lead displacement or fracture [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

| **Cause** | **Management** |
|-|-|
| Low output | Increase voltage/pulse width; verify autocapture function [^9a61ea14] |
| Lead dislodgement/fracture | Reposition or replace lead [^notfound] |
| High impedance | Check connections; replace lead if faulty [^notfound] |
| Electrolyte disturbance | Correct potassium, acid-base status [^2c931246] |
| Battery depletion | Replace generator [^5de565f9] |
| Device malfunction | Replace generator; address EMI [^c9f38dc5] |
| Acute ischemia | Treat ischemia; consider temporary pacing [^0b11a68f] |

---

## Preventive measures

- **Regular follow-up**: Monitor thresholds, impedance, and battery status [^227010e9].
- **Safety margin**: Program output 2–3× threshold when feasible [^00fe4cbd].
- **Patient education**: Report symptoms promptly, especially in dependent patients [^227010e9].
- **Perioperative planning**: Manage EMI and use magnets judiciously [^c9f38dc5].

---

Pacemaker failure to capture most often reflects **output below threshold**, **lead problems**, or **myocardial unresponsiveness**; prompt recognition and targeted correction — including reprogramming, lead revision, or temporary pacing — restore capture and prevent harm [^f56d4298].

### Pacemaker malfunction-review of permanent pacemakers and malfunctions encountered in the emergency department [^f56d4298]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pacemaker malfunction refers to a failure of the pacemaker to perform the desired cardiac pacemaking function. These malfunctions can occur anywhere within the system from the pulse generator and leads to the electrode-myocardium interface. These failures of sensing, capture, and inadequate pacing can have severe hemodynamic consequences, so rapid identification of specific dysfunction is critical to intervention and stabilization. Emergency providers should be aware of pacemaker components, function, basic programming, and types of malfunctions to adequately assess, stabilize, and disposition patients.

### Hyperkalemia induced failure of pacemaker capture and sensing [^2c931246]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia may cause cardiac pacemaker (PMK) malfunctioning due to a reduction of the electronegativity of the resting myocardial potential. Both sensing and capture mechanisms could be temporarily affected, with possible life-threatening effects. Calcium chloride may counteract almost immediately such a dangerous effect of hyperkalemia, restoring the normal pacemaker function. We describe the case of a 75-year-old woman, observed in the Emergency Department for extreme weakness, very large QRS complexes, and a pacemaker type II exit block, associated with sensing failure and "spike-on-T" phenomenon. She was managed with immediate i.v. calcium chloride, followed by insulin/glucose and sodium bicarbonate infusions; the ECG recordings show an almost immediate correction of the PMK malfunctioning and serial improvement of the intraventricular conduction. This case supports the feasibility and effectiveness of i.v. calcium administration, as expected on the basis of electrophysiological ionized calcium effect on the threshold potential.

### Tetraparesis and failure of pacemaker capture induced by severe hyperkalemia: case report and systematic review of available literature [^05c112c6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In severe hyperkalemia, neurologic symptoms are described more rarely than cardiac manifestations. We report a clinical case; present a systematic review of available literature on secondary hyperkalemic paralysis (SHP); and also discuss pathogenesis, clinical effects, and therapeutic options.

Case Report

A 75-year-old woman presented to the emergency department complaining of tetraparesis. Her serum potassium level was 11.4 mEq/L. Electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a pacemaker (PMK)-induced rhythm, with loss of atrial capture and wide QRS complexes. After emergency treatment to restore cell membrane potential threshold and lower serum potassium, neurologic and ECG signs completely disappeared. An acute myocardial infarction subsequently occurred, possibly linked to tachycardia induced by salbutamol therapy. We reviewed 99 articles (119 patients). Mean serum potassium was 8.8 mEq/L. In most cases, ECG showed the presence of tall T waves; loss of PMK atrial capture was documented in 5 patients. In 94 patients, flaccid paralysis was described and in 25, severe muscular weakness; in 65 patients, these findings were associated with other symptoms. Concurrent renal failure was often documented. The most frequent treatments were dialysis and infusion of insulin and glucose. Eighty-seven percent of patients had complete resolution of symptoms. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Severe hyperkalemia is always a life-threatening medical emergency, as it can precipitate fatal dysrhythmias and paralysis. SHP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurologic signs and symptoms of uncertain etiology, especially in a subject with kidney failure or who is taking medications that may worsen renal function. The presence of a PMK does not necessarily impede hyperkalemic cardiac toxicity.

Troubleshooting

Common problems with temporaring pacing include failure to pace, failure to capture, and R-on-T. Failure to pace occurs when the pacemaker is set to deliver electrical impulses but no corresponding pacing spikes are seen. There is a problem either with the pacemaker, the pacing wires, or at the lead/myocardium interface. A full check should be undertaken to evaluate whether the wires have migrated, whether the leads are properly inserted into the pacing box, and whether the pacing leads are faulty and require replacing. A pacing check should be undertaken to ensure that the pacing rate is not set below the patient’s intrinsic rate and that the device is not oversensing.

Failure to capture occurs when the pacemaker delivers electrical impulses that generate corresponding pacing spikes. However, the impulses do not reliably induce action potentials in the myocardium of the chamber being paced, which means that the patient’s heart rate remains lower than the rate set on the pacemaker. In this setting, a full check should be undertaken to eensure that there are no connection issues between the heart, pacing wires, pacing leads, and pacing box. A pacing check should be performed especially to confirm the capture threshold and appropriateness of the set capture output.

Inappropriate pacing, irregular pacing, or both, may occur in these circumstances: the set pacing rate is similar to the patient’s intrinsic rate, the capture output is set too low, or the device is oversensing or undersensing. If R-on-T occurs, the pacemaker should be switched off and senior input immediately sought. If the patient is pacing dependent, emergency help should be sought. It is important to check the sensing threshold and confirm both that the sensing threshold is not too low and that the sensitivity has been appropriately set.

HRS/APHRS/LAHRS cardiac physiologic pacing—procedure and follow-up considerations: During implantation and follow-up of patients with CPP devices, electrocardiographic demonstration of BiV (for CRT) or conduction system (for CSP) capture is essential. Shared decision-making is recommended when contemplating implantation of a CPP device and should include patient values, preferences, goals of care, prognosis, potential benefits, short- and long-term risks including device-associated infection, effects on battery longevity, future lead management issues, evidence base for different CPP types, and end-of-life considerations. Substantial right ventricular pacing of ≥20%–40% may induce cardiomyopathy in a subset of patients. Remote monitoring and in-person echocardiographic and electrocardiographic evaluations are essential during follow-up after CPP implantation to ensure appropriate capture and optimization of therapy.

Lead dysfunction—In case of lead dysfunction, there is the option of abandoning the lead or extracting it. Lead dysfunction seems the second most frequent reason for lead extraction in the ELECTRa registry. Causes include lead fracture or insulation failure resulting in issues with lead impedance, sensing or capture, and in these cases the electrical parameters may still be normal but the integrity of the lead is clearly compromised.

Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2021). High credibility.

Electrophysiological procedures—cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices and pacing are defined for data capture, including that a CRT device is a biventricular pacemaker that sends electrical signals to both ventricles and helps the heart pump more effectively; it may or may not have an atrial pacing wire, and CRT-P has the pacing function in addition to resynchronization but does not entail defibrillator function. CRT-D also incorporates the additional function of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) to quickly terminate an abnormally fast, life-threatening heart rhythm. His bundle pacing is described as a transvenous pacemaker system that can produce normal physiological ventricular activation with a lead positioned on the His bundle. Abbreviations are specified: CRT indicates cardiac resynchronization therapy; CRT-D, cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator; CRT-P, cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker; and ICD, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

### A change of pace: modifying pacemaker settings in the emergency department as emergency physicians, A case report [^9a61ea14]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pacemakers are implantable or external devices that send electrical impulses, allowing the heart to contract. Some common indications for permanent pacemaker placement include symptomatic bradycardia due to high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block, sick sinus syndrome, chronic bifascicular block, and postcardiac transplantation. Like all devices, pacemakers can malfunction or stop working entirely. We present a patient with an implantable pacemaker/cardioverter and defibrillator (ICD) displaying symptomatic failure to capture, and settings were adjusted in the emergency department (ED). Adjustment in the ED resolved the patient's symptoms and required no further interventions.

Case Report

An 82-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and a Medtronic dual chamber pacer/ICD (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) presented to the ED for complaints of weakness and lightheadedness. Emergency medical services noted intermittent bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased responsiveness. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed failure to capture. The Medtronic application was used to interrogate and reprogram the device. The settings were DDD at a rate of 60 beats/min with ventricular output of 4.5 millivolts (mV) and atrial output of 4.5 mV, which were changed to ventricular lead outputs from 4.5 mV to 8.0 mV and rate from 60 to 80 for additional cardiac output. After this adjustment, the bradycardia resolved, and ECG showed a successful AV-paced rhythm. Transcutaneous pacing was never required. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Adjustment of pacer settings in the ED to stabilize the critically ill patient is within the scope of the emergency physician. We can reduce stress to the patient and prevent hospitalizations. Pacemakers can become a tool to optimize treatment plans for an aging population in whom pacemakers are becoming more common.

### Low settings of the ventricular pacing output in patients dependent on a pacemaker: are they really safe? [^c7dc6910]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Background

It is generally acknowledged that pacemaker output must be adjusted with a 100% voltage safety margin above the pacing threshold to avoid ineffective pacing, especially in patients dependent on pacemakers.

Aims

The aim of this prospective crossover study was to assess the beat-to-beat safety of low outputs in patients who are dependent on a pacemaker between 2 follow-up examinations.

Methods

The study included 12 patients who had received a DDD pacemaker with an automatic beat-to-beat capture verification function. The ventricular output at 0.4 milliseconds pulse duration was programmed independently of the actual pacing threshold in a crossover randomization to 1.0 V, 1.5 V, and 2.5 V for 6 weeks each. At each follow-up, the diagnostic counters were interrogated and the pacing threshold at 0.4 milliseconds was determined in 0.1-V steps. The diagnostic pacemaker counters depict the frequency of back-up pulses delivered because of a loss of capture. During the randomization to 1.0-V output, we evaluated whether the adjustment of the output under consideration of the >100% voltage safety margin reduced the frequency of back-up pulses.

Results

Pacing thresholds at the randomization to 1.0-V, 1.5-V, and 2.5-V output were not significantly different, with 0.7 +/- 0.3 V at 2.5-V output, 0.6 +/- 0.2 V at 1.5-V output, and 0.6 +/- 0.2 V at 1.0-V output. The frequency of back-up pulses was similar at 2.5-V and 1.5-V output, 2.2% +/- 1.9% and 2.0% +/- 2.0%, respectively. The frequency of back-up pulses significantly increased at 1.0-V output to 5.8% +/- 6.4% (P <.05). Back-up pulses >5% of the time between the 2 follow-ups were observed in no patient at 2.5 V, in 1 patient at 1.5 V, and in 5 patients at 1.0 V. At the randomization to the 1.0-V output, 6 patients had pacing thresholds of 0.5 V or less, and 6 patients had pacing thresholds >0.5 V. The frequency of back-up pulses in the 2 groups was not significantly different, 6.4% +/- 8.6% and 5.7% +/- 2.6%.

Conclusions

The frequency of back-up pulses was significantly higher at 1.0-V output than at 1.5-V and 2.5-V output. This also applied to patients with pacing thresholds of < or =0.5 V. Fixed low outputs seem not to be absolutely safe between 2 follow-ups in patients who are dependent on a pacemaker, even when the output has a 100% voltage safety margin above the pacing threshold. When patients with pacemakers programmed to a low ventricular output have symptoms of ineffective pacing, an intermittent increase of the pacing threshold should be carefully ruled out.

### Rate-dependent pacing failure after pacemaker implantation: novel insights into the mechanism of using adenosine [^ff60f413]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2020). Medium credibility.

An 82-year-old woman received pacemaker implantation for sick sinus syndrome. Two days after the implantation, electrocardiography showed 2:1 atrial pacing failure, followed by a bradycardia-dependent increase in the atrial pacing threshold during a pacemaker examination. However, transient 1:1 atrial pacing capture recovered by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) administration, which was performed to evaluate the bradycardia-dependent pacing failure mechanism. We considered this phenomenon to be caused by Phase 4 depolarization and avoided replacing this atrial lead. Three weeks later, the atrial pacing threshold had improved. We report the potential role of Phase 4 depolarization in a bradycardia-dependent increase in pacing threshold by using ATP.

### Surgical approaches to epicardial pacemaker placement: does pocket location affect lead survival? [^12b3f910]. Pediatric Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Definitions

We defined a lead’s lifetime from the implantation date to the date of documented lead failure, removal, or latest follow-up date within the study period. If the pocket location was changed and an existing lead reused, the lead was censored at the time of pocket relocation. When an apparently normally functioning lead was removed or replaced (elective replacement), the latest follow-up date was recorded, and the lead was censored. Other outcomes recorded included patient death, heart transplantation, abandonment of pacing system, patient lost to follow-up evaluation, or completion of the study period. Failure type was noted for all failed leads whenever possible and categorized as proven lead fracture by direct inspection or radiograph, pacing problems such as failure to capture or unacceptably high capture threshold, clinically significant sensing problems, or suspected lead fracture due to lead impedance or cause otherwise not specified.

Surgical Technique

The standard techniques for creation of subrectus and subxiphoid pacemaker pockets have been reviewed elsewhere. The retrocostal approach is performed as follows. An entry into the left posterior rectus sheath is made near the lower margin of the sternotomy incision, and a pocket is developed within the rectus sheath. The upper margin of the rectus sheath is delimited by its attachment to the subcostal margin. This attachment is carefully dissected off the ribs to permit extension of the pocket cephalad, beyond and posterior to the subcostal margin. Care is taken to remain extrapleural in the cephalad extension of the pocket.

The pacemaker generator is positioned within the pocket so as to be almost entirely retrocostal. An anchoring suture secures the generator to the periosteum of the ribs to prevent it from migrating outside the protection of the overlying rib. The header of the generator, with lead attachments, is entirely posterior to the ribs, so the course of the leads never emerges from the protection of the overlying rib cage. This method is in contradistinction to the prior method of the rectus sheath pocket, in which the leads pass over the abdominal wall to course into the pericardial envelope (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 
Chest radiographs demonstrating pocket locations. The typical sites of epicardial pacemaker implantation are demonstrated from left to right: retrocostal, subxiphoid, and subrectus. Notably, the retrocostal location keeps all hardware within an intrathoracic location, whereas the subrectus and subxiphoid pacemaker pockets require that the pacemaker leads traverse the abdominal musculature

### Temporary pacing following cardiac surgery-a reference guide for surgical teams [^227818e0]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In addition to understanding temporary pacing risk factors, indications, types, and positioning at surgery, it is also important for surgeons to know how to perform a pacing check, set the pacemaker, and troubleshoot common temporary pacing problems in post cardiac surgical patients, as outlined in this paper. A low sensing threshold risks R-on-T, while a high capture threshold risks pacing wire failure, which could have catastrophic effects in pacing dependent patients. For normally functioning pacing wires, a VVI is a safe back-up pacing mode. DDD is also safe, but preferable for use in patients who need sequential pacing due to known or high risk atrioventricular block. AAI preserves the native atrioventricular conduction system and is ideal when atrial kick and pacing up is required to increase blood pressure.

Importance

Interrogations and autopsies of sudden deaths with cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) are rarely performed. Therefore, causes of sudden deaths with these devices and the incidence of device failure are unknown.

Objective

To determine causes of death in individuals with CIEDs in a prospective autopsy study of all sudden deaths over 35 months as part of the San Francisco, California, Postmortem Systematic Investigation of Sudden Cardiac Death (POST SCD) study.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Full autopsy, toxicology, histology, and device interrogation were performed on incident sudden cardiac deaths with pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). The setting was the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City and County of San Francisco. Participants included all sudden deaths captured through active surveillance of all deaths reported to the medical examiner and San Francisco residents with an ICD (January 1, 2011, to November 30, 2013).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Identification of a device concern in sudden deaths with CIEDs, including hardware failures, device algorithm issues, device programming issues, and improper device selection. For the ICD population, outcomes were the cumulative incidence of death and sudden cardiac death and the proportion of deaths with an ICD concern.

Results

Twenty-two of 517 sudden deaths (4.3%) had CIEDs, and autopsy revealed a noncardiac cause of death in 6. Six of 14 pacemaker sudden deaths and 7 of 8 ICD sudden deaths died of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Device concerns were identified in half (4 pacemakers and 7 ICDs), including 3 hardware failures contributing directly to death (1 rapid battery depletion with a sudden drop in pacing output and 2 lead fractures), 5 ICDs with ventricular fibrillation undersensing, 1 ICD with ventricular tachycardia missed due to programming, 1 improper device selection, and a pacemaker-dependent patient with pneumonia and concern about lead fracture. Of 712 San Francisco residents with an ICD during the study period, 109 died (15.3% cumulative 35-month incidence of death), and the 7 ICD concerns represent 6.4% of all ICD deaths.

Conclusions and Relevance

Systematic interrogation and autopsy of sudden deaths in one city identified concerns about CIED function that might otherwise not have been observed. Current passive surveillance efforts may underestimate device malfunction. These methods can provide unbiased data regarding causes of sudden death in individuals with CIEDs and improve surveillance for CIED problems.

### 2023 HRS / APHRS / LAHRS guideline on cardiac physiologic pacing for the avoidance and mitigation of heart failure [^d83fec77]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Pacemaker interrogation and programming approach for cardiac physiologic pacing (CPP) specifies modality-specific steps for His bundle pacing (HBP), left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP), and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). For HBP, determine His bundle capture relative to RV capture and program output to ensure His bundle capture (at least 1 V above the threshold), avoid capture assessment algorithms unless His bundle and RV capture thresholds are similar, program AV delays 30–50 ms shorter than conventional parameters, recognize that atrial oversensing can occur with proximal lead placement and may need appropriate programming to also avoid ventricular undersensing, and avoid ventricular unipolar sensing if pacing dependent. For LBBAP, determine LBB (LV septal) capture and anodal capture, capture assessment algorithms can be utilized successfully, and program AV delays 20–30 ms shorter than conventional parameters. For CRT, determine LV (CS lead)–only capture and anodal capture, capture assessment algorithms can be utilized successfully and LV-only pacing may be preferred in some cases, and program AV delays 10–20 ms shorter than conventional parameters; a footnote clarifies that a shorter AV delay than conventional is needed to take account for the time delay from pacing output to QRS onset with conduction system pacing.

Cardiac physiologic pacing (CPP)—Recommendations for substantial ventricular pacing: Class 2a (Level of Evidence B-R for CRT; B-NR for HBP and LBBAP) states that in patients with an indication for permanent pacing with an LVEF 36%–50% who are anticipated to require substantial ventricular pacing, CPP is reasonable to reduce the risk of PICM. Class 2b (Level of Evidence B-NR) states that in patients with normal LVEF who are anticipated to require substantial ventricular pacing, it may be reasonable to treat patients with CPP to reduce the risk of PICM. Class 2b (Level of Evidence C-LD) states that in patients who are ventricular pacing–dependent undergoing HBP pacemaker implantation, placement of an additional backup lead may be reasonable to mitigate the risk of high pacing capture thresholds, lead dislodgment, loss of capture, or oversensing.

A 83-year-old woman with a single-chamber pacemaker implanted 15 years earlier was brought to the ED due to symptomatic bradycardia. ECG continuous monitoring allowed the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with complete atrioventricular block in the setting of a complete failure to capture. The differing timing cycles of pacing outputs can confirm that sensing is preserved in the absence of a pacemaker programmer.

The prevention and treatment of life-threatening bradyarrhythmias have been revolutionized in the last half century by electronic pacemakers. Because this represents a palliative therapy, attempts have begun to effect a cure with the novel tools of gene and cell therapy. Over time, the strategies used have coalesced to focus on achieving a stable and autonomically responsive cardiac rhythm in a setting that ultimately would require no implanted hardware. In this report, we review the history of the disease process being treated, approaches now in progress, and the demands that must be met if biological therapies are to be successful.

Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Perioperative management of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs)—pulse generator and lead–tissue interface damage states that it is possible to cause failure or permanent damage to a CIED from electrosurgery applied in immediate close proximity or directly to the pulse generator, and that application of monopolar electrosurgery close to the pulse generator or electrodes may cause current entry with damage and should be avoided; therefore, surgeries close to the CIED should be done with bipolar rather than monopolar electrosurgery whenever that is possible, using strategic return-electrode positioning and lower power to reduce exposure, for example the return electrode should be on the ipsilateral arm for ipsilateral hand surgery. Electrosurgical collateral damage to the lead-myocardial interface is possible but generally thought to occur rarely, and has been rarely reported to result in increased pacing threshold or loss of capture or induction of arrhythmias.

Cardiac physiologic pacing (CPP) follow-up—ECG-based assessment and documentation emphasize that an ECG can be a practical means to assess if the LV lead is capturing by contributing a positive deflection in lead V1 and a negative deflection in lead I, and an ECG to confirm LV lead capture is particularly helpful if device interrogation is not feasible. Optimization of CRT pacing vectors can be facilitated by ECG QRS duration assessments during testing of LV unipolar and bipolar vectors, and a baseline ECG obtained at the time of a successful CRT or CSP implant can also be useful as a future template to determine continued successful pacing capture. In patients who have had a CSP device implanted, a 12-lead ECG, including long strips during threshold testing, can help to ensure and optimize maximal conduction system capture, and the tracing should be evaluated to determine capture thresholds, LBBB correction when pertinent, and type of capture (selective vs nonselective conduction system capture). For HBP and LBBAP, there are no data at present to support the use of echocardiography for optimization.

Pacemaker cost-effectiveness and generator longevity—dual-chamber pacemaker implantation compared with ventricular pacemaker implantation (VVI) was approximately $53,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained over 4 years of follow-up, and when extended over the expected lifetime of a typical patient, the calculated cost-effectiveness of dual-chamber pacing improved to $6,800 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. In resource use and replacement, 16% to 24% of pacemaker implantations are for replacement of generators; of those, 76% are replaced because their batteries have reached their elective replacement time. Hardware and software features that prolong useful battery longevity may improve the cost-effectiveness of pacing; expert programming can prolong longevity by an average of 4.2 years compared with nominal settings, and leads with steroid elution and/or high pacing impedance allow for less current drain. Generators that automatically determine whether a pacing impulse results in capture allow outputs closer to threshold values, although rigorous studies supporting the overall cost-effectiveness of these advanced pacing features are lacking.

### Transvenous pacemaker placement: a review for emergency clinicians [^6a6a1289]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Transvenous pacemaker placement is an integral component of therapy for severe dysrhythmias and a core skill in emergency medicine.

Objective

This narrative review provides a focused evaluation of transvenous pacemaker placement in the emergency department setting.

Discussion

Temporary cardiac pacing can be a life-saving procedure. Indications for pacemaker placement include hemodynamic instability with symptomatic bradycardia secondary to atrioventricular block and sinus node dysfunction; overdrive pacing in unstable tachydysrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes; and failure of transcutaneous pacing. Optimal placement sites include the right internal jugular vein and left subclavian vein. Insertion first includes placement of a central venous catheter. The pacing wire with balloon is then advanced until electromechanical capture is obtained with the pacer in the right ventricle. Ultrasound can be used to guide and confirm lead placement using the subxiphoid or modified subxiphoid approach. The QRS segment will demonstrate ST segment elevation once the pacing wire tip contacts the endocardial wall. If mechanical capture is not achieved with initial placement of the transvenous pacer, the clinician must consider several potential issues and use an approach to evaluating the equipment and correcting any malfunction. Although life-saving in the appropriate patient, complications may occur from central venous access, right heart catheterization, and the pacing wire.

Conclusions

An understanding of transvenous pacemaker placement is essential for emergency clinicians.

Pacemaker generator longevity and replacement—ACC/AHA/HRS Guidelines for Device-Based Therapy report that 16% to 24% of pacemaker implantations are for replacement of generators; of those, 76% are replaced because their batteries have reached their elective replacement time, and expert programming of pacemaker generators prolonged longevity by an average of 4.2 years compared with nominal settings. Optimal programming of output voltages, pulse widths, and AV delays can markedly decrease battery drain, generators that automatically determine whether a pacing impulse results in capture allow for pacing outputs closer to threshold values, and leads with steroid elution and/or high pacing impedance allow for less current drain, although rigorous studies supporting the overall cost-effectiveness of these advanced pacing features are lacking.

Cardiac physiologic pacing (CSP) recommendations—For patients undergoing CSP with His bundle pacing (HBP) or left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP), 12-lead ECG is useful during implantation to assess conduction system capture most accurately (COR 1, LOE C-EO). In these patients, accurate demonstration of conduction system capture thresholds (including BBB correction) and myocardial capture thresholds at implant is useful for appropriate programming of the device (COR 1, LOE C-EO). Assessment of His bundle/left bundle current of injury using appropriate filter settings can be beneficial in achieving acceptable capture thresholds and lead stability (COR 2a, LOE C-LD).

### Surgical approaches to epicardial pacemaker placement: does pocket location affect lead survival? [^8d443f99]. Pediatric Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Methods

Design and Subjects

We undertook a retrospective chart review of all patients with epicardial pacemaker systems implanted or followed at Rady Children’s Hospital–San Diego between January 1980 and May 2007. Institutional review board approval was obtained before data collection. Patients were identified by review of medical records and our surgical database. Transvenous pacemaker systems and leads placed prophylactically were excluded from the analysis. Patients whose devices were implanted outside our institution were included in the study when adequate follow-up evaluation, pocket location, and variables of their implanted devices were documented.

Data Collection

We reviewed all medical records in hard and soft copy for the purposes of our study. These included electronic databases, paper charts, and surgical and electrophysiological records. The demographic and clinical variables collected were date of birth, gender, height and weight at the time of the implantation and the latest follow-up evaluation, anatomic and electrophysiologic diagnosis, and number of prior operations. When patient height or weight were not available for a device implantation procedure, we used two to three points on the patient’s plotted growth curve (National Center for Health Statistics 2000, 3rd to 97th percentile charts) and extrapolated the curve to determine the patient’s approximate implant dimensions. The implantation procedure-related variables collected were pocket location (derived from the surgeon’s operative notes and confirmed using radiography and follow-up records whenever possible), the implantation date, and the implanting surgeon. The lead-specific variables collected were the make and model of the lead (and associated manufacturing details such polarity, insulation material, steroid-eluting properties), lead tip location (epicardial or transmural-endocardial), lead chamber (atria or ventricle), lead functional characteristics (implant and latest follow-up capture threshold, sensing, and impedance), lead failure (yes/no), and lead failure type described in the following discussion.

Previously untreated patients had a full or partial CRT system but were not receiving CRT because of a failed LV lead implantation or lead issues that resulted in the CS lead programmed “off” due to high threshold, noncapture, phrenic nerve pacing, or lead failure. Table 2 provides additional details on T1Cs at 6 months. There were 12 patients with study device system events, including 7 in whom the electrode was not anchored, 3 who did not achieve BIVP due to difficulties with the acoustic window, 1 transmitter revision, and 1 episode of ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion. In addition, 7 patients had cardiac perforations. Four perforations required surgical intervention and 3 were treated with pericardiocentesis. The cardiac perforations occurred early in the study and in response, refresher training on an implant simulator prior to every implant and use of real-time echocardiography were implemented. Traditional CRT implant involves placing a lead in the CS; however, 30% to 40% of patients do not respond. 1, 10-12 Furthermore, an additional 10% are unable to receive CRT due to anatomical challenges limiting access to the CS, phrenic nerve stimulation, or high-pacing thresholds.

27, 28 Previous strategies to overcome these challenges included surgically placed epicardial leads or transvenous LV endocardial leads, which are both associated with multiple complications. 29, 30. Conventional CS pacing is nonphysiological as the electrical wavefront starts in the epicardium and moves to the endocardium. Normal physiological activation of the heart is the opposite. There is increased interest in pacing the endocardium directly due to the immediate capture of the conduction system and superior hemodynamic effects. 11, 13, 29 Additional comparisons are needed. 14.

His bundle pacing (HBP) implantation and programming—During HBP lead implantation, it is suggested to achieve capture thresholds of <2.5 V at 1 ms; late rises in capture thresholds requiring lead revisions are seen in 7%–11% of patients. In 10% of patients, both His bundle and RV myocardial capture thresholds can be identical, and change in pulse width, programmed stimulation, or rapid pacing can help confirm conduction system capture. Adjusting the high-pass filter in the recording system (0.5–1 Hz from 30 Hz) can aid recording of current of injury; proximal placement can be associated with atrial oversensing and ventricular undersensing, so it is preferable to target the distal His bundle region. While programming devices with HBP, AV delay should be shortened by 40–50 ms compared to conventional parameters, and current automatic threshold assessment algorithms do not allow for accurate assessment of His bundle capture thresholds and should generally be turned off.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Acute MI–related bradycardia and conduction disturbances—supporting considerations note that “Although transient SND may occur in the context of an acute MI, nonreversible injury to the atrioventricular conduction system accounts for most pacing indications,” and “Temporary pacing does not by itself constitute an indication for permanent pacing.” Inferior wall MI–associated SND or atrioventricular block “may be attributable to a transient increase in vagal tone or decreased blood supply to the atrioventricular node or less commonly the sinus node.” Disturbances arise from “ischemia, extent and location of MI, reperfusion and autonomic effects,” and significant bradycardia can “negatively impact survival.” Because capture with transcutaneous pacing is difficult, “this method should only be used if other temporary methods are delayed or not available.” Prognosis varies by infarct location; “Anterior MI with associated atrioventricular conduction impairment generally confers a worse prognosis with a higher mortality than an inferior MI with a similar initial presentation.” Accordingly, “Indications, therefore, for PPM implantation in the setting of an acute MI are based on the clinical situation, and adequate observation to allow for recovery of atrioventricular conduction, and to avoid unnecessary pacemaker implantation,” and “Again, the clinician should carefully consider and generally avoid early permanent pacemaker implantation.”

### Flecainide causing elevated capture thresholds on pacemaker implantation [^620c5dd5]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

Flecainide is a Vaughan Williams class 1c antiarrhythmic used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. It has been described as a rare cause for increased pacemaker capture thresholds. We describe a report of a patient, in her early 80s, presenting with tachy-brady syndrome on a background of permanent atrial fibrillation. She was treated with metoprolol and flecainide by her private cardiologist. Permanent right ventricular chamber pacing was recommended for her slow heart rate. At insertion of her single chamber pacemaker, she was noted to have elevated capture thresholds despite appropriate lead positioning. A flecainide level was elevated at 1.1 µg/mL, and it was subsequently ceased. This was associated with a rapid improvement in her capture threshold. Flecainide should be considered as a cause for elevated pacing thresholds at the time of implant. Particular care should be taken for at-risk groups such as the elderly and patients with renal impairment.

Suspected lead failure—clinical presentation: The lead failure modes are pace–sense malfunction and shock component malfunction, with the former accounting for the clear majority (>90%) of diagnosed lead failures in clinical practice. In pace-sense circuits, conductor failure or insulation breach typically present as oversensing of rapid, nonphysiological signals, resulting in inappropriate shocks or pacing inhibition. In the past, the most common presentation of pace-sense lead fracture was inappropriate shocks. Health care providers who provide initial care for patients should understand the use of magnets for suspending therapy. Insulation failure with shorting of the high-voltage circuit can result in catastrophic failure of the pulse generator.

2. The physiology of CSP is dependent on whether the conduction system is captured or not. A low conduction system capture (including BBB correction) threshold is associated with long-term stability and safety of pacing. During CSP for infranodal AV block and BBB, pacing should be performed at ≥120 bpm to confirm distal conduction system capture and/or BBB correction. Accurate documentation of the His/left bundle capture threshold, BBB correction threshold, and local myocardial capture threshold in patients with nonselective CSP is useful for appropriate programming of the pacing output both at implant and during follow-up.,,,,,,,,, Several observational studies, have shown an increase in His bundle capture threshold by >1 V in up to 15%–28% of patients during intermediate-term follow-up. In ventricular pacing–dependent patients with nonselective HBP, RV septal myocardial capture can provide ventricular pacing backup in addition to His bundle capture.

3. Injury current in atrial and ventricular myocardial lead electrograms is associated with low tissue capture thresholds. Recording of His bundle injury current suggests that the lead has penetrated the insulating outer layer of the His bundle or in close proximity. In patients undergoing HBP,demonstration of His bundle current of injury at the time of implant was shown to be associated with low capture thresholds at implant and during 1-year follow-up compared to when injury current was not observed in the His bundle electrogram. In another study,demonstration of deep negative His potential and His bundle injury current was associated with low capture thresholds at implant and 1-year follow-up. In a studyof 115 patients with LBBP, 100% of patients with LBB injury current were associated with LBB capture thresholds <1.5 V at 0.5 ms compared to 76% of patients without LBB injury current. Injury current can be recorded in the pacing system analyzer or more clearly using high-resolution recording system by adjusting the high-pass filter settings.

Device or lead advisories and replacement thresholds—It is incumbent upon the follow-up physician to be aware of advisories issued in relation to potential device malfunction, and specific recommendations are to consider lead/device replacement if death is a likely result of device malfunction, the mechanism of device/lead failure is known, potentially recurrent, and possibly life-threatening, the patient is pacemaker-dependent, the risk of replacement is substantially lower than the risk of device malfunction, or the device is approaching its elective replacement indicator. Complications related to replacement of ICD generators under advisory have been well documented, including infection, the need for reoperation, and death. In general, for pacemaker-dependent patients, advisory device failure rates in excess of 0.3% warrant consideration of device replacement; in patients with ICD generators under advisory, an estimated failure rate of 3% favors replacement in the majority of cases, decreasing to 1% when procedural mortality rates are 0.1% or less and/or risk of fatal arrhythmias increases to 20% per year. During certain lead advisories, reprogramming, enabling alert features for impedance, and increasing utilization of remote monitoring may have an effect on future rates of invasive lead replacement and/or extraction.

### Safety and efficacy of leadless pacemakers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^250dfa60]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Several limitations should be considered when interpreting our results. Although our findings are promising, the data were entirely observational, and most studies had a small sample size and short follow‐up time of <1 year. Because there are essential differences in sizes, fixation and pacing mechanisms between the Nanostim and Micra devices, a meta‐analysis was performed separately for each device. However, because of the low number of studies that used the Nanostim LP, pooled estimates for this device were not drawn, and most of the pooled estimates reflect the performance of the Micra LP only. The inconsistency about which complications are reported makes estimating pooled incidences for specific complications challenging. Similarly, efficacy endpoints about pacing capture threshold were defined differently among studies, with some considering ≤2 V acceptable, whereas others used the 1.5‐V threshold. The exclusion of abstracts and conference proceedings may increase the risk of publication bias, although data using only fully published articles are considered more reliable and generally necessarily provide all required information.

Results

Condition scope

The working group defined a broad scope as it applies to heart failure. Consistent with major guidelines, patients would be diagnosed as having heart failure if they had clinically identified heart failure signs and symptoms and objective evidence of cardiac dysfunction. All patients with the diagnosis of heart failure would be included, whether presenting acutely or chronically, regardless of etiology, and across the spectrum of ejection fraction. Acute heart failure was classified as either an acute first presentation or as an acute decompensation of chronic heart failure, whether or not it resulted in a hospital admission.

Patients with a first presentation as cardiogenic shock were excluded from the scope, as there is often a distinct upstream precipitating factor, which requires urgent or emergent intervention. As such, the patient does not fit in with the typical management pattern for the general heart failure population. However, patients surviving the initial event, with or without aggressive medical or surgical intervention, and continuing to be in heart failure, would be included after stabilization. Similarly, patients with coronary or valvular disease may fit the scope if presenting with objective signs of ventricular dysfunction in the absence of immediately correctable causes such as active ischemia. Patients with heart failure who had undergone transplant or mechanical assistance were considered outside the scope. These populations present unique treatment challenges not concordant with the majority of heart failure patients. The scope did not include patients with isolated right heart failure.

Treatment variables

Treatments included for measurement and recording reflect the recommendations of major evidence-based guidelines. These therapies are known to affect mortality, hospitalization, quality of life, or a combination of these in the heart failure patient. Broadly, these can be divided into pharmacotherapy, invasive therapies, and rehabilitation. Pharmacotherapy includes all heart failure medications at baseline and any changes made to the therapeutic regime over time. Invasive therapies include devices such as pacemakers, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization therapy, as well as cardiac surgery. Cardiac rehabilitation program initiation was included to complete the treatment options available (Online Table S1). Treatment variables will be captured through the patient’s medical record. Ongoing treatment variable modifications will be overseen by the ICHOM steering committee in line with emerging evidence.

Transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) nonmagnet and magnet ECG assessment—goals are to determine whether the patient displays intrinsic rhythm or is being intermittently or continuously paced at the programmed settings, characterize the patient's underlying atrial mechanism, and, if intrinsic rhythm is displayed, determine that normal sensing is present for 1 or both chambers depending on whether it is a single- or dual-chamber pacemaker and programmed pacing mode; during magnet application, goals are to verify effective capture of the appropriate chamber(s) and verify the programmed pacing mode, assess magnet rate and compare with previous transmissions while being aware of the magnet rate that represents elective replacement indicators, assess pulse width if it is 1 of the elective replacement indicators, demonstrate and analyze Threshold Margin Test results when programmed on, and, for dual-chamber pacemakers, if magnet application results in a change in AV interval during magnet application, that change should be demonstrated and verified.

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) device programming—sensing, mode switching, and blanking period management: Frequent PVCs reported by device counters may represent ventricular oversensing or atrial under sensing with native ventricular conduction and may compromise the amount of biventricular capture. In the case of T wave oversensing decreasing ventricular sensitivity is important but may require repeat VF testing depending upon the original implant defibrillation testing programmed sensitivity. Inappropriate mode switching, usually due to ventricular far field oversensing in the atrium can also significantly reduce the responses to CRT; in this situation, the device will revert to VVI CRT pacing but can cause retrograde VA conduction with the risk of pacemaker syndrome, and it usually can be prevented by programming a post-ventricular atrial blanking period (PVAB) of at least 150 ms. Conversely, under sensing of atrial fibrillation can lead to absence of mode switching and irregular, fast tracking of atrial fibrillation; adjusting atrial sensitivity to a more sensitive value can minimize it, and the detection rate of atrial tachyarrhythmias can be reduced (e.g. to 170–180 b.p.m.) to allow atrial fibrillation detection in the presence of intermittent atrial fibrillation under sensing. Under sensing of atrial flutter in the PVAB can be avoided by device-specific algorithms, programming a shorter AV delay, and/or reducing the upper tracking limit. If sinus rhythm tracking is not occurring consistently, it may be due to under sensing during PVARP prolongation after PVC; automatic algorithms to terminate pacemaker-mediated tachycardia (PMT) may misinterpret sinus tachycardia as PMT and interrupt sinus rhythm tracking, and if interruption of CRT is observed, PVC or PMT intervention algorithms should be programmed off, or if available, utilize dedicated algorithms to regain sinus rhythm tracking.

Injury current markers during His bundle pacing (HBP) and left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) are linked to lower capture thresholds and favorable follow-up performance. Injury current in atrial and ventricular myocardial lead electrograms is associated with low tissue capture thresholds. Demonstration of His bundle current of injury at the time of implant was shown to be associated with low capture thresholds at implant and during 1-year follow-up compared to when injury current was not observed in the His bundle electrogram; similarly, deep negative His potential with His bundle injury current was associated with low capture thresholds at implant and 1-year follow-up. In a study of patients with LBBB, 100% of those with LBB injury current had LBB capture thresholds <1.5 V at 0.5 ms compared to 76% without LBB injury current among 115 patients.

### Safety and efficacy of leadless pacemakers: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^ee2d1ca5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Besides the good safety profile, the implant success and the short‐term efficacy of LPs were high. However, there was a lack of efficacy data beyond 2 years, which leaves uncertainty about the longevity of the device performance. The unexpected premature battery failure of the Nanostim LP occurred at 2.3 to 4.0 years after implantation.Although no such concern has been reported with the Micra LP, the only LP currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, whether it can match the battery life of contemporary TVPs remains uncertain. More data are also needed about the long‐term management of these devices such as pacemaker retrieval and how additional devices are implanted when LPs reach the end of battery life.

Uncertainties also exist about the clinical outcomes associated with LPs, because most studies only report acceptable pacing capture threshold as the primary efficacy end point. Although the electrical performance is easy to measure, clinical outcomes like mortality, syncope, heart failure, TV function and quality of life are equally relevant to patients and clinicians. Only a few studies have evaluated quality of life, all of which reported improved quality of life,,and 1 showed better physical activity, physical role, and mental health associated with LP compared with conventional devices.On the other hand, TV function was evaluated in 2 small studies, with 1 study suggesting worsening TV regurgitation in up to 45% of patients, which is comparable to the 38% incidence associated with TVPs (P =0.39).The other recorded only 1 out of 23 patients experiencing increased TV regurgitation,which was thought to result from pulmonary hypertension rather than pacing. Nevertheless, neither studies reported new onset of heart failure as a clinical endpoint. Theoretically, without a lead crossing the valve, TV regurgitation should occur less frequently with LPs, because studies have shown that worsening TV function associated with traditional cardiac devices are likely attributable to lead‐related damages to TV leaflets or subvalvular structures, or impairment of leaflet mobility and coaptation.Future investigations are needed to examine the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon as well as evaluate other clinical outcomes.

### Temporary pacing following cardiac surgery-a reference guide for surgical teams [^94c6ed12]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Complications

Although temporary pacing wire-use is considered safe, there is a small but appreciable risk of developing complications. Perhaps the most concerning complications are tamponade, ventricular perforation, ventricular arrhythmias, and disruption of coronary anastomoses. Pacing wires are also at risk of localised infection and myocardial damage. More common issues pertain to their function. Over time, the capture thresholds increase while the sensing thresholds decrease. Epicardial oedema, inflammation, and fibrosis at the lead-myocardium interface are implicated in these changes, which affect the atrial wires more commonly than the ventricular wires.

### 2023 HRS / APHRS / LAHRS guideline on cardiac physiologic pacing for the avoidance and mitigation of heart failure [^4513e0ba]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Conduction system pacing (CSP) procedural testing and programming guidance emphasizes rate testing and threshold documentation. During CSP for infranodal atrioventricular (AV) block and bundle branch block (BBB), pacing should be performed at ≥120 bpm to confirm distal conduction system capture and/or BBB correction. Accurate documentation of the His/left bundle capture threshold, BBB correction threshold, and local myocardial capture threshold in patients with nonselective CSP is useful for appropriate programming of the pacing output both at implant and during follow-up. Several observational studies have shown an increase in His bundle capture threshold by > 1 V in up to 15%–28% of patients during intermediate-term follow-up, and in ventricular pacing-dependent patients with nonselective His bundle pacing (HBP), right ventricular (RV) septal myocardial capture can provide ventricular pacing backup in addition to His bundle capture.

### A review and analysis of managing commonly seen implanted devices for patients undergoing radiation therapy [^5a35b269]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Description of implanted devices

A cardiac pacemaker is usually placed in the chest or abdomen to help control abnormal heart rhythms. Some new leadless pacemakers are directly implanted into the right ventricular heart muscle. The pacemaker uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a specified rate., An ICD is implantable in the subcutaneous tissues of the chest or abdomen. ICD performs cardioversion, defibrillation, and pacing of the heart, and corrects most life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias., Both pacemaker and defibrillator can be used in cardiac resynchronization therapy. A hepatic arterial infusion pump is a small, programmable device implanted in the abdominal cavity that is designed to deliver chemotherapy at a constant rate directly to the liver. This method allows for high doses of chemotherapy to be delivered to the liver with protection of the surrounding normal tissues. The pump is sensitive to heat, for example, the medication would flow faster if the surrounding temperature increases.An intrathecal pump directly delivers medications into the space between the spinal cord and the protective sheath surrounding the spinal cord. Radiation could cause alarm and failure of the pump due to electronic circuit damage or battery depletion. An implantable neurostimulation device modulates the nervous system's activity, usually through electromagnetic approaches. Similar to CIEDs, the neurostimulator also has a pulse generator component, which can be potentially damaged by radiation.A loop recorder records and remotely reports heart rhythm continuously or, on-demand, for up to 3 years. It is a small device inserted just beneath the skin of the chest to capture the electrical signals of the heart. Alike CIEDs, the loop recorder also has CMOS electronic circuitry that could have radiation-induced effects.A cerebral shunt is commonly used to treat hydrocephalus, the swelling of the brain due to excess buildup of cerebrospinal fluid. They are catheters that redirect the fluid from the ventricles typically into the heart or abdomen where it can be absorbed.A mediport is a small, implantable reservoir that allows chemotherapy medications to be delivered through the port.Both cerebral shunt and mediport do not have an electronic circuitry component in them. A tubeless insulin pump is a newer device, which is programmed to cover basic insulin needs by regularly delivering small amounts of short-acting insulin or extra amounts at mealtimes as needed. We will not discuss more on this device in this article as it is attached externally to the patient; however, it is advised that patients remove these devices for radiation therapy delivery.

### 2023 HRS / APHRS / LAHRS guideline on cardiac physiologic pacing for the avoidance and mitigation of heart failure [^62241b33]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Cardiac physiologic pacing (CPP) optimization recommendations indicate that in patients with CRT, a 12-lead ECG is useful to confirm LV lead capture and facilitate optimization of LV pacing configurations (1 C-EO). During in-office follow-up of patients with CSP, a multilead or 12-lead ECG is recommended to assess conduction system capture, including BBB correction (1 B-NR). During in-office follow-up of patients with CSP, a comprehensive assessment that includes documentation of His/left bundle capture, BBB correction, and myocardial capture thresholds can be useful (2a B-NR). In patients with HBP who have an increase in threshold of >1 V, more frequent in-office follow-up can be beneficial to determine the need for lead revision, especially in ventricular pacing–dependent patients (2a C-EO).

CRT vs RVP

Two studies, 1 with 50 patientsand the other with 149 patients,followed patients with normal LVEF and found BiV pacing was associated with preserved LVEF and avoidance of adverse remodeling during long-term follow-up when compared to RVP. The Progressive Ventricular Dysfunction Prevention in Pacemaker Patients (PREVENT-HF) trialrandomized 108 patients with anticipated ventricular pacing at least 80% to BiV pacing (n = 50) vs RV apical pacing (n = 58). Subjects had nearly normal LVEF at baseline (57.5% ± 11.8% BiV pacing and 54.9% ± 12.9% RVP). The study did not show benefit of BiV pacing over RVP but did not show harm.

3. Data regarding long-term outcomes are scarce, but most series reflect a relatively higher risk of revision in His bundle leads compared with RV leads due to suboptimal outcomes, including risk of unacceptably high His bundle lead capture threshold, dislodgment, loss of capture, and oversensing (of atrial or His potentials). Revisions are reported in the medium term in approximately 5%–7% of acutely successful implants., Thus, for HBP, after weighing the risks and benefits of additional hardware, procedural duration, programming complexity, and cost, it may be reasonable to place a “backup” ventricular lead in scenarios in which ventricular capture is critical (eg, pacemaker dependency).Short- and medium-term outcomes demonstrate LBBAP lead stability and lead revision risk to be similar to those of traditional RVP.

3.1.2. Less than substantial ventricular pacing

Recommendations for less than substantial ventricular pacing

Synopsis

Patients who require less than substantial amounts of ventricular pacing will have a smaller clinical impact of the pacing strategy selected compared to those who require substantial ventricular pacing. Therefore, RV lead placement with minimization of RVP, as well as CSP, are acceptable strategies for patients with normal or mildly depressed LVEF. CRT with BiV pacing has not been found to be of benefit in patients who are not anticipated to require substantial pacing and who have normal LVEF.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in patients with a pacemaker system designed for the magnetic resonance environment [^c4f658d5]. Heart Rhythm (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of pacemaker patients is contraindicated due to documented potential risks to the patient from hazardous interactions between the MRI and pacemaker system.

Objective

The purpose of this prospective, randomized, controlled, worldwide clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a pacemaker system designed for safe use in MRI for any bradycardia indicated patient.

Methods

Patients (n = 464) were randomized to undergo an MRI scan between 9 and 12 weeks postimplant (MRI group, n = 258) or not to undergo MRI (control group, n = 206) after successful implantation of the specially designed dual-chamber pacemaker and leads. Patients were monitored for arrhythmias, symptoms, and pacemaker system function during 14 nonclinically indicated relevant brain and lumbar MRI sequences. Sequences were performed at 1.5 T and included scans with high radiofrequency power deposition and/or high gradient dB/dt exposure. Clinical evaluation of the pacemaker system function occurred immediately before and after MRI, 1 week and 1 month post-MRI, and at corresponding times for the control group. Primary endpoints for safety analyzed the MRI procedure complication-free rate and for effectiveness compared capture and sensing performance between MRI and control groups.

Results

No MRI-related complications occurred during or after MRI, including sustained ventricular arrhythmias, pacemaker inhibition or output failures, electrical resets, or other pacemaker malfunctions. Pacing capture threshold and sensed electrogram amplitude changes were minimal and similar between study groups.

Conclusion

This trial documented the ability of this pacemaker system to be exposed in a controlled fashion to MRI in a 1.5 T scanner without adverse impact on patient outcomes or pacemaker system function.

### Pacemaker and ICD generator reliability: meta-analysis of device registries [^7731270c]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Despite there being millions of pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) generator implants worldwide, little is known about device reliability.

Objectives

To perform a meta-analysis of prospective pacemaker and ICD registries to determine annual rates of pacemaker and ICD malfunction and to identify trends in these rates.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (January 1966 to April 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (through second quarter 2005), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (through second quarter 2005), and a bibliographic review of secondary sources. Search terms included pacemaker, artificial; defibrillators, implantable; registries; performance; and malfunction.

Study Selection

Eligible registries were prospective; reported the number of patients with pacemaker, ICD, or both; and allowed determination of the annual number of device malfunctions. Of 1007 references screened, 3 registries meeting the selection criteria were identified and included 2.1 million pacemaker person-years and 14,821 ICD person-years of observation.

Data Extraction

Included the annual number of patients with pacemakers and ICDs at risk of device failure and the annual number of generator malfunctions (1983-2004 for pacemakers, 1988-2004 for ICDs). A device malfunction was defined as an integral component failure that required device explantation prior to reaching elective replacement. Failures of pacemaker and ICD electrodes were not included in the study.

Data Synthesis

There were 2981 pacemaker and 384 ICD generator malfunctions. Pacemaker reliability improved markedly during the 1980s (P for trend <.001) and the pacemaker malfunction rate remained low during the remainder of the study. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator reliability improved during the first 10 study years (P for trend <.001). From 1998-2002, however, the ICD malfunction rate increased more than 4-fold (P for trend <.001), before decreasing substantially in the latter 2 years of the study. Overall, the mean (SE) annual ICD malfunction rate was about 20-fold higher than the pacemaker malfunction rate (26.5 [3.8] vs 1.3 [0.1] malfunctions per 1000 person-years, P<.001). Battery malfunctions were the most common cause of device failure.

Conclusions

Pacemaker reliability has improved markedly. In contrast, after more than a decade of improving device reliability, the ICD malfunction rate transiently increased before experiencing substantial reductions in the latter 2 study years. Whether increasing device sophistication accounts for the observed decrease in reliability is not known. Continued monitoring of pacemaker and ICD performance is required.

### Outcomes before and after the recall of a heart failure pacemaker [^f5cdfcc1]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Timely and complete disclosure of medical device defects is necessary to manage patient care safely and effectively.

Objectives

To determine if the manufacturer's recommendations following the recall of a medical device were timely and complete, the follow-up information and data provided to patients and physicians were adequate for managing patient care, and the actions taken by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the recall were appropriate.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This single-center retrospective case series included 90 of 448 patients who were implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker at the Minneapolis Heart Institute from May 2003 through January 2011; this pacemaker was recalled in November 2015. In addition, returned product reports submitted by the manufacturer to the FDA via the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database from January 2008 through December 2018 were analyzed.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Clinical outcomes were serious adverse clinical events that occurred before and after the November 2015 recall notifying physicians and patients that the device's battery could fail unexpectedly because of high internal impedance. Technical outcomes were signs and causes of failure.

Results

Five of 90 patients observed during 2015 experienced syncope when their pacemakers stopped pacing owing to battery or wire connection defects prior to the recall. Of the 90 patients, 37 (41%) were men, and the median (interquartile range) age at implantation was 71.3 (66.1-78.2) years. Analysis of the MAUDE data revealed that battery failures prior to the recall were associated with serious adverse events that included 1 death, 1 cardiac arrest, 5 syncopal attacks, and 6 heart failure exacerbations; 3 additional prerecall syncopal events were caused by wire connection defects. The manufacturer and the FDA were aware of the battery and wire connection defects for 19 months before issuing the recall, yet the wire connection problem was not included in the advisory and physicians were not informed that interrogating the pacemaker could result in loss of pacing. The FDA classified the recall as class II rather than the more critical class I.

Conclusions and Relevance

This case series study of patients implanted with a defective pacemaker found that the pacemaker recall was delayed and that subsequent communications did not include all critical information needed for safe and effective patient care. These findings should prompt reforms in how the medical device industry and the FDA manage future medical device recalls.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Medium credibility.

Transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment—nonmagnet and magnet application—includes determining whether the patient displays intrinsic rhythm or is being intermittently or continuously paced at the programmed settings, characterizing the patient’s underlying atrial mechanism (sinus versus atrial fibrillation [AF], atrial tachycardia), confirming that normal sensing is present for 1 or both chambers depending on single- or dual-chamber configuration and programmed pacing mode; during magnet application, verify effective capture of the appropriate chamber(s) and the programmed pacing mode, assess magnet rate and compare with previous transmissions and elective replacement indicators, demonstrate and analyze Threshold Margin Test (TMT) results if programmed “on,” and, for dual-chamber pacemakers, demonstrate and verify any change in AV interval during magnet application.

### Rates of atrial fibrillation in black versus white patients with pacemakers [^1bf69ad4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Our study should be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, we lacked data on outpatient visits and thus could not ascertain diagnoses of AF made purely in the outpatient setting; however, this is unlikely to have affected our results in this population. Because pacemaker implantation is an inpatient procedure, we were likely to have thoroughly captured the population of patients who received pacemakers. After pacemaker implantation, we found similar results in sensitivity analyses that censored patients at the last documented pacemaker interrogation, thereby ensuring evaluation of heart rhythm during the entire period of analysis because pacemakers would be expected to keep in memory any AF episodes throughout this interval. This makes it unlikely that differences in inpatient versus outpatient care were responsible for our results. Second, because we included only patients with pacemakers, we cannot be certain that our results are generalizable to the overall population. In support of the generalizability of our study, we found the same relative hazard for stroke in black versus white patients (≈1.5) as was found in prior population‐based studies. 1 Third, we lacked data on antithrombotic medication use and thus cannot directly assess the degree to which the higher stroke risk in black patients is due to differences in anticoagulation use in patients with AF. Fourth, we lacked direct clinical data and relied on ICD‐9‐CM codes to identify outcomes. Distinctions between AF and atrial flutter based on claims data may not be reliable; therefore, further work will be needed to better understand racial differences in these dysrhythmias. We relied on AF diagnoses rather than direct assessment of rhythm, so we were unable to assess differences in the relative burden of AF in black and white patients. Because pacemakers in our cohort were not implanted primarily to screen for AF, some cases of brief AF captured on pacemaker interrogations may have been considered clinically insignificant and thus not documented. This is especially true given ongoing uncertainty about the pathogenic significance of brief AF episodes. 28, 29 If failure to document AF occurred with similar frequency among black and white patients, nondifferential misclassification of diagnoses would have served to introduce a conservative bias by attenuating associations between race and outcomes and thereby reducing our ability to detect differences in AF rates between white and black patients. It is possible, however, that AF diagnoses captured by pacemakers were less frequently documented in black than white patients, although this scenario is not supported by the available evidence. 11

### Bipolar mood cycles and lunar tidal cycles [^8fce52e8]. Molecular Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Antidepressant medications sometimes induce, or accelerate the frequency of, rapid mood cycling.These types of responses seem to have occurred in nine patients (Patients 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15 and 17), in as much as withdrawal of these agents was associated with slowing of cycling or onset of unremitting depression (see, for example, Supplementary Figure S7)., If the relationship of mood cycles to lunar cycles is causal, this observation raises the possibility that antidepressant medications somehow sensitized the individuals to the influence of lunar cycles. This effect might result from the demonstrated capacity of some antidepressants to slow the intrinsic rhythm of the circadian pacemaker, thereby making it susceptible to capture by the slower-than-24-h rhythm of the lunar tidal day.

If bi-weekly lunar cycles drive rapid mood cycles by entraining the circadian pacemaker to the 24.8-h lunar tidal day, how might one interfere with their influence? One approach would be to refrain from prescribing antidepressant medications while continuing maintenance treatment with lithium carbonate.Another approach would be to strengthen the pacemaker’s entrainment to the 24.0-h solar day. This could be accomplished by exposing patients to longer periods of darkness at night, which have been shown to increase the amplitude of the pacemaker’s phase-responses to light and strengthen its coupling to the light–dark cycle.Consistent with this prediction, Patient 9 achieved a complete remission when he stayed in total darkness from 1800 hours to 0800 hours every night.Recently reported modifications of this procedure might make it more practical and convenient.

### A novel mechanism of failure to detect atrial arrhythmias by pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators [^b0265257]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2010). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old man with complete heart block, status post-Medtronic dual chamber pacemaker insertion, failed ablation for atrial tachycardia at an outside institution. Despite persistent palpitations and known unsuccessful ablation, pacemaker interrogation revealed no evidence of atrial arrhythmias. At electrophysiology study, burst pacing from the high right atrium and distal coronary sinus at 370 ms revealed bidirectional 2:1 interatrial conduction block. Left atrial burst pacing at 260 ms induced an atrial tachycardia (cycle length 340 ms) with 2:1 left to right atrial block and right atrial activation at 680 ms. The tachycardia was localized to the lateral left atrial roof. A series of ablation lesions from left to right superior pulmonary vein terminated the tachycardia. Left to right interatrial conduction block is a mechanism for underdetection of atrial arrhythmias with implantable devices not previously described. As the extent of atrial ablation increases, the incidence of this mechanism of underdetection may increase. Though devices are often considered ideal for atrial arrhythmia detection and are used in multiple trials, detection failures can occur despite appropriate device function. This case underscores the need for electrocardiographic monitoring in addition to device-based electrogram monitoring.

Alcohol septal ablation is a novel catheter-based technique for the treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Complete heart block complicates the procedure in 7%-30% of cases and necessitates the prophylactic insertion of a temporary pacing wire in all patients who do not have a permanent pacemaker.

### Assessing the risks associated with MRI in patients with a pacemaker or defibrillator [^631403fa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

The presence of a cardiovascular implantable electronic device has long been a contraindication for the performance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We established a prospective registry to determine the risks associated with MRI at a magnetic field strength of 1.5 tesla for patients who had a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) that was "non-MRI-conditional" (i.e., not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for MRI scanning).

Methods

Patients in the registry were referred for clinically indicated nonthoracic MRI at a field strength of 1.5 tesla. Devices were interrogated before and after MRI with the use of a standardized protocol and were appropriately reprogrammed before the scanning. The primary end points were death, generator or lead failure, induced arrhythmia, loss of capture, or electrical reset during the scanning. The secondary end points were changes in device settings.

Results

MRI was performed in 1000 cases in which patients had a pacemaker and in 500 cases in which patients had an ICD. No deaths, lead failures, losses of capture, or ventricular arrhythmias occurred during MRI. One ICD generator could not be interrogated after MRI and required immediate replacement; the device had not been appropriately programmed per protocol before the MRI. We observed six cases of self-terminating atrial fibrillation or flutter and six cases of partial electrical reset. Changes in lead impedance, pacing threshold, battery voltage, and P-wave and R-wave amplitude exceeded prespecified thresholds in a small number of cases. Repeat MRI was not associated with an increase in adverse events.

Conclusions

In this study, device or lead failure did not occur in any patient with a non-MRI-conditional pacemaker or ICD who underwent clinically indicated nonthoracic MRI at 1.5 tesla, was appropriately screened, and had the device reprogrammed in accordance with the prespecified protocol.

Pace-sense failure diagnostics—counts of extremely short R-R intervals: The Medtronic Sensing Integrity Count stores the count of R-R intervals shorter than 130 ms, and a rapidly increasing sensing integrity count is a sensitive indicator of conductor fracture, which in isolation has low specificity; elevated counts are more common with intact integrated bipolar leads than with intact dedicated bipolar leads, and increasing episodes of nonsustained VT, particularly if characterized by rapid rates, should arouse suspicion for possible lead failure.

### 2023 HRS / APHRS / LAHRS guideline on cardiac physiologic pacing for the avoidance and mitigation of heart failure [^c73fe23d]. Heart Rhythm (2023). Medium credibility.

HBP can result in selective capture of the His bundle alone or capture of surrounding RV myocardium in addition to the His bundle, resulting in nonselective capture (Figure 7). Nonselective HBP can be difficult to differentiate from RV myocardial–only capture. A 12-lead ECG can help differentiate nonselective HBP from RV septal–only pacing. In addition, BBB correction (Figure 8) can be more readily recognized with 12-lead ECG.During threshold testing, output (voltage)–dependent changes in ECG morphology are helpful in identifying and accurately documenting His bundle capture and BBB correction thresholds. In up to 10% of patients, both His bundle and RV myocardial capture thresholds can be identical. In such patients, change in pulse width, programmed stimulation, or rapid pacing can help confirm conduction system capture. Various criteria to define His bundle capture in patients with normal and diseased His-Purkinje conduction are provided in Table 6.

HBP can be associated with higher capture thresholds compared to RVP. Additionally, during longer-term follow-up, late rise in capture thresholds requiring lead revisions are seen in 7%–11% of patients. During HBP lead implantation, it is suggested to achieve capture thresholds of <2.5 V at 1 ms. Injury current recorded in the HBP and LBBP lead electrogram during lead implantation has been shown to be associated with excellent acute and long-term thresholds. – Adjusting the high-pass filter in the high-resolution recording system (0.5–1 Hz from 30 Hz) can be helpful in recording the HB current of injury.HBP lead placement in the proximal His bundle region can be associated with atrial oversensing and ventricular undersensing. It is preferable to target the distal His bundle region during implantation to avoid sensing issues and threshold increases after AV node ablation. While programming devices with HBP, AV delay should be shortened by 40–50 ms compared to conventional parameters to allow for His-ventricular conduction times. Current automatic threshold assessment algorithms do not allow for accurate assessment of His bundle capture thresholds and should generally be turned off.

### Surgical approaches to epicardial pacemaker placement: does pocket location affect lead survival? [^4efe1451]. Pediatric Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Lead Failure

Overall, 43% (95/219) of the patients experienced one or more lead failures during a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, and 28% (173/620) of the leads failed during a mean follow-up period of 3.1 years. The estimated lead survival was 93% at 2 years and 83% at 5 years. The majority of the leads failed due to pacing problems (54%, 93/173) (e.g. high pacing thresholds), followed by lead fracture (31%, 53/173) and sensing problems (14%, 24/173). When divided into groups by pocket location, the majority of lead failures were seen in the subrectus group (116/173). Overall, 40% of the leads using this pocket location failed compared with 16% and 17% of the leads placed in subxiphoid and retrocostal locations, respectively (p = 0.001). However, when adjustment was made for length of follow-up evaluation, the rates of failure by implant location did not differ significantly (Fig. 2, Table 3). In general, chi-square analysis showed no significant differences of lead failure cause by implant site (Fig. 3). There were no statistical differences between lead failure rates and the implanting surgeon.

### 2017 HRS expert consensus statement on cardiovascular implantable electronic device lead management and extraction [^5dbf729c]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Device electrograms in pace–sense failures: Device electrogram (EGM) analysis is important in the diagnostic approach to suspected lead failure, and oversensing (noise) is the most common observation in this failure mode. In conductor fractures, typical EGM characteristics are signals that are intermittent with a high dominant frequency, highly variable, and not recorded on the high-voltage or shock channel; EGMs are typically noncyclical and exhibit extremely short nonphysiological R-R intervals (<160 ms), may saturate the sensing amplifier, and produce truncated near-field signals. Lead connection problems can present with similar EGM patterns but are most often temporally associated with an invasive CIED procedure such as implantation or generator replacement. In contrast, insulation failures do not themselves typically generate abnormal signals but instead lead to sensing of physiological or nonphysiological signals from surrounding structures or conductor interaction, so EGM patterns in insulation breaches vary, reflecting the signal source.

### HRS expert consensus statement on remote interrogation and monitoring for cardiovascular implantable electronic devices [^e728c865]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Remote monitoring technology—Transtelephonic monitoring (TTM) of pacemakers, which was first introduced in 1971, delivers limited data on pacemaker function via analog transmission over a telephone landline, including sensing, capture, battery longevity, and a real-time electrocardiogram; it requires coordination with clinical staff and verbal communication, and is not capable of retrieving diagnostic data from the device’s memory. RI and RM technologies are recommended over TTM because of the additional diagnostic data they provide. Inductive systems use a wand-based radiofrequency platform; once the wand is placed over the device, programmed, stored, and measured data are sent via real-time radiofrequency transmissions to a home transceiver, and the patient receives feedback regarding the success or failure of the transmission.

### 2023 HRS / APHRS / LAHRS guideline on cardiac physiologic pacing for the avoidance and mitigation of heart failure [^504e3460]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Left bundle branch capture criteria during left bundle branch pacing (LBBP) are described using surface electrocardiogram (ECG) timing measures and morphology. Abrupt shortening of stimulus to V6 R-wave peak time (RWPT) ≥ 10 ms during deep-septal LBBP lead implantation with subsequent short and constant V6 RWPT during high- and low-output pacing was associated with high specificity for LBB capture. V6 RWPT ≤ 35 ms in non–left bundle branch block (LBBB) and <80 ms in LBBB was associated with 100% specificity for LBB capture but with lower sensitivity. Change in V6 RWPT ≥ 8 ms (RWPT during corrective His bundle pacing [HBP] − LBB area pacing [LBBAP]) was associated with 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity to confirm LBB capture in a small LBBB series meeting Strauss criteria, and a V6–V1 interpeak interval of ≥44 ms during LBBP had 100% specificity for LBB capture. The majority of these criteria are based on transitions in ECG morphology; an exception supported by invasive assessment is the abrupt decrease in stimulus to V6 RWPT of ≥10 ms during lead delivery.

### Leadless pacemakers: where are we? [^ee13d399]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pacemakers have been the cornerstone of brady-arrhythmia management since the mid-20th century. Despite the widespread use and success of traditional transvenous pacemakers, they are associated with an estimated 15 % complication rate at three years. Driven by the advantages over traditional transvenous pacemakers including a lack of transvenous leads, resistance to infection, and ease of implantation, the number of leadless pacemakers placed annually in the United States has dramatically increased since their initial approval. While current iterations of leadless pacemakers lack the versatility offered by transvenous devices, recent advances in leadless pacing offer an increasingly diverse range of therapeutic options. This review will discuss the past, present, and future emerging technologies, and strategies in leadless pacing.

Left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) capture confirmation—During LBBAP, 12-lead ECG characteristics help confirm placement of the lead in the LV septal subendocardial region and assess capture of the left conduction system. Transition from nonselective to selective LBB or LV septal capture is highly specific for LBB capture, while recording LBB potentials (LB-V intervals of 15–35 ms) is highly sensitive. A 2-lead technique with a lead in the HB location and LBB area can be helpful for confirming LBB capture, and physiology-based criteria using native V6 R-wave peak time (RWPT) as well as a stepwise algorithm have been proposed to assess LBB capture.

### Medical device surveillance with electronic health records [^7c6a9724]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For individuals implanted with the most widely used medical devices today, including pacemakers, joint replacements, breast implants, and more modern devices, such as insulin pumps and spinal cord stimulators, effective pre-market assessment and post-market surveillance are neccessaryto assess their implants’ safety and efficacy. Device surveillance in the United States relies primarily on spontaneous reporting systems as a means to document adverse events reported by patients and providers, as well as mandatory reporting from manufacturers and physicians to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As a result, device-related adverse events are significantly underreported—by some estimates as little as 0.5% of adverse event reports received by the FDA concern medical devices.Recent adoption of universal device identifiers, will make it easier to capture device details, and to report events using these identifiers, but linking devices to patient outcomes remains a challenge. Unique device identifiers have not been used historically (longitudinal data are essential to monitor device safety over time) and many relevant patient outcomes are simply not recorded in a structured form amenable for analysis. The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists recently analyzed practices of medical device regulation around the world and dissemination of device recalls to the public, sharing their findings in a report dubbed the ‘Implant Files’.One issue highlighted in their report is the significant challenge of tracking device performance and reports of adverse events.

Phrenic nerve stimulation (PNS) assessment during LV lead placement—It is optimal that PNS be absent when pacing through the LV lead at maximal voltage (10 V and 0.5 ms pulse width), and a safety margin of two times between the LV capture threshold and the PNS capture threshold may be acceptable when the LV lead must remain where PNS cannot be completely avoided; where possible, PNS should be assessed in all relevant LV pacing configurations for that lead, and in this situation, a representative subset of configurations should be tested.

Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Perioperative management of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs)—pacing safety margins and magnet/autocapture management are specified as follows: The usual recommendation is that the stimulus output be 2 to 3 times pacing threshold or at least 3 times the threshold pulse width, although with LV pacing less than a two fold amplitude or pulse width safety margin is often programmed, and many current CIEDs perform automatic threshold testing and adjust the stimulus output at a safety margin which could be less than the 2-fold the threshold; therefore, consideration may be given to temporarily increasing the stimulation outputs during the operative period. Placing a magnet or reprogramming a pacemaker to asynchronous suspends the autocapture feature, and after magnet removal most manufacturers’ current devices (BIOTRONIK, Boston Scientific, ELA/Sorin, St. Jude Medical) will immediately perform an autothreshold test and/or beat-to-beat surveillance for loss of capture, whereas Medtronic pacemakers will perform autothreshold checks only at the scheduled intervals with nominal safety margins always set two times the autothreshold. If there is an advisory on the lead or pulse generator, this should be relayed to the operative team if it has any impact on the risks of the perioperative management.

### Flecainide (flecainide acetate) [^358ee1d0]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Effects on Pacemaker Thresholds

Flecainide is known to increase endocardial pacing thresholds and may suppress ventricular escape rhythms. These effects are reversible if flecainide is discontinued. It should be used with caution in patients with permanent pacemakers or temporary pacing electrodes and should not be administered to patients with existing poor thresholds or nonprogrammable pacemakers unless suitable pacing rescue is available.

The pacing threshold in patients with pacemakers should be determined prior to instituting therapy with flecainide, again after one week of administration and at regular intervals thereafter. Generally threshold changes are within the range of multiprogrammable pacemakers and, when these occur, a doubling of either voltage or pulse width is usually sufficient to regain capture.

Electrolyte Disturbances

Hypokalemia or hyperkalemia may alter the effects of Class I antiarrhythmic drugs. Preexisting hypokalemia or hyperkalemia should be corrected before administration of flecainide.

Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of flecainide in the fetus, infant, or child have not been established in double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. The proarrhythmic effects of flecainide, as described previously, apply also to children. In pediatric patients with structural heart disease, flecainide has been associated with cardiac arrest and sudden death. Flecainide should be started in the hospital with rhythm monitoring. Any use of flecainide in children should be directly supervised by a cardiologist skilled in the treatment of arrhythmias in children.

### Runaway pacemaker [^8825a1a1]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Pacemaker-induced ventricular tachycardia has been described in literature. The earliest report was published in 1965 in a patient who had a fixed rate pacemaker inserted. The most probable reason described was electronic failure.Examination by the manufacturer of the unit used in this case revealed the failure of a transistor in the timing circuit. There was also a 6.4 V direct current leak caused by component failure of the pacemaker output capacitor. This current has been shown to cause polarisation and increased resistance at the positive pole of myocardium.

The fusion of two separate impulses, one arising from pacemaker, the other from ventricular ectopic, is another possible reason described in literature. Ventricular extra systoles occurred at a variable coupling interval of 640–720 ms, and that they were all of similar configuration. Those extra systoles with a short coupling interval (653 (41) ms) inhibited the output of the pacemaker and did not cause ventricular tachycardia. The ventricular extra systoles with a long coupling interval that was close to the programmed cycle length of the pacemaker (710 (14) vs 732 ms) failed to inhibit the pacemaker output, presumably because depolarisation from the extra systole had not spread to the pacemaker electrode site in time to inhibit the pacemaker. The resulting fusion beat usually triggered ventricular tachycardia.

Other possible cause mentioned in the literature is atrial sensing during postventricular refractory period eliciting ineffective atrial stimulation. The following native ventricular beat cannot be identified by the device because it occurred during cross-chamber blanking period. As a result, after atrioventricular delay, ventricular pacing artefact is delivered inducing fatal ventricular tachycardia.

Learning points

Pacemaker-induced ventricular tachycardia is an emergency which needs to be addressed urgently.
Patients with this particular type of ventricular tachycardia would not respond to any medical treatment or cardioversion as fault lies in pacemaker.
These patients need to disable the device via magnet and urgent change of pulse generator.
Recognition of this phenomenon is vital as mostly patients present in emergency room with symptoms or collapse.

### His bundle pacing, learning curve, procedure characteristics, safety, and feasibility: insights from a large international observational study [^308fc1b7]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

3.2.2 Last available follow‐up thresholds and programmed stimulation outputs

The mean threshold of His bundle capture (whether selective or nonselective) at the last available follow‐up was 1.3 ± 1.2 V at 0.9 ± 0.2 ms (n = 366). Mean programmed His lead pacing output at follow‐up was 3.0 ± 1.1 V at 0.8 ± 0.3 ms with a safety margin of 1.7 ± 1.0 V above the threshold of His bundle capture. The details of all thresholds for the various types of His bundle pacing are recorded in Table 3.

Table 3 
His pacing thresholds

Of the 366 patients with follow up threshold data available, 31 (8.5%) had a rise in threshold to 3 V or more. Of these patients, the mean threshold at implant was 2.01 V ± 1.1 with a rise to 4.3 V ± 1.5 during follow‐up. Not all of these changes required reintervention, for example in three patients (with small rises <0.5 V) the patients had previously undergone failed LV lead implantation and the (“bail‐out”) His pacing system was delivering satisfactory ventricular resynchronization.

HBP threshold data were not available for all patients at follow‐up (100 patients). The reasons for this include: initial implant within 6 weeks and first follow‐up not occurred (n = 58), data not reported (although no mention of lead‐related issues included in supplied data set) (n = 17), patient death (n = 5 [3 progressive heart failure, 2 unknown]), patient followed up at different hospital (n = 1), pacemaker explanted due to infection (n = 1) or explanted due to venous thrombosis (n = 1).

In 17 patients, no follow up capture threshold data was reported because they were not receiving His pacing. In three patients, this was because there was only myocardial capture present (n = 3) (mean threshold 0.5 V at 1ms). In 14 patients, His lead had been deactivated. Reasons for deactivation were a rise in threshold (n = 6) and displacement and loss of capture (n = 7). One patient experienced exercise‐induced symptoms and 2:1 infra‐Hisian block was observed during an exercise test. Therefore, His lead was deactivated and RV only pacing was performed.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Shared decision-making principles for bradycardia pacing—definition and risk–benefit context: “A commonly accepted definition of shared decision-making includes 4 components: 1) at least 2 participants, the clinician and patient; 2) both participants share information with each other; 3) both parties build a consensus about the preferred treatment; and 4) an agreement is reached on the treatment to implement.” “Notably, a recommendation based on evidence or guidelines alone is not shared decision-making.” While “pacemaker implantation or revision are commonly performed heart procedures and are not typically associated with high procedural risk in most patients,” adverse events “such as pneumothorax and cardiac tamponade can complicate the procedure.” Moreover, “patients with significant comorbid conditions may not derive the intended benefit of pacing support or an improved QOL,” and “the benefit-risk ratio is not favorable if the probable benefit is also quite low,” particularly in terminal progressive illness where “the benefits of pacing support may not be realized and are unlikely to positively impact the overall outcome.”

### Echocardiographic screening for heart failure and optimization of the care pathway for individuals with pacemakers: a randomized controlled trial [^75de1115]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Consistent with our data, previous studies have shown that people with pacemakers implanted for bradycardia have a risk of impaired LV function (LVEF < 50%) or overt HF far higher than the general population. Those with impaired LV function have a lower quality of life, higher hospitalization rate and poorer prognosis than those with a pacemaker and normal LV function. Observational studies in people with pacemakers have consistently shown that the degree of LV dysfunction is related to the RV pacing burden, with a linear relationship to risk of HF events and cardiovascular deathand that LV impairment is more frequent in patients with pacemakers who also have underlying IHD or myocardial fibrosis,.

Although the adverse effects of RV pacing on LV function, and the fact that many people with standard pacemakers have LV dysfunction, have been appreciated for many years,, the medical management of pacemaker-associated HF is under-investigated. Optimal care in patients with impaired LV function includes renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitorsand β-adrenoceptor antagonists,, with proven favorable effects on LV remodelingand patient-oriented long-term outcomes. Moreover, a program with a protocol of initiation and titration of medical therapy for people with HFrEF provided in a specialized setting is associated with better outcomes. Most of the phase III trials of medical therapy for HFrEF did not actively exclude people with standard pacemakers, but, although around 9% of people with HFrEF have a standard pacemaker,, none of the trials reported analyses for outcomes in this subgroup. Hence, as a result of a lack of data, guidelines make no particular mention of the investigation and management of people with pacemakers at risk of, or with proven, HFrEF except to comment on the use of algorithms to limit RV pacing, and the potential benefits of upgrading standard pacemakers to CRT in the presence of symptoms, LV dysfunction and a high requirement for ventricular pacing,.

### To replace or not to replace: a systematic approach to respond to device advisories [^6a396437]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

The decision of whether and when to replace a device in response to an "advisory" letter requires careful consideration, because device replacement carries related risks and is influenced by the clinical characteristics of the patient.

Methods and Results

The risk/benefit of device replacement depends on four parameters: expected annual sudden cardiac death rate; residual device life; difference in failure rate between the device listed on the advisory letter and the replacement device; and the replacement procedure mortality risk. Using these four factors, we have developed an equation that provides the "number needed to replace" (NNR) to save one life. Per our model, patients implanted with a device with a failure rate approaching 1% and a probability of requiring device intervention >or=25% per year-in particular, pacemaker-dependent patients-have an NNR <250. Pacemaker-dependent patients, with devices having three or more years longevity, but with device failure rates >or=0.5%, have an NNR <100. Patients with arrhythmic risk <or=2.5% per year and those with devices having failure rates <0.1% have a high NNR and stand more risk to be harmed than benefited from device replacement.

Conclusions

Pacemaker-dependent patients and those with high arrhythmic risk (>or=25% annually) when having "advisory" devices with high failure rate (>or=1%) have an NNR <250 and, hence, could be considered for device replacement. Conversely, patients with arrhythmic risk <or=2.5% per year and those with devices having failure rates <or=0.1% have a high NNR or even risk of "harm" from device replacement. In all the intermediate cases, the NNR will quantify the benefit/risk ratio of replacement, thus helping physicians and patients decide on the preferred approach. The NNR methodology proposed here is also applicable to advisory notices issued to leads, but the high morbidity associated with lead replacement will generally rule out interventions to replace leads.

### Taser-induced rapid ventricular myocardial capture demonstrated by pacemaker intracardiac electrograms [^a0e2e292]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

A Taser weapon is designed to incapacitate violent individuals by causing temporary neuromuscular paralysis due to current application. We report the first case of a Taser application in a person with a dual-chamber pacemaker demonstrating evidence of Taser-induced myocardial capture.

Methods and Results

Device interrogation was performed in a 53-year-old man with a dual-chamber pacemaker who had received a Taser shot consisting of two barbs delivered simultaneously. Assessment of pacemaker function after Taser application demonstrated normal sensing, pacing thresholds, and lead impedances. Stored event data revealed two high ventricular rate episodes corresponding to the exact time of the Taser application.

Conclusions

This report describes the first human case of ventricular myocardial capture at a rapid rate resulting from a Taser application. This raises the issue as to whether conducted energy devices can cause primary myocardial capture or capture only in association with cardiac devices providing a preferential pathway of conduction to the myocardium.

### The past, present, and future of pacemaker therapies [^01abd540]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Since its introduction into clinical practice, electronic pacing has saved many lives. Despite continuous improvements, electronic pacemakers have important shortcomings, which stimulated the development of biological alternatives. Biological pacemakers generate the cardiac impulse using genes or cells to treat bradycardias. Over the past decade, significant improvements have been made in biological pacemakers, but issues remain in relation to long-term outcomes and safety. Concurrently, efforts to improve electronic pacemakers have also intensified. Whether new generations of electronic pacemakers will erase lingering concerns with regard to electronic pacing or whether biologicals will ultimately supplement or supplant electronics remains to be seen.

### Temporary pacing following cardiac surgery-a reference guide for surgical teams [^8b4c869d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The second concept required to be understood for setting the pacemaker is of the output, which is the current delivered by the pacemaker in milliamps. A low output means that the pacemaker is delivering a low current, while a high output means that the pacemaker is delivering a high current. The minimum current required to induce an actional potential in the myocardium is termed the capture threshold and can be observed practically as the minimum current required to produce regular pacing spikes with appropriate morphological rhythm changes. The output is often set to a value double that of the capture threshold. Thus, for a ventricular capture threshold of 2.5 mA, the ventricular output should be set to 5 mA. An inappropriately low output risks pacing signals having no, or indeed variable, effects on cardiac conduction. Whereas, an inappropriately high output risks extracardiac pacing such as of the phrenic nerves and acceleration of fibrosis at the lead/myocardium interface.

To check the ventricular sensing threshold, the atrial output should be switched off or the atrial pacing wire simply disconnected. The ventricular output should be set to the lowest possible value. The pacing rate should then be reduced to 20 bpm below the underlying heart rhythm. The ventricular sensitivity value should then be gradually increased from the minimum setting until the pacing device light-emitting diode (LED) illuminates regularly. The ventricular sensitivity value should then be gradually reduced until the sensing LED starts regularly illuminating. The sensitivity value at this point is the sensing threshold. The atrial sensitivity should then be assessed in a similar fashion. If a pacing wire sensitivity is too low, pacing modes dependent on that pacing wire should not be used. If neither of the pacing wires have adequate sensing, the pacemaker should be switched off.

To check the ventricular capture threshold, the ventricular sensing threshold must first be assessed as satisfactory. The pacing rate should be increased to 10 bpm above the underlying heart rhythm, with care taken in tachycardic patients. The ventricular output should then be gradually increased until regular pacing spikes are seen on the rhythm strip along with morphological changes. This value is the capture threshold, and the ventricular output should be set to a value double that of the capture threshold. In patients whose capture threshold approximates the maximal output setting, an early referral to electrophysiology should be considered, especially for patients who are pacing dependent, as an alternative pacing system may be required. The atrial capture threshold should be assessed in a similar fashion.

### Kinetics of atrial repolarization alternans in a free-behaving ovine model [^dc8bd9fd]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Kinetics of Atrial Repolarization Alternans.

Introduction

Repolarization alternans (Re-ALT), a beat-to-beat alternation in action potential repolarization, promotes dispersion of repolarization, wavebreaks, and reentry. Recently, Re-ALT has been shown to play an important role in the transition from rapid pacing to atrial fibrillation (AF) in humans. The detailed kinetics of atrial Re-ALT, however, has not been reported so far. We developed a chronic free-behaving ovine pacing model to study the kinetics of atrial Re-ALT as a function of pacing rate.

Methods

Thirteen sheep were chronically implanted with 2 pacemakers for the recording of broadband right atrial unipolar electrograms and delivery of rapid pacing protocols. Beat-to-beat differences in the atrial T-wave apex amplitude as a measure of Re-ALT and activation time were analyzed at incremental pacing rates until the effective refractory period (ERP) defined as stable 2:1 capture.

Results

Atrial Re-ALT appeared intermittently but without periodicity, and increased in amplitude as a function of pacing rate until ERP. Intermittent 2:1 atrial capture was observed at pacing cycle lengths 40 ms above ERP, and increased in duration as a function of pacing rate. Episodes of rapid pacing-induced AF were rare, and were preceded by Re-ALT or complex oscillations of atrial repolarization, but without intermittent capture.

Conclusion

We show in vivo that atrial Re-ALT developed and increased in magnitude with rate until stable 2:1 capture. In rare instances where capture failure did not occur, Re-ALT and complex oscillations of repolarization surged and preceded AF initiation.

### Comparing complication rates between abbott tendril 2088 and competitive manufacturer leads: novel real-world data approach [^e472eb97]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are multiple factors which may contribute to the differences in our findings compared to the Khatiwala et al.paper. There was significant variability in outcome reporting across the referenced studies in the meta‐analysis. For example, in the El‐Chami et al.paper, “cases of lead malfunction were screened using the following search terms: noise, lead fracture, lead malfunction, insulation abnormality, insulation breach, and abrasion.” In the Zhu et al.study, “device clinic follow‐up records were screened for evidence of noise oversensing with atrial mode switch or noise reversion, abnormal impedance, failure to capture, and failure to sense.” In the Lovibond et al.analysis, lead complications were identified via an external remote monitoring service. The inconsistency in the methods used to screen for and then identify lead malfunction is problematic and makes pooling of these studies and interpretation of these data challenging. This contrasts with the consistent and validated method used to identify complications in our study, which required both a diagnosis code indicating a mechanical lead complication as well as a procedure code indicating lead‐related surgery.

Most of the retrospective cohort studies referenced in the meta‐analysis in question had relatively small sample sizes with wide confidence intervals when assessing the risk ratio for lead abnormalities. The exception to this is a study conducted by El‐Chami et al.which assessed over 8000 patients with over 500 events in patients with Abbott leads. Notable differences were seen in the baseline characteristics between patients receiving Abbott leads compared to those with leads from other manufacturers. These differences included a lower percentage of atrial leads and a higher percentage of pacing systems (as opposed to defibrillating systems) in the Tendril 2088 group. Patients with Tendril 2088 leads were also significantly older compared to patients receiving CM leads. In addition, this paper is based on a single center, whereas our nationwide study comparatively provides a more comprehensive analysis.

CIED follow-up—components of a complete evaluation and factors that determine visit type and frequency are delineated. Complete CIED evaluation includes interrogation of the device, review of device data and device programming parameters and temporary reprogramming for assessment of system function such as capture thresholds and sensing thresholds, and permanent programming changes may or may not be made on completion of the follow-up visit; this evaluation may be performed by a physician or by the CEAP trained in CIED follow-up under CIED or HF physician supervision. Determinants of follow-up include patient related items such as Stability of rhythm and cardiovascular symptoms, Change in anti-arrhythmic or heart failure therapy, High or unstable pacing thresholds, Frequency of ICD therapies, Patient's inability to accurately report symptoms, Planned surgeries/medical interventions, Patient distance from follow-up clinic, and Other medical/social factors; CIED related items including Historical reliability of the CIED system, Age of CIED, Programmed parameters that influence battery chemistry and thresholds, pacing frequency, frequency of patient contact, Arrhythmia/heart failure diagnostics, and Medications that may influence pacing or defibrillation threshold; and disease related items Frequency and severity of symptoms and Changes in cardiovascular therapy.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the Evaluation and management of Patients with bradycardia and cardiac Conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^75e55c1e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Bradycardia—synopsis and supportive guidance for pacemaker decisions emphasizes that “the decision to implant a pacemaker should be shared between the patient and clinicians” using shared decision-making and based on clinical indications, individualized risks and benefits, overall prognosis, and “the patient’s preferences and goals of care,” and that “potential future lead management issues (if applicable) should be discussed … along with potential considerations at end of life”; the text underscores that “consideration of patient preferences is essential,” that patients with significant comorbid conditions “may not derive the intended benefit of pacing support,” that in terminal progressive illness the benefits “may not be realized and are unlikely to positively impact the overall outcome,” and that when probable benefit is low “the benefit-risk ratio is not favorable,” with these pros and cons discussed with the patient and family.

### Equivalent performance of epicardial versus endocardial permanent pacing in children: a single institution and manufacturer experience [^2949a3c6]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Children requiring permanent pacing have a lifelong need for follow-up. Epicardial leads have traditionally fared worse than endocardial counterparts. We tested the hypothesis that steroid-eluting epicardial and endocardial leads had equivalent outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed medical records of 148 children, mean age 8.2 +/- 4.8 years, in whom a dual-chamber pacemaker system with steroid-eluting leads from a single manufacturer was implanted. Primary outcome was mortality. Secondary outcomes included freedom from lead failure and pacemaker system reintervention. Loss of capture-sensing, lead displacement-fracture, exit block, and high thresholds constituted lead failure. Reintervention included need for lead revision or generator change.

Results

There was no early mortality. Late mortality occurred once (0.5 +/- 0.5 deaths/1,000 patient-months) and eight times (3.4 +/- 1.2 deaths/1,000 patient-months) in the endocardial and epicardial groups, respectively. The relative hazard of endocardial versus epicardial site for lead failure was 0.408 (p = 0.038) and for reintervention was 0.629 (p = 0.002). Endocardial and epicardial groups differed in important ways: concomitant cardiac surgery 5% (3 of 61) versus 27% (27 of 99); congenital heart disease 33% (20 of 61) versus 90% (89 of 99); single ventricle physiology 13% (8 of 61) versus 52% (51/99); and age (10.5 +/- 4.5 years vs 5.5 +/- 5.2 years). Adjusting for these covariants, the relative hazard for freedom from lead failure for endocardial versus epicardial leads was 0.546 (p = 0.360). The adjusted relative hazard for freedom from reintervention was 0.157 (p = 0.045).

Conclusions

Technologic advances attenuate important differences in lead failure rates between endocardial and epicardial steroid-eluting pacing leads and thus bridge the performance gap between these fixation modes.

### One-year safety and performance of a dual-chamber leadless pacemaker [^1f7a2b82]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A dual-chamber leadless pacemaker can provide bradycardia therapy to most patients with pacemaker indications without the complications associated with a lead or pulse generator. We sought to confirm whether previously reported 3-month safety and performance outcomes were sustained through 12 months by determining whether 12-month complication-free and performance success rates exceeded their prespecified performance goals.

Methods

Patients were enrolled in the prospective, single-group Aveir DR i2i Study if they had a standard indication for dual-chamber pacing. Enrolled patients were implanted with an Aveir DR dual-chamber leadless pacemaker system, which comprised 2 communicating leadless pacemakers (1 in the right atrium and 1 in the right ventricle). The primary safety outcome evaluated whether freedom from serious device- or procedure-related events through 365 days exceeded the predetermined performance goal of 76.5%. The primary performance outcome determined whether the composite of atrial capture threshold (≤3.0 V at 0.4 ms) and sensing amplitude (P-wave ≥1.0 mV) at the 12-month visit exceeded the predetermined performance goal of 80.0%.

Results

Sites attempted implantation in 300 subjects, where 63.3% had sinus-node dysfunction and 33.3% had atrioventricular block as their primary pacing indication. The primary safety end point was achieved, with a Kaplan-Meier 12-month complication-free rate of 88.6% (95% CI, 84.5-91.8; P <0.001). The primary performance end point was achieved in 92.8% of patients (95% CI, 89.7-95.8; P <0.001).

Conclusions

Both primary safety and performance end points were met after 1 year, demonstrating consistency with previously reported 3-month outcomes of a dual-chamber leadless pacemaker.

### Echocardiographic screening for heart failure and optimization of the care pathway for individuals with pacemakers: a randomized controlled trial [^f93ebc1e]. Nature Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Pacemaker implantation for bradycardia improves quality of life and survival,. Over a million devices are implanted globally each year –. Long-term right ventricular (RV) pacing is associated with an adverse effect on left ventricular (LV) function and the development of HF, especially in the presence of other cardiovascular morbidities,, which augurs a worse prognosis –. Routine pacemaker follow-up offers the opportunity to screen for pacemaker-associated HF. However, people with pacemakers were either actively excluded from randomized controlled trials assessing medical therapies for HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) or subgroup analyses of those with pacemakers were not undertaken. Therefore, as a result of the lack of evidence, no medical treatment strategy has been recommended for this group in current HF or pacing guidelines, such that the effects of a pathway, which includes screening followed by patient-centered education and optimized medical management for people found to have impaired LV function, are unknown.

OPT-PACE (OPTimizing PACEmaker therapy) was designed to determine the effect on clinical outcomes of screening for impaired LV function in people with pacemakers implanted for bradycardia.
