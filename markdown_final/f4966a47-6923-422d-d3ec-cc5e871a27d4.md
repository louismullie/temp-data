## Question

Patient with history of breast CA is here due to swollen optic nerves. Her MRI is negative. Differential and next steps?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and next steps for a patient with a history of breast cancer who presents with swollen optic nerves and a negative brain MRI. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the optic nerve swelling is unilateral or bilateral and whether visual function is affected. Then, I should verify the key MRI sequences and whether they adequately covered the orbits, chiasm, and venous sinuses. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential that accounts for cancer-specific etiologies and non-cancer causes. After that, I need to outline immediate next steps, including ophthalmic imaging and when to pursue lumbar puncture. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like leptomeningeal disease, paraneoplastic optic neuropathy, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and close with a concise decision algorithm and safety-net plan.

> Let me first confirm the clinical framing, because the approach hinges on it. Swollen optic nerves can reflect papilledema from raised intracranial pressure, optic disc edema from optic neuropathies, or pseudopapilledema such as optic disc drusen; in a patient with breast cancer, I must also keep cancer-specific causes in mind, including leptomeningeal metastasis, compressive lesions, and paraneoplastic processes, even when a standard brain MRI is reportedly negative [^112xaNFv] [^116XLqcA].

> Wait, let me verify the MRI protocol before drawing conclusions. A "negative MRI" may be misleading if the orbits were not imaged with fat-suppressed T1 post-contrast sequences, if the optic nerves and chiasm were not scrutinized, or if venography was not performed to assess for venous sinus thrombosis; I should confirm whether the study included dedicated orbital MRI with and without contrast, thin sections through the chiasm, and MR venography, because missing these can obscure optic nerve sheath enhancement, leptomeningeal disease, or venous outflow obstruction that would explain papilledema [^114K5oU9] [^115dfrpQ] [^116bLcwy].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis, starting with cancer-specific considerations. Leptomeningeal metastasis from breast cancer can present with papilledema and cranial neuropathies, and MRI can be falsely negative early or if the sequences are suboptimal; CSF cytology may be required and sometimes needs repetition to detect malignant cells, so I should not anchor on a single negative MRI in this context [^116XLqcA] [^116rKmvh]. Pituitary or parasellar metastasis can compress the chiasm and cause optic neuropathy or papilledema; breast cancer is a common source, and subtle sellar changes may be missed without targeted pituitary imaging, so I should double-check the sellar cuts and consider endocrine testing if indicated [^1125JXy4] [^111d9DVA]. Paraneoplastic optic neuropathy is rare but reported; serologic testing may be considered when other etiologies are excluded, though imaging is often unrevealing early on [^notfound]. Direct optic nerve or sheath infiltration or perineuritis can occur with systemic cancer and may require dedicated orbital imaging to detect enhancement or sheath widening [^114K5oU9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about non-cancer causes. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is common in women of childbearing age and can present with papilledema and a normal brain MRI; specific MRI signs such as posterior globe flattening, optic disc protrusion, and transverse sinus stenosis increase diagnostic confidence, and lumbar puncture with opening pressure is confirmatory when the diagnosis remains uncertain [^116bLcwy] [^114RW81U]. Optic disc drusen can mimic papilledema but is distinguished by fundus autofluorescence and enhanced-depth imaging OCT; importantly, drusen can coexist with true papilledema, so I need to check for both if visual function is threatened [^114K5oU9] [^113ZQyKj]. Optic neuritis, ischemic optic neuropathy, and compressive lesions like optic nerve sheath meningioma remain on the list, but in a patient with cancer, I should prioritize cancer-related etiologies while keeping these in reserve [^112xaNFv].

> Next, I should review immediate next steps. Let me first confirm a comprehensive neuro-ophthalmic examination, including visual acuity, color vision, pupils, fields, and dilated fundus exam, because this will separate papilledema from pseudopapilledema and guide urgency [^112xaNFv]. I need to obtain dedicated orbital MRI with fat-suppressed T1 pre- and post-contrast, thin sections through the optic nerves and chiasm, and MR venography if papilledema is suspected, to evaluate for sheath enhancement, leptomeningeal disease, venous sinus thrombosis, or compressive lesions; if MRI is contraindicated, CT venography is an alternative for venous assessment [^114K5oU9] [^115dfrpQ]. Orbital ultrasound can help distinguish papilledema from drusen if the diagnosis remains uncertain after clinical examination, with reasonable sensitivity and specificity in experienced hands [^113TmCe4]. If papilledema is confirmed or strongly suspected, I should proceed to lumbar puncture with opening pressure and CSF analysis, including cytology, because this can reveal idiopathic intracranial hypertension or leptomeningeal disease when MRI is non-diagnostic [^114RW81U] [^116rKmvh].

> But wait, what if the MRI truly shows no abnormality and the fundus reveals drusen without true edema? In that scenario, I should avoid unnecessary LP and instead monitor with serial ophthalmic imaging and fields, while remaining vigilant for evolution of true papilledema or optic neuropathy over time [^114K5oU9] [^113ZQyKj]. Conversely, if papilledema is present and MRI is negative, I should not delay LP, because missing idiopathic intracranial hypertension or early leptomeningeal disease can risk vision loss or delay oncologic therapy [^114RW81U] [^116XLqcA].

> I should double-check for red flags that mandate expedited workup. Rapidly progressive visual loss, new cranial neuropathies, or systemic signs of cancer recurrence should lower my threshold for repeat MRI with optimized sequences, CSF cytology, and consideration of whole-neuraxis imaging to evaluate for leptomeningeal spread or skull base disease, given the high stakes of delayed diagnosis in this population [^116XLqcA] [^116rKmvh]. If leptomeningeal disease is confirmed, management shifts to oncologic therapy and CNS-directed treatment, with multidisciplinary coordination and consideration of intrathecal strategies in appropriate subtypes, acknowledging the guarded prognosis and the need for early intervention [^116XLqcA] [^113hQDgx].

> Let me reconsider the role of paraneoplastic testing. While not first-line, if the clinical picture is atypical for demyelination, compressive, or vascular etiologies and the patient has a history of breast cancer, targeted paraneoplastic antibody testing may be reasonable after excluding more common causes, recognizing that false positives and negatives occur and results must be interpreted in clinical context [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to ensure the MRI was adequate, distinguish papilledema from pseudopapilledema, and proceed to LP when papilledema is present or when cancer-specific etiologies remain suspected despite a negative MRI. A negative brain MRI does not exclude leptomeningeal disease, venous sinus thrombosis, pituitary or skull base metastasis, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, so I should tailor the next steps to the clinical phenotype while maintaining a low threshold to repeat imaging and obtain CSF when indicated [^114K5oU9] [^114RW81U] [^116XLqcA].

In a breast cancer patient with swollen optic nerves and a negative MRI, the most likely causes are **idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)** [^114RW81U] or **optic nerve head drusen (ONHD)** [^114K5oU9], with leptomeningeal metastasis [^116XLqcA] or paraneoplastic optic neuropathy still possible despite a negative MRI [^notfound]. Next steps include a **comprehensive neuro-ophthalmic exam** (visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, pupils, funduscopy) [^112xaNFv], **multimodal ophthalmic imaging** (OCT, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography) [^113ZQyKj] to distinguish true edema from pseudopapilledema, and **lumbar puncture with opening pressure** [^114RW81U] to assess for IIH or leptomeningeal disease [^116rKmvh]. If imaging is inadequate, repeat **MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast and venography** [^114K5oU9] is indicated. Management is guided by the definitive diagnosis, with urgent treatment if vision is threatened [^111NtYTQ].

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for swollen optic nerves in a breast cancer patient with a negative MRI includes:

| **Category** | **Condition** | **Key features** |
|-|-|-|
| Pseudopapilledema | Optic nerve head drusen (ONHD) | - Asymptomatic or mild visual field defects <br/> - Normal visual acuity <br/> - Autofluorescence on fundus imaging <br/> - Elevated optic discs with blurred margins [^114K5oU9] [^113ZQyKj] |
| Raised intracranial pressure | Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) | - Headache <br/> - Transient visual obscurations <br/> - Papilledema <br/> - Normal MRI <br/> - Elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture [^114RW81U] [^116bLcwy] |
| Metastatic disease | Leptomeningeal metastasis | - Multifocal neurologic deficits <br/> - Cranial neuropathies <br/> - Headache <br/> - MRI may be normal early or with subtle meningeal enhancement [^116XLqcA] [^116rKmvh] |
| Paraneoplastic syndrome | Paraneoplastic optic neuropathy | - Progressive vision loss <br/> - Color vision deficits <br/> - Normal MRI <br/> - Positive antiretinal antibodies [^111MmTUk] |
| Inflammatory | Optic perineuritis | - Pain with eye movements <br/> - Visual field defects <br/> - Optic nerve sheath enhancement on MRI [^114K5oU9] [^116WjWy6] |

## Recommended next steps

Given the negative MRI, the following steps are recommended:

---

### Clinical evaluation

Perform a **comprehensive neuro-ophthalmic examination**, including visual acuity, color vision, visual fields, pupillary responses, and funduscopy [^112xaNFv]. Also assess for **systemic symptoms** — headache, nausea, vomiting, cranial nerve palsies, or other neurologic deficits — suggestive of raised intracranial pressure or metastatic disease [^116XLqcA].

---

### Ophthalmic imaging

- **Optical coherence tomography (OCT)**: To differentiate true optic disc edema from pseudopapilledema (e.g. optic disc drusen) [^113ZQyKj].

- **Fundus autofluorescence**: To identify optic disc drusen [^114K5oU9].

- **Fluorescein angiography**: To assess for optic disc leakage characteristic of true edema [^notfound].

---

### Lumbar puncture

Perform a **lumbar puncture with opening pressure** [^114RW81U] to assess for idiopathic intracranial hypertension or leptomeningeal metastasis [^116rKmvh]. Analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for cytology, protein, glucose, and cell count [^116rKmvh].

---

### Repeat imaging

If the initial MRI is inadequate or suspicion remains high, repeat **MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast**, including MR venography to assess for venous sinus thrombosis or subtle leptomeningeal enhancement [^114K5oU9] [^115dfrpQ].

---

### Laboratory evaluation

Consider **paraneoplastic antibody testing** (e.g. anti-CV2/CRMP5, anti-recoverin) if paraneoplastic optic neuropathy is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management considerations

Management depends on the **definitive diagnosis**:

- **Idiopathic intracranial hypertension**: Weight loss, acetazolamide, and close ophthalmologic monitoring [^111NtYTQ].

- **Optic nerve head drusen**: Observation and reassurance [^notfound].

- **Leptomeningeal metastasis**: Systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal therapy, and cranial irradiation [^116SSTh9].

- **Paraneoplastic optic neuropathy**: Immunotherapy and treatment of the underlying malignancy [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

In a breast cancer patient with swollen optic nerves and a negative MRI, prioritize **pseudopapilledema (ONHD), IIH, leptomeningeal metastasis, and paraneoplastic optic neuropathy**. A structured approach with neuro-ophthalmic examination, multimodal imaging, lumbar puncture, and selective repeat MRI is essential to identify the cause and guide management.

### The swollen optic nerve: an approach to diagnosis and management [^112xaNFv]. Practical Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of swollen optic nerves differs according to whether the swelling is unilateral or bilateral, or whether visual function is normal or affected. Patients with a unilaterally swollen optic nerve and normal visual function most likely have optic nerve head drusen. Patients with abnormal visual function most likely have demyelinating optic neuritis or non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy. Patients with bilaterally swollen optic nerve heads and normal visual function most likely have papilloedema, and require neuroimaging followed by lumbar puncture. However, if their visual function is affected, the most likely causes are bilateral demyelinating optic neuritis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder and anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein optic neuritis: these patients require investigating with contrast-enhanced MRI of the orbits.

### Clinical reasoning: a 27-year-old man with progressive bilateral vision loss resistant to steroid therapy [^113AnZ4Q]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

This case involves a 27-year-old man who presented with progressive bilateral visual impairment that initially improved with steroid therapy but subsequently worsened. The clinical problem centers on diagnosing optic nerve damage with meningeal involvement unresponsive to standard interventions. The patient's vision loss began insidiously in the right eye and later affected the left, with fundoscopy showing bilateral optic nerve atrophy. Although steroids provided temporary relief, the condition deteriorated, necessitating further investigation. MRI revealed dural thickening and enhancement near the optic canals, suggesting an infiltrative or compressive process. The diagnostic approach required considering inflammatory, compressive, and infiltrative etiologies, with a biopsy ultimately proving critical when initial treatments failed. This case underscores the importance of a stepwise diagnostic strategy and highlights the need to consider rare conditions in atypical presentations, guiding readers through the differential diagnosis.

### A case of paraneoplastic myelopathy associated with the neuromyelitis optica antibody [^115SY2wr]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Background

A 63-year-old woman with a history of metastatic breast cancer presented to the emergency department with chest pain in a band-like distribution. Within 1 day of presentation the patient developed bilateral lower-extremity weakness and urinary retention. The emergence of these symptoms coincided with the recurrence of her metastatic breast cancer. Fifteen months before presentation the patient had experienced a similar episode of myelopathy in the setting of recurrence of her breast cancer, from which she recovered completely following treatment with steroids.

Investigations

General and neurological examination, routine laboratory testing, MRI of the brain and spine, tests for serum autoimmune antibodies, infectious serology testing, lumbar puncture, paraneoplastic panel, neuromyelitis optica antibody testing, evaluation for celiac disease, CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, whole-body [(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET scan, lymph node biopsy, electroencephalography observing visual and brainstem auditory evoked potentials, and neuro-ophthalmological examination.

Diagnosis

Myelopathy, possibly paraneoplastic, associated with the neuromyelitis optica antibody in the setting of metastatic breast cancer.

Management

Corticosteroids to treat the myelopathy and chemotherapy for the breast cancer.

### Approach to patient with unilateral optic disc edema and normal visual function [^114K5oU9]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Medium credibility.

In patients with swollen optic nerve head and normal visual function, optic disc drusen (ODD) is the most common diagnosis. The best tests for detecting ODD are funds autofluorescence and enhanced-depth imaging ocular coherence tomography (EDIOCT). After ODD has been ruled out, asymmetric papilledema should be assumed to be the cause and MRI of the brain and orbits with contrast and venography should be performed in all patients. It allows one to look for indirect signs of increased inctracranial pressure (ICP), optic perineuritis, and other inflammatory or compressive processes affecting optic nerve or its sheath such as optic nerve sheath meningioma. If imaging signs of raised ICP are present, lumbar puncture should be performed with measurement of opening pressure and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contents in all patients with fever, meningismus or neurologic deficits as well as patients who are not in the typical demographic group for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Optic nerve sheath enhancement on MRI should prompt work-up for causes of optic perineuritis. When the appropriate neuroimaging is normal, the differential diagnosis is limited and ophthalmological consultation is necessary to determine whether other subtle ocular abnormalities are present on biomicroscopic and dilated fundus examination.

### A young woman with blurred vision and distal paresthesias [^117H5feZ]. JAMA Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

A 29-year-old woman presented with blurred vision and distal paresthesias. Her initial evaluation revealed severe bilateral optic disc edema with distal lower-extremity sensory and motor deficits and electrodiagnostic evidence of a length-dependent mixed demyelinating and axonal polyneuropathy. The results of routine diagnostic testing, including laboratory tests, magnetic resonance imaging, and lumbar puncture, were nondiagnostic. A targeted biopsy was ultimately required for diagnosis. In this article, we discuss the differential diagnosis and outline the clinical evaluation indicated for a patient presenting with demyelinating polyneuropathy and concurrent papilledema.

### Skull base metastasis of breast cancer with oculomotor and trochlear nerve palsy [^117XHwxM]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Skull base metastatic tumors are rare. Breast cancer in particular can cause bone metastases after a long period of time. A 70-year-old woman presented with multiple cranial nerve palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion that extended from the orbit to the base of the skull, and the patient was referred to our department. Ophthalmological evaluation showed left visual acuity impairment, left oculomotor nerve palsy, and left trochlear nerve palsy. Endoscopic biopsy performed 5 years after the completion of breast cancer treatment revealed skull base metastases. In unilateral multiple cranial nerve palsy, the possibility of skull base metastases should be considered.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^112DuNbo]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

MRI in differential diagnosis (including atypical demyelination and NMO)

The exclusion of alternative diagnoses that can mimic MS is imperative in applying the 2010 McDonald criteria. From an imaging perspective, many inherited and acquired disorders may manifest with evidence of DIT, DIS, or both, and these should be included in the differential diagnosis of MS-like lesions. A timely recognition of imaging "red flags" in the work-up of patients suspected of having MS should alert clinicians to reconsider the differential diagnosis more extensively and perform some additional analyses. Several reviews have been published on imaging features of the main acquired and inherited conditions that can enter the differential diagnosis of MS. –

In the 2010 McDonald criteria, a specific focus was the differential diagnosis between MS and NMO and NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD). Up to 70% of NMOSD patients at onset have brain MRI lesions. The brain, optic nerve and spinal cord MRI findings of NMOSD patients have been recently reviewed, and revised diagnostic criteria for NMOSD have been proposed. The International Panel for NMO diagnosis proposed the use of the unifying term NMOSD, which was stratified further by aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G antibody (AQP4-IgG) testing. According to this revision, for patients with a positive AQP4-IgG test, at least one core clinical characteristic is required for NMOSD diagnosis; these include clinical syndromes or MRI findings related to optic nerve, spinal cord, area postrema, other brainstem, diencephalic, or cerebral presentations. For AQP4-IgG negative patients or patients with unknown AQP4-IgG status, more stringent clinical criteria, with additional neuroimaging findings, are required. In particular, acute optic neuritis requires brain MRI showing (1) normal findings or only nonspecific WM lesions, or (2) optic nerve MRI with a T2-hyperintense or T1-weighted gadolinium-enhancing lesion extending over half the optic nerve length or involving the optic chiasm. Acute myelitis requires an associated intramedullary MRI lesion extending over 3 contiguous segments (longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis, or LETM) or 3 contiguous segments of focal spinal cord atrophy in patients with a history compatible with acute myelitis. The area postrema syndrome requires associated dorsal medulla/area postrema lesions. Finally, an acute brainstem syndrome requires associated peri-ependymal brainstem lesions.

In summary, when atypical imaging presentation occurs other acquired and inherited WM conditions should be considered.

ASCO HER2-positive advanced breast cancer with brain metastases — brain MRI use states that if a patient does not have a known history or symptoms of brain metastases, there are insufficient data to recommend for or against performing routine surveillance with brain magnetic resonance imaging, and clinicians should have a low threshold for performing diagnostic brain magnetic resonance imaging testing in the setting of any neurologic symptoms suggestive of brain involvement.

### Metastatic breast carcinoma presenting as unilateral pulsatile tinnitus: a case report [^116HJzrF]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Pulsatile tinnitus is a rare symptom, yet it may herald life-threatening pathology in the absence of other symptoms or signs. Pulsatile tinnitus tends to imply a vascular cause, but metastatic disease also can present in this way. Clinicians should therefore adopt a specific diagnostic algorithm for pulsatile tinnitus and always consider the possibility of metastatic disease. A history of malignant disease and new cranial nerve palsies should raise clinical suspicion for skull base metastases. We describe the case of a 63-year-old woman presenting with unilateral subjective pulsatile tinnitus and a middle ear mass visible on otoscopy. Her background included the diagnosis of idiopathic unilateral vagal and hypoglossal nerve palsies 4 years previously, with normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Repeat MRI and computed tomography imaging were consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma. This case raises important questions about imaging protocols and the role of serial scanning in patients at high risk of metastatic disease.

We report on the case of a patient with breast cancer with diffuse cranial nerve and cauda equina lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging of the patient's brain and spinal cord showed diffuse abnormal enhancement and slight enlargement of the cranial nerves and cauda equina. Although the results of subsequent testing for two antineural antibodies were negative, paraneoplastic sensorimotor neuropathy associated with breast cancer was considered to be the most likely clinical diagnosis.

A 63-year-old man, with a history of melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness, vertical diplopia, and headache. Brain MRI revealed leptomeningeal enhancement of multiple cranial nerves and an enhancing mass-like lesion along the anterolateral surface of the pons and midbrain. Subsequent brain biopsy demonstrated the final diagnosis. This case highlights the broad differential diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease, emphasizing the role of specific clinical, laboratory, and imaging cues in guiding clinical reasoning.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114NREmm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Pituitary incidentaloma — initial evaluation: We recommend that patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma undergo a complete history and physical examination, laboratory evaluations screening for hormone hypersecretion and for hypopituitarism. Patients with evidence of either of these conditions should undergo an appropriately directed biochemical evaluation. We recommend that all patients with a pituitary incidentaloma, including those without symptoms, undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hormone hypersecretion. We recommend that patients with a pituitary incidentaloma with or without symptoms also undergo clinical and laboratory evaluations for hypopituitarism. We recommend that all patients presenting with a pituitary incidentaloma abutting the optic nerves or chiasm on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) undergo a formal visual field (VF) examination.

### Clinical spectrum and diagnostic pitfalls of neurologic syndromes with Ri antibodies [^112FJFNA]. Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The original descriptions of Ri-PNS defined OMS as the stereotyped manifestation of this disease. However, we demonstrate herein that the clinical phenotype is more heterogeneous and usually involves multiple neurologic systems, the core manifestation being a cerebellar syndrome. It is of note that OMS was present in only a quarter of the French cohort cases, and none of them presented with OMS as an isolated manifestation; the absence of OMS should therefore not exclude the diagnosis of a Ri-PNS.

According to the data presented herein, Ri-PNS is a rare disease, but we suspect that it is largely underdiagnosed. The stepwise course of the syndrome, usually subacute but chronic/progressive in almost 30% of patients, can lead to diagnostic delays or to misdiagnose the disorder as a primarily neurodegenerative disease or as a nonparaneoplastic inflammatory brain disease, thus preventing the early discovery of cancer. This is further supported by the frequency of misdiagnosis that was high in the French cohort. By reviewing critically all available cases, we were able to define a list of differential diagnoses in which Ri-PNS should be considered. The latter are characterized by a subacute/progressive ataxia-plus syndrome that develops in patients without structural or vascular brain abnormalities (table 2). In particular, in cases in which ophthalmoplegia associates with ataxia and abnormal reflexes on examination (11% of patients in the French Cohort), the presentation is strongly suggestive of Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis (BBE), a postinfectious inflammatory brain disease. Both brain MRI and CSF tests are not able to distinguish between the 2 conditions; only a positive test for serum anti-GQ1b antibody, positive in 66% of patients with BBE, would allow a correct diagnosis. For example, it has been reported that a patient who presented initially with ophthalmoparesis, tetraparesis, and areflexia following a Campylobacter jejuni –related gastroenteritis, received an initial diagnosis of BBE-Guillain-Barré overlap syndrome, later proven to be an Ri-PNS associated with breast cancer. Aside from BBE, another relevant differential diagnosis for the Ri-PNS is represented by the group of atypical parkinsonisms, particularly progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Both PSP and Ri-PNS can present with supranuclear gaze palsy or ophthalmoplegia and repeated unprovoked falls, in the context of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (14% of the cases in the French cohort). This presentation would likely lead to a diagnosis of probable PSP, although a sudden onset or stepwise or rapid progression should alert the clinician to look for other diagnoses, including autoimmune conditions. We believe that patients with Ri-PNS and chronic/progressive course could be missed if this set of criteria is applied strictly.

### Diagnosis and management of central nervous system metastases from breast cancer [^116SSTh9]. The Oncologist (2003). Low credibility.

The brain, cranial nerves, leptomeninges, spinal cord, and eye compose the central nervous system (CNS) and are at risk for the development of metastases from breast cancer. Such metastases are diagnosed on the basis of clinical suspicion and substantiated by neuroimaging, resection when indicated, and sampling of cerebrospinal fluid when leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) is suspected. Treatment is aimed at palliation of symptoms and preservation of neurologic function. Historically, conventional radiation therapy has been the mainstay of palliative treatment for brain, cranial nerve, spinal cord, and ocular metastases. However, additional treatment options for brain metastases have been brought about by technological advances in surgery to resect brain metastases, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to focally irradiate metastases, both of which have been substantiated by data from randomized trials. Ongoing research is aimed at refining criteria to select which patients with brain metastases should undergo surgery and SRS and how these focal therapies should be optimally integrated with whole-brain radiotherapy. Therapy for LM must carefully balance the potential risks and perceived benefits associated with CNS-directed therapies. Despite advances in neuroimaging, surgery, and radiation therapy, novel treatments are needed to improve the effectiveness of treatments for CNS metastases, especially LM, while reducing attendant neurotoxicity.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and study of autoimmune retinopathy from the American Academy of Ophthalmology's task force [^115ywf3r]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2025). High credibility.

Autoimmune retinopathy (AIR) — cancer surveillance and repeat testing guidance: Cancer detection can occur years after AIR diagnosis, and clinicians should remain mindful of the possibility of undetected malignancies despite initial systemic evaluations. Repeat exhaustive evaluations have been recommended in other paraneoplastic syndromes; however, AIR is well known to occur even in the absence of cancer in the form of npAIR and is not an exclusively paraneoplastic phenomenon. Therefore, repeat extensive testing such as total body imaging is of unclear and possibly limited value. Nonetheless, clinicians should ensure that patients remain up to date on regular age-appropriate cancer screenings (e.g., mammography, colonoscopy) even if their initial evaluation was unrevealing.

### Acute annular outer retinopathy preceded by invasive ductal breast carcinoma: a case report [^114Un47w]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Laboratory analyses including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, complete blood count with differential, antinuclear antibody, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor and angiotensin-converting enzyme revealed normal findings. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), and Bartonella (Cat Scratch Disease) serologies were negative. Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) was positive. Toxoplasmosis immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) were nonreactive. An MRI with contrast of the orbits showed no optic nerve pathology.

The patient was started on 1 g IV methylprednisolone for three days followed by oral prednisone 100 mg daily. Two days after presentation, visual acuity was CF at 1 foot in both the right and left eye. There were no changes to the white annular band. Two weeks after presentation, visual acuity declined to HM in the right eye and CF at 1 foot in the left eye. Retinal pigment epithelial atrophy persisted in both eyes and there was no detectable progression of the annular band in both eyes. Three months after presentation, the best-corrected visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and CF at 1 foot in the left eye. The annular band remained unchanged in both eyes.

An extensive workup was performed to assess for an occult neoplasm, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of the brain, pelvis, spine and breast, and Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, pelvis and head. The investigations detected an invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast that was subsequently confirmed to be of Histological Grade/Nottingham Score of 2/3 following an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy of the breast.

Clinical considerations — initial evaluation for a woman who presents with breast-related symptoms states that the initial evaluation of a woman with breast-related symptoms should include review of her history to characterize her symptoms and to identify risk factors for breast cancer, and it also should involve performance of a clinical breast examination.

### Pituitary metastasis: is there still a place for neurosurgical treatment? [^111d9DVA]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Pituitary metastases are uncommon, ranging from 1 to 5% of all metastases. Between 10 and 30% of pituitary lesions are symptomatic responsible for diabetes insipidus, visual field defect or cranial nerve palsy. Primary sites are lung or breast in two-thirds of cases. There is no current reference concerning treatment of such lesions. Overall survival is poor and depends on primary site. Although the role of surgery is currently limited, discussion is warranted in several indications for diagnostic or symptomatic purposes. We report two cases of symptomatic pituitary metastases in a context of breast cancer and review the litterature concerning the role of surgery and other treatment modalities.

### Headache in a young woman: leptomeningeal metastasis as the first presentation of underlying breast malignancy [^11469Wpf]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A 37-year-old woman presented with a 2-week history of persistent headache in an occipitotemporal distribution. The patient had experienced prior headaches and migraines, but this presentation was characterised by its intensity and duration. There was associated dizziness and blurring of vision in episodes occurring up to 4–5 times per day. Whole body cross-sectional CT imaging and MRI of neuronal axes were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid cytology demonstrated large abnormal pleomorphic cells expressing the tumour marker CA125. Positron emission tomography-fluorodeoxyglucose revealed bilateral axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy as well as increased uptake in the lateral regions of both breasts. These results correlated with MRI breast and mammography findings. Axillary lymph node biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma making the diagnosis of breast malignancy, the most likely primary site of metastatic leptomeningeal disease. In the 6-week interval between initial presentation and diagnosis, the patient deteriorated significantly with the new onset of facial nerve palsy and partial seizures. The treatment intent was palliative, focusing on symptom control with systemic chemotherapy and whole brain radiotherapy.

### How far should I manage acute optic neuritis as an ophthalmologist? A United Kingdom perspective [^111v2FAM]. Eye (2024). Medium credibility.

Similarly, painless optic nerve pathologies without disc swelling may be mistaken for acute ON. The clinical history will identify patients at risk of a traumatic or drug-induced or metabolic syndrome optic neuropathy, or post-surgical posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (PION). This is seen rarely in patients following protracted surgery, most commonly associated with coronary artery bypass grafting and back or spinal surgery. The presumed cause is ischaemic hypoperfusion, and a number of risk factors have been reported in the literature including anaemia, intraoperative blood loss, operative duration, and low blood pressure. Symptoms are typically reported within 1–2 days of surgery and frequently upon awakening, although this may be delayed in those sedated after surgery. Presentation is usually with painless central or peripheral vision loss or both, decreased or absent colour vision which is bilateral in over 60% of cases. Rarely, PION presents in patients with occult giant cell arteritis (GCA), malignant hypertension, or other vasculitides. In GCA, PION occurs in less than 3–6% of cases and presents as sequential vision loss. The optic disc examination is normal in the acute setting, with the development of optic atrophy approximately 6 weeks after the event. Functional enquiry may reveal other symptoms suggestive of vasculitis, and inflammatory markers and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antigen (ANCA) may be abnormal. Patients sometimes suddenly notice the monocular vision impairment associated with a compressive optic nerve lesion such as a mucocele, or optic nerve sheath meningioma, which may be mistaken for ON prior to neuroimaging. Scleritis, myositis and orbital inflammation may result in pain on eye movement which could mimic ON without optic disc swelling, but in these conditions, there are usually other clinical signs, and no colour desaturation or RAPD (unless there is compression or concurrent ON).

Cone dysfunction will also impair colour perception and other subtle retinal pathologies may impair visual acuity (e.g. acute macular neuroretinopathy, paracentral acute middle maculopathy) or visual field (e.g. acute zonal occult outer retinopathy, acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement syndrome). Multimodal imaging (with optical coherence tomography, autofluorescence, and even fundus fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography) valuably aids identification of alternate pathologies. Electrodiagnostic testing with 30 Hz flicker, multifocal ERG and visual evoked potentials can also helpfully differentiate primary retinal from optic nerve pathology, but may not be available in the acute setting.

### Diagnostic methods and therapeutic options of uveal melanoma with emphasis on MR imaging-part I: MR imaging with pathologic correlation and technical considerations [^112bAyZM]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Melanocytoma

Melanocytomas are benign pigmented tumors that may occur near or on the optic disk or in the uvea. Melanocytomas of the optic disk are hamartomas constituted by pigmented melanocytes arranged among the axons of the optic nerve head. Although previously described as a static hamartomatous proliferation, tumor growth has been described (10–15% of cases) as well as malignant transformation into melanoma, the latter occurring in about 2% of cases; hence, annual follow-up is needed. Melanocytomas may extend beyond the margin of the optic disk, thus involving the adjacent choroid or retina. On the other hand, melanomas affecting primarily the optic nerve are exceedingly uncommon, whereas the prevalence of optic nerve invasion by choroidal melanoma ranges between 5 and 7%.

At MR melanocytomas may resemble uveal melanomas, being markedly hypointense on T2-weighted sequences. However, melanocytomas seldom produces subretinal fluid or hemorrhage.

Intraocular metastases

Together with uveal melanomas, intraocular metastases represent the most common ocular malignant neoplasm in adults. The most prevalent primary tumors are breast cancer and bronchial carcinoma. Metastases are situated in the posterior portion of the eyeball in most cases (about 80%), since neoplastic emboli enter into the eye through posterior ciliary arteries. Metastases may involve both eyes in about 30% of cases; on the other hand, bilateral melanomas are exceptionally rare. Retinal detachment is less frequent in metastases (25%) than in melanomas (65.5%); moreover, the size of metastases is generally smaller than that of melanomas. Tumor shape is another important clue in the differential diagnosis. Metastasis usually have a flat shape (placoid and lentiform), placoid type being the most frequent (65.9%); this latter morphological appearance does not occur in melanomas in which the dome and mushroom shape are most common.

At MRI, metastases tend to demonstrate a more homogeneous signal intensity than melanomas, nevertheless the differentiation of these two entities on the basis of signal intensity is challenging because of the frequent overlap of imaging findings. In particular, amelanotic or poorly pigmented melanomas cannot be distinguished from metastases merely according to their signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. As for quantitative MR measurements, on T1-weighted sequences the tumor/vitreous body signal intensity ratio of uveal melanomas (2.13) is higher than that of metastases (1.8).

### Recurrent optic neuritis and perineuritis followed by an unexpected discovery: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^116WjWy6]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Case Presentation

In September 2020, a 67-year-old woman presented with a 2-day history of left eye burning and difficulty reading fine print (Figure 1). Her clinical history dates to January 2009 when she presented with a 10-day history of progressive, painful central vision loss in her right eye. The ophthalmologic examination at that time was remarkable for a visual acuity (VA) of 20/50 OD and 20/25 OS. There was decreased color vision in the right eye, a right relevant afferent pupillary defect, and right optic disc swelling with areas of hemorrhage. The aquaporin-4 antibody (anti-AQP4; assessed by cell-based assay [CBA]) was negative, and she was diagnosed with right anterior optic neuritis (ON).

Figure 1
Chronologic Heat Map

In this figure, we detail the condition of the patient over time. The longitudinal axis (left to right) depicts the condition of disease, where the smaller amplitude and lighter color indicates greater stability of disease. Alternately, the expanded amplitude of the colored heat map (above and below the horizontal linear axis over time) designates increased disease activity (whether on a clinical or paraclinical basis) or complications of the treatment of disease. Other fields of information are added either above or below the heat map and include information about treatments, diagnoses, commentaries adding contextual perspectives, and results from specific test assessments from each most relevant period of clinical decision-making. Each field is consistently color-coded throughout as defined in the figure legend.

MRI of the brain and orbits (with fat suppression) with and without contrast (Figure 2) showed greater than 50% T1 enhancement of the right optic nerve extending to the level of the optic chiasm and with prechiasmatic involvement of the contralateral optic nerve, most consistent with an inflammatory process localized to the orbital segments of the optic nerves and sheath (i.e. perineuritis). MRI of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord was unremarkable. CT of the chest was normal.

### Updates on ophthalmic imaging features of optic disc drusen, papilledema, and optic disc edema [^113ZQyKj]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

The diagnosis of patients with optic nerve head elevation should focus on a combination of history, neuro-ophthalmic examination, and multimodal ophthalmic imaging. This careful approach can help distinguish ODD, papilledema, and optic disc edema of various types and avoid unnecessary brain MRI and invasive lumbar puncture procedure in those without optic disc edema. Patients with ODD may have concurrent optic disc edema from papilledema or AION, so clinical suspicion and multimodal ophthalmic imaging are critical to correctly identify these patients who are at high risk of vision loss. In the future, more studies are needed to validate imaging biomarkers of optic nerve head elevation and identify features that are not just diagnostic but also prognostic of visual outcome.

Discussion

General comments and comparison with related literature

The infrequency of concurrent tumors in the sellar region makes them overlooked in differential diagnoses. Clinically and radiographically, these cases usually do not present with clear signs that indicate the presence of coexisting neoplasms. However, certain clinical indicators such as rapid tumor growth and the swift symptoms progression should raise suspicions of multiple tumor pathology. As exemplified in our first case, diverse enhancement patterns on brain MRI scans may also serve as potential indicator, although such radiologic findings are not pathognomonic for tumor-to-tumor metastasis. This case also presented a substantial surgical challenge due to the lesion's high vascularity, which was likely associated with its malignant component, resulting in significant intraoperative bleeding.

Our systematic review found lung and breast cancer to be the most prevalent primary sources of metastasis to PitNETs, also known as pituitary adenomas, which is consistent with brain metastases overall. The underlying mechanisms leading to the formation of metastases within PitNETs remain unclear. Some hypotheses, however, suggest that abnormalities in the pituitary gland's vasculature, such as non-portal vessels or neovascularization in the surrounding tissues of the PitNET may provide a route for metastatic cells to invade it.

Clinical presentation

Visual impairments were the most frequently encountered symptom among the cases reviewed, with the severity ranging from partial loss, such as typical bitemporal hemianopsia resulting from the pressure on the fibers from nasal retina in the anterior aspect of the optic chiasm, to complete blindness, as observed in the first case we reported. The high incidence of visual symptoms correlates with the predominance of non-functioning tumors, which tend to present clinically only when their growth results in a mass effect on adjacent structures, with the optic chiasm being the most affected. The presence of malignant cells may contribute to more rapid tumor growth, potentially explaining the observed frequency of visual deficits. Furthermore, apoplexy is often observed as a clinical presentation these cases, likely due to this rapid growth, which can overwhelm the pituitary gland's venous drainage capacity. The resultant hemorrhage or infarction within the tumor leads to the sudden onset of symptoms associated with pituitary apoplexy, including severe headache, visual disturbances, and hormonal deficiencies. Headaches are believed to stem from the stretching of the dura mater as the tumor enlarges, a condition that would be anticipated with substantial suprasellar masses that exert pressure on the optic apparatus. However, headaches' more generic nature as a symptom might lead to underreporting in relation to visual disturbances.

### "Will the real demyelinating disorder please stand up? ": from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^112ALBVR]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnostic Considerations

For the case in question, one may consider either relapsing MS (RMS) or MOGAD as the 2 top differential diagnoses. His presentation with multifocal inflammatory activity, chronic and active demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord, relatively bland CSF along with CSF-restricted OCBs would support a diagnosis of RMS. However, features atypical for MS included the severity of his vision loss with ON, extensive optic nerve enhancement with perineural involvement, robust and remarkable response to steroids, and presence of MOG-IgG with a clear positive titer (≥ 1:100), all of which could suggest the alternate diagnosis of MOGAD. MRI findings with few, poorly demarcated intracranial lesions also support a diagnosis of MOGAD, although the short-segment cord lesions are more suggestive of RMS. Although not observed in this particular case, the presence of a central vein sign would also more strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS rather than MOGAD. In addition, OCT with severe optic nerve thinning may be seen more commonly with optic neuritis from MOGAD as opposed to RMS.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is another neuroinflammatory condition characterized by optic neuritis and spinal cord lesions. AQP-4 Ab-associated NMOSD was ruled out in this case by the negative AQP-4 Ab testing. Although seronegative NMOSD could be considered, this was excluded in this case because of the overall clinicoradiologic syndrome and presence of persistently positive MOG-IgG.

Infectious processes that may present with optic neuritis and spinal cord lesions such as mycoplasma, syphilis, varicella zoster virus, HIV, human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), or others should be considered and tested for accordingly as guided by clinical presentation. Para/postinfectious presentations such as acute disseminating encephalomyelitis after a viral illness may also be considered. He denied any preceding or associated infectious symptoms and lacked other findings to suggest these diagnoses.

Other inflammatory or rheumatologic disorders such as sarcoidosis, Bechet disease, and vasculitides may cause an optic neuritis with intracranial and/or spinal cord lesions. However, these were believed to be less likely in this case because of lack of other associated symptoms, imaging features, and negative rheumatologic testing thus far.

Finally, neoplastic processes related to solid tumors or lymphoma should be considered on the differential especially in an individual with a history of smoking. Again, his lack of systemic symptoms, normal laboratory findings otherwise, and overall benign clinical course made these lower on the differential.

### Clinical, electrophysiologic and serologic evidence of cancer associated retinopathy preceding a diagnosis of breast cancer [^111MmTUk]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

We report the case of a woman in her 50s who presented headaches, blurred vision, diplopia and loss of peripheral vision. She was treated for normal tension glaucoma based on optic nerve cupping prior to the development of diplopia. Records demonstrated visual field constriction over 4 months despite well-controlled intraocular pressures. Examination revealed decreased visual acuity and visual field constriction. The multifocal electroretinogram was abnormal. After a thorough review of her medical and family history, a concern for cancer-associated retinopathy developed. Blood samples were positive for antiretinal antibodies against 23 kDA and 46 kDA proteins. Cancer screening was recommended as the aetiology for retinopathy was unknown and revealed a left breast lump. Following lumpectomy with adjuvant chemoradiation, her visual acuity normalised and visual field defects completely resolved. This case serves to provide an example that distant systemic symptoms may be a manifestation of the underlying malignancy and the importance of clinical suspicion with prompt evaluation.

Eleven months after completing adjuvant treatment, the patient developed difficulty focusing her eyes, disequilibrium, and mild headache. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status was 1. Ocular motor examination by a neuro-ophthalmologist identified a small hypertropia of the right eye that increased in the left gaze, downward gaze, and with the right head tilt, consistent with a fourth nerve palsy. The remaining physical exam was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast showed enhancement of the bilateral fifth, seventh, and eight cranial nerves (Fig. 1a–d), and spinal MRI with and without contrast demonstrated patchy circumferential enhancement of the lower thoracic and lumbar spine, and enhancement of the cauda equina nerve roots, all consistent with LC. Lumbar puncture demonstrated an opening pressure of 24 cm cerebrospinal fluid, white blood cell count 2 (normal < 5), and protein 106 mg/dL (normal 19–40 mg/dL). Spinal fluid cytology was positive for malignant cells, confirming LC. Re-staging computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no evidence of other metastatic involvement.

### Advances in breast cancer research-NCI… [^113ezgcx]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

Depending on their level of risk, women diagnosed with DCIS almost always have surgery and possibly other treatments. A 2024 trial showed that women with low-risk DCIS who undergo active monitoring were no more likely to be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer after two years than those who undergo surgery with or without radiation therapy. However, longer follow-up is needed to assess the long-term safety of forgoing surgery. ESR1gene. ESR1mutations can make the cancer resistant to other hormone therapies.
- Imlunestrant is also an oral SERD that has been shown to be more effective in slowing the growth of ESR1-mutant tumors in women with advanced, ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer than standard hormone therapy. The combination of imlumestrant with abemaciclib, a drug that blocks cell growth, was better than standard hormone therapy in both those with.
- Researchers are also studying whether the combination of hormone therapy and radiation therapy is more effective than hormone therapy alone in treating women with low-risk early stage breast cancer.
- Tamoxifen, an established hormone therapy for breast cancer, has been shown to reduce the rate of recurrence over 15 years in people with DCIS who were treated without radiation therapy.
- For younger women with metastatic ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, results from a large trial showed that the combination of the small molecule targeted drug ribociclib and hormone therapy was much better than chemotherapy at slowing tumor growth.
- In women with high-risk, node positive ER-positive breast cancer, abemaciclib given for two years in combination with endocrine therapy has also been shown to decrease the risk of recurrence.

Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy is approved for treatment of women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer that has high expression of PD-L1. A study in patients with early-stage triple negative breast cancer showed that giving pembrolizumab before surgery, followed by one year of pembrolizumab after surgery, led to better response than chemotherapy alone. This led to FDA approval of pembrolizumab in the early-stage setting. A current NCI-supported study is looking at patients with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer who had a complete response to treatment before surgery still need more treatment afterward. The standard treatment is to give pembrolizumab 27 weeks after surgery. The goal is to find out if observation alone works just as well as continuing pembrolizumab in preventing the cancer from coming back.

Description

We report the case of a 38-year-old woman who was initially diagnosed with stage II oestrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast, in 2013. Breast MRI at that time showed multifocal disease in the right breast. The patient underwent a right mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection, which revealed pT2 N1a breast cancer. Following this, she received four cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide and adjuvant radiation. At that time, she had declined tamoxifen due to her history of lattice degeneration and concerns of retinal detachment. She was also offered letrozole with goserelin but declined due to their side effect profile and risk for retinal complications.

The patient did well on routine follow-up until July 2015, when she presented to emergency department with symptoms of dizziness. Workup showed hypercalcaemia. Imaging studies including bone scan and CT scan showed multiple bone metastases, mediastinal and subcarinal lymphadenopathy and hilar masses. MRI was negative for brain lesions. Pathology from one of the lesions showed metastatic breast cancer, ER and PR positive and HER2 negative.

Leptomeningeal spread of tumor

Primary (medulloblastoma, ependymoma, oligodendroglioma, and glioblastoma) and secondary (leukemia/lymphoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma) tumors may spread through subarachnoid spaces with extension along the cranial nerves. VII and VIII cranial seem to be the most affected nerves. Clinically, symptoms of irritation and neural compression are present with multiple cranial neuropathies and mental status changes, secondary to meningeal irritation and hydrocephalus. The nerve may enhance on post-gadolinium sequences and appear enlarged (Fig. 22). Neural enhancement can be very subtle and better demonstrated on post-Gadolinium fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences.

### Progressive myelitis in a 63-year-old woman: a case report from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^111GcuwE]. Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Differential Diagnostic Considerations

The differential diagnosis of a subacute myelitis includes infectious, neoplastic, metabolic/nutritional, and immune-mediated/neuroinflammatory conditions. A vascular etiology was considered unlikely in this clinical scenario based on subacute time course of symptoms. Clinical, radiographic, serum, and CSF studies helped to narrow the differential diagnosis.

Clinical Course and Demographics

The explanation for the patient's subacute onset of symptoms over days to weeks could represent demyelinating pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS), but her older age, absence of previous typical demyelinating events, lack of brain lesions, and negative oligoclonal bands argue against a diagnosis of MS. She had no systemic signs of infection, and CSF studies were negative for multiple infectious etiologies. Normal CSF/serum glucose ratio that is between 0.4 and 0.8 (rather than low), lack of systemic manifestations, and absence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy argue against a neuroinflammatory disorder such as sarcoidosis. Her older age and cancer history raise the diagnostic concern for direct metastatic disease from breast cancer, a paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome, or myelitis related to an immune-related adverse event (irAE) from ICI use. A second unrelated malignancy, such as primary CNS lymphoma, was considered less likely. Negative CSF cytology and absence of residual tumor on breast ultrasound reduced the likelihood of metastatic involvement of the spinal cord.

MRI Features

The MRI features were typical of an inflammatory demyelinating myelitis with multiple short-segment, contrast-enhancing lesions. The radiographic imaging was atypical for a paraneoplastic condition, given lack of symmetric, dorsal-lateral tract-specific involvement, nor was it characteristic of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-IgG myelitis, given the lack of a longitudinally extensive lesion and absence of involvement restricted to the gray matter. However, the T2 hyperintensity and focal contrast enhancement of the conus could be consistent with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated disease (MOGAD) spinal cord pathology. The lack of meningeal or leptomeningeal involvement argues against neurosarcoidosis and carcinomatous meningitis. Furthermore, the absence of diffusion restriction made CNS lymphoma less likely.

### Tumors metastatic to the pituitary gland: case report and literature review [^112ncYUB]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Tumors metastatic to the pituitary gland are an unusual complication of systemic cancer typically seen in elderly patients with diffuse malignant disease. Breast and lung are the commonest sites of the primary tumor, whereas diabetes insipidus is the most frequent symptom at presentation. Their rarity and usually indolent course, as well as the lack of specific clinical and radiological features, impede their differentiation from other more common sellar area lesions, particularly when history of malignancy is absent. Management of these patients may also be very difficult because the prognosis depends on the course of the primary neoplasm. A 68-yr-old man, with no history of malignancy, presented with recent onset of hypopituitarism, mild diabetes insipidus, headaches, left oculomotor nerve palsy, and progressive bilateral deterioration of visual acuity and visual fields. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large sellar mass compressing the optic chiasm and invading the left cavernous sinus, whereas a prolactin elevation at 438.6 ng/ml (19.73 nmol/liter) was noted. Decompression of the sellar region was attempted, and pathology disclosed a metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. On postoperative investigation, primary liver tumor was identified and confirmed by biopsy. The patient improved transiently but died 3 months after diagnosis because of deterioration of the liver disease. The relevant literature is reviewed in light of this unusual case, illustrating the problems in the diagnosis and management of patients with metastasis to the pituitary.

We recommend that all patients have a MRI scan, if possible, to better delineate the nature and extent of the incidentaloma when initially diagnosed by CT, and for the MRI a specific pituitary protocol should be done that includes fine cuts with and without gadolinium, with guidelines for evaluation of renal function before gadolinium to be followed.

### A practical approach to, diagnosis, assessment and management of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^111NtYTQ]. Practical Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Patients presenting with papilloedema need careful evaluation and timely investigation. This is required to exclude all other causes of swollen optic nerves and raised intracranial pressure: IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion. Acute management depends on the immediate risk to vision. For most patients, this is a chronic condition associated with significant disability from headache. Disease-modifying therapy is weight loss. CSF shunting should be considered temporary. IIH requires a multidisciplinary approach involving ophthalmologists, neurologists and neurosurgeons. These patients are best managed in centres with expertise in IIH.

Practice points

Distinguishing papilloedema from pseudopapilloedema is not always straightforward, and may require a senior ophthalmology opinion.
Pseudotumour cerebri describes raised intracranial pressure and papilloedema in the absence of a space-occupying lesion and can be caused by several conditions (box 2). Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is a diagnosis of exclusion where NO cause can be found.
A single lumbar puncture opening pressure reading can be misleading. Where the opening pressure is out of keeping with the clinical picture, the clinician should review the whole case.
Monitoring of visual fields can be problematic in many patients who have functional overlay.
Treat the patient. High-risk patients lose vision rapidly. Headaches may be multifactorial, and require specialist evaluation and treatment to reduce disability.

### Pituitary metastases: presentation and outcomes from a pituitary center over the last decade [^1125JXy4]. Pituitary (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pituitary metastasis (PM) is a rare manifestation of malignancy. The reported prevalence varies depending on the method of assessment; 0.4% in radiological, 1% in surgical, and between 0.14 and 28.1% in autopsy series. Proposed mechanisms of PM include direct hematogenous spread, spread via the hypothalamic-portal vessels, meningeal spread via the suprasellar cistern, or extension from juxtasellar or skull base metastases. The posterior pituitary has been considered to be particularly susceptible to metastatic spread, mainly due to receiving blood supply from the systemic circulation, in contrast to the anterior gland which is supplied through the hypophyseal portal system.

Clinical presentation is variable and includes visual field impairment or optic neuropathy, cranial nerve palsies, anterior pituitary dysfunction or diabetes insipidus (DI). In earlier series, DI was a prominent presenting manifestation pointing towards the diagnosis of PM in a patient with known malignancy. PM is most frequently detected in patients with a history of cancer, with breast and lung being the most common primary sites; it may also be the first manifestation of malignancy or detected incidentally. Imaging findings can be non-specific and are often not helpful in discriminating between PM and pituitary adenoma or other sellar lesion; however, rapid growth and invasion of parasellar structures should raise suspicion of pituitary metastatic infiltration. Management options include surgery and radiotherapy (alone or in combination), as well as, depending on the primary malignancy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or hormonal therapy (such as tamoxifen for breast cancer). Evidence on the outcomes of these approaches is limited, likely owing to the short survival of patients with PM.

Earlier diagnosis and appropriate management can potentially impact the outcome and quality of life of patients with PM. A significant proportion of the literature in this field (case reports and small case series) was published over a decade ago. Given advances in the sensitivity and availability of diagnostic imaging, as well as in the treatments and survival of cancer patients, it is anticipated that the presentation, natural history and prognosis of PM will have evolved, necessitating up to date information on contemporary clinical practice. Therefore, with this study, we aimed to elucidate the presenting manifestations, diagnostic and management approaches, as well as the outcomes of patients with PM from a large Pituitary center in Europe over the last 10 years.

### Rare cause of blurred vision: unilateral primary dural ectasia of the optic nerve sheath [^116zggRL]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Dural ectasia, also known as meningocele of the optic nerve sheath, is a rare benign pathology. Magnetic resonance imaging has a great role in the diagnosis of this condition, which has nonspecific symptoms such as progressive blurred vision. It is observed as cerebrospinal fluid accumulation within the expanded nerve sheath around the optic nerve. Treatment is planned after differential diagnosis of other pathologies such as mass and inflammation in addition to diagnosis with magnetic resonance imaging. Medical treatment is usually sufficient, and surgical treatment is planned for progressive patients.

Background

Meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) is a rare and severe complication of a number of neoplastic processes. Hematologic tumors are the most frequent cause of MC, particularly acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodking lymphoma. Among solid tumors, the most frequent causes of MC are breast and lung adenocarcinoma as well as melanoma. The incidence of this complication is around 3% in breast cancer, 7% in lung cancer and 1.5% in melanoma. MC is the first manifestation of systemic cancer in only 5–10% of patients, although it is frequently seen in patients with disseminated systemic disease.

MC occurs when tumor cells reach the leptomeningeal space either through the blood, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or by growing along nerve and vascular sheaths. As a consequence, most patients present with different multifocal neurological symptoms that may involve the cranial nerves (oculomotor, facial, cochlear and optic), the spine and the cerebrum. Ocular symptoms were first reported by Katz, being diplopia and vision loss the most frequent ocular complaints.

Early diagnosis and treatment are usually very complicated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than computed tomography (CT) scan in detecting brain meningeal dissemination, although the spine should also be assessed by MRI or CT myelography. MRI may show focal or diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement as well as tumoral lesions. However, these findings are non-specific, and should be evaluated in the particular clinical context. On the other hand, CSF analysis should be performed in all patients with suspected MC. Malignant cells are detected in the CSF in only 50% of patients with MC in the first lumbar puncture. Therefore, repeated CSF sampling is usually needed. Finally, the CSF protein concentration (50 mg/dl) and the opening CSF pressure (> 25 cm H₂O) are frequently elevated, whereas the glucose concentration (< 60 mg/dl) is usually decreased.

### A 43-year-old woman presenting with subacute, bilateral, sequential facial nerve palsies, then developing pseudotumour cerebri [^112u2fgm]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

A patient presented elsewhere with what appeared to be a simple, unilateral, chronic suppurative otitis media and then developed an ipsilateral facial palsy. She soon developed the same problem on the other side. At the time, a brain MRI had been ordered but the clinician did not review it with a radiologist. The surgical specimens were not sent for histopathology. When transferred to our institution 3months later, the patient had severe bilateral papilloedema due to intracranial hypertension due to missed cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Further surgery revealed that the pathology in the temporal bone was B-cell lymphoma, which, fortunately, responded to chemoradiotherapy. There was good resolution of the facial palsies, but the patient has severe permanent visual loss due to optic atrophy.

Metastases or tumours extending into the CPA

Leptomeningeal or perineural tumour spread and lesions originating in the skull base, cerebellum or fourth ventricle may mimic vestibular schwannoma (Fig. 15). In case of metastatic disease there usually is a known history of malignancy. The most frequently encoutered primary sites are lung, breast, melanoma or lymphoma. Patients present with rapidly progressive symptoms, often combined with palsy of other cranial nerves, despite the small size of the lesion. Metastatic disease will show rapid growth.

On a heavily T2-weighted image (a) a tumour with an "ice-cream cone" appearance and cystic changes is present on the left. On the right a soft tissue mass is present in the cerebellopontine angle cistern. Follow-up examintation a few months later (b - d) revealed extensive growth of the lesions, which are now evidently closely related to the choroid plexus. Post-contrast images (c, d) show cystic and nodular leptomeningeal metastases in the fossa posterior. CSF analysis showed malignant cells (adenocarcinoma)

### Parotid gland: an unusual site of breast cancer metastasis [^116RBN7P]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Parotid gland metastases from breast cancer are an extremely rare and unusual event with a limited number of cases recorded in the literature. A 71-year-old woman with a history of ductal adenocarcinoma of the left breast presented to the maxillofacial clinic with an asymptomatic swelling of the left parotid gland. The presentation occurred 21 years after she underwent treatment for recurrent breast cancer. Investigations led to the diagnosis of a breast cancer metastasis which was oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive and negative. Positron emission tomography scan confirmed this as a solitary metastasis. She was treated with aromatase inhibitors and a stable clinical response was observed on follow-up. Surgical intervention was avoided with its potential complications such as facial nerve injury. Metastasis from breast cancer to the parotid gland is a very rare phenomenon. However, in a patient with previous breast cancer, it should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis.

### Delineating extramammary findings at breast MR imaging [^115DZvJi]. Radiographics (2017). Low credibility.

Breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is the only breast imaging modality that consistently encompasses extramammary structures in the thorax and upper abdomen. Incidental extramammary findings on breast MR images of patients with a history of breast cancer or other malignancies are significantly more likely to be malignant and may affect staging and treatment. An understanding of the frequency, distribution, and context of extramammary findings on breast MR images and a familiarity with common and uncommon sites of breast cancer metastasis inform the differential diagnosis and prompt the appropriate diagnostic next step, to differentiate benign from malignant findings. High-yield organ systems on breast MR images, as reflected by a high positive predictive value for malignancy, are correlated with known distant sites of breast cancer metastasis in the bone, lung, liver, and lymph nodes. Staging is considered when disease involves the skin and chest wall. Unusual sites of breast cancer metastasis from invasive lobular carcinoma are discussed, including the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum, and adrenal glands. Nonmalignant clinically important findings involving the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems are reviewed, and potential pitfalls in diagnosis and interpretation are highlighted. A consistently systematic diagnostic approach is emphasized for identifying extramammary abnormalities on breast MR images. All things considered, the radiologist should be able to improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity while interpreting extramammary findings on breast MR images. © RSNA, 2017.

### Follicular thyroid cancer presenting as a sellar mass: case report and review of the literature [^113UtE15]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe an uncommon initial manifestation of well-differentiated follicular carcinoma of the thyroid in an unusual metastatic site.

Methods

We present clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings in our patient and review related data from the literature.

Results

A young healthy woman presented with headache and diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a complex mass in the sellar region. Endocrine evaluation was remarkable only for a modestly high serum prolactin level. Transsphenoidal biopsy of the sellar mass revealed metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma. On subsequent examination, a thyroid nodule was palpated. She underwent total thyroidectomy and ablative therapy with ¹³¹I, after which her symptoms gradually subsided and the sellar mass ultimately decreased in size. Although well-differentiated thyroid cancer generally manifests as a thyroid nodule, metastatic disease is present at the time of initial assessment in approximately 1% of cases, and the lungs and the skeleton are the most frequent sites of involvement. Only a few cases of thyroid cancer metastasizing to the sella have been reported. Described cases occurred mainly in elderly patients with previously diagnosed thyroid cancer. The most common malignant tumors that metastasize to the sella and pituitary are lung cancer in men and breast cancer in women. Metastatic tumors frequently manifest with cranial nerve palsies or diabetes insipidus and occur in elderly patients.

Conclusion

Follicular thyroid cancer can manifest initially as a distant metastatic tumor in young patients. Metastatic lesions should always be in the differential diagnosis of a sellar mass, even in young patients.

### Mechanisms of visual loss in papilledema [^115S6HWp]. Neurosurgical Focus (2007). Low credibility.

The term "papilledema" indicates swelling of the optic discs secondary to increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema can be caused by an intracranial mass lesion or by other factors. Visual symptoms frequently accompany papilledema, which can lead to permanent visual loss if left untreated. Starting with an illustrative case, the authors review the pathophysiology of the visual signs and symptoms of papilledema. They also briefly review potential treatment options, focusing on the role of the neurosurgeon in the treatment of patients with papilledema.

### Alopecia areata and myasthenia gravis presenting as paraneoplastic phenomena of breast cancer [^115SErcY]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Case report

A 60-year-old woman presented to the dermatology clinic through the request of a neurologist for evaluation of nonscarring scalp alopecia temporally related to the onset of diplopia. The patient reports that she woke up one morning with acute onset of double vision and concomitant patchy hair loss. She reported that her double vision seemed to worsen toward the end of the day. Her hair loss was limited to the scalp and was not associated with pruritus or pain. Both diplopia and hair loss worsened over the next 6 months prompting her to seek medical care. She was first seen by Ophthalmology with no structural ocular issues identified and was subsequently referred to Neurology. Neurologic exam showed prominent 3 rd and 4 th cranial nerve deficits with right eyelid ptosis. Cutaneous evaluation showed well-circumscribed oval patches of scalp hair loss sparing eyebrows, lashes, and other hair bearing surfaces (Fig 1). Screening brain magnetic resonance imaging showed normal anatomy without evidence of vascular abnormality or space occupying lesion. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated unremarkable androgen profile, vasculitis screening, nutritional/thyroid studies, serum electrolytes, and rheumatic serum studies. Trichoscopy showed few anagen/catagen hairs. The majority of follicles had no sheath and were tapered at one end with abrupt termination at the opposite end consistent with AA (Fig 2). Second-tier laboratory evaluation showed elevated levels of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies consistent with a diagnosis of MG. She was started on pyridostigmine, intralesional triamcinolone, and clobetasol scalp solution with limited symptomatic improvement over the course of 2 months. Chest computed tomography as part of the MG work-up looking for mediastinal mass showed evidence of concerning calcifications within her right breast (Fig 3). Mammography and biopsy revealed stage I invasive ductal carcinoma of her right breast (pT1cN0M0) which was HER2/Neu+ and ER/PR-with pagetoid spread (Fig 4). She underwent partial mastectomy with central breast excision and subsequent radiation therapy without systemic corticosteroids. The patient recovered well from oncologic therapy and subsequently demonstrated rapid improvement in her presenting autoimmune symptoms.

### A 28-year-old woman with left-sided weakness and atypical MRI lesions: from the national multiple sclerosis society case conference proceedings [^115wTagH]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis also included infectious causes. Both neurosyphilis and tuberculosis, for example, could rarely manifest as enhancing longitudinally extensive lesion(s) causing progressive subacute symptoms. However, an infectious etiology was less likely in this patient who had no infectious symptoms or identifiable exposures on presentation of her neurologic symptoms and had an extensive negative workup for infections, including negative screens for syphilis and HIV as well as negative CSF cultures, VDRL, and viral studies.

Finally, the insidious and gradually progressive nature of the patient's symptoms over many months placed malignancy high on the differential diagnosis list. The Table summarizes the typical clinical and radiologic features differentiating a spinal cord tumor from an inflammatory/autoimmune myelopathy. The patient's enhancing, expansile cervical cord lesion at symptom onset was concerning for a primary CNS lymphoma or glioma. Like autoimmune/inflammatory myelopathies, primary CNS lymphoma could develop longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions and would be frequently isointense to hypointense on T1-weighted sequence in addition to high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and enhancement with contrast. Although spinal cord swelling would be typically seen, some patients (approximately 40%) with spinal cord lymphoma could have intramedullary lesions without edema, mimicking a non-neoplastic etiology. Spinal cord gliomas could also develop intramedullary longitudinally extensive lesions. They could cause cervico-thoracic T2-hyperintense spinal cord lesions and diffusely involve the cross-sectional area of the cord with homogenous contrast enhancement. Spinal cord astrocytomas, a type of glioma, could mimic MOGAD-associated spinal cord lesions (including involvement of the conus) but would be distinguished by their excentric location and irregular margins. Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (the most common of which originate from lung or breast) could mimic inflammatory lesions with a circular border of enhancement on imaging similar to that seen in NMOSD. However, there may be a greater tendency of intramedullary spinal cord metastases to have their circular border of enhancement capped by a flame-like taper on either end, which would not be typical of inflammatory/autoimmune myelopathies. In our patient, the tapering of the expansile spinal cord lesion at the caudal and rostral aspects would be unusual for an inflammatory/autoimmune myelopathy and could favor a spinal cord tumor (Figure 2, A–F). Metastatic spinal cord lesions typically show low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, but our patient's cord lesion was isointense on T1-weighted sequences (Figure 2). Neoplastic causes of longitudinally extensive myelopathies should be suspected if the patient's symptoms continued to progress despite treatment with methylprednisolone or plasma exchange or if the patient's spinal cord imaging showed persistent contrast enhancement after 3 months of onset. A spinal cord biopsy may be necessary to reach a diagnosis.

### Clinical insights into paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration [^111htnXf]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

Neuroimaging is usually unremarkable in paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), at least in the early stages of the disease. A patient with proven PCD is reported in whom it could be shown that cerebellar atrophy evolved very rapidly and was present in early imaging studies. Even with the use of the whole spectrum of modern diagnostic tools, the underlying malignancy can be difficult to diagnose. In addition to mammography, MRI is recommended in these cases and repeat FDG-PET may be necessary.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: central nervous system cancers, version 2.2022 [^116XLqcA]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

Leptomeningeal metastases — epidemiology, presentation, and outcomes: Leptomeningeal metastasis occurs in approximately 5% of patients with cancer, most cases arise from breast cancers, lung cancers, and melanoma, and tumor cells gain access to the leptomeninges by hematogenous dissemination, lymphatic spread, or direct extension with dissemination throughout the neuraxis by the constant flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Infiltration of the leptomeninges by any malignancy is a serious complication that results in substantial morbidity and mortality, with common symptoms depending on location including new cranial nerve palsies when the posterior fossa is involved, spinal cord-related symptoms such as pain, focal motor or sensory dysfunction, and bowel/bladder dysfunction, and ventricular system involvement with headache, nausea/vomiting, and confusion. The median survival of patients diagnosed with this disorder is typically 2 to 4 months, although survival may be extended by early detection and intervention, and the underlying tumor type can have some impact on overall survival.

### Optic nerve glioma and optic neuritis mimicking one another: case report [^115ajaun]. Neurosurgery (2005). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

The clinical and radiographic presentations of optic nerve gliomas and optic neuritis are for the most part distinct and their diagnoses straightforward. We present two cases illustrating the occasional difficulty one can encounter in distinguishing neoplastic from inflammatory optic neuropathies.

Clinical Presentation

Patient 1 is a 17-year-old girl who presented with acute onset of pain and rapidly progressive visual loss in the right eye. Patient 2 is a 38-year-old man who presented with painless progressive visual loss in the left eye.

Intervention

Patient 1 was initially diagnosed with idiopathic retrobulbar optic neuritis. Interval increase of the optic nerve on magnetic resonance imaging prompted a biopsy of the optic nerve, which revealed a pilocytic astrocytoma. Patient 2 was found to have left optic nerve enhancement most consistent with an optic nerve glioma. Before a biopsy, the patient spontaneously improved without treatment, indicating an inflammatory process.

Conclusion

Differentiating between optic nerve neoplasm and inflammation may be difficult. On occasion, the classic clinical finding of pain with eye movement and the radiographic finding of enlargement and enhancement of the optic nerve may be misleading. Open biopsy of the optic nerve is indicated only after a completely negative metabolic, infectious, and inflammatory workup; interval increase of the optic nerve on magnetic resonance imaging; and failure of the patient to recover vision.

### Complete unilateral vision loss and optic nerve cupping from metastatic prostate cancer to the optic canal [^112UPyMp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 71-year-old man, living with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer to the lymph nodes, spine and skull, presented with acute on chronic left eye vision loss. Examination revealed no-light-perception vision, a relative afferent pupillary defect and optic disc cupping. MRI brain revealed optic canal narrowing from metastatic sphenoid bone expansion and extraosseous tumour compressing the intracanalicular optic nerve. The optic disc cupping and excavation without significant pallor of the remaining neuroretinal rim was likely secondary to chronic compression of the optic nerve. The patient was treated with radiation therapy, but did not regain vision and was referred to palliative care as his condition continued to worsen. As patients live longer with advanced cancer, there is a greater risk of metastasis to atypical areas of the body including the optic nerve. This case demonstrates the unique combination of optic disc cupping from optic canal metastasis due to prostate cancer.

### MR imaging in the evaluation of equivocal clinical and imaging findings of the breast [^1178oApj]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Because of its high negative predictive value in excluding breast cancer, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging plays a role in the evaluation of selected clinical and imaging findings of the breast, especially when biopsy is not technically feasible. Case selection is very important in ensuring the efficacy of this use of MR imaging because of potential false-positive and (albeit less likely) false-negative results. This article examines the clinical scenarios and imaging findings in which MR imaging is contributory to patient management after conventional workup with equivocal results.

### Pituitary incidentaloma: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112eoFTR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Follow-up testing of the pituitary incidentaloma — Patients with incidentalomas who do not meet criteria for surgical removal of the tumor should receive nonsurgical follow-up with clinical assessments and the following tests: MRI scan of the pituitary 6 months after the initial scan if the incidentaloma is a macroincidentaloma and 1 yr after the initial scan if it is a microincidentaloma; in patients whose incidentaloma does not change in size, we suggest repeating the MRI every year for macroincidentalomas and every 1–2 yr in microincidentalomas for the following 3 yr, and gradually less frequently thereafter. Visual field (VF) testing is indicated in patients with a pituitary incidentaloma that enlarges to abut or compress the optic nerves or chiasm on a follow-up imaging study, and we suggest that clinicians do not need to test VF in patients whose incidentalomas are not close to the chiasm and who have no new symptoms and are being followed closely by MRI. Clinical and biochemical evaluations for hypopituitarism are advised 6 months after the initial testing and yearly thereafter in patients with a pituitary macroincidentaloma, and we suggest that clinicians do not need to test for hypopituitarism in patients with pituitary microincidentalomas whose clinical picture, history, and MRI do not change over time. Patients who develop any signs or symptoms potentially related to the incidentaloma or who show an increase in size of the incidentaloma on MRI should undergo more frequent or detailed evaluations as indicated clinically.

### Bilateral optic neuritis in a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a case report [^116pryNL]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Fundus images of a patient with optic neuritis at onset. A Fundus photography revealed that the optic discs were swollen and congested bilaterally, with blurred edges. B OCT revealed mild thickening of the RNFL around the optic disc. C OCTA revealed bulging optic discs in both eyes with reduced blood flow density. D FFA revealed mild bilateral late optic disc fluorescence staining

Orbital MRI enhancement revealed bilateral optic nerve thickening and enhancement, widening of the optic nerve sheaths and fluid accumulation (Fig. 2 A-B). Brain MRI revealed no space-occupying lesions. (Fig. 2 C). The patient also reported a recent history of headaches and tinnitus. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained via lumbar puncture, which revealed that her intracranial pressure (ICP) was 270 mmH₂O, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear with a protein level of 0.62 g/L. To rule out secondary causes of elevated ICP, neurology consultation and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) for venous sinus stenosis are indicated. At this point, our diagnosis became unclear. Was the optic disc swelling due to bilateral optic neuritis or increased ICP?

Fig. 2
Patient's one-week MRI at onset. A Orbital MRI enhancement showed bilateral optic nerve thickening and enhancement, widening of the optic nerve sheaths and fluid accumulation. B The optic nerve sheath diameter measured 6.1 mm bilaterally. C Brain MRI showed no space-occupying lesions.

The BCVA was hand motion (HM) in the right eye and 0.4 in the left eye. Bilateral optic disc swelling worsened while awaiting MRV (Fig. 3 B). Upon reviewing the MR image again, we considered that the patient experienced not only optic nerve sheath widening and enhancement but also rapid progression of her condition. The patient expressed anxiety about her vision loss, we decided to initiate methylprednisolone 500 mg IV infusion after excluding contraindications. Again, we suggested testing for AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG antibodies, but the patient declined. On the second day of therapy, the patient noticed an improvement in vision. After 3 days of methylprednisolone pulse therapy, the patient's vision significantly improved. Bilateral optic disc swelling was notably reduced (Fig. 3 C).

### The role of orbital ultrasonography in distinguishing papilledema from pseudopapilledema [^113TmCe4]. Eye (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of orbital ultrasonography in distinguishing papilledema from pseudopapilledema in adult patients.

Methods

The records of all adult patients referred to the neuro-ophthalmology service who underwent orbital ultrasonography for the evaluation of suspected papilledema were reviewed. The details of history, ophthalmologic examination, and results of ancillary testing including orbital ultrasonography, MRI, and lumbar puncture were recorded. Results of orbital ultrasonography were correlated with the final diagnosis of papilledema or pseudopapilledema on the basis of the clinical impression of the neuro-ophthalmologist. Ultrasound was considered positive when the optic nerve sheath diameter was ≥ 3.3mm along with a positive 30° test.

Results

The sensitivity of orbital ultrasonography for detection of papilledema was 90% (CI: 80.2–99.3%) and the specificity in detecting pseudopapilledema was 79% (CI: 67.7–90.7%).

Conclusions

Orbital ultrasonography is a rapid and noninvasive test that is highly sensitive, but less specific in differentiating papilledema from pseudopapilledema in adult patients, and can be useful in guiding further management of patients in whom the diagnosis is initially uncertain.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: from detection to decision [^111nYoPq]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Nipple discharge is a fairly common complaint in breast units. Cytology is not routinely recommended due to its high false-negative rate. When the discharge is unilateral, uniductal, persistent, and spontaneous, this condition is classified as PND, and breast imaging is mandatory to rule out malignancy. Although PND is usually caused by benign conditions, malignancy is detected in 3% to 23% of cases.

The first-line imaging techniques are US or FFDM/DBT combined with US, depending on the patient's age and gender. If these modalities yield negative findings, MRI is the preferred next step over galactography. Due to its high sensitivity and NPV, a negative MRI result is sufficient to justify surveillance rather than surgery. CEM can be a suitable alternative when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. Ductoscopy is also a promising tool to identify patients who may benefit from surgery.

DISC EDEMA OR PSEUDOEDEMA?

Clinical history and fundoscopic examination cannot reliably distinguish disc edema from pseudoedema

In most cases of optic nerve head elevation, clinical history and optic nerve examination are not sufficient to make the correct diagnosis. There are many overlapping clinical characteristics, and patients can present with normal vision or relatively nonspecific visual disturbances (Table 1). Patients with ODD or papilledema commonly have normal central vision, whereas those with optic disc edema because of optic neuritis or AION typically have symptomatic vision loss.

On funduscopic examination, most causes of optic nerve head elevation look similar – the optic disc is full and elevated, and there is blurred disc margin and small cup-to-disc (C/D) ratio (Table 2). There may be venous congestion and dilation, peripapillary arteriolar irregularity or narrowing, and signs of ischemia. These are important signs of vascular compromise that should heighten awareness for risk of sudden vision loss.

### A case of prolonged disease-free survival in a patient with choroidal metastasis from breast cancer [^117Ge1Yc]. Nature Clinical Practice: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

A 57-year-old woman presented with distorted vision and decreased visual acuity (finger count only) in her left eye, 6 years after she had undergone a lumpectomy, lymph-node dissection, and radiation therapy for a 1.1 cm infiltrating ductal carcinoma of her right breast. A year before this presentation, she had completed 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy.

Investigations

Physical examination, including a thorough ophthalmologic evaluation; laboratory investigations, ocular fluorescein angiography, ocular ultrasonography, head CT, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography, bone scan, and bilateral mammography.

Diagnosis

Choroidal metastasis from breast carcinoma, with no other evidence of disease recurrence.

Management

Radiation therapy to the left eye followed by ongoing hormonal therapy with oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily for the past 9.5 years.

### Advances in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of leptomeningeal disease [^113hQDgx]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

The tissues surrounding the brain and the spinal cord, or meninges, are comprised of the outer pachymeninges and the inner leptomeninges. The pachymeninges consist of the osteal and meningeal layers of the dura mater. The pachymeninges are served by the systemic circulation and lie outside the blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier systems. The leptomeninges include the multilayered arachnoid membranes and pia mater and contain the circulating CSF. The leptomeninges reside behind the blood-CSF-barrier and may host a number of neurologic conditions including infections, inflammatory conditions as well as cancer. Spread of cancer cells into pia mater and the arachnoid membrane is referred to as leptomeningeal metastasis (LM).

Reflecting the diffuse nature of the disease location, LM is associated with a myriad of clinical manifestations that lead to substantial morbidity. CNS involvement from LM can result in encephalopathy, headache, seizures, and multiple cranial neuropathies with associated diplopia, dysphagia, and dysarthria. Impaired CSF resorption due to LM can cause obstructive hydrocephalus and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Spine involvement from LM may lead to pain, weakness, dysautonomia, and genitourinary dysfunction. Despite debilitating clinical symptoms, establishing the diagnosis can be challenging due to significant limitations in available radiographic and laboratory studies.

LM carries a grim prognosis. Survival following diagnosis of LM from solid organ tumors such as lung cancer and breast cancer averages less than three to six months despite treatments including supportive care, radiation therapy, and intrathecal chemotherapy. Some variability in prognosis based on tumor type has been reported with LM secondary to lung cancer associated with poorer prognosis compared to breast cancer and melanoma. Tumor subtype can influence the prognosis as well with HER2+ and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer associated with better prognosis compared to hormone negative tumorsand prolonged survival reported in EGFR mutant lung cancer treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors compared to LM from other non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). This bleak outcome is a direct result of major roadblocks in the study of LM, which impede the development of effective treatments and include: 1. Diagnostic challenge; 2. Inability to quantitate disease burden; 3. Genetic heterogeneity. However, many of these barriers will soon be overcome. Herein we review these emerging diagnostic tools for better detection, quantification, and prognostication of LM as well as multiple treatment modalities that portend improvements in management of this devastating complication of cancer.

A Safer, Better Treatment Option for Some Younger Women with Breast CancerPosted: For younger women with advanced breast cancer, the combination of ribociclib and hormone therapy was much better at shrinking metastatic tumors than standard chemotherapy treatments, results from an NCI-funded clinical trial show. Shorter Course of Radiation Is Effective, Safe for Some with Early-Stage Breast CancerPosted: In a large clinical trial, a condensed course of radiation therapy was as effective and safe as a longer standard course for those with higher-risk early-stage breast cancer who had a lumpectomy. This shorter radiation course makes treatment less of a burden for patients. Pembrolizumab Improves Survival in Advanced Triple-Negative Breast CancerPosted: Adding the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab to chemotherapy can help some patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer live longer.

In the KEYNOTE-355 trial, overall survival improved among patients whose tumors had high levels of the PD-L1 protein. Enhertu Improves Survival for Metastatic "HER2-Low" Breast CancerPosted: Sacituzumab govitecan now has regular FDA approval for people with locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer. The update follows last year's accelerated approval of the drug for people with TNBC. Imaging Test Could Help Guide Breast Cancer Treatment DecisionsPosted: For some people with ER-positive breast cancer, a new imaging test may help guide decisions about receiving hormone therapy, according to a new study. The test can show whether estrogen receptors in tumors are active and responsive to estrogen. Dormant Tumor Cells Can Be Sensitized to ChemotherapyPosted: A new study in mice shows that disrupting the relationship between breast cancer cells that spread to bone and normal cells surrounding them makes the cancer cells sensitive to treatment.

Whole- and Partial-Breast Radiation Effective at Preventing Breast Cancer from ReturningPosted: In women with early-stage breast cancer, two clinical trials have shown that both whole- and partial-breast radiation therapy are effective at preventing the cancer from returning after breast-conserving surgery. FDA has approved the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib as a first-line treatment in some women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

### Practice bulletin no. 164: diagnosis and management of benign breast disorders [^112F2jSU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Benign breast disorders — evaluation of mastalgia (breast pain) emphasizes that the evaluation should include a history to elicit timing, frequency, severity, and location and attention to activities or trauma; mastalgia associated with breast cancer is more likely to be unilateral, intense, noncyclic, and progressive. A clinical breast examination should be performed and the chest wall evaluated separately; if a palpable abnormality is identified, then imaging should be performed, and breast imaging should be considered for focal mastalgia without an obvious cause, particularly if the pain is of new onset. Mondor disease is described as a rare cause of noncyclic breast pain with a palpable cord and linear skin dimpling, and because an association with breast cancer has been reported, age-appropriate breast imaging should be performed to rule out a nonpalpable underlying cancer.

### Metastatic breast cancer presenting as orbital mass: a case report with literature review | JCO global oncology… [^116Sh9nU]. ASCO (2017). Low credibility.

Case Report A 58-year-old African American female presented to the ophthalmology clinic with a right anterior orbital mass, which was initially suggestive of orbital sarcoidosis. Symptoms included progressively worsening eye pain with pressure headache, orbital tenderness, and decreased vision. The patient first noticed the nodule and drooping of the eyelid 3 months before evaluation and complained of fatigue for approximately 1 year with no accompanying fever, chills, weight loss, or diplopia. On initial presentation, her eye pain and mass was attributed to ocular sarcoidosis. This possibility was further entertained with a chest x-ray that showed midhilar adenopathy and thickening of the minor fissure that was consistent with changes secondary to sarcoidosis. The patient was started on prednisone for presumed orbital sarcoidosis, which was supported by findings of elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and angiotensin-converting enzyme.

Despite 3 months of steroid therapy, the patient's symptoms persisted, with increasing tightness of the superior orbit, which made the initial sarcoidosis diagnosis unlikely. There was no rib pain or vision change, and she was sleeping well. There was no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, hematuria, productive cough, chest pain, or night sweats. She had a performance status of 0. The patient was given her diagnosis of biopsy-proven metastatic right breast cancer involving right axillary lymph node, right orbital region, rib lesion, and possible lung nodules. Biopsy of her orbital mass and breast mass confirmed ER-/PR-positive and HER2-/neu-negative metastatic breast cancer. Treatment is usually palliative once diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer is made and is prescribed for symptom relief and improvement of orbital function. 2The hematogenous seeding of cancer to the orbit reflects systemic disease that has likely spread to other sites.

1Main interventions are the use of systemic chemotherapy or hormone therapy, depending on receptor testing of lesion, with or without local radiation or surgical resection. 4Radiotherapy has an objective response rate up to 79%, and in 80% of cases it restores vision but does risk cataract formation and radiation retinopathy. 2It can be used in patients with such symptoms as persistent pain and bony destructions, though with little effect on vision improvement. 1Patients with bony involvement of the orbit and other sites should be offered bone-modulating agents, such as bisphosphonates or denosomab.

### MR imaging of papilledema and visual pathways: effects of increased intracranial pressure and pathophysiologic mechanisms [^115dfrpQ]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2013). Low credibility.

Papilledema, defined as swelling of the optic disc, frequently occurs in the setting of increased ICP and in a variety of medical conditions, including pseudotumor cerebri, sinus thrombosis, intracerebral hemorrhage, frontal lobe neoplasms, and Chiari malformation. Noninvasive imaging of the ON is possible by using MR imaging, with a variety of findings occurring in the setting of papilledema, including flattening of the posterior sclera, protrusion of the optic disc, widening of the ONS, and tortuosity of the ON. Early recognition of papilledema and elevated ICP is of paramount importance for ensuring restoration of vision. Newer advanced MR imaging techniques such as fMRI and DTI may prove useful in the future to assess the potential effects of papilledema on retinal and visual pathway integrity.

### Metastatic skull tumors: MRI features and a new conventional classification [^114GmCSF]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Clinical manifestations (Table 2)

Patients with calvarial circumscribed intraosseous metastases had no symptoms. Calvarial circumscribed invasive metastases caused local pain and swelling in five patients (18%). Four patients (11%) with calvarial diffuse invasive metastases suffered from headache and nausea because of dural and subdural invasion. As demonstrated in Table 2, the most common symptom in our patients with skull-base metastasis was cranial nerve signs (21%), followed by pain (13%). Of 20 patients with cranial nerve signs, 11 (55%) presented with diplopia, 4 (20%) with trigeminal nerve sign, 4 (20%) with hypogrossal nerve dysfunction, and 3 (15%) with facial nerve palsy.

The median interval between diagnosis of the primary tumors and detection of skull metastases was 4 years (mean 6 years; range 0–16 years 5 months). The mean survival time from skull metastasis in the 175 patients was 19.5 months (median 9 months; range 3–65 months). The time from primary diagnosis to skull metastases was 71 months for cases with breast cancer, 26 months for prostate cancer, 9 months for lung cancer, and 4 months for malignant lymphoma (Table 3).

Table 3
Primary cancer and intervals from diagnosis of primary malignancy to skull metastases

Treatment

Patients with asymptomatic skull metastases and without brain metastases were followed up with regular MR imaging.

Sixty-three (36%) of our patients underwent radiation therapy. Thirty-five (56%) of those 63 patients had simultaneous brain parenchymal metastases, and needed whole-brain radiation. Another 28 patients were symptomatic because of skull metastases: 23 (82%) patients showed improvement of their symptoms or stable disease after local or whole cranial radiation.

Overall survival from diagnosis of metastatic skull tumor was 23 months for patients with prostate cancer, 15 months for breast cancer, 6 months for malignant lymphoma, and 5 months for lung cancer (Fig. 3).

### Magnetic resonance imaging signs of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [^116bLcwy]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are there evidence-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signs that improve the accuracy of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) diagnosis?

Findings

In this cohort study of 192 patients, the presence of 2 of 3 IIH-specific MRI signs (posterior bulb flattening, optic nerve disc protrusion, and transverse sinus venous stenosis) enabled the diagnosis of papilledema in patients with suspected IIH with greater accuracy than with the use of current diagnostic MRI criteria. This diagnostic ability was confirmed in 3 independent cohorts.

Meaning

These findings suggest that 3 IIH-specific MRI signs can be used to diagnose papilledema more accurately than the current diagnostic MRI criteria.

### Etiology of papilledema in patients in the eye clinic setting [^114RW81U]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the likely etiology of papilledema among patients presenting to an eye clinic without a previously known cause?

Findings

In this population-based cross-sectional study including 86 patients diagnosed with papilledema, most patients (87%) were found to have idiopathic intracranial hypertension, while 13% presented with potentially life-threatening conditions, including intracranial tumor, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and granulomatous meningitis.

Meaning

All patients presenting with papilledema require neuroimaging; however, based on the results of this study, those with the typical demographic characteristics of idiopathic intracranial hypertension and lack of other neurologic symptoms may not need urgent neuroimaging, as long as the papilledema is not severe enough to threaten vision.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of metastatic breast cancer, management of brain metastases, ASCO 2018 guidelines recommend to offer the following options in patients with progressive intracranial metastases despite initial radiotherapy, with the choice of treatment depending on initial treatment:

- stereotactic radiosurgery

- surgery

- whole-brain radiotherapy

- a trial of systemic therapy

- enrollment in a clinical trial

- best supportive an additional option for diffuse recurrence.
