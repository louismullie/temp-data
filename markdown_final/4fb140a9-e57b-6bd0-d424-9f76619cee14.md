## Question

Patient has hard bump on top of foot

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a hard bump on the top of the foot. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial history and physical examination to frame the differential. Then, I should verify red flags that mandate urgent action. Next, I will consider the most likely benign etiologies and how to distinguish them clinically. After that, I need to check which imaging modality is appropriate and when to escalate to MRI. Finally, I will outline management pathways, including when to refer or biopsy, and close with a concise diagnostic algorithm and key takeaways anchored to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the core elements of history and examination that narrow the differential for a dorsal foot mass. I need to ask about onset and duration, rate of growth, pain or tenderness, trauma or repetitive microtrauma, shoe pressure, fluctuance, skin changes, systemic symptoms, and comorbidities such as diabetes or neuropathy, because these features separate ganglion cysts, bony prominences, exostoses, ganglion cysts, lipomas, and more serious entities like infection or tumor [^a4b4ae85] [^4b2c3e7e]. On exam, I should palpate for consistency, mobility, warmth, erythema, fluctuance, and reproduce symptoms with pressure, and I should inspect gait and footwear to identify mechanical drivers, since dorsal ganglia are common and often minimally tender, whereas bony exostoses are firm and noncompressible [^a4b4ae85] [^d2a4ba78].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to screen for red flags that change urgency. Rapid enlargement, firm fixed mass, night pain, weight loss, fever, erythema with warmth, or a history of diabetes with neuropathy should prompt expedited imaging and possible biopsy, because malignancy and diabetic foot infection or Charcot arthropathy can mimic benign masses and carry high morbidity if missed [^4b2c3e7e] [^e48b0b98] [^2f935ec2]. I should double-check for pulsatility or a bruit suggesting a dorsalis pedis aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, which is rare but requires urgent vascular evaluation [^29c92cf8] [^42590c69].

> Next, I should review the most likely benign etiologies and their distinguishing features. Ganglion cysts are common on the dorsum, typically soft to firm, mobile, and may transilluminate; they can extend plantarward and occasionally have an hourglass configuration, so I need to keep multi-compartment extension in mind when planning excision [^d2a4ba78]. Bony exostoses or tarsal boss present as hard, noncompressible prominences at joint margins and are often irritated by shoes; radiographs confirm bony origin and help distinguish from avulsion fragments or accessory ossicles [^notfound]. Accessory ossicles such as os supranaviculare can be mistaken for avulsion fractures; careful radiographic morphology and clinical context help differentiate incidental variants from acute injuries [^5b91820c]. Lipomas are softer, mobile, and less common dorsally but should be considered when the mass is subcutaneous and compressible [^dc9daeaa].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging sequence so I don't overuse MRI unnecessarily. For a nontraumatic, longstanding, soft dorsal mass without red flags, ultrasound is the first-line modality because it characterizes cystic versus solid lesions, detects ganglion cysts, and guides aspiration if needed; it is also useful for vascular masses like dorsalis pedis aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm [^notfound]. If ultrasound is inconclusive or if the mass is bony or periarticular, plain radiographs are appropriate to evaluate for exostosis, avulsion fracture, or accessory ossicles; weight-bearing views can be helpful for mechanical lesions [^notfound]. I should confirm that MRI is reserved for indeterminate solid masses, suspected malignancy, deep or complex lesions, or when surgical planning is required, given its superior soft tissue contrast and ability to define extent and neurovascular relationships [^f3522548].

> I will now examine the management pathway by likely diagnosis, but I need to ensure I align with evidence and guidelines. For a ganglion cyst, observation is reasonable if asymptomatic; aspiration with or without corticosteroid injection can be offered for symptomatic lesions, and surgical excision is indicated for recalcitrant or recurrent cases, ideally with preoperative MRI if an hourglass extension is suspected to guide a combined approach [^d2a4ba78]. For a tarsal boss or symptomatic exostosis, footwear modification, padding, and activity adjustment are first-line; surgical excision is reserved for persistent pain or functional limitation after conservative measures [^notfound]. For suspected malignancy or atypical solid masses, I should refer to orthopedic oncology for core needle biopsy and definitive management, because delayed diagnosis worsens outcomes in foot tumors [^a4b4ae85] [^4b2c3e7e].

> But wait, what if the patient has diabetes or neuropathy and the "bump" reflects infection or Charcot arthropathy rather than a simple mass. I should confirm that any erythema, warmth, swelling, or ulcer in a diabetic foot warrants evaluation for infection and osteomyelitis; plain radiographs are first-line, with MRI if osteomyelitis remains uncertain or if a soft tissue abscess is suspected, and probe-to-bone testing plus inflammatory markers can aid diagnosis when appropriate [^015c31bd] [^96d272bf] [^95cfd027]. In acute Charcot, radiographs may be normal early; MRI can show bone marrow edema and subchondral fractures, and urgent off-loading is critical to prevent deformity and ulceration, so I should not delay immobilization while waiting for advanced imaging if clinical suspicion is high [^187c66b0] [^0e9386ae].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic algorithm to ensure it is practical and safe. Start with history and physical to classify the mass as cystic, bony, solid soft tissue, or inflammatory, and screen for red flags. If cystic and uncomplicated, proceed to ultrasound; if bony or periarticular, obtain radiographs; if solid, indeterminate, or concerning for malignancy, obtain MRI and consider referral. In patients with diabetes or neuropathy, prioritize infection and Charcot with clinical assessment, radiographs, and MRI or targeted imaging as indicated, and escalate care promptly if systemic signs or ulcer are present [^a4b4ae85] [^015c31bd] [^96d272bf].

> In summary, I need to ensure the evaluation remains systematic and reference-based. Most dorsal foot "hard bumps" are benign ganglion cysts, bony exostoses, or accessory ossicles, but I must actively exclude infection, Charcot arthropathy, and malignancy when red flags are present. Ultrasound and radiographs are the cornerstones of initial imaging, with MRI reserved for indeterminate or complex cases, and management should be tailored to diagnosis, symptoms, and patient risk, including timely referral for biopsy when malignancy is suspected [^a4b4ae85] [^f3522548] [^4b2c3e7e].

A hard bump on the top of the foot is most often a **ganglion cyst** or a **bony prominence** (exostosis/accessory ossicle) [^d2a4ba78] [^5b91820c], but the differential includes lipoma, neuroma, gouty tophus, infection, or, rarely, malignancy [^a4b4ae85] [^4b2c3e7e]. Start with a focused history and exam, then use **ultrasound** to distinguish cystic from solid lesions and **plain radiographs** to assess bony involvement [^46d7b30e]. Most benign lesions are managed conservatively; persistent, painful, or growing masses warrant MRI and possible biopsy or excision [^f3522548] [^a4b4ae85].

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize onset and duration (acute vs chronic), and assess for trauma or repetitive microtrauma. Review pain characteristics — including location, quality, and aggravating factors such as shoes or activity — and screen for systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night pain). Document medical history, including diabetes, gout, RA, and malignancy, and review medications and allergies.

---

### Physical examination

Assess location, size, shape, consistency, mobility, and tenderness, and inspect for erythema, warmth, fluctuance, and skin changes. Evaluate gait and footwear for mechanical contributors, and perform a neurovascular exam with distal pulses and sensation.

---

## Diagnostic imaging

### Ultrasound

Ultrasound is **first-line** to distinguish cystic from solid lesions and to characterize ganglia, lipomas, and vascular malformations [^notfound]. It is noninvasive, dynamic, and does not involve radiation.

---

### Plain radiographs

Obtain radiographs to assess bony involvement — such as exostosis, accessory ossicles, or fractures — and to evaluate for calcifications or periosteal reaction [^46d7b30e].

---

### MRI

MRI is indicated for **indeterminate or complex masses**, suspected malignancy, or preoperative planning; it provides superior soft-tissue contrast and delineates extent and neurovascular relationships [^f3522548].

---

## Management strategies

### Conservative management

Observation is appropriate for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic lesions, with patient education and reassurance. Use footwear modification (wider shoes, padding) and activity adjustment to reduce irritation. Consider aspiration with or without corticosteroid injection for symptomatic ganglia or bursae.

---

### Surgical management

Indications include persistent pain, functional impairment, cosmetic concern, or suspicion of malignancy. Options include excision (open or minimally invasive) for ganglia, lipomas, or exostoses, and biopsy with wide local excision for suspected malignancy [^a4b4ae85].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include persistent pain or functional limitation, recurrence (notably with ganglia and exostoses), and infection or wound complications after intervention. Delayed diagnosis of malignancy or infection can worsen outcomes [^4b2c3e7e].

---

## When to refer

Refer to **orthopedics or podiatry** for suspected malignancy, complex or indeterminate masses, or failure of conservative care. Refer to vascular surgery for suspected aneurysm or vascular malformation, and to infectious disease or rheumatology for suspected systemic disease.

---

A hard bump on the top of the foot is usually a ganglion cyst or bony prominence; use ultrasound and radiographs to confirm, and manage conservatively unless symptoms persist or malignancy is suspected.

### Talus avulsion fractures: are they accurately diagnosed? [^67347929]. Injury (2015). Low credibility.

Dorsal talus avulsion fractures occurring along the supination line of the foot can cause pain and discomfort. Examination of the foot and ankle using the Ottawa ankle rules does not include examination of the talus, an injury here is easily missed causing concern to the patient. This is a retrospective study carried out in a major trauma centre to look at the assessment and diagnosis of all patients with a dorsal talus and navicular avulsion fractures over a one year period. Nineteen patients with an isolated dorsal talus avulsion fracture and five patients with an isolated dorsal navicular fracture were included. The correct diagnosis was made in 12 of patients with isolated dorsal talus avulsion fractures, 7 patients were given an incorrect diagnosis after misreading of the radiograph. Four patients with a dorsal navicular avulsion fracture were given the correct diagnosis. If not correctly diagnosed on presentation patients can be overly concerned that a 'fracture was missed' which can lead to confusion and anxiety. Therefore these injuries need to be recognised early, promptly diagnosed, treated symptomatically and reassurance given. We recommend the routine palpation of the talus in addition to the examination set out in the Ottawa Ankle Rules and the close inspection of plain radiographs to adequately diagnose an injury in this area.

Other causes of heel pain (Pathway 4) — Although less common, benign and malignant tumors, infection (soft tissue and bone), and vascular compromise must be considered as etiologies of a patient's heel pain, and the potential morbidity of these conditions is substantial. Proper diagnostic testing along with consultation or referral to the appropriate specialist are paramount in these individuals. In adolescents, calcaneal apophysitis is probably the most frequent etiology of heel pain, and palliative treatment is successful in nearly all cases.

Answers:
A. X-ray of involved site to evaluate for bony involvement – Incorrect. An x-ray of the site would not be the best next step in management as it would not provide information regarding any systemic spread of this condition.
B. Evaluation of metastasis with PET-CT imaging – Correct. A PET-CT is indicated to further diagnose and stage possible metastasis.
C. Chemotherapy – Incorrect. Chemotherapy would not be the best next step in management because we are unsure if systemic treatment is indicated without first evaluating the presence of local or systemic metastases.
D. Wide-local excision – Incorrect. While a wide-local excision would be indicated to ensure the removal of the primary tumor, further imaging studies must first be conducted to evaluate for metastatic disease.
E. No additional treatment is indicated – Incorrect. Diagnosis of this rare tumor must include evaluation for metastatic disease and long-term surveillance of recurrence.

AbstractMorning Report is a time-honored tradition where physicians-in-training present cases to their colleagues and clinical experts to collaboratively examine an interesting patient presentation. The Morning Report section seeks to carry on this tradition by presenting a patient's chief concern and story, inviting the reader to develop a differential diagnosis and discover the diagnosis alongside the authors of the case. This report examines the story of a 40-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department for evaluation of chest pain and pain in the joints of her hands and feet. Using questions, physical examination, and testing, an illness script for the presentation emerges; the differential is refined until a final diagnosis is made.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^27dee316]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Assessment of the diabetic foot (Pathway 1) — the pedal manifestations of diabetes are well documented and potentially limb-threatening when left untreated, and the evaluation of the diabetic foot involves careful assimilation of the patient's history and physical findings with the results of necessary diagnostic procedures. Screening tools may be valuable in evaluating the patient and determining risk level, early detection of foot pathology, especially in high-risk patients, can lead to earlier intervention and thereby reduce the potential for hospitalization and amputation, and identification of abnormal historical and/or physical findings can therefore improve the prognosis for a favorable outcome through appropriate — and early — referral. A thorough medical and foot history must be obtained from the patient, and all patients with diabetes require a pedal inspection whenever they present to any health care practitioner.

### Intravascular endothelial hyperplasia of the foot [^46895bea]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Intravascular endothelial hyperplasia is a benign soft tissue mass rarely reported in the foot. Advanced imaging and confirming a benign diagnosis are critical for any soft tissue mass. This paper identifies 2 patients that developed intravascular endothelial hyperplasia tumors which required surgical excision. A 17-year-old male patient presented to clinic complaining of a painful bump to the arch of his right foot which he related to an injury 9 months prior. Magnetic resonance imaging of the right foot revealed a mass within the plantar subcutaneous fat that was serpiginous in nature similar to adjacent branching vessels favoring a low-flow vascular malformation. A 38-year-old female with Multiple Sclerosis presented with complaints of persistent symptoms of pain to the 1 st interspace, difficult ambulation and neuritis. Ultrasound and MRI observed solid, multilobulated mass, with internal vascular malformation, MRI describing intrinsic involvement along the abductor musculature and flexor tendons. Both lesions were surgically excised and sent for pathology. Pathology report indicated a diagnosis of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia or Masson's tumor in both cases. Pathology diagnosis of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia is generally good with wide resection leading to low recurrence rates. Both patients in the current study have progressed postoperatively with resolution of symptoms and without recurrence.

Question 3

IWGDF guidelines recommend to diagnose a STI in diabetic foot clinically, based on the presence of local or systemic inflammatory signs and symptoms, and to classify the severity of the infection according to the ulcer depth, the extent of spread of cellulitis from the ulcer, and the presence of systemic signs (inflammatory response). Whilst mild infections may be treated with oral (and perhaps topical) antimicrobial therapy, some moderate and all severe infections require urgent interventions, generally including intravenous antibiotic therapy, surgical debridement and patient stabilization. The decision to perform a surgical debridement is based on the clinical presentation, but sometimes it is not possible to estimate either the severity of the infection or the extent of tissue involvement. Therefore, we need to know the following:

3a: What kind of imaging modality is recommended in patients with an ulcer located at fore-/mid-foot complicated by a severe or moderate infection before performing a surgical debridement of the infected tissue?
3b: Which imaging modality is recommended if the infected ulcer is located in the hind-foot?

Reply to question 3

3a: Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can lead to successful healing of diabetic foot ulcers, reducing the need for surgery. Although the diagnosis of STI is usually achievable by clinical examination, imaging may be sometimes useful to assess the extent of the process. Nevertheless, some imaging modalities may fail in differentiating between sterile inflammation and infection.

Plain X-rays are not optimal for detecting soft tissue abnormalities, but a recent retrospective study on 62 diabetic patients reported that the most frequent primary location of soft tissue emphysema, detectable with X-rays, was the forefoot (61.3%), followed by the mid-foot (21.0%) and hind-foot (16.1%). The soft tissue emphysema was most frequently observed in the dorsal foot tissue (49.2%), followed by both dorsal and plantar tissue (27.4%), and the plantar foot tissue (24.2%). X-rays findings showed a good correlation with CT findings, treatment outcome and microbiology.

### Foot bumps: now you see them, now you don't… [^652ecdf0]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

An otherwise healthy 14-year-old girl presented to her family physician with visible growths on the plantar and lateral aspect of both feet. She was especially puzzled because the lesions disappeared in a non–weight-bearing state. Comments from family and classmates, who spoke of the prominence of the lesions, heightened her concern and prompted her visit. The condition was otherwise asymptomatic and she acknowledged that they had been present for several years. Question Discussion The answer is D: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Piezogenic pedal papules usually reflect a benign condition consisting of normal fat tissue that has extruded through the dermis. The papules usually appear on the plantar aspect of the foot and heel and are more marked on the medial aspect; they may also occur near the wrist and lateral borders of the hand. They are visible only when the patient is weight bearing and immediately disappear in a non–weight-bearing posture.

Occasionally, the papules will be painful. This has been attributed to ischemia of the herniated fatty tissue caused by compressive compromise of its blood supply. Piezogenic papules are most commonly diagnosed in otherwise healthy patients. 1 Usually, they are not suggestive of systemic diseases. Because they are typically painless, they may go unrecognized. They only impair musculoskeletal function if they cause pain from focal ischemic effects, but ulceration does not occur. Sometimes the papules may be familial. 2 Rarely, they may be associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This patient, however, did not demonstrate hyperlaxity of joints, hyperelasticity of skin, easy bruising, or atrophic skin changes typically seen in Ehlers-Danlos patients. Additionally, no family members reported a history of the syndrome. Treatment of the papules is usually unnecessary unless they cause pain. Therapeutic measures include use of heel pads and avoidance of prolonged standing.

If these interventions fail, excision of the papules can be performed, but this is rarely necessary. Obesity, per se, is not associated with piezogenic pedal papules, and most patients with piezogenic papules are otherwise healthy. Tophi are collections of solid urate that deposit in connective tissues in patients with gout. Common locations include the external ear, foot, hand, prepatellar bursa, and olecranon region. Their appearance also remains unchanged in the non–weight-bearing state.

### Controversies in the management of active Charcot neuroarthropathy [^a5732bd3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This article has demonstrated the controversies around the diagnosis, assessment, and management of CN. These variations have arisen in the absence of a lack of robust evidence to guide healthcare professionals to diagnose, monitor and treat CN. Current guidance is primarily based on low-quality studies: level III evidence (case control studies) and level IV evidence (expert opinion) rather than high-quality meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (level I evidence). In the absence of definitive evidence to resolve variability between the approaches to management there is likely to be continued variatons in the reported time to healing and frequency of CN-related complications.

Given the rarity of CN and the challenges for making a diagnosis based on clinical examination and radiological imaging, there is a strong case for considering what other opportunities may exist to help screen for and diagnose CN.

To meaningfully compare outcome data, studies need to accurately describe the population at baseline and have access to agreed standard definitions for diagnosis, remission and relapse.

There is a lack of evidence about the sensitivity, specificity, cost-effectiveness, safety and patient acceptability for techniques used to diagnosis and monitor CN. Furthermore, uncertainty continues about how monitoring techniques relate to treatment outcomes.

The main treatment for CN is conservative, with the use of a nonremovable cast or boot. It appears that the reported treatment times for CN vary, for not entirely clear reasons. Currently there is a lack of evidence to support the use of pharmacological therapies to treat CN, and surgery is primarily reserved for when conservative treatment has failed.

Given this lack of evidence to support the treatment and management of CN national and international health and care organisations and experts have identified CN as a research priority. In 2009 the US National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Office of Rare Diseases of the National Institutes of Health highlighted the need for a coordinated international approach to research into the pathophysiology, and management of CN. While acknowledging the complexities of developing a randomised controlled trial, a review paper from the Lancet in 2015 emphasised the need for further research into CN including diagnosis, management, outcomes, and the impact on people's health-related quality of life. In the UK, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, 'Diabetic foot problem: prevention and management', have also included research into CN among its top five research priorities for the diabetic foot.

### Soft tissue masses: evaluation and treatment… [^a4b4ae85]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

and eccentric calcifications with variable vascularity 47 MRI: well-demarcated mass, isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images 47 Extrinsic bone erosion in 11% to 20% of cases|Diagnosis can be delayed because of slow growth Referral to orthopedic oncology for core needle biopsy and resection|. 16, 23 Presentation in children is often varied and nonspecific, and lesions can grow rapidly during periods of weight gain. 50 Patients who have family members with multiple lipomas may have a genetic condition called familial multiple lipomatosis, which presents with multiple benign lipomas on the extremities or trunk. 23 Because some lipomas are deep to the fascia, they can be larger than what is felt on palpation. BAKER CYST 73These cysts can be more pronounced during a flare-up of knee arthritis. They may be found incidentally on MRI or ultrasonography.

Treatment includes monitoring, aspiration, corticosteroid injection, aspiration with ultrasound-guided fenestration of cyst walls, and arthroscopic cystectomy.
73. PLANTAR FIBROMA are nodular masses arising in the plantar aponeurosis of the foot. They are the second most common type of soft tissue mass in the foot and ankle after ganglion cysts. 35Although the etiology is unclear, past trauma to the foot, Dupuytren contracture, Peyronie disease, and family history increase the risk of plantar fibroma. 35, 74 Patients often present with a painful nodular lesion in the midsubstance or superficial aspect of the plantar fascia that is worsened with walking or standing. Plantar fibromas are bilateral in 20% to 50% of cases. 35 Examination may reveal a focal thickening along the plantar fascia or a palpable nodule. 36 On ultrasonography, plantar fibromas appear as fusiform nodules that are hypoechoic to isoechoic without intrinsic vascularity. 5, 36.

Treatment rarely requires excision, and many plantar fibromas can be managed conservatively with shoe padding or modifications. Corticosteroid injections can relieve pain and decrease the size of the fibroma. 36, 72 If orthotics and intralesional corticosteroid injections are ineffective, a subtotal fasciectomy with wide excision can be considered. 36.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^901a5cd0]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Acute Charcot arthropathy — clinical diagnosis relies on characteristic unilateral inflammatory changes in an insensate foot, frequent pain despite neuropathy, and awareness of ulceration that can mimic osteomyelitis. The initial diagnosis is often clinical, based on profound unilateral swelling, increased skin temperature, erythema, joint effusion, and bone resorption in an insensate foot; these characteristics in the presence of intact skin are often pathognomonic of acute neuroarthropathy. In more than 75% of cases, the patient will present with some degree of pain in an otherwise insensate extremity, and diagnosis can be complicated when patients first present with a concomitant ulceration, raising questions of potential contiguous osteomyelitis.

### Charcot foot: the diagnostic dilemma [^0e9386ae]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians involved in the management of patients with diabetes are likely to encounter the diagnostic and treatment challenges of pedal neuropathic joint disease, also known as Charcot foot. The acute Charcot foot is characterized by erythema, edema and elevated temperature of the foot that can clinically mimic cellulitis or gout. Plain film radiographic findings can be normal in the acute phase of Charcot foot. A diagnosis of Charcot syndrome should be considered in any neuropathic patient, even those with a minor increase of heat and swelling of the foot or ankle, especially after any injury. Early recognition of Charcot syndrome and immobilization (often with a total contact cast), even in the presence of normal radiographs, can minimize potential foot deformity, ulceration and loss of function. Orthopedic or podiatric foot and ankle specialists should be consulted when the disease process does not respond to treatment.

### Thyroid dermopathy treatment of the foot in the setting of Grave's hyperthyroidism [^becafbd6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Graves' hyperthyroidism is one of the most common autoimmune diseases, caused by autoantibodies acting against the thyrotropin receptor. Extra-thyroid manifestations include ophthalmopathy, acropachy, and dermopathy, which accounts for 4% to 13% of clinical presentations. This is a case study of a 55-year-old female who presented with recurrent soft tissue mass formation over the dorsal right foot. The patient underwent a soft tissue mass excisional biopsy and the pathology report revealed a soft tissue mass secondary to thyroid dermopathy. Given her history of soft tissue recurrence and previous diagnosis, the patient underwent both excisional biopsy and radiation treatment with success. After 1 year of follow-up, the patient had completely healed without complication. This case demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach for clinical diagnosis and treatment.

### How to use clinical signs and symptoms to estimate the probability of limb ischaemia in patients with a diabetic foot ulcer [^bfe84bc3]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Assessment of ischaemia and interventions to improve perfusion are key elements in the management of the diabetic foot ulcer to achieve wound healing. This article will review, analyse and interpret the value of clinical information in determining the likelihood of limb ischaemia and thereby the need for referral to a vascular specialist. I conducted an historical review of the genesis of several currently recommended clinical signs and their diagnostic properties in the assessment of limb ischaemia. Changes in limb ischaemia probability based on such results were calculated using Bayes theorem, and the use of such probabilities is discussed in the context of the threshold approach to clinical decision making. Some clinical signs have negligible value in altering probability of limb ischaemia, possibly because they were advocated by Buerger for the diagnosis of thromboangiitis obliterans, an occlusive vascular disease of a different pathophysiology than atherosclerosis. Pedal pulse palpation, the most widely studied clinical sign, will marginally change a pre-test probability of ischaemia of 50% to 76% if positive (abnormal pulses) and to 36% if negative (normal pulses). Higher or lower pre-test probabilities of ischaemia will change the post-test probabilities such that these are too low or high to rule in or rule out ischaemia, respectively. Individual clinical signs convey little information regarding the presence of limb ischaemia but may have some value in combination or with pre-test probability near 50% in the assessment of ischaemia and the decision to refer for a vascular consultation.

### Diagnostic imaging of the diabetic foot: an EANM evidence-based guidance [^2c58d0f0]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2024). Medium credibility.

Overall, as stated before for OM, a clear superiority of one of these three imaging modalities in detecting STI in different foot locations did not emerge, to reach definite conclusions.

Question 4

Foot ulcers may complicate a CF, in both its acute and chronic stages and OM may develop. What imaging modality should be performed when there is suspicion of OM complicating a CF?

Reply to question 4

Given the progressive, destructive nature of Charcot's arthropathy, a delay in the diagnosis can result in the progression of deformity, increasing the risk of ulceration, often followed by superimposed infection, potentially leading to amputation. The most common anatomic site affected by Charcot is the mid-foot and, in particular, the metatarso-cuneiform and naviculo-cuneiform joints (type I arthropathy).

Because there is no definitive single method to consistently differentiate Charcot arthropathy from OM, a combination of physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging has to be used to guide diagnosis, and thereby treatment.

The accuracy of X-rays in differentiating OM from Charcot arthropathy is approximately 50 to 60%, when demineralization, periosteal reaction, cortical destruction and/or periosteal new bone formation are present. However, these findings may not appear until 2 to 3 weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms, as they require the loss of 40% to 50% of bone mass to be detectable. Although recently Mens et al. proposed the use of dual-energy CT (DECT) to quantify the presence of bone marrow edema in patients with ulcers and suspected OM, as alternative to MRI, there is no relevant literature to support the use of CT in these patients, unless surgical reconstruction is planned.

### Diagnosis of heel pain [^c76b8d88]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common presenting symptom in ambulatory clinics. There are many causes, but a mechanical etiology is most common. Location of pain can be a guide to the proper diagnosis. The most common diagnosis is plantar fasciitis, a condition that leads to medial plantar heel pain, especially with the first weight-bearing steps in the morning and after long periods of rest. Other causes of plantar heel pain include calcaneal stress fracture (progressively worsening pain following an increase in activity level or change to a harder walking surface), nerve entrapment (pain accompanied by burning, tingling, or numbness), heel pad syndrome (deep, bruise-like pain in the middle of the heel), neuromas, and plantar warts. Achilles tendinopathy is a common condition that causes posterior heel pain. Other tendinopathies demonstrate pain localized to the insertion site of the affected tendon. Posterior heel pain can also be attributed to a Haglund deformity, a prominence of the calcaneus that may cause bursa inflammation between the calcaneus and Achilles tendon, or to Sever disease, a calcaneal apophysitis in children. Medial midfoot heel pain, particularly with continued weight bearing, may be due to tarsal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve as it courses through the flexor retinaculum, medial calcaneus, posterior talus, and medial malleolus. Sinus tarsi syndrome occurs in the space between the calcaneus, talus, and talocalcaneonavicular and subtalar joints. The syndrome manifests as lateral midfoot heel pain. Differentiating among causes of heel pain can be accomplished through a patient history and physical examination, with appropriate imaging studies, if indicated.

Mountaineers are at risk of skin lesions caused by constant boot friction. This is the case of a 35 year old mountaineer who presented with large and deeply ulcerated lesions over the medial aspects of both heels after a two and a half day climb using crampons. A number of factors such as the length of the climb in cold and thin air and the impossibility of removal of the footwear to allow rapid rewarming may have contributed to a more acute presentation of these lesions.

### The AIUM practice parameter for the performance of the musculoskeletal ultrasound examination [^8d5039f3]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Interdigital foot ultrasound — patient positioning, scanning technique, and dynamic maneuvers are outlined: The patient is supine with the foot dorsiflexed 90° to the ankle, and either a dorsal or plantar approach can be used. The transducer is placed longitudinally on the plantar aspect of the first interdigital space, and the examiner applies digital pressure on the dorsal surface, then the transducer is moved laterally with its center at the level of the metatarsal heads, and the technique is repeated for the remaining interspaces and then repeated in the transverse plane. When a Morton's neuroma is clinically suspected, pressure can be applied to reproduce the patient's symptoms, and manual medial and lateral compression of the forefoot with plantar imaging transverse to the metatarsals (Mulder's maneuver) will often displace a neuroma in a plantar direction along with a palpable click, improving visibility. The intermetatarsal bursa lies on the dorsal aspect of the intermetatarsal nerve, so care must be taken to correctly identify a neuroma and differentiate it from the bursa, which typically thins with compression.

Dupuytren's Disease Symptoms and Family History

Table 4 presents the weighted estimates of the disease symptoms among the Dupuytren's patients (definition 4). The most commonly reported symptom at the time of the survey was a hard bump on one or both hands (69%), followed by dimpling in one hand (30%) and a ropelike growth (cord) in one hand (23%, Table 4). More than one third of Dupuytren's patients indicated that their fingers were bent to the extent that it interfered with everyday activities, such as picking up items, putting on gloves, buttoning a shirt, or washing hands or face (data not shown in table).

Table 4
Summary of current Dupuytren's disease symptoms among Dupuytren's patients

Percents are weighted averages of the stratum-specific estimates

The first hand symptom noticed was most commonly a bump or a knot that had developed on the palm or at the base of the fingers (61%). A substantially lower percentage of Dupuytren's patients reported that a ropelike growth was the first symptom noticed, followed by fingers bent toward the palm or dimpling (Table 4). Nearly all Dupuytren's patients (82%) indicated that the first symptom noticed appeared only in one hand.

Eighteen percent of Dupuytren's patients reported that an immediate family member had one or more symptoms consistent with Dupuytren's: hard bump (10%), bent fingers (9%), dimpling (5%), and a ropelike growth (5%). Only 3% of patients indicated that an immediate family member had a diagnosis of Dupuytren's disease, Dupuytren's contracture, or palmar fibromatosis.

Os supranaviculare

The os supranaviculare is also known as the os talonaviculares dorsalis, talonavicular ossicle, or Pirie's bone. It can be found in the dorsal aspect of the talonavicular joint.

This is a rare os, with a prevalence that has been estimated as 1%, and usually asymptomatic. In some cases, it is fused with the navicular, to form a spur that has no clinical significance (Fig. 6).

Fig. 6
Os supranaviculare. Example of an incidental finding of an os supranaviculare (arrowhead) on a 39-year-old woman, referred with the suspicion of sesamoiditis

Differential diagnosis has to be established with avulsion fractures of the capsule of the talonavicular joint, which happen typically in middle-aged women and are related to the use of high heels. Fractures of the capsule may associate fractures in the dorsal aspect of the talar head, which may help in the differential. History of trauma and development of pain and swelling in the region, and a more linear morphology favors fracture over ossicle (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7

The differential diagnosis has to be established with an avulsion fracture of the talo navicular joint capsule, as seen in this lateral radiograph (white arrow). Note the mild swelling of the soft tissues associated and the more linear configuration of the fragment, compared to the more triangular shape of the ossicle. Incidental note os peroneum (curved black arrow)

### Foot tumors: diagnosis and treatment [^4b2c3e7e]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2004). Low credibility.

Several large clinical series have demonstrated that benign and malignant tumors occur in the foot and ankle at a much higher rate than previously thought. Vigilance is warranted in investigating any foot mass, including those with an apparently indolent course. Although tumors in the foot tend to produce symptoms relatively early because of the foot's compact structure, many tumors are initially misdiagnosed. Given the comparatively small size of the anatomic compartments in the foot, tumors often present outside the original compartment, making timely diagnosis essential. Major treatment errors can be avoided if physicians consider the potential for malignancy when evaluating all foot masses. A high index of suspicion, an organized approach to diagnosis, and evaluation of and adherence to the basic principles of treatment of musculoskeletal neoplasms increase the likelihood of acceptable results.

### American association of clinical endocrinology clinical practice guideline: developing a diabetes mellitus comprehensive care plan-2022 update [^cf6287aa]. Endocrine Practice (2022). High credibility.

Diabetic neuropathy — diagnosis, screening, and management in diabetes mellitus are outlined as follows: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a clinical diagnosis, and a comprehensive differential diagnosis should be considered to rule out nondiabetic neuropathies. Screening for DPN should be done at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), within 5 y of the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes (T1D), and subsequently annually and whenever symptoms occur, by clinical history and physical exam. Assessments for DPN should include a careful history of target symptoms and a combination of at least two tests: vibration sensation using a 128-Hz tuning fork, pinprick sensation, temperature discrimination, 10-g monofilament testing on the dorsal aspect of the great toe bilaterally, and ankle reflexes, following the typical DPN pattern starting distally on the hallux and moving proximally until a sensory threshold is identified. Screening for cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy (CAN) should be considered at diagnosis of T2D and at 5 y after the diagnosis of T1D (including youth), and also in the presence of DPN, CKD, 2 or more CVD risk factors, hypoglycemia unawareness, high glucose variability, heart failure, perioperatively, or with autonomic symptoms, with a careful differential to exclude mimics. CV reflex tests (deep breathing, Valsalva, supine to standing) remain the gold standard and are recommended for CAN; indices of heart rate variability from electrocardiogram recordings could be used as an earlier screening alternative. Diabetic foot exams should be performed at every visit (in person or virtual) to identify deformities and those at risk for ulcerations and amputations. Intensive glucose control applied as early as possible is recommended to prevent the onset of DPN and CAN in T1D; achieving optimal control of glucose, blood pressure, and lipids along with lifestyle interventions (including weight loss and exercise) are recommended to prevent DPN and CAN in T2D, and lifestyle interventions are effective for prevention in prediabetes/metabolic syndrome. For painful DPN, pregabalin, duloxetine, and capsaicin 8% patch are recommended, with evidence that these agents reach 30% to 50% reduction in pain in many individuals; gabapentin and some tricyclic antidepressants may also be as effective, and combination or switching among classes may provide greater benefits than maximizing a single agent. The use of opioids, including tramadol or tapentadol, is NOT RECOMMENDED due to risk; in refractory painful DPN, spinal cord stimulation with nonpharmacological approaches should be considered.

Criteria for selecting studies

Type of studies

Published RCTs evaluating the efficacy or effectiveness of any intervention for PHP were considered for inclusion. No language restrictions were imposed. All other designs including quasi-experimental studies, letters to the editor, opinion pieces, editorials and conference abstracts were considered ineligible.

Characteristics of participants

An RCT was included if the participants were clinically diagnosed with PHP with explicit reference to pain on the underside of the heel that was most noticeable on weight-bearing after periods of rest but also worse following prolonged weight bearing. All participants were over the age of 16 years and had experienced symptoms of any duration. RCTs were excluded if participants' PHP was related to fractures, tumours or infections or confounded by other conditions that might be rheumatological, neural, vascular or dermatological in origin.

Types of interventions

Any RCT that investigated the effectiveness or efficacy of an intervention compared with another intervention, placebo, sham or wait and see was included, provided there was a follow-up of at least 2 weeks.

Outcome measures

Studies that reported at least one of the three outcome measures — patient-reported pain, first step pain or foot-related function — were included. Where multiple methods of quantifying the same outcome were reported, the author's main prespecified outcome metric was accepted, or that of the metric with the lower level of effect. This was done to avoid making recommendations based on type 1 error with the rationale that an intervention which results in a meaningful effect size for a given outcome should be consistent irrespective of the measure used.

Short term was defined as 1 week to 3 months, medium term as > 3 and up to 6 months and long term as > 6 months. Where multiple follow-ups within a time window were reported, the outcome at the latest time point within short and medium term, and closest to 1 year for long term was selected.

A 55-year-old man with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes with microvascular and macrovascular complications presented with a 1-week history of painful erythematous swelling on the dorsum of the left foot with two areas of foot ulceration. Inflammatory markers were raised. MRI of the left foot revealed a soft tissue swelling on the dorsum of the left foot, marrow oedema and destruction of several small joints of the foot, indicating osteomyelitis and Charcot neuroarthropathy (CN). The soft tissue swelling on the dorsum of the left foot was debrided; per-operatively bone destruction of base of the fifth metatarsal was found. The patient received intravenous antibiotics for 6 weeks. The clinical features of CN including erythema, oedema and elevated temperature of the left foot settled with off-loading the foot in an air cast walker after 6 months. Our case highlights the need to recognise CN in an acutely inflamed foot of diabetic patients with neuropathy, even when other conditions like soft tissue infection and osteomyelitis can explain the clinical features.

### Assessment of the pediatric foot mass [^dd2b174f]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Masses in the pediatric foot are relatively uncommon and can present a diagnostic challenge. The literature lacks a comprehensive overview of these types of lesions. Most are benign soft-tissue lesions that can be diagnosed on the basis of history and physical examination. However, some rare malignant neoplasms can mimic benign masses. It is imperative to recognize these lesions because the consequences of a delayed or missed diagnosis can be substantial. A thorough history and physical examination of all pediatric patients with foot lesions are crucial to ensure that any lesion not readily identified as benign is appropriately managed.

### Diagnosing common benign skin tumors… [^dc9daeaa]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

9 Lipomas must be clinically differentiated from other tumors. The primary differential diagnosis in a subcutaneous mass is a sebaceous cyst or abscess. Lipomas are soft, flesh-colored nodules that are easily moveable under the overlying skin. Sebaceous cysts are generally identifiable by a central punctum, and abscesses can be identified by the presence of warmth, redness, and pain. Ultrasonography is increasingly used to aid in the diagnosis of lipomas. High-frequency ultrasonography can provide high-resolution images of subcutaneous tumors and surrounding structures. Dermatofibromas Dermatofibromas result from idiopathic benign proliferation of fibroblasts. Generally located on the lower extremities, they may develop at any cutaneous site and range in size from 3 to 10 mm. They are four times more common in women, and most develop between 20 and 50 years of age. They are usually asymptomatic, although pruritus and tenderness can be present.

19 Diagnosis is based on the appearance of firm, raised, papules or nodules, ranging from tan to reddish brown. They tend to be darker at the center and fade to normal skin color at the margin. Dermatofibromas exhibit dimpling or retraction of the lesion beneath the skin with lateral compression. 20 No treatment is required unless there is a change in size or color, or bleeding or irritation from trauma. A 2012 study found that 73% of patients who underwent laser ablation reported satisfaction with the results.
21. Spontaneous inflammation and rupture can occur, with significant involvement of surrounding tissue. There is no way to predict which lesions will remain quiescent or become larger or inflamed. Infected cysts tend to be larger, more erythematous, and more painful than sterile inflamed cysts. 22 Diagnosis of epidermal inclusion cysts is based on appearance and palpation of a discrete, freely movable cyst or nodule.

Careful inspection often reveals a central punctum. Treatment is unnecessary unless desired by the patient, and can be accomplished via simple excision with removal of the cyst and cyst wall. Inflamed or ruptured cysts often resolve spontaneously without therapy, although they tend to recur. Intralesional steroid injections can hasten resolution of inflamed cysts and should be followed by interval excision. 23.

Plain X-ray for suspected bone infection in diabetes-related foot infection: Any patient with a possible bone infection should initially have plain X-rays of the foot. Interpreted by an experienced reader, characteristic findings of bone infection are highly suggestive of osteomyelitis, but similar abnormal findings can be caused by Charcot osteoarthropathy and other disorders. As plain X-rays are relatively inexpensive, widely available, and cause minimal harm, we recommend them as part of the routine assessment of patients presenting with a DFI. Because plain X-rays are insensitive to acute osteomyelitis, it is often useful to repeat a normal examination in 2–3 weeks when the suspicion of osteomyelitis is still high.

### Pseudoaneurysm of the dorsalis pedis artery: case report and literature review [^42590c69]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms of the dorsalis pedis artery are rare vascular entities usually caused by traumatic injury or iatrogenic intervention, producing a focal soft pulsatile tissue mass in the dorsal foot. Gradual expansion of the fibrous capsule can produce secondary physical signs through the pressure exerted on surrounding structures. We report the case of a 57-year-old male with an idiopathic pseudoaneurysm of the dorsalis pedis artery. A focused history found a low-grade blunt trauma to the dorsal foot that had occurred 2 years previously. The diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm was confirmed by ultrasound examinations and computed tomography angiograms. The pseudoaneurysm was treated with resection, and a short reversed great saphenous vein interposition graft was placed. He recovered well after surgery and remained free of symptoms 18 months postoperatively. The literature review of this uncommon vascular pathologic entity and the diagnosis and management are discussed.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^ebdeb999]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot disorders — mechanisms of injury emphasize that soft tissue alterations can shift plantar pressures and, together with neuropathy, contribute to ulceration, and that shoe-related low-pressure trauma over bony prominences is a leading precipitant; soft tissue changes include increased plantar fascia thickness with limited hallux dorsiflexion, decreased plantar soft tissue thickness, skin hardness/stiffness, and callus propensity, are presumably due to glycosylation of collagen, enhance plantar pressures in gait, and in the presence of neuropathy can be implicated in ulceration, while the first common mechanism of injury is prolonged low pressure over a bony prominence (bunion or hammertoe), causing wounds over the medial, lateral, and dorsal forefoot, associated with tight or ill-fitting shoes, and shoe trauma with loss of protective sensation and foot deformity is described as the leading event precipitating foot ulceration in persons with diabetes.

### Chronic madura foot: mycetoma and / orspp or actinomycosis [^9234a7b3]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 58-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of soft tissue swelling (approximately 9 cm in diameter) on the plantar aspect of his left foot (figure 1). The patient was a farmer who worked in a remote area in the Western province of Saudi Arabia. According to the patient, the swelling had gradually increased in size over a few years, but it was painless and thus had not restricted him from continuing to farm his land for the best part prior to presenting for an opinion. As the sole income earner for his family, the reason for now seeking medical advice was owing to the inability to continue farming his land due to the large size of the lesion restricting him from mobilising normally and not being able to wear any types of shoes/sandals. The patient was a poor historian regarding his medical history and rarely sought medical advice. Further questioning, however, revealed that he had type 2 diabetes (no known duration) and penicillin allergy. The patient could not recall a 'starting event' or episode of trauma associated to the mass, and his estimation of the duration of the mass at 2 years was speculative at best.

Figure 1
(A) A large soft tissue mass on the plantar aspect of the foot from anterior to posterior. (B) A lateral view of the soft tissue mass demonstrates the extent of the growth which limited the patient's mobility.

On examination of the mass, it was painless, firm, with no fluctuance. The patient was afebrile with no clinical signs of infection (erythema, heat, purulence). There were no lymphatic streaks or palpable inguinal adenopathy. The mass extended from the plantar aspect of the foot, extending dorsally between the third and fourth toe webspaces. On the plantar aspect of the mass were areas of small crusted lesions that sporadically discharged fliud were reported by the patient.

A diabetes foot screen was performed, and this identified that peripheral pulses were present and handheld Doppler (ArjoHuntleigh Dopplex SD2 bi-directional Doppler with 8MHz probe) identified biphasic, strong waveforms. A neurological examination using the Modified Neuropathic Disability Score (10/10) revealed loss of protective sensation. This finding likely explained the lack of pain associated to the mass and ability to continue weight bearing pain-free for an extended period of time.

### Common foot fractures [^4de6b5db]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Foot fractures account for about one-third of lower extremity fractures in adults. They are typically caused by a crush injury or an axial or twisting force on the foot. Patients usually present with bony point tenderness and swelling of the affected area. Weight-bearing varies based on the extent of the fracture and the patient's pain tolerance. When a foot or toe fracture is suspected, anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained. The Ottawa foot and ankle rules can help determine the need for radiography after an acute ankle inversion injury. Many foot fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot or a hard-soled shoe. Weight-bearing and duration of immobilization are based on the stability of the fracture and the patient's pain level. Most toe fractures can be managed nonsurgically with a hard-soled shoe for two to six weeks. Close attention should be paid to the great toe because of its role in weight-bearing, and physicians should follow specific guidelines for orthopedic referral. Meta-tarsal shaft fractures are managed with a boot or hard-soled shoe for three to six weeks. The proximal aspect of the fifth metatarsal has varied rates of healing due to poor blood supply, and management is based on the fracture zone. Lis-franc fractures are often overlooked; radiography with weight-bearing should be obtained, and physicians should look for widening of the tarsometatarsal joint. Other tarsal bone fractures can be managed with a short leg cast or boot for four to six weeks when nonsurgical treatment is indicated. Common foot fracture complications include arthritis, infection, malunion or nonunion, and compartment syndrome.

### Giant dorsal lipofibromatosis in an infant: a case report [^c501b8a9]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Lipofibromatosis is a rare, benign, soft tissue tumor that develops mainly in children and is congenital in approximately one-fifth of cases. It was first proposed by Fetsch in 2000. The lesions usually develop under the skin or in the soft tissues of the extremities, typically in the hands or feet, and the most common presentation is a slowly growing, mildly painful mass. Complete surgical resection, the preferred treatment option, may result in local recurrence, and no distant metastases have been reported. As the disease is relatively rare, it is prone to misdiagnosis. This is a report of an atypical case of lipofibromatosis in which the diagnosis was confirmed only after detection by various modalities such as pathology, immunohistochemistry, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^1776a267]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Osteomyelitis in diabetic foot — diagnosis and management emphasize confirmatory testing, surgical debridement when indicated, and cautious use of local antibiotics. A diagnosis of osteomyelitis requires that both culture and biopsy studies reveal positive findings; resection of infected bone with or without local amputation and concurrent antimicrobial therapy is the most optimal management, though the routine need for surgery has recently been questioned and in some cases medical therapy alone might be warranted. If the affected bone has been completely resected or amputated, the infection may be treated as a soft tissue infection; however, if residual bone is present, the patient will likely require 4 to 8 weeks of antibiotic therapy. Antibiotic impregnated bone cement has been advocated but should only be used if the bone has been thoroughly debrided and the soft tissue envelope is adequate for wound closure, and it is generally recommended that antibiotic beads be removed 2 weeks after placement; gentamycin, tobramycin, or vancomycin are typically used in the beads. An alternative is absorbable bone graft substitutes mixed with antibiotic powder, but studies are lacking as to the efficacy of either modality compared with systemic antimicrobial therapy alone, and if the infection fails to respond to therapy, the patient should be fully reassessed.

### Unilateral perniosis (chilblains) following hip arthroplasty [^50ae1b36]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

To the Editor: We read with great interest the case report by Boesjes et al describing a presentation of recurrent, unilateral perniosis (chilblains) in a woman with prior trauma and reconstructive surgery to the affected site. Among the few documented cases of unilateral disease, one important similarity stands out — preceding neurological damage. This finding led Boesjes et al to propose a neurogenic component in disease pathogenesis. We report a case of unilateral chilblains which may further support this conclusion in an otherwise healthy 28-year-old Latino man with an extensive orthopedic surgery history.

Our patient presented to the emergency department with a 10-day history of redness and perceived coldness in the lower portion of his left leg. His medical history was notable for a left hip fracture sustained in an automobile accident 1.5 years prior, which was repaired by reduction and internal fixation shortly after the time of injury. The repair was later complicated by lumbosacral plexopathy and avascular necrosis necessitating arthroplasty, which he underwent 5 weeks prior to presentation. The patient was afebrile and felt well; he denied respiratory, neurologic, and cardiac symptoms. Physical examination revealed asymmetric edema and erythema of the left leg with intact peripheral pulses and neurologic function (Fig 1, A and B). Initial differential diagnosis included thromboembolic diseases versus cutaneous small vessel vasculitis.

B, Distal portion of left foot at the time of admission, depicting nonblanching, nonpalpable purpuric macules, which were also evident on the lateral dorsal aspect. Note vesicular lesions on the base of purpura of the third toe.

On admission, computed tomography angiography and venous duplex ultrasonography failed to demonstrate occlusive disease. No valvular lesions were identified on echocardiography. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were normal, and an extractable nuclear antigen panel was negative. Serum cryoglobulins were not obtained. A punch biopsy was performed of the left foot lesions, demonstrating dense superficial and deep perivascular and lichenoid lymphocytic infiltration consistent with chilblains (Fig 2). Given the negative workup and lack of cold exposure, the patient's symptoms were felt to be most likely related to dysautonomia secondary to his prior injury and surgeries. He reported resolution of symptoms within 4 weeks with conservative management.

Introduction

Diabetes-related foot disease is a global problem. Various types of foot lesions can occur in diabetic patients, usually as a consequence of the diabetes-related peripheral neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease, or both. These two factors lead to foot ulcers that may be caused by repetitive stress, development of foot deformities, micro-traumas, areas of high pedal pressure, excessive load and imbalance. Diabetes also frequently causes various, but mostly ill-defined, immunological perturbations. These, in the setting of a break in the protective skin envelope, often lead to the development of infection in the wound. This event, especially in presence of vascular impairment (which limits the migration of phagocytic cells and delivery of antibiotic therapy) dramatically complicates the management of foot complications.

The prevalence of active foot ulcers in persons with diabetes is about 6.3%, with rates of 5.5% in Asia, Europe and Africa, and 13% in North America. Approximately a quarter of all persons with diabetes will, at some point during their lifetime, develop a foot ulcer. These ulcers are the seeding point for the development of potentially serious infectious complications, starting with soft tissue infection (STI) and in many cases spreading to underlying bone, thus causing osteomyelitis (OM).

The classical clinical symptoms used to define STI (with or without concomitant OM) are redness, warmth, swelling, pain and/or tenderness, and purulent secretions, usually in the setting of a foot wound or ulcer. The presence of various so-called "secondary" findings that should also raise suspicion of diabetic foot infection (DFI) include non-purulent secretions, friable and discoloured granulation tissue, wound undermining and foul odour. Once infection of the diabetic foot is demonstrated, the severity is further classified as mild (involving only a limited area of the superficial skin and soft tissue), moderate (more wide spread infection, either horizontally or vertically), or severe (accompanied by systemic inflammatory response signs and symptoms).

The spreading of the infection into the underlying bone is one of the most feared complications, as it is associated with high risk of lower extremity amputation, prolonged hospitalization, high social and financial costs and increased mortality rates. Whilst the prevalence of OM underlying a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer is probably underestimated, its presence is clearly associated with worse outcomes, especially when radiographic changes are present.

### A systematic guideline by the ASPN workgroup on the evidence, education, and treatment algorithm for painful diabetic neuropathy: SWEET [^bc7278e3]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

PDN continues to remain a challenging condition to manage effectively. Tailoring treatment to individual patients, considering their comorbidities and preferences, is crucial for optimizing outcomes. Additionally, a multidisciplinary approach involving collaboration between primary care physicians, endocrinologists, interventional pain specialists, podiatrists, and other healthcare professionals is essential for comprehensive PDN management.

Physical Exam

Early detection of PDN is challenging due to the insidious nature of PDN and nonspecific symptoms. Patients frequently experience symptoms such as pins and needles, shocks, numbness, a feeling of walking on sandpaper or extra socks, and burning sensations. These symptoms often worsen at night and follow a stocking-glove distribution, initially affecting the feet and toes before progressing proximally. Evaluating medical history, family history, alcohol use, and medications, along with thorough physical exam is vital for early stage PDN identification. The American Diabetes Association recommends sensory tests such as the 128 Hz tuning fork, monofilament testing, thermal testing, pinprick sensations, deep tendon reflexes, and proprioceptive testing; see Figure 1. Additionally, laboratory investigations, electrodiagnostic studies, and skin biopsies may aid diagnosis and assess disease progression.

Algorithmic approach to management of PDN.

Diagnostic Approaches

Sensory Testing

Sensory testing plays a crucial role in evaluating peripheral nerve function in PDN. The 128 Hz tuning fork is utilized to assess vibratory sensation, reflecting the integrity of large sensory nerve fibers. The absence of perceived vibratory sensation indicates sensory impairment. The 10-g Semmes Weinstein monofilament test evaluates light touch perception and is used to assess large nerve fibers. The mono filament is designed to buckle under 10 g of pressure. Various testing sites, including the plantar aspect of the toes, metatarsal heads, dorsum of the hallux, midfoot, and plantar aspect of the heel, are recommended. Because the aforementioned exams test the large nerve fibers, positive tests are usually in the irreversible late stage of the disease progression.

### Diagnosing heel pain in adults [^7f6fa270]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Heel pain is a common condition in adults that may cause significant discomfort and disability. A variety of soft tissue, osseous, and systemic disorders can cause heel pain. Narrowing the differential diagnosis begins with a history and physical examination of the lower extremity to pinpoint the anatomic origin of the heel pain. The most common cause of heel pain in adults is plantar fasciitis. Patients with plantar fasciitis report increased heel pain with their first steps in the morning or when they stand up after prolonged sitting. Tenderness at the calcaneal tuberosity usually is apparent on examination and is increased with passive dorsiflexion of the toes. Tendonitis also may cause heel pain. Achilles tendonitis is associated with posterior heel pain. Bursae adjacent to the Achilles tendon insertion may become inflamed and cause pain. Calcaneal stress fractures are more likely to occur in athletes who participate in sports that require running and jumping. Patients with plantar heel pain accompanied by tingling, burning, or numbness may have tarsal tunnel syndrome. Heel pad atrophy may present with diffuse plantar heel pain, especially in patients who are older and obese. Less common causes of heel pain, which should be considered when symptoms are prolonged or unexplained, include osteomyelitis, bony abnormalities (such as calcaneal stress fracture), or tumor. Heel pain rarely is a presenting symptom in patients with systemic illnesses, but the latter may be a factor in persons with bilateral heel pain, pain in other joints, or known inflammatory arthritis conditions.

Neurologic heel pain — definition, nerve etiologies, and referral: "Neurologic heel pain is defined as pain in the heel as a result of an entrapment or irritation of one or more of the nerves that innervate this region", and "persistent symptoms may yield neurologic-related pathology". Patients "with a history of previous heel surgery or trauma should be highly suspect for neurologic heel pain". Nerves considered include "Posterior tibial (tarsal tunnel syndrome)", "Medial calcaneal (heel neuroma)", "Medial plantar", "Lateral plantar, including branch to abductor digiti minimi", and "Sural, including lateral calcaneal". Proximal processes also apply: heel pain or sensory loss "can also be attributable to more proximal nerve impingement syndromes", and back-to-foot radiation "must be evaluated for radiculopathy secondary to proximal nerve root pathology", with "double-crush syndrome, in which concomitant proximal and distal nerve entrapments may occur simultaneously". When suspected with sensory findings and radiating pain, the text notes "appropriate referral for diagnostic studies and/or assessment by a specialist".

### Hourglass ganglion cyst of the foot: a case report [^d2a4ba78]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Ganglion cyst, a common benign soft tissue lesion, is not uncommon in the foot, with the most common location being the dorsal aspect. We describe a case where the ganglion had an unusual radiographic appearance in the form of an hourglass, extending from dorsum into the planter compartments of the foot. A 74-year-old woman presented with longstanding pain in her midfoot. Clinical examination revealed a soft tissue swelling with minimal tenderness in the first webspace of the right foot. The initial radiograph was normal. Ultrasound examination revealed a cystic swelling filled with hemorrhagic fluid with an hourglass appearance. Magnetic resonance imaging examination confirmed the cystic nature of the swelling and depicted the hourglass-shaped ganglion extending from the dorsal to plantar aspect of foot. Complete excision was possible with a combined dorsal and plantar approach. Ganglion cyst can present in the foot in locations other than the dorsum and could have extensions into the plantar aspect. This variation needs to be considered when planning surgical excision, which could be aided by preoperative magnetic resonance imaging.
