## Question

Will gram positive cocci grow in both aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether gram-positive cocci will grow in both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the metabolic categories of gram-positive cocci and which ones are facultative versus obligate anaerobes. Then, I should verify what high-quality guidelines say about blood culture bottle selection and why both aerobic and anaerobic bottles are recommended. Next, I will examine comparative studies that quantify recovery differences between bottle types. After that, I should review clinical scenarios and organism-specific data that illustrate growth in anaerobic bottles. Finally, I will synthesize a clear answer with caveats about exceptions and practical implications for collection strategy.

> Let me first confirm the organism categories. Most clinically significant gram-positive cocci are facultative anaerobes, meaning they can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, streptococci such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococci; this facultative capacity explains why they can grow in both aerobic and anaerobic bottles, albeit sometimes with different kinetics or yields [^d74a8e7d].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline stance before drawing conclusions. The 2024 IDSA/ASM guidance explicitly recommends obtaining both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles for adults because some gram-positive organisms grow better in anaerobic bottles, and anaerobic bottles also improve detection of facultative and obligate anaerobes; this is why paired sets are standard in adult practice [^d74a8e7d] [^30e9d72b].

> I will now examine comparative data to quantify the yield difference. In a large controlled comparison, pairing one aerobic and one anaerobic bottle recovered more total organisms and more gram-positive cocci than two aerobic bottles, with significantly more staphylococci detected in the anaerobic bottle; importantly, some isolates were recovered only from the anaerobic bottle, underscoring additive value rather than redundancy [^e7d0071c]. Similarly, a separate evaluation showed that Plus Anaerobic/F bottles detected more staphylococci and streptococci than Standard Anaerobic/F bottles when paired with Plus Aerobic/F, reinforcing the yield advantage of modern anaerobic media formulations [^e4c6d234].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about every gram-positive coccus behaving identically. I should confirm organism-specific nuances. Streptococcus pneumoniae and some other streptococci are repeatedly noted to grow better in anaerobic bottles, which aligns with clinical observations of earlier or exclusive detection in anaerobic media in certain cases; this is precisely why guidelines continue to endorse routine anaerobic bottles despite declining obligate anaerobe incidence [^d74a8e7d]. Neonatal data also show that many common neonatal pathogens, including GBS and S. aureus, will grow under anaerobic conditions, supporting paired bottles in pediatric workflows as well [^0d1236c7].

> But wait, what if there are true anaerobic gram-positive cocci that only grow in anaerobic bottles. Yes, there are anaerobic gram-positive cocci such as Peptostreptococcus and Parvimonas micra that are obligate anaerobes; they will not grow in aerobic bottles and require anaerobic conditions for recovery, which is another reason to include anaerobic bottles when clinically suspected [^de1b9906] [^e7d0071c]. I should double-check that these are indeed the organisms sometimes isolated from anaerobic bottles in polymicrobial bacteremias, confirming the clinical relevance of anaerobic culture even when facultative organisms predominate [^e7d0071c].

> Let me consider practical implications and exceptions. While facultative gram-positive cocci can grow in both bottle types, recovery may be faster or more robust in one bottle depending on the organism and medium formulation; therefore, using both aerobic and anaerobic bottles optimizes sensitivity and time-to-detection across the spectrum of pathogens, including streptococci and staphylococci that may be present at low inoculum or under antimicrobial pressure [^e7d0071c] [^e4c6d234]. I should confirm that this aligns with sepsis best practices emphasizing early, pre-antibiotic paired sets from separate sites to maximize yield and interpret contamination [^30e9d72b].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Yes, facultative gram-positive cocci will grow in both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles, and many grow as well or better in anaerobic bottles, which is why current guidelines recommend paired aerobic and anaerobic bottles for adults; obligate anaerobic gram-positive cocci will grow only in anaerobic bottles, so including anaerobic culture prevents missed pathogens and improves overall detection of bacteremia [^d74a8e7d] [^e7d0071c] [^e4c6d234].

---

Gram-positive cocci are **facultative anaerobes** and will grow in both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles, though growth may be slower or delayed in anaerobic bottles [^d74a8e7d]. Some organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and certain streptococci, may grow **better in anaerobic bottles** [^d74a8e7d] [^e7d0071c], and anaerobic bottles can also detect obligate anaerobes that aerobic bottles miss [^e7d0071c]. Therefore, **paired aerobic and anaerobic bottles are recommended** for optimal recovery and timely detection of gram-positive cocci in bloodstream infections [^d74a8e7d] [^30e9d72b].

## Growth characteristics of gram-positive cocci in aerobic and anaerobic conditions

Gram-positive cocci, including staphylococci and streptococci, are **facultative anaerobes** that can grow in both aerobic and anaerobic environments, though growth kinetics and yields may differ [^d74a8e7d]. Aerobic bottles support robust growth of most gram-positive cocci, while anaerobic bottles can enhance recovery of certain species and detect obligate anaerobes that aerobic bottles miss [^e7d0071c].

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Several clinical studies have evaluated the recovery of gram-positive cocci from aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles:

- **BacT/ALERT system study**: Significantly more gram-positive cocci, including Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, were recovered when both aerobic and anaerobic bottles were used compared to aerobic bottles alone [^e7d0071c].

- **BACTEC system study**: Anaerobic bottles detected more staphylococci and streptococci than standard anaerobic bottles, highlighting the importance of anaerobic culture for gram-positive cocci recovery [^e4c6d234].

- **Neonatal study**: Anaerobic bottles yielded clinically significant organisms in 33.9% of cases, including gram-positive cocci, demonstrating their utility even in pediatric populations [^cb1a3bf3].

## Specific gram-positive cocci and their growth patterns

| **Organism** | **Aerobic growth** | **Anaerobic growth** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Staphylococcus aureus | Robust growth | Growth, sometimes delayed | Anaerobic bottles can enhance recovery [^e7d0071c] |
| Coagulase-negative staphylococci | Robust growth | Growth, sometimes delayed | Anaerobic bottles can enhance recovery [^e7d0071c] |
| Streptococcus pneumoniae | Robust growth | Enhanced growth | Better recovery in anaerobic bottles [^d74a8e7d] [^e7d0071c] |
| Streptococcus pyogenes | Robust growth | Growth, sometimes delayed | Anaerobic bottles can enhance recovery [^d74a8e7d] |
| Enterococcus species | Robust growth | Growth, sometimes delayed | Anaerobic bottles can enhance recovery [^d74a8e7d] |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

Given the evidence, **paired aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles are recommended** for optimal recovery of gram-positive cocci [^d74a8e7d]. Anaerobic bottles can detect organisms missed by aerobic bottles, leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of bloodstream infections [^e7d0071c]. This approach is particularly important for severe infections, immunocompromised patients, and those with suspected polymicrobial bacteremia [^30e9d72b].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While anaerobic bottles enhance recovery, they may also yield contaminants, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, requiring **careful clinical correlation** [^f33bfba2]. Additionally, anaerobic bottles may show delayed positivity, necessitating adequate incubation and follow-up [^34a4f63d].

---

Gram-positive cocci will grow in both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles, but **anaerobic bottles can improve recovery** for certain species and detect obligate anaerobes. Therefore, paired aerobic and anaerobic bottles are recommended for optimal detection of bloodstream infections caused by gram-positive cocci [^d74a8e7d].

The number of positive anaerobic blood culture results per 1,000 blood cultures performed decreased from 12.6 in the period from 1997 to 2001 to 7.0 in the period from 2002 to 2006 (P < 0.001), as did the proportion of isolated anaerobic organisms compared to the number of all organisms isolated from blood cultures (7.6% to 4.3% [P < 0.001]), while positive aerobic cultures remained stable. In contrast, the proportion of Bacteroides fragilis group members and gram-positive cocci within the anaerobic group increased (26.8% to 36.7% [P = 0.004] and 5.4% to 12% [P < 0.001], respectively). The number of patients with anaerobic bacteremia decreased from 122 patients in 1997 to 69 in 2006.

### Rapid identification of bacteria and yeast: summary of a national committee for clinical laboratory standards proposed guideline [^d8c2673c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Using colony morphology on selected agars, Gram-stain morphology, and a number of 1-step biochemical or enzymatic tests, skilled microbiologists can identify the species of the majority of isolates seen routinely in a clinical laboratory. These results are often available more quickly than and are as accurate as those derived from conventional methods. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards has produced a guideline that describes tests that can be used to identify a number of aerobic gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci, a number of commonly isolated anaerobes, and 3 species of yeast. An overview of the organisms included in the guideline, the tests that identify them, and the situations in which rapid testing is appropriate is presented here.

### Isolation of a strictly anaerobic strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis [^2a145090]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2006). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a well-characterized, nonfastidious, aerobic gram-positive coccus commonly isolated in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Although coagulase-negative staphylococci, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, are often considered a contaminant in the clinical laboratory, an increasing number of reports describe their pathogenesis, in particular in infections of prosthetic devices. This article describes the isolation of a strictly anaerobic strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis in pure culture from the site of an infected prosthetic hip. This isolate was unique in that it grew only under strictly anaerobic conditions. Initially, the isolate was thought to be a known anaerobic gram-positive coccus. However, certain key biochemical and antimicrobial tests performed as part of the standard laboratory identification procedure were not consistent with results expected for any known anaerobic gram-positive coccus; the isolate was catalase positive and metronidazole and penicillin resistant. This isolate was characterized by further biochemical analysis, antimicrobial testing, and nucleic acid sequencing. This paper presents the first documented isolation of a strictly anaerobic Staphylococcus epidermidis strain, confirmed by rpoB gene sequencing.

Intended use. Bact/alert® fa plus culture bottles are used with bact/alert® microbial detection systems in qualitative procedures for recovery and detection of aerobic and facultative anaerobic from blood and other normally sterile body fluids. Description of the issue. A customer in united states notified biomérieux of an increase of false positive gram negative target with the genmark eplex bcid when testing blood samples inoculated in one lot of bact/alert fa plus
- reference. result of the above series of tests. The customers transferred sample from positive pf plus/fa plus bottles and tested the sample with a bcid molecular test. Results had a positive detection for serratia marcescens or gram-negative organism. Serratia marcescens: as per the instructions for use for bcid2 panel, serratia marcescens is part of the enterobacterales family. It is characterized as gram-negative bacterium.

Growth of this organism is best between 4°c to 45°c. The autoclave process exposes the bottles to high temperature, higher than the survival temperature of serratia marcescens, resulting in non-viable dna. Pf plus/fa plus quality control testing with bcid2 panel: all the qc records were reviewed for the pf plus and fa plus lots involved.) provides the following adequate guidance pertaining to non-viable organisms with an bact/alert bottle. The laboratory procedure section states: "smear and subculture all positive bottles. ¿ the limitations of the test section states ¿a gram-stained smear from a negative bottle may sometimes contain a small number of non-viable. investigation. Conclusion: there is no evidence of any bottle malfunction with the bact/alert pf plus/fa plus culture bottle lots. The bact/alert bottles detected organism growth as intended.

Bcid2 testing is being conducted on designated raw materials and samples representing all media bulks for the fill lots for bact/alert products. Testing of all the media bulks that contribute to the fill lot fills will aid in monitoring product containing nucleic acid residual in an effort to reduce the chances of customers obtaining false positive results with bcid panel testing.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^9cad1943]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — diagnosis and microbiology emphasize polymicrobial involvement and tissue-based confirmation. Numerous different anaerobic and aerobic organisms can be cultured from the involved fascial plane, with an average of 5 pathogens in each wound, and most originate from bowel or genitourinary flora. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show edema along the fascial plane, but sensitivity and specificity are ill defined, and in practice, clinical judgment is the most important element in diagnosis. A definitive bacteriologic diagnosis is best established by culture and Gram stain of deep tissue obtained at operation or by positive blood cultures; Gram-positive cocci in chains suggest Streptococcus and large gram-positive cocci in clusters suggest S. aureus. If there is no necrosis on exploratory incision, the procedure can be terminated with very little risk or morbidity, and while biopsy for frozen section analysis may be used, gross inspection usually suffices and biopsy alone may produce a false-negative result.

Clinical Review (Insufficient Quality of Evidence to Enable a Clear Recommendation)

Which Empirical Antimicrobial Agents Are Preferred for Osteomyelitis?

Based on data from observational studies, if antibiotic therapy cannot be delayed until culture availability, it is reasonable to empirically cover aerobic gram-positive cocci, especially S aureus, and gram-negative bacilli (Table 2; eTable 2 in Supplement 2). Many practitioners routinely provide anaerobic coverage for DFO; however, comparative data are not available to establish the clinical benefit or harm of this approach. Inclusion of empirical therapy targeting methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa depends on the presence of specific risk factors (addressed below). In all cases, local susceptibility patterns, patient-specific risk factors, and prior culture data influence the choice of antibiotic selection. Culture results can be used to tailor empirical therapy when possible.

Table 2.
Reasonable Empirical Antimicrobial Therapy Options With Published Data a

Abbreviations: PJI, prosthetic joint infection; TMP-SMX, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

When Should Antimicrobial Coverage Targeting MRSA Be Included?

Based on culture data from observational studies, inclusion of empirical anti-MRSA coverage depends on local prevalence and patient-specific risk factors, such as known colonization status (which is the biggest individual risk factor), prior positive cultures, and health care exposure. In a setting with low MRSA incidence, no known MRSA colonization or prior positive cultures, and minimal health care contact, it is reasonable to withhold empirical MRSA coverage.

When Should Antimicrobial Coverage Against P Aeruginosa Be Included?

Based on culture data from observational studies, routine use of empirical antipseudomonal therapy for osteomyelitis is unnecessary. Such agents are added in the presence of specific risk factors, including patients with chronic wounds who have: (1) been exposed to multiple prior courses of antibiotics; (2) previously had cultures positive for P aeruginosa; (3) gangrenous wounds; (4) had a recent surgical procedure (eg, within 3 months, as with early PJI); or (5) specific sites of infection particularly associated with pseudomonal infection (eg, malignant otitis externa).

Does Bone Penetration of an Antimicrobial Agent Matter Clinically, and Should It Be Used to Select Therapy?

Outcome data related to antibiotic bone penetration are limited for osteomyelitis. Thus, theoretical bone penetration (eTable 3 in Supplement 2) is not the primary driver of antibiotic selection; published clinical outcomes data are more relevant.

### Antimicrobial therapy of infections with aerobic Gram-positive rods [^ca4ad3de]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2001). Low credibility.

This review presents data on in vitro susceptibilities of aerobically growing Gram-positive rods and in vivo activities of antibiotics used against Gram-positive rods. While in some instances susceptibility and efficacy are predictable (e.g. penicillin vs. Listeria and microaerophilic coryneforms, or metronidazole vs. Gardnerella) susceptibility testing by dilution techniques seems necessary for many Gram-positive rods as long as they are deemed clinically relevant.

### Management of intra-abdominal infections: recommendations by the WSES 2016 consensus conference [^20e4a942]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Appropriate intraperitoneal specimen is peritoneal fluid or pus that is collected from the site of infection. For specimen collection, intraperitoneal fluid, pus, or tissue should be collected in airless sterile syringe with combi-stopper or in sterile test tube. Intraperitoneal specimen can be directly inoculated into appropriate aerobic and anaerobic transport media. Peritoneal swab and fluid from drain tubes are not recommended routinely. Sufficient fluid volume (usually at least 1–2 mL of fluid or tissue) must be collected, and then transported to the microbiology laboratory using a transport system that properly handles and preserves the samples to avoid damage or compromising their integrity.

At the laboratory, the intraperitoneal specimen should be examined under a microscope using Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture should be established, and antibiotic susceptibility test should be performed. Received peritoneal fluid or pus may be examined under the microscope immediately because Gram stains may be of value in detecting Gram-positive cocci or yeast. In the event of positive finding of Gram-positive cocci or yeast, the additional empiric anti-cocci or anti-fungi therapy should be considered before definitive culture results are available.

When a microorganism is identified in clinical cultures, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) should always be performed to guide antibiotic therapy.

Results are reported as the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is the lowest concentration of drug that inhibits the growth of the organism. Reports typically contain a quantitative result in μg/mL and a qualitative interpretation. The interpretation usually categorizes each result as susceptible (S), intermediate (I), and resistant (R) basing on breakpoints established by either the Clinical or Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) in the USA or the European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) in Europe.

### Notes from the field: Veillonella misidentified as Francisella tularensis-Idaho, 2016 [^f69ab7b3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

Veillonella spp. are small, slow-growing, nonmotile anaerobic Gram-negative cocci found as part of the normal flora of gastrointestinal, respiratory, and vaginal tracts. Although Veillonella spp. are classified as anaerobes, anaerobic organisms (including Veillonella spp.) have been observed growing in aerobic conditions for a limited time after isolation before becoming nonviable. Often considered contaminants of clinical specimen collection, Veillonella spp. have been rarely isolated from monomicrobial cultures of invasive infections. Predisposing factors for invasive infection have not been fully studied, but might include local or systemic immune suppression and localized anaerobic conditions produced by tissue necrosis, diminished blood supply, or prolonged infection with aerobes.

This is the first published report of misidentification of Veillonella sp. as F. tularensis by an AMIS and of isolation of Veillonella sp. from a nonprosthetic knee. Hospital and public health staff members responded appropriately to the preliminary misidentification of the isolate as F. tularensis; however, accurate identification would have obviated the need for time-intensive response activities, use of prophylactic antibiotics by hospital staff members, and inappropriately targeted antibiotic therapy for the patient. Clinical laboratories are advised not to use a commercial AMIS if a select agent is suspected in a clinical sample and to consult with their LRN-biologic laboratory for guidance and sample referral. Clinicians should consider Veillonella spp. when receiving laboratory reports of F. tularensis generated by AMISs. Because Veillonella spp. are typically resistant to recommended or alternative antibiotic therapies for tularemia (i.e. streptomycin, gentamicin, tetracyclines, ciprofloxacin, and other fluoroquinolones), antibiotic coverage for both Veillonella spp. and F. tularensis could be considered until final microbial identification is available.

### Detection of bacterial and yeast species with the bactec 9120 automated system with routine use of aerobic, anaerobic, and fungal media [^62e1fa67]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2008). Low credibility.

During the period 2006 and 2007, all blood cultures required by four units at high infective risk and most of those required by other units of the University Hospital of Palermo, Palermo, Italy were performed using a Bactec 9120 automated blood culture system with a complete set of Plus Aerobic/F, Plus Anaerobic/F, and Mycosis IC/F bottles. The aim of the study was to enable the authors to gain firsthand experience of the culture potentialities of the three different media, to obtain information regarding the overall and specific recovery of bacteria and yeasts from blood cultures in the hospital, and to reach a decision as to whether and when to utilize anaerobic and fungal bottles. Although very few bloodstream infections (1.8%) were associated with obligate anaerobes, the traditional routine use of anaerobic bottles was confirmed because of their usefulness, not only in the detection of anaerobes, but also in that of gram-positive cocci and fermentative gram-negative bacilli. In this study, Mycosis IC/F bottles detected 77.4% of all the yeast isolates, 87.0% of yeasts belonging to the species Candida albicans, and 45.7% of nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli resistant to chloramphenicol and tobramycin. In order to improve the diagnosis of fungemia in high-risk patients, the additional routine use of fungal bottles was suggested when, as occurred in the intensive-care unit and in the hematology unit of the University Hospital of Palermo, high percentages of bloodstream infections are associated with yeasts, and/or antibiotic-resistant bacteria and/or multiple bacterial isolates capable of inhibiting yeast growth in aerobic bottles.

### The surgical infection society revised guidelines on the management of intra-abdominal infection [^8cbbf119]. Surgical Infections (2017). Medium credibility.

Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) empiric antimicrobial coverage — Standard antimicrobial therapy for patients with IAI should include agents with activity against aerobic gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, aerobic streptococci, and obligate enteric anaerobic organisms found in the gastrointestinal tract, although coverage of the latter may not be absolutely essential in patients with an upper gastrointestinal source of infection. Observational studies have demonstrated an increased risk of treatment failure and death when this basic principle is not followed, and a recent large database study of more than 6000 patients confirmed higher failure and death with regimens lacking anaerobic activity compared with active anaerobic therapy. Consistent with this, we recommend use of antimicrobial regimens having activity against the typical gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae, gram-positive cocci, and obligate anaerobes involved in these infections (Grade 1-A).

### Empirical therapy for diabetic foot infections: are there clinical clues to guide antibiotic selection? [^5c118dcc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2007). Low credibility.

Initial antibiotic therapy for diabetic foot infections is usually empirical. Several principles may help to avoid selecting either an unnecessarily broad or inappropriately narrow regimen. First, clinically severe infections require broad-spectrum therapy, while less severe infections may not. Second, aerobic Gram-positive cocci, particularly Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) for patients at high-risk) should always be covered. Third, therapy should also be targeted at aerobic Gram-negative pathogens if the infection is chronic or has failed to respond to previous antibiotic therapy. Fourth, anti-anaerobe agents should be considered for necrotic or gangrenous infections on an ischaemic limb. Parenteral therapy is needed for severe infections, but oral therapy is adequate for most mild or moderate infections.

Bloodstream infection laboratory diagnosis — key points emphasize that volume of blood collected, not timing, is most critical; disinfect the venipuncture site with chlorhexidine or 2% iodine tincture in adults and children > 2 months old (chlorhexidine NOT recommended for children < 2 months old); draw blood for culture before initiating antimicrobial therapy; catheter-drawn blood cultures have a higher risk of contamination (false positives); "Do not submit catheter tips for culture"; "Never refrigerate blood prior to incubation"; and use a "2–3 bottle blood culture set for adults, at least one aerobic and one anaerobic; use 1–2 aerobic bottles for children". The document also notes that "Streptococcus pneumoniae and some other gram-positive organisms may grow better in anaerobic than aerobic bottles".

### Comparison of recovery of blood culture isolates from two bacT / ALERT FAN aerobic blood culture bottles with recovery from one FAN aerobic bottle and one FAN anaerobic bottle [^e7d0071c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Traditionally, a routine blood culture for adult patients consisted of paired aerobic and anaerobic bottles, but the routine use of an anaerobic blood culture bottle has been challenged in recent years. In this study, we compared the recovery of two FAN aerobic bottles with one FAN aerobic and one FAN anaerobic bottle. Each pair of bottles was collected by a separate collection procedure, and each bottle held a recommended 8- to 12-ml draw. A total of 704 clinically significant isolates were recovered from 8,620 sets (17,240 pairs), with 487 (69.2%) isolates recovered from one or both bottles in each pair of bottles, 86 isolates (12.2%) recovered only from the FAN aerobic-FAN aerobic pair, and 131 isolates (18.6%) recovered only from the FAN aerobic-FAN anaerobic pair. Significantly more total organisms (P = 0.002), gram-positive cocci (P = 0.03), Staphylococcus aureus (P = 0.05), Enterobacteriaceae other than Escherichia coli (P = 0.02), and anaerobes (P = 0.01) were recovered from the FAN aerobic-FAN anaerobic pair than from the FAN aerobic-FAN aerobic pair. A separate analysis was performed on the 618 isolates that were recovered from the FAN aerobic-FAN anaerobic pair to compare recovery by bottle type. Significantly more S. aureus (P = 0.005) and anaerobes (P < 0.001) were recovered from the FAN anaerobic bottle, while significantly more coagulase-negative staphylococci (P = 0.01), Streptococcus pneumoniae (P = 0.03), and other gram-negative bacilli (P = 0.004) were recovered from the FAN aerobic bottle. These results support the routine use of a FAN anaerobic bottle for use in the culture of blood with the BacT/ALERT system in our institution. These results also suggest that the decision of whether to routinely utilize an anaerobic blood culture bottle should be influenced by the overall recovery of bacteria and yeast, the recovery of specific types of bacteria or yeast, the medium type, and the blood culture system utilized by the laboratory.

### Triple diagnostics for early detection of ambivalent necrotizing fasciitis [^99fd9684]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Triple diagnostics: Gram staining

Fascia biopsy material is transported to the lab in a sterile container. For Gram staining, the tissue is fixed to a glass slide by alcohol or heating. For microscopy, x1,000 magnification (using an oil immersion objective lens (100×)) is used to assess the presence, Gram staining, characteristic arrangements and morphology of microorganisms.

Group A Streptococci (GAS, also called Streptococcus pyogenes) are Gram positive spherical cocci. In clinical specimens such as fascia biopsy material, they may appear as pairs or short chains. However, when they are grown in liquid media, they form the typical long chains. Polymicrobial infections are usually mixtures of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and therefore, many morphologically different microorganisms can be seen. Gram staining may even show more different microorganisms than are cultured eventually, as culturing anaerobic bacteria can be difficult due to specific growth requirements. Antibiotic therapy can be modulated according to the results of the Gram stain.

Gram staining and microscopy can be performed rapidly after arrival of the tissue in the lab, with a turn-around-time of approximately 30 min depending on the techniques used in the lab and the skills of the microscopist. Negative microscopy does not rule out the presence of microorganisms in tissue however; tissue should therefore be cultured as well. This also facilitates antimicrobial susceptibility testing on the causative microorganisms. Special care should be given to anaerobic microbes.

### How to isolate, identify and determine antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in routine laboratories [^a6bdcae5]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2018). Low credibility.

Background

There has been increased interest in the study of anaerobic bacteria that cause human infection during the past decade. Many new genera and species have been described using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of clinical isolates obtained from different infection sites with commercially available special culture media to support the growth of anaerobes. Several systems, such as anaerobic pouches, boxes, jars and chambers provide suitable anaerobic culture conditions to isolate even strict anaerobic bacteria successfully from clinical specimens. Beside the classical, time-consuming identification methods and automated biochemical tests, the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry has revolutionized identification of even unusual and slow-growing anaerobes directly from culture plates, providing the possibility of providing timely information about anaerobic infections.

Aims

The aim of this review article is to present methods for routine laboratories, which carry out anaerobic diagnostics on different levels.

Sources

Relevant data from the literature mostly published during the last 7 years are encompassed and discussed.

Content

The review involves topics on the anaerobes that are members of the commensal microbiota and their role causing infection, the key requirements for collection and transport of specimens, processing of specimens in the laboratory, incubation techniques, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria. Advantages, drawbacks and specific benefits of the methods are highlighted.

Implications

The present review aims to update and improve anaerobic microbiology in laboratories with optimal conditions as well as encourage its routine implementation in laboratories with restricted resources.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^7b84e0a1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Secondary peritonitis diagnostic evaluation — source identification and test selection are emphasized. The diagnosis of secondary peritonitis is dependent upon identifying a source for invading microorganisms — usually genitourinary or gastrointestinal microbiota, and unlike SBP, secondary peritonitis tends to be polymicrobic and may include anaerobic microbiota with organisms such as S. aureus, N. gonorrhoeae, and Mycobacterium spp. unusual in this setting. If typhlitis is suspected, C. difficile toxin testing, stool cultures for enteric pathogens, and blood cultures should be requested, and C. septicum should be considered in neutropenic enterocolitis; if other etiologies are ruled out and a parasitic cause is suspected, a request for ova and parasite examination could be considered. Peritoneal fluid should be sent in an anaerobic transport system for Gram stain and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures, and inoculation of blood culture bottles alone with peritoneal fluid is not appropriate in this setting. The microbiology laboratory should be contacted to arrange special processing if cytomegalovirus (CMV) is of concern and should also be contacted if N. gonorrhoeae is of concern; this specimen type has no FDA-cleared commercial platform for testing. Infectious complications following bariatric surgery are frequently due to gram-positive cocci and yeast (Candida spp.), and because many of these patients have had prior exposure to antibiotics, multiply resistant organisms are of concern.

### Performance of two resin-containing blood culture media in detection of bloodstream infections and in direct matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) broth assays for isolate identification: clinical comparison of the bacT / alert plus and bactec plus systems [^70ec6fe7]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2014). Low credibility.

We compared the clinical performances of the BacT/Alert Plus (bioMérieux) and Bactec Plus (Becton Dickinson) aerobic and anaerobic blood culture (BC) media with adsorbent polymeric beads. Patients ≥ 16 years old with suspected bloodstream infections (BSIs) were enrolled in intensive care units and infectious disease wards. A single 40-ml blood sample was collected from each and used to inoculate (10 ml/bottle) one set of BacT/Alert Plus cultures and one set of Bactec Plus cultures, each set consisting of one aerobic and one anaerobic bottle. Cultures were incubated ≤ 5 days in the BacT/Alert 3D and Bactec FX instruments, respectively. A total of 128 unique BSI episodes were identified based on the recovery of clinically significant growth in 212 aerobic cultures (106 BacT/Alert and 106 Bactec) and 151 anaerobic cultures (82 BacT/Alert and 69 Bactec). The BacT/Alert aerobic medium had higher recovery rates for Gram-positive cocci (P = 0.024), whereas the Bactec aerobic medium was superior for recovery of Gram-negative bacilli (P = 0.006). BacT/Alert anaerobic medium recovery rates exceeded those of the Bactec anaerobic medium for total organisms (P = 0.003), Gram-positive cocci (P = 0.013), and Escherichia coli (P = 0.030). In terms of capacity for diagnosing the 128 septic episodes, the BacT/Alert and Bactec sets were comparable, although the former sets diagnosed more BSIs caused by Gram-positive cocci (P = 0.008). They also allowed earlier identification of coagulase-negative staphylococcal growth (mean, 2.8 h; P = 0.003) and growth in samples from patients not on antimicrobial therapy that yielded positive results (mean, 1.3 h; P < 0.001). Similarly high percentages of microorganisms in BacT/Alert and Bactec cultures (93.8% and 93.3%, respectively) were identified by direct matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry assay of BC broths. The BacT/Alert Plus media line appears to be a reliable, timesaving tool for routine detection of BSIs in the population we studied, although further studies are needed to evaluate their performance in other settings.

### Microbiological study of dacryocystitis in northwest of iran [^404c282e]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

In our study on 129 cases, the results of the culture were negative in 24.8%, which indicates that there is no growing aerobic factor in one quarter of the patients and suggests the probability of anaerobic agents as an etiologic factor. Although we had signified previous treatment as an exclusion criterion, the cases treated with hidden antibiotics and unknown medications should be considered as possible causes of negative culture results.

The general trend of previous studies including Chaudhry et al (2005), Bharathi et al (2008), Huber-Spitzy et al (1992), Mills et al (2007), Ali et al (2013), and Assefa et al (2015) indicates that gram-positive organisms dominate in both acute and chronic dacryocystitis, and the most common being staphylococcal species. The prevalence of gram-positive bacteria in dacryocystitis has been reported in Finland (62%), Australia (54.4%), Saudi Arabia (79.1%), the USA (68.8%), and in a previous study conducted in Iran (68.8%).–In our study, most of the isolated bacteria were gram positive (63.8%) and more accurately, gram-positive cocci (61.8%) followed by gram-negative bacilli (25.8%) and fungus species (10.4%), respectively. Also, 45.4% of isolated strains were staphylococcal species.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) — classification, microbiology, and specimen approach are outlined: SSTIs "are often classified as simple (uncomplicated) or complicated (necrotizing or non-necrotizing) and may involve skin, subcutaneous fat, fascial layers, and musculoskeletal structures". Primary cutaneous infections "are commonly caused by a narrow spectrum of pyogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus))". In diabetic foot infections, "Anaerobic bacteria are important and predominate pathogens in DFIs and should always be considered when choosing therapeutic options", and "The majority of DFIs are polymicrobial, but gram-positive cocci, specifically staphylococci, are the predominate infectious agents; Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in the majority of chronic DFIs". For wound culture strategy, "Surface cultures of such wounds, including decubitus ulcers are of little value as they represent colonizing microbes, which cannot be easily differentiated from the underlying etiologic agent", whereas "Tissue biopsies, preferably a full-thickness biopsy, following thorough debridement, or bone biopsies obtained through a debrided site, are optimal for obtaining clinically relevant information". Necrotizing cutaneous infections "are usually caused by streptococci and less often by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or Klebsiella species but are often polymicrobial".

### Neonatal granulicatella elegans bacteremia, london, UK [^c7de76df]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Culture of the neonate's blood sample (BacTalert 3D; Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK) grew small, gram-variable bacilli after 17 hours of aerobic incubation. A subculture incubated aerobically on CBA or chocolated CBA showed no bacterial growth; however, tiny colonies were seen on fastidious anaerobic agar with and without neomycin. Gram staining of the colonies showed gram-positive bacilli that were morphologically similar to those isolated from placenta. We suspected lactobacilli or streptococci, but testing (API Strep and Coryne strips; bioMérieux UK Ltd, Hampshire, UK) did not confirm this. Nutritionally variant streptococci were not suspected.

Both isolates were sent to the Health Protection Agency Laboratory of Healthcare Infections (London). Antimicrobial drug sensitivities were determined (Iso-Sensitest Agar; Thermo Fisher) according to a previously defined method. The isolates were sensitive to penicillin, clarithromycin, trimethoprim, and vancomycin but resistant to tetracycline. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes of both isolates confirmed they were the same G. elegans strain. Isolates exhibited enhanced growth in the presence of pyridoxal (Figure) and satellitism with Staphylococcus aureus.

Figure
Blood agar plates with (left) and without (right) pyridoxal supplement from a study of neonatal Granulicatella elegans bacteremia, London, UK.

G. elegans (originally known as Abiotrophia elegans) was first described in 1998 as a catalase-negative, oxidase-negative, nonmotile, facultative anaerobic gram-positive bacterium. However, the bacterium can exhibit variability and pleomorphism on Gram staining: forms range from bacilli in nutrient-depleted media to cocci arranged in short chains in nutrient-rich media. This variability poses challenges to the identification and taxonomic classification of the organism. The possibility of nutritionally variant streptococci (NVS) should be considered when gram-positive cocci or bacilli are seen on Gram staining, but the cocci/bacilli grow poorly on nonsupplemented media. Studies have shown that pyridoxine facilitates the growth of NVS.

### Antibiotic susceptibility of human gut-derived facultative anaerobic bacteria is different under aerobic versus anaerobic test conditions [^b0408570]. Microbes and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Facultative anaerobes are the most common cause of infections in anoxic parts of the human body, including deep wound, vagina, periodontal pockets, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary tract and lungs. Generally, antibiotic susceptibility tests (AST) for facultative anaerobes are performed under aerobic conditions due to ease of handling and rapid growth. However, variation in susceptibility of facultative anaerobes to antibiotics under aerobic and anaerobic conditions can lead to failure of antibiotic treatment. Our study evaluated the susceptibility of facultative anaerobic microorganisms to antibiotics during growth under anaerobic or aerobic conditions. We compared the resistance patterns of representatives from 15 bacterial genera isolated from the human-gastrointestinal tract against 22 different antibiotics from six classes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Preliminary results obtained by a disc diffusion method were verified using minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing. The results demonstrated that 7-strains had a similar pattern of drug resistance under both conditions, while the remaining ten strains had significant differences in resistance patterns between aerobic and anaerobic conditions for at least one antibiotic. We conclude that successful antibiotic therapy for host-associated pathogens requires proper assessment of the oxygen condition of the growth environment and MIC testing of each pathogen under anaerobic and aerobic conditions.

INTRODUCTION

is a Gram-positive facultative anaerobe that is responsible for foodborne infections of humans, typified by high mortality rates. It is found in a range of environments, including brackish water, soil, and decaying plant material. It can grow within a wide temperature range and is resistant to low pH and high salt. This versatility may, at least in part, account for the ability ofto survive food processing and to grow under conditions routinely used for food preservation.

In infections following ingestion, is able to invade host cells using the InlA and InlB proteins and, after uptake, to escape from the phagosome through the actions of listeriolysin O and the phospholipases PlcA and PlcB. Once outside the phagosome, it replicates in the host cell cytosol, polymerizing actin at its pole through the ActA protein to move around the cell and invade neighboring cells.

Within the environment and the infected host, is exposed to varying oxygen tensions that range from fully aerobic to anaerobic conditions. For example, following ingestion ofin contaminated food, it is exposed to low-oxygen environments in the intestine, while it is exposed to higher levels of oxygen following invasion into host tissue. Under aerobic conditions, the major end products of glucose catabolism are equally lactate, acetate, acetoin, and carbon dioxide. In contrast, under anaerobic conditions following fermentation, the major end product is lactate, with small amounts of acetate, formate, ethanol, and carbon dioxide. It is unclear what terminal electron acceptors can be used under fermentative anaerobic growth, although fumarate has been suggested to function in this capacity. Mutants defective in the aro pathway and thus unable to make menaquinone grow anaerobically even under aerobic conditions and are defective for intracellular growth in epithelial cells and attenuated in mice. This suggests that intracellular growth ofand growth in vivo are predominantly via aerobic metabolism.

Aerobic vaginitis (AV) — a condition with abnormal vaginal microbiota comprising aerobic enteric commensals or pathogens such as Group B Streptococcus (S. agalactiae), Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and S. aureus and variable inflammation — in shares decreased lactobacilli and increased pH with bacterial vaginosis (BV) but typically shows pH 6, no positive whiff test, a red and edematous vagina with small erosions or ulcerations, yellow‑green discharge, and dyspareunia. AV has been observed in 8%–11% of pregnant women and in 5%–24% of women reporting vaginal complaints. Diagnosis is made by reviewing vaginal discharge and Gram stain or phase contrast microscopy to visualize enteric bacilli and gram‑positive cocci, lack of lactobacilli, and presence of leucocytes and parabasal or immature epithelial cells; accurate distinction from BV is important because treatments differ.

### Management of neonates born at ≥ 35 0 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^0d1236c7]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Laboratory testing — blood culture in early-onset sepsis (EOS): In the absence of validated, clinically available molecular diagnostics, blood culture remains the diagnostic standard for EOS, and newborn surface cultures and gastric aspirate analysis cannot be used to diagnose EOS; urine culture is not indicated in sepsis evaluations performed at < 72 hours of age. In modern systems, these systems are used to reliably detect bacteremia at a level of 1 to 10 colony-forming units per mL if a minimum blood volume of 1 mL is inoculated, and a median blood culture time to positivity of < 24 hours is reported among term infants when using contemporary techniques. Pediatric blood culture bottles generally require a minimum inoculum of 1 mL of blood for optimal recovery, the use of 2 separate culture bottles may provide the opportunity to determine if commensal species are true infections by comparing growth in the 2 cultures, and the use of 1 aerobic and 1 anaerobic culture bottle may be done to optimize recovery; most neonatal pathogens, including GBS, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, will grow under anaerobic conditions. In critically ill term newborn infants, a prolonged empirical antibiotic treatment may occasionally be appropriate despite negative culture results.

### Bacteriology of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections and in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents [^d5fc3e0c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

As part of a United States-based multicenter clinical trial, conducted from 2001 to 2004, that compared ertapenem to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections (DFIs), we obtained 454 pretreatment specimens from 433 patients. After debridement, the investigators collected wound specimens, mostly by curettage or biopsy, and sent them to the R. M. Alden Research Laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. Among the 427 positive cultures, 83.8% were polymicrobial, 48% grew only aerobes, 43.7% had both aerobes and anaerobes, and 1.3% had only anaerobes. Cultures yielded a total of 1,145 aerobic strains and 462 anaerobic strains, with an average of 2.7 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 8) for aerobes and 2.3 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 9) for anaerobes. The predominant aerobic organisms were oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (4.4%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (15.3%), Streptococcus species (15.5%), Enterococcus species (13.5%), Corynebacterium species (10.1%), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (12.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.5%). The predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci (45.2%), Prevotella species (13.6%), Porphyromonas species (11.3%), and the Bacteroides fragilis group (10.2%). Pure cultures were noted for 20% of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cultures, 9.2% of Staphylococcus epidermidis cultures, and 2.5% of P. aeruginosa cultures. Two or more species of Staphylococcus were present in 13.1% of the patients. Ertapenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were each active against > 98% of the enteric gram-negative rods, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, and anaerobes. Among the fluoroquinolones, 24% of anaerobes, especially the gram-positive cocci, were resistant to moxifloxacin; 27% of the gram-positive aerobes but only 6% of the members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to levofloxacin. Moderate-to-severe DFIs are typically polymicrobial, and almost half include anaerobes. Our antibiotic susceptibility results can help to inform therapeutic choices.

### An anaerobic bacterium host system for heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters [^e9a61d27]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

An ideal anaerobic host for heterologous expression of natural product BGCs should (i) be safe to manipulate in the laboratory; (ii) grow rapidly under anaerobic conditions; (iii) have clear genetic and metabolic backgrounds; (iv) have versatile genetic tools and readily accept large DNA fragments to accommodate the 10–120 kb size range of most natural product BGCs; and (v) possess the requisite precursor molecules to support the biosynthesis of diverse natural products. Genomic analysis of anaerobic bacteria from various environments, including the human body, revealed high average BGC abundances from some families within the predominantly Gram-positive Clostridia and Bacilli classes of the Firmicutes phylum. Clostridia members are obligate anaerobes infamous for being difficult to culture, which makes them unattractive as heterologous expression hosts. The Bacilli are distinguished from the Clostridia by their capacity for aerobic respiration, and many Bacilli strains are aerotolerant or facultative anaerobes that can grow well without fastidious cultivation. In addition, among the top 30 families with high average BGC abundances in the human microbiome, four families are from the Bacilli class, with three (Aerococcaceae, Carnobacteriaceae, and Streptococcaceae) belonging to the Lactobacillales order. We therefore focused our analysis on these three families from which to choose an appropriate host for BGCs heterologous expression. The well-established protocols and genetic tools available for Streptococcus directed our attention to this genus.

### Multiple bacteria in aortic aneurysms [^a9657fb2]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of the present study was to reexamine the possibility that bacteria, particularly anaerobes, are present in aortic aneurysms.

Methods

From December 2000 to November 2001, 53 samples from aneurysm walls were collected from 49 patients during reconstructive surgery. The tissue specimens were sectioned and cultured under anaerobic conditions. Twenty-eight specimens were also subjected to scanning or transmission electron microscopy.

Results

Anaerobic cultivation yielded bacteria in 14 of the 53 samples (26.4%). All bacteria were gram-positive cocci or rods from nine genera and 12 species. Five cultures (35%) were mixed, containing two bacterial species. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic species were found in four samples (28.5%). Anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 10 of 14 positive cultures (71%). Among anaerobes found were Propionibacterium acnes, Propionibacterium granulosum, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, and Eggerthella lenta. Coaggregating bacteria of different sizes and structure were found on the aneurysm walls and inside the intravascular plaque at electron microscopy. Bacteria were found in 20 of the 28 samples (71%) examined with scanning or transmission electron microscopy.

Conclusion

Multiple bacteria, many of which did not belong to the indigenous skin microflora, colonize aortic aneurysms. It is not clear whether the bacteria contribute to weakening of the aortic wall by eliciting inflammation or whether they are secondary colonizers of aneurysms.

### Notes from the field: Veillonella misidentified as Francisella tularensis-Idaho, 2016 [^5f2c7816]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

In October 2016, the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories, Division of Public Health, was notified by hospital A's clinical laboratory (a member of the Idaho Sentinel Laboratory Network) that a bacterial isolate cultured from a hospitalized patient's knee joint fluid aspirate had been identified with 96% confidence as Francisella tularensis (a Tier 1 select agent*) by an in-house automated microbial identification system (AMIS). The isolate was submitted to the Idaho Bureau of Laboratories for confirmatory testing using Laboratory Response Network (LRN) reference methods. Hospital A laboratory personnel reported that the isolate had been manipulated on the open bench and certain laboratory workers had potentially been exposed. The Division of Public Health, hospital A, and Eastern Idaho Public Health initiated an investigation to confirm F. tularensis, assess potential laboratory exposures, and determine the source of infection. The investigation determined that the infectious agent was Veillonella and not F. tularensis.

The patient, a man aged > 75 years, had a multiyear history of chronic unilateral knee pain, during which time he had received a series of three intra-articular injections of hyaluronate sodium 2 years previously, and several intra-articular injections of triamcinolone with bupivacaine, the last of which occurred 15 days before he sought care at hospital A for a swollen knee. Gram staining of an intra-articular aspirate obtained that day from the affected knee showed Gram-variable cocci. The aspirate was cultured under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Slow-growing colonies of Gram-negative cocci were observed from the anaerobic culture, with limited growth in aerobic conditions. Because an anaerobic AMIS panel was not available, isolates from the aerobic culture were processed for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility on the AMIS using a panel specific for aerobic organisms. Identification of F. tularensis by the AMIS triggered notification of the Division of Public Health and revision of the patient's antibiotic regimen from vancomycin, piperacillin, and tazobactam to ciprofloxacin. Eastern Idaho Public Health interviewed the patient and determined that he lived in a rural area and reported no recent exposure to potential sources of naturally occurring F. tularensis (e.g. ill animals, arthropod bites, contaminated water, or use of lawn mowers or string trimmers near dead animals).

### Relevance of routine use of the anaerobic blood culture bottle [^a53ad658]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2007). Low credibility.

Using the BacT/Alert automated system, we conducted a 1-year retrospective study on blood cultures, focusing on the relevance of routine use of the anaerobic bottle. The rate of patients with positive blood cultures was 19.7%. Among these, 13.5% had a positive anaerobic bottle in the absence of any aerobic bottle, and 2/3 of these grew with nonobligate anaerobes. These patients were hospitalized in 20 out of 26 wards of the hospital group. For 65.4% of the monomicrobial-positive blood cultures growing Enterobacteriaceae, the anaerobic bottle detected growth earlier than the corresponding aerobic bottle. These data suggest that, in our institution, the use of an anaerobic bottle is still relevant.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^c5dee199]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Native vertebral osteomyelitis — initial laboratory and tissue diagnostics include that two sets of aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures and ESR and CRP should be obtained, with Brucella blood cultures and serologic tests in endemic areas, fungal blood cultures based on risk factors, and tuberculosis testing considered for those at risk; patients with S. aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, or Brucella bloodstream infection or, in an endemic setting, a positive Brucella serology do not need further testing, whereas for all others, image-guided aspiration/biopsy of a disc space or vertebral endplate is recommended with submission for Gram stain, aerobic and anaerobic culture, and histopathology; if results are negative or inconclusive, a second sampling procedure should be considered, and microorganism-specific NAATs or 16S ribosomal RNA gene PCR/sequencing may be considered, with strategies including setting aside a specimen for testing if cultures are negative or performing molecular testing on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue for histopathologic evaluation.

(7) Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci (excluding enterococci e.g. Enterococcus faecalis [formerly Streptococcus faecalis]), Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Bacteroides species including B. fragilis, Clostridium species, Peptococcus niger, and Peptostreptococcus species.

Appropriate culture and susceptibility studies should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the causative organisms to CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Therapy may be started while awaiting the results of these studies.

In randomized comparative studies, CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP and cephalothin were comparably safe and effective in the management of infections caused by gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods susceptible to the cephalosporins. CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP has a high degree of stability in the presence of bacterial beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases.

Many infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria resistant to some cephalosporins respond to CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Similarly, many infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria resistant to some penicillin antibiotics (ampicillin, carbenicillin, penicillin G) respond to treatment with CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Many infections caused by mixtures of susceptible aerobic and anaerobic bacteria respond to treatment with CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP.

Prevention:

CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP is indicated for the prophylaxis of infection in patients undergoing uncontaminated gastrointestinal surgery, vaginal hysterectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, or cesarean section.

If there are signs of infection, specimens for culture should be obtained for identification of the causative organism so that appropriate treatment may be instituted.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP and other antibacterial drugs, CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Heterogeneity in clinical patterns of adult lung abscess patients: an 8-year retrospective study in a tertiary hospital [^23115c15]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The predominant bacteria detected via conventional culture were aerobic GNBs (50%), aerobic GPCs (16.15%) and facultative anaerobes (12.08%). In contrast, mNGS primarily identified anaerobes (54.99%), facultative anaerobes (12.53%), and aerobic GNB (12.53%) as the main bacterial species (Fig. 1 C). The detection rate of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria by traditional culture was significantly lower that by mNGS (Fig. 1 D).

Among non-survivor patients, aerobic GNB accounted for 66.7% of the primary types of pathogens, with anaerobes accounted for 11.1%. The most commonly detected pathogens in this group were K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa (Fig. 2 A and B). In patients with hematogenous dissemination, a similar pattern was observed, with aerobic GNB being the most prevalent (69.2%). However, there was a significant increase in the proportion of aerobic GPC (18.3%). The most frequently detected pathogens in this subgroup were K. pneumoniae, S. aureus and A. baumannii (Fig. 2 A and C).

### Evaluation of the ePlex blood culture identification panels for detection of pathogens in bloodstream infections [^2ae7aa9f]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2019). Medium credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design.

The evaluation was performed prospectively on consecutive positive blood cultures (BacT/Alert aerobic SA and anaerobic SN bottles; bioMérieux, Marcy-l'Étoile, France) of adult patients sampled from January to October 2017 at CHU UCL Namur Mont-Godinne (CHUMG), a 370-bed tertiary university hospital comprising four intensive care units (total of 30 beds) and with a 120-bed surgical department covering subspecialties including cardiovascular thoracic surgery (lung transplantation), otorhinolaryngo-oncology, and neurosurgery. The CHUMG is part of a larger multisite institution (940 beds) resulting from the association of three hospitals serving a regional population (490,000 inhabitants) in the southern part of Belgium.

The inclusion criteria for enrollment included nonduplicate positive blood culture episodes (one Gram-stained morphotype per septic episode per patient) with organisms visualized at Gram stain microscopy and presumptive clinically significant episodes based on the CDC definition of bloodstream infections (single positive blood culture containing Gram-positive cocci in clusters or diphtheroid Gram-positive rods were excluded). Clinical data were further reviewed to definitively distinguish infection from contamination and to assess the presumed or proven anatomical site source of septicemia. The results obtained by the ePlex BCID panels were not reported to clinicians or used for clinical management of the patients.

### The strict anaerobe Bacteroides fragilis grows in and benefits from nanomolar concentrations of oxygen [^e5509375]. Nature (2004). Excellent credibility.

Strict anaerobes cannot grow in the presence of greater than 5 micro M dissolved oxygen. Despite this growth inhibition, many strict anaerobes of the Bacteroides class of eubacteria can survive in oxygenated environments until the partial pressure of O2 (PO2) is sufficiently reduced. For example, the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythensis colonize subgingival plaques of mammals, whereas several other Bacteroides species colonize the gastrointestinal tract of animals. It has been suggested that pre-colonization of these sites by facultative anaerobes is essential for reduction of the PO2 and subsequent colonization by strict anaerobes. However, this model is inconsistent with the observation that Bacteroides fragilis can colonize the colon in the absence of facultative anaerobes. Thus, this strict anaerobe may have a role in reduction of the environmental PO2. Although some strictly anaerobic bacteria can consume oxygen through an integral membrane electron transport system, the physiological role of this system has not been established in these organisms. Here we demonstrate that B. fragilis encodes a cytochrome bd oxidase that is essential for O2 consumption and is required, under some conditions, for the stimulation of growth in the presence of nanomolar concentrations of O2. Furthermore, our data suggest that this property is conserved in many other organisms that have been described as strict anaerobes.

### Anaerobic conditions induce expression of polysaccharide intercellular adhesin in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis [^ba9bc908]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Products of the intercellular adhesion (ica) operon in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis synthesize a linear beta-1,6-linked glucosaminylglycan. This extracellular polysaccharide mediates bacterial cell-cell adhesion and is required for biofilm formation, which is thought to increase the virulence of both pathogens in association with prosthetic biomedical implants. The environmental signal(s) that triggers ica gene product and polysaccharide expression is unknown. Here we demonstrate that anaerobic in vitro growth conditions lead to increased polysaccharide expression in both S. aureus and S. epidermidis, although the regulation is less stringent in S. epidermidis. Anaerobiosis also dramatically stimulates ica-specific mRNA expression in ica- and polysaccharide-positive strains of both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. These data suggest a mechanism whereby ica gene expression and polysaccharide production may act as a virulence factor in an anaerobic environment in vivo.

### Clinical evaluation of the iCubate iC-GPC assay for detection of Gram-Positive bacteria and resistance markers from positive blood cultures [^e6bfb0ca]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2018). Low credibility.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Clinical specimen collection.

Four clinical laboratories participated in this study, representing different geographic areas in the United States (Laboratory Alliance of Central New York, Syracuse, NY; Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI; TriCore Reference Laboratories, Albuquerque, NM; and Tampa General Hospital, Tampa, FL). Clinical specimens were collected and tested from January 2015 until October 2016. Three different automated blood culture systems were evaluated (BacT/Alert, bioMérieux, Durham, NC; Bactec, Becton-Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD; and VersaTREK, Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). iC-GPC and BC-GP testing was performed from blood culture bottles types that included BD Bactec Standard Aerobic/Anaerobic, VersaTREK Redox 1/2, BacT/Alert SA Standard Aerobic, and BacT/Alert FA FAN aerobic bottles.

A total of 1,134 blood cultures confirmed to contain Gram-positive cocci by Gram stain were initially enrolled in this study. A total of 53 specimens were excluded from the study due to repeat iC-GPC Assay error, repeat Verigene BC-GP error, a mixed Gram stain result, or incomplete specimen data. Of the 1,081 remaining blood cultures evaluated in this study, 879 cultures were fresh prospective positive blood cultures tested within 8 h of culture positivity, 34 were frozen prospective positive blood cultures, and 168 were frozen simulated blood cultures representing low-prevalence bacteria possessing uncommon resistance markers. Specimens were stable for up to 8 h after initial bottle positivity, and bottles were stored on the blood culture bottle system, at room temperature, or refrigerated. After 8 h, aliquots were frozen for future repeat testing or discrepant analysis. Verigene BC-GP testing was performed at two clinical sites. Sites that performed internal Verigene testing tested positive blood culture specimens on the BC-GP assay within 8 h of bottle positivity. Sites that did not perform internal Verigene testing prepared frozen aliquots of the positive blood cultures and shipped the specimens on dry ice to an external site for testing. All patient specimens were deidentified prior to enrollment and tested in accordance with protocols approved by the Pearl institutional review board (IRB).

### Role of anaerobic blood cultures in neonatal bacteremia [^cb1a3bf3]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evaluation for neonatal sepsis routinely includes performing both aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures despite our lack of knowledge of the true incidence of anaerobic bacteremia in this age group and the consequences of not performing these paired cultures.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all blood cultures performed for neonates in a children's hospital. Clinically significant pathogens were defined as microorganisms that rarely are considered to be contaminants, that were recovered from multiple blood cultures or sites, or were considered significant according to the patient's attending physician. The chart of every patient with positive culture results was reviewed for patient characteristics.

Results

A total of 662 culture sets among 403 patients were obtained between November 1, 2013, and April 30, 2015. A clinically significant organism was isolated from 64 (9.7%) culture sets from 25 patients (1.9% contamination rate). A total of 56 organisms were isolated; 35 (62.5%) grew from both the aerobic and anaerobic bottles, 19 (33.9%) grew from the anaerobic bottle alone, and 2 (3.6%) grew from the aerobic bottle alone. One (0.2%) obligate anaerobic bacterium (Clostridium symbiosum) was identified.

Conclusions

Although the incidence of anaerobic bacteremia in neonates is rare, anaerobic culture remains important in this population, given the increased yield of both aerobic and facultative anaerobic organisms isolated from anaerobic blood culture bottles.

### Prevalence of antibiotic resistance in anaerobic bacteria: worrisome developments [^1dc0ba65]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Antibiotic-resistant anaerobic bacteria have become increasingly recognized as a confounding factor in the selection of therapeutic agents. The use of potent, broad-spectrum antibiotics as empirical therapy, along with appropriate adjunctive measures, has, in some ways, masked the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance problem that parallels that observed for nonanaerobic pathogens. The use of standardized testing methods that recognize resistance and an understanding of resistance mechanisms have become essential for the treatment of patients and the development of new agents.

### Spondylodiscitis with psoas abscess [^de1b9906]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Parvimonas micra (P. micra) is a Gram-positive anaerobic cocci, normally found in the oral cavity and rarely causes severe infections. We describe a rare clinical presentation of P. micra as spondylodiscitis and psoas abscess with haematogenous spread in an adult patient. MRI lumbar spine detected L2 and L3 spondylodiscitis. Blood cultures were positive at 48hours of incubation and P. micra was identified on anaerobic culture after 72hours. Isolates from bone biopsy confirms P. micra She was successfully treated with ceftriaxone, followed by oral metronidzole for a total of 8 weeks. The suspected origin of her P. micra was a dental cavity. Anaerobic bacteria tend to be underestimated in spondylodiscitis. In cases of slow growing organisms, we emphasise the importance of performing accurate identification including anaerobic bacteria to guide management. P. micra should be considered in patients with spondylodiscitis who had recent dental intervention or perioral infection.

### Anaerobic pleuropulmonary infection [^98531487]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Obligate anaerobes are the predominant constituents of normal oropharyngeal flora and produce pleuropulmonary infection in patients who are prone to aspirate. Obtaining material from these patients for culture from the site of infection that is uncontaminated by normal flora is problematic. In-vitro cultivation of obligate anaerobes requires rigorous anaerobic techniques and susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes is not standardized in many clinical microbiology laboratories. Few clinical trials of drugs have been done in patients with laboratory documented or putative anaerobic pulmonary infection. For these reasons the diagnosis and therapy of anaerobic pulmonary infection are frequently empirical and guided by published studies of in-vitro activity against collected clinical isolates. Several new drugs that have in-vitro activity against obligate anaerobes have recently become available for empirical treatment of pneumonia.

Pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) — synovial fluid microbiology practices emphasize that cultures for aerobic bacteria are routinely performed and laboratories should use chocolate (lysed sheep's blood) agar, and for young children it is now common practice to inoculate joint fluid directly into an aerobic blood culture bottle. In some cases of culture positive ABA, the Gram stain may be negative, and narrowing antimicrobial therapy based solely on the Gram stain is not advised. Anaerobic, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures should not be performed routinely in otherwise healthy children with primary ABA but should be performed for children who are immunocompromised, have penetrating injury to the joint, or have failed primary treatment, and other studies on joint fluid (e.g., pH, protein, LDH, lactate) are no longer recommended for routine use in children with suspected ABA.

### Anaerobic infections in children [^2cd848f0]. Microbes and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Anaerobic bacteria can cause a variety of endogenous infections in children. Because of their fastidious nature, they are difficult to isolate from infectious sites, and are often overlooked. Anaerobic infections can occur in all body sites, including the central nervous system, oral cavity, head and neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, skin, and soft tissues. They colonize the newborn after delivery and have been recovered from several types of neonatal infections. These include cellulitis of the site of fetal monitoring, neonatal aspiration pneumonia, bacteremia, conjunctivitis, omphalitis, and infant botulism. The lack of adequate therapy may lead to clinical failures. Their isolation requires appropriate methods of collection, transportation and cultivation of specimens. Treatment is complicated by their slow growth, their polymicrobial nature and their growing resistance to antimicrobials. Antimicrobial therapy is often the only form of therapy required, whereas in others it is an important adjunct to a surgical approach. Because anaerobes are generally recovered mixed with aerobic organisms, the choice of antimicrobial agents should provide coverage of both types of pathogens.

### Two cases of diskitis attributable to anaerobic bacteria in children [^5e6429f6]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Diskitis, an inflammation of the intervertebral disk, is generally attributable to Staphylococcus aureus and rarely Staphylococcus epidermidis, Kingella kingae, Enterobacteriaciae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. In many cases, no bacterial growth is obtained from infected intervertebral discs. Although anaerobic bacteria were recovered from adults with spondylodiscitis, these organisms were not reported before from children. The recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 2 children with diskitis is reported. Patient 1. A 10-year-old male presented with 6 weeks of low back pain and 2 weeks of low-grade fever and abdominal pain. Physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between thoracic vertebra 11 and lumbar vertebra 2. The patient had a temperature of 104 degrees F. Laboratory tests were within normal limits, except for erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which was 58 mm/hour. Blood culture showed no growth. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed minimal inflammatory changes in the 12th thoracic vertebra/first lumbar vertebra disk. There was no other abnormality. A computed tomography (CT)-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded bloody material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and Gram-positive cocci in chains. Cultures for anaerobic bacteria yielded heavy growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, which was susceptible to penicillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin 600 000 units every 6 hours for 3 weeks, and then oral amoxicillin, 500 mg every 6 hours for 3 weeks. The back pain resolved within 2 weeks, and the ESR returned to normal at the end of therapy. Follow-up for 3 years showed complete resolution of the infection. Patient 2. An 8-year-old boy presented with low back pain and low-grade fever, irritability, and general malaise for 10 days. He had had an upper respiratory tract infection with sore throat 27 days earlier, for which he received no therapy. The patient had a temperature of 102 degrees F, and physical examination was normal except for tenderness to percussion over the spine between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Laboratory tests were normal, except for the ESR (42 mm/hour). Radiographs of the spine showed narrowing of the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space and irregularity of the margins of the vertebral endplates. A CT scan revealed a lytic bone lesion at lumbar vertebra 4, and bone scan showed an increase uptake of (99m)technetium at the third to fourth lumbar vertebra disk space. CT-guided aspiration of the disk space yielded cloudy nonfoul-smelling material, which was sent for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. Gram stain showed numerous white blood cells and fusiform Gram-negative bacilli. Anaerobic culture grew light growth of Fusobacterium nucleatum. The organism produced beta-lactamase and was susceptible to ticarcillin-clavulanate, clindamycin, metronidazole, and imipenem. Therapy with clindamycin 450 mg every 8 hours was given parenterally for 3 weeks and orally for 3 weeks. Back pain resolved within 2 weeks. A 2-year follow-up showed complete resolution and no recurrence. This report describes, for the first time, the isolation of anaerobic bacteria from children with diskitis. The lack of their recovery in previous reports and the absence of bacterial growth in over two third of these studies may be caused by the use of improper methods for their collection, transportation, and cultivation. Proper choice of antimicrobial therapy for diskitis can be accomplished only by identification of the causative organisms and its antimicrobial susceptibility. This is of particular importance in infections caused by anaerobic bacteria that are often resistant to antimicrobials used to empirically treat diskitis. This was the case in our second patient, who was infected by F nucleatum, which was resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. The origin of the anaerobic bacteria causing the infection in our patient is probably of endogenous nature. The presence of abdominal pain in the first child may have been attributable to a subclinical abdominal pathothology. The preceding pharyngitis in the second patient may have been associated with a potential hematogenous spread of F nucleatum. P magnus has been associated with bone and joint infections. This report highlights the importance of obtaining disk space culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria from all children with diskitis. Future prospective studies are warranted to elucidate the role of anaerobic bacteria in diskitis in children.

### Time to first culture positivity among critically ill adults with methicillin-resistantGrowth in respiratory or blood cultures [^fd3a96fe]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Background: For critically ill adults receiving empirical vancomycin, the duration of negative cultures after which vancomycin may be discontinued without risking subsequent growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains unknown. Objective: We hypothesized that if sputum cultures did not grow MRSA or blood cultures did not grow Gram-positive cocci on Gram stain by 48 hours, those cultures would not subsequently demonstrate MRSA. Methods: We conducted an ancillary analysis from patients enrolled in the Isotonic Solutions and Major Adverse Renal Events Trial (SMART). In this cohort of patients, we collected data on the time of either MRSA identification in culture or Gram-positive cocci identification on Gram stain and rate of vancomycin discontinuation. Results: Of the 15802 patient admissions in the SMART study, 6553 (41.5%) received empirical intravenous vancomycin. Respiratory sputum cultures demonstrated MRSA during 178 patient admissions. Among respiratory cultures that would ultimately grow MRSA, 85% were positive within 48 hours, and 97% were positive within 72 hours. Cultures demonstrated MRSA bacteremia during 85 patient admissions. In 83 cases (97.6%) of MRSA bacteremia, Gram-positive cocci were identified within 48 hours after the culture was obtained. Conclusion and Relevance: This analysis of a large cohort of critically ill adults receiving empirical vancomycin found that Staphylococcus aureus was present in all but 15% of cases of MRSA-positive respiratory cultures after 48 hours, whereas Gram-positive cocci were identified within 48 hours during nearly all episodes of MRSA bacteremia. These findings may inform the timing of discontinuation of empirical vancomycin among critically ill adults.

### Evolution of anaerobe susceptibility testing in the United States [^698643b1]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Susceptibility testing of anaerobes has been described for approximately 45 years, some 15 years fewer than descriptions for aerobic organisms. During that time period, > 16 methods, > 16 media, and a host of other variables have been described in the United States literature, culminating in the most recent standards published by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) in 2001. These new guidelines include a single agar dilution reference method as well as an alternative minimal inhibitory concentration method validated by extensive multilaboratory collaborative trials. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration-approved E-test has proved valuable as a user-friendly alternative to NCCLS methods. Highlights of the "evolution" of various methods, their variations and their failures, factors that affected the development of the current standards, and the rationale for susceptibility testing of anaerobes are discussed herein.

### Functional decomposition of metabolism allows a system-level quantification of fluxes and protein allocation towards specific metabolic functions [^10ac89dd]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

The comparison between aerobic and anaerobic growth also suggests that cellular energetics do not impact cellular growth on glycolytic sources significantly. In anaerobic conditions, the glucose intake flux for wild-type E. coli is > 2 times than that in aerobic conditions, with a corresponding reduction in growth yield (Supplementary Fig. 5 l). The increase in overall glucose flux is mainly driven by the ~ 7-fold increase in energy-associated glucose intake required for aerobic growth (~ 2 mmol/g DW /h, Fig. 2 f) compared to anaerobic growth (~ 15mmol/g DW /h, Supplementary Fig. 5 m) at the same growth rate of ~ 0.75/h. This increase is necessary to compensate for the drop in energetic efficiency in anaerobic conditions, yielding at most 2.5 ATP per glucose molecule (Supplementary Fig. 5 g), compared to up to 24 ATPs aerobically (Supplementary Fig. 4 d). Despite these large changes in growth yield and energetic efficiency, the maximum growth rate on glucose is only reduced by less than 20%. Overall, our results suggest that neither carbon availability nor energy is the main limiting factors for aerobic growth on glycolytic carbon sources. Rather, the differences in growth rates might stem from the varied expression levels of the catabolic proteins, and are possibly modulated by the expression of other underutilized proteins.

### Subsp.andas emerging human uropathogens in elderly patients [^059bbb3c]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common human infections in both community and hospital settings, affecting 150 million people each year worldwide, with significant morbidity and high medical costs. In both settings, Enterobacterales are responsible for the vast majority of UTIs, predominantly uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. Besides Gram-negative bacilli, UTIs can also be caused by Gram-positive bacteria such as enterococci, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, or Streptococcus agalactiae. Furthermore, emerging Gram-positive species have recently been described as true uropathogens: Actinotignum (formerly Actinobaculum) schaalii and Aerococcus spp. (A. urinae and A. sanguinicola).

Lactobacilli are non-spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic or microaerophilic, non-nitrate-reducing, non-motile Gram-positive rods. These microorganisms are ubiquitous and widespread commensals in human and animal microbiota. In humans, they are usually considered non-pathogenic as they are common inhabitants of the oropharynx, the gastrointestinal tract, and the female genital tract. Like other lactic acid bacteria (e.g. pediococci, lactococci) and bifidobacteria, they are widely used as starter cultures in the food industry (for fermented milk products or sausages) or as probiotic preparations. Due to their fastidious growth under aerobic conditions and their resemblance to bacterial species of the resident microbiota, lactobacilli have frequently been overlooked or regarded as contaminants. Additionally, it has long been challenging to identify them to the species level using conventional phenotypic-based methods. Although the advent of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry has greatly improved their identification, molecular identification is still required in some cases. Nonetheless, they can occasionally cause invasive infections, such as bacteremia and endocarditis, which are the most frequent, followed by intra-abdominal and respiratory infections, UTIs, endophthalmitis, chorioamnionitis, and meningitis as well as various abscesses and wound infections. The main species recovered from human infections, knowing that the genus Lactobacillus was extensively modified and several species have been reassigned to novel genus names, include Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (formerly Lactobacillus rhamnosus), Lacticaseibacillus casei (formerly Lactobacillus casei), and Lactobacillus gasseri followed by Limosilactobacillus fermentum (formerly Lactobacillus fermentum), Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (formerly Lactobacillus paracasei), Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (formerly Lactobacillus plantarum). These infections are often associated with underlying conditions such as immunosuppression, neutropenia, cancer, diabetes, previous surgery or endoscopy, invasive procedures (central venous or urinary catheterization, intubation/ventilation, dental procedure), prosthetic material, renal failure, or prolonged ineffective antibiotic therapy.

### Iron reduction under oxic conditions by microbacterium deferre sp. nov. A1-JK [^bf7482ab]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

In this work, a novel Gram-positive bacterium, Microbacterium deferre A1-JK T, was isolated from the cable bacteria-transversed microaerophilic veil and studied for its electroactive metabolism. Unlike Gram-negative bacteria such as S. oneidensis and G. sulfurreducens, Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane and instead possess a thick peptidoglycan cell wall, which limits direct electron transfer across the cell envelope. Consequently, Gram-positive bacteria typically rely on soluble redox shuttles, such as flavins, to mediate EET. Direct interspecies electron transfer via outer membrane cytochromes is rare in Gram-positives, with Thermincola potens JR being one notable exception.

Microbacterium species are found in diverse environmental conditions, including a high-altitude desert, human clinical specimensand even a radioactive waste site. As polyextremophiles, members of Microbacterium can grow as psychrophiles, halophiles, both acido- and alkaliphiles under a wide range of pH conditions (pH 5–11) and as facultative anaerobes. In pure cultures, M. deferre A1-JK T displays metabolic flexibility and can utilise several carbon sources, as most others of this genus. Our experiments demonstrate that it can anaerobically respire Fe(III) and electrodes through flavin-mediated EET. We present the mechanism of EET in M. deferre A1-JK T along with a potential model of its electron transfer pathway, supported by physiological and genomic analyses. Further, we demonstrate the reduction of Fe(III) by M. deferre A1-JK T under aerobic conditions, contrary to the widely accepted notion of Fe(III) reduction occurring only anaerobically. This discovery has implications for understanding microbial biogeochemical cycling on modern as well as early Earth transitioning towards the Great Oxidation Event. Besides, it offers opportunities to study bifurcations in microbial metabolism, which bacteria may use to optimise growth and survival in dynamic environments.

### The nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis supports anaerobic growth of Listeria monocytogenes [^f8b660df]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Isoprenoids are an essential and diverse class of molecules, present in all forms of life, that are synthesized from an essential common precursor derived from either the mevalonate pathway or the nonmevalonate pathway. Most bacteria have one pathway or the other, but the Gram-positive, facultative intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes is unusual because it carries all the genes for both pathways. While the mevalonate pathway has previously been reported to be essential, here we demonstrate that the nonmevalonate pathway can support growth of strains 10403S and EGD-e, but only anaerobically. L. monocytogenes lacking the gene hmgR, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, had a doubling time of 4 h under anaerobic conditions, in contrast to the 45 min doubling time of the wild type. In contrast, deleting hmgR in two clinical isolates resulted in mutants that grew significantly faster, doubling in approximately 2 h anaerobically, although they still failed to grow under aerobic conditions without mevalonate. The difference in anaerobic growth rate was traced to three amino acid changes in the nonmevalonate pathway enzyme GcpE, and these changes were sufficient to increase the growth rate of 10403S to the rate observed in the clinical isolates. Despite an increased growth rate, virulence was still dependent on the mevalonate pathway in 10403S strains expressing the more active GcpE allele.

### Getting to zero: impact of a device to reduce blood culture contamination and false-positive central-line-associated bloodstream infections [^f33bfba2]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study showed that blood-culture contamination was dramatically reduced when phlebotomists used the ISDD on both inpatients and ED patients. Conversely, according to definitions outlined herein, we observed 172 patients with contaminated blood cultures drawn via traditional venipuncture, who could have suffered potential harm, including 2 patients who may have received excess antibiotics.

The overall reduction in BCC was accompanied by a reduction in reported CLABSIs in 2019 compared with 2017 and 2018. Although the reduction in CLABSIs between 2017 and 2018 may have been associated with the implementation of a more active skin preparation via swabbing with a larger volume of chlorhexidine, we consider the intervention described here to be the sole contributor to the subsequent decreased CLABSI SIR observed throughout 2019. False-positive CLABSIs may not only compromise clinical care but also have significant implications for benchmark rankings. During the year of the study, our medical center achieved a top-10 ranking in patient safety from Vizient, a consortium of 101 academic medical centers that ranks each member on healthcare-associated infection rates and many other factors. This achievement is due, in part, to our low CLABSI incidence.

We also noted a decrease in number of blood-culture sets containing a single bottle of either Candida spp or VRE. In the authors' experience, enterococci and other gram-positive cocci replicate to very high numbers if present in an intravascular focus (eg, central line) and are usually present in all 4 bottles. By NHSN surveillance definitions, a single bottle of a matched 4-bottle set containing VRE is considered to be a true CLABSI, despite published studies showing that VRE can be present on the skin of patients who carry the organism in the gastrointestinal tract. At present, a single blood-culture bottle containing Candida spp is also considered evidence of true candidemia based on a historical clinical evaluation. However, at that time, laboratory guidelines recommended that matched blood-culture sets should consist of 2 aerobic bottles and 2 anaerobic bottles. Our laboratory uses 3 aerobic bottles in each 4-bottle set, and in our experience, at least 2 aerobic bottles are likely to be positive in patients with candidemia. As this pertains to the definition of BCC used here, we invite further input and future studies on this topic.

### A quasi-universal medium to break the aerobic / anaerobic bacterial culture dichotomy in clinical microbiology [^e1aff8f8]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

In the mid-19th century, the dichotomy between aerobic and anaerobic bacteria was introduced. Nevertheless, the aerobic growth of strictly anaerobic bacterial species such as Ruminococcus gnavus and Fusobacterium necrophorum, in a culture medium containing antioxidants, was recently demonstrated. We tested aerobically the culture of 623 bacterial strains from 276 bacterial species including 82 strictly anaerobic, 154 facultative anaerobic, 31 aerobic and nine microaerophilic bacterial species as well as ten fungi. The basic culture medium was based on Schaedler agar supplemented with 1 g/L ascorbic acid and 0.1 g/L glutathione (R-medium). We successively optimized this media, adding 0.4 g/L uric acid, using separate autoclaving of the component, or adding haemin 0.1 g/L or α-ketoglutarate 2 g/L. In the basic medium, 237 bacterial species and ten fungal species grew but with no growth of 36 bacterial species, including 22 strict anaerobes. Adding uric acid allowed the growth of 14 further species including eight strict anaerobes, while separate autoclaving allowed the growth of all tested bacterial strains. To extend its potential use for fastidious bacteria, we added haemin for Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae and Eikenella corrodens and α-ketoglutarate for Legionella pneumophila. This medium allowed the growth of all tested strains with the exception of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis. Testing primoculture and more fastidious species will constitute the main work to be done, but R-medium coupled with a rapid identification method (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry) will facilitate the anaerobic culture in clinical microbiology laboratories.

Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Serratia spp. Acinetobacter spp. Enterobacter spp. P. aeruginosa, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Proteus vulgaris, P. mirabilis, Bacteroides spp., including B. fragilis, anaerobic cocci, or enterococci.

Bone and Joint Infections caused by P. aeruginosa, enterococci, Bacteroides spp., or anaerobic cocci.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Urethritis caused by N. gonorrhoeae.

PIPRACIL has also been shown to be clinically effective for the treatment
of infections at various sites caused by Streptococcus species including S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae; however, infections caused by these organisms are ordinarily treated
with more narrow spectrum penicillins. Because of its broad spectrum
of bactericidal activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic
and anaerobic bacteria, PIPRACIL is particularly useful for the treatment
of mixed infections and presumptive therapy prior to the identification
of the causative organisms.

Also, PIPRACIL
may be administered as single drug therapy in some situations where
normally two antibiotics might be employed.

Piperacillin has been successfully used with aminoglycosides, especially
in patients with impaired host defenses. Both drugs should be used
in full therapeutic doses.

### Major gut microbiota perturbations in firstborn infants compared to those with older siblings soon after delivery [^9a8a19ac]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

For each sample, metrics for analysis were a) the presence/absence of each bacterial species/genus/group and b) its population count (CFU/g of feces; measured in colonized children only) and c) the ratio of population counts of anaerobic to facultative bacteria (anaerobic/facultative ratio), as a measure of the anaerobic character of the microbiota. The population count of facultatives was assessed by culture on non-selective medium under aerobic conditions. The population count of anaerobic bacteria was assessed by growth on non-selective medium under anaerobic conditions, from which we subtracted the counts of isolates which could also grow under aerobic conditions (determined by subculture).

PHOTO QUIZ

A 55-year-old patient with a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease presents with malaise and fever for approximately 1 week. On physical examination, he was found to have a painful lower extremity, and non-healing ulcer present for approximately a month. The ulcer is 3.0 cm in diameter and ulcerated with a hyperemic border. He has two dogs and a pet fish. No significant travel or vocational history is noted. Blood cultures are collected and submitted to the microbiology laboratory. Growth was detected in the aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles after 16-hour incubation. A representative Gram stain of the blood cultures is pictured (Fig. 1A). Subcultured colonies were visible on the sheep blood agar (Fig. 1B: 48-hour incubation); there was no growth on MacConkey agar. Bubbles formed when the colony was exposed to hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1C). Latex agglutination testing with the Lancefield group B reagent produced a weak reaction showing fine clumping (Fig. 1D). The VEREGENE System (Luminex) Gram-positive panel was negative. What is the diagnosis?

### Multilaboratory comparison of growth characteristics for anaerobes, using 5 different agar media [^81ac4a89]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A multilaboratory study compared the growth of 30 fastidious anaerobes, using 5 different agar media: Wilkins-Chalgren (WC), WC with either whole or laked sheep blood, and Brucella supplemented with vitamin K(1) and hemin and either laked or whole sheep blood. The media were compared for quality and quantity of growth. Experiments were conducted either entirely in an anaerobic chamber or inoculated in ambient air with anaerobic incubation. The results showed that (1) any medium plus whole or laked blood was better than unsupplemented WC, (2) whole blood and laked blood additives gave similar results, (3) supplemented Brucella with whole or laked blood was superior to WC and WC with whole or laked blood, and (4) anaerobic and aerobic inoculation with anaerobic incubation gave similar results. Brucella agar supplemented with whole or laked blood supports the growth of fastidious anaerobic species better than the WC agars do.

Leuconostoc lactis is an intrinsically glycopeptide-resistant but ampicillin-susceptible, gram-positive, facultative anaerobic coccus found in food products including dairy products, vegetables, and wine. L. lactis is a very rare pathogen associated with bloodstream infections. Staphylococcus nepalensis is a novobiocin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus also found in food products, such as dry-cured ham and fish sauce, that has not been reported as a human pathogen. Neither L. lactis nor S. nepalensis is part of normal human bacterial flora.

A 71-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia sought care for upper abdominal pain and vomiting after a meal at his son's restaurant. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed collapse of the lower esophagus wall and expansion of the mediastinum; medical staff diagnosed a spontaneous esophageal rupture and performed emergency surgery. Surgical findings demonstrated a 5 cm perforation of the lower esophagus with no rupture to the thoracic and abdominal cavity. The final diagnosis included Boerhaave syndrome, esophageal hiatus hernia, and mediastinitis. Two sets of blood culture taken on day 1 were positive for gram-positive cocci, which we identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry as L. lactis in an aerobic bottle (10.7 h to culture) and an anaerobic bottle (13.3 h to culture) and S. nepalensis in 1 anaerobic bottle (24.3 h to culture). The 2 bacteria were indications of true bacteremia; therefore, we escalated ampicillin/sulbactam (treatment to piperacillin/tazobactam for L. lactis (Appendix Table 1) and initiated vancomycin treatment for S. nepalensis on day 3 after admission (Appendix Table 2). We measured MICs in the microdilution method using the MicroScan WalkAway 96 SI system (Beckman Coulter,) with a MICrofast7J panel and determined the susceptibility of L. lactis according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. On day 7, we deescalated piperacillin/tazobactam to ampicillin/sulbactam, referring to the MICs, and we obtained follow-up sets of blood culture. The culture results were negative. We discontinued vancomycin by day 14 but maintained the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen. A follow-up CT scan on day 28 showed a subsiding mediastinal abscess. Moreover, a pathological examination of the surgical biopsy demonstrated no esophageal cancer. On the basis of the clinical course of the disease, we strongly suspected a breakthrough of L. lactis and S. nepalensis through the ruptured esophagus into the bloodstream. To prove this relationship, we obtained permission from the patient's son to analyze samples of the food products his father consumed, including cheese, dry-cured ham, sauerkraut, pizza margherita, bianchetti (pasta with boiled young sardines), and red and white wine. We cultured samples from these products on blood agar medium; colonies of L. lactis, confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, were derived from cheese samples (Figure).

### Unusual aerobic and anaerobic bacteria associated with prosthetic joint infections [^dcf427d7]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2006). Low credibility.

The association of certain microorganisms, such as Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, with prosthetic joint infection (PJI) has been recognized for many years. To our knowledge, a systematic review of the presentation and management of less commonly encountered species of coagulase-negative staphylococci, nutritional-variant streptococci, aerobic non-spore and spore forming Gram-positive or anaerobic bacteria is not available. We therefore sought to provide a comprehensive literature review of PJI due to these microorganisms that will provide a valuable and quick reference for clinicians caring for these patients. We conducted a Medline search of all case reports and case series of PJI due to unusual aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The presentation, surgical, and medical management strategies were reviewed. Appropriate medical and surgical management of such infections is complex and evolving as newer diagnostic tests, surgical techniques and antimicrobials become available. Management of patients with these infections requires close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon, infectious disease specialist and microbiology laboratory.

### Early care of adults with suspected sepsis in the Emergency department and out-of-hospital environment: a consensus-based task force Report [^30e9d72b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Blood cultures in suspected sepsis — timing, number, and catheter considerations are specified: Although sending samples for culture does not affect initial treatment, isolation of a pathogen from samples collected early and prior to antibiotics can provide confirmation and enhance appropriate antibiotic tailoring because cultures taken after antibiotics have substantially lower yields. We recommend collecting blood cultures as early as feasible and before administration of antibiotics, unless culture collection will delay antibiotic administration, and taking 2 sets of blood cultures (1 aerobic bottle and 1 anaerobic bottle in each set) obtained from separate sites over a short time period is common practice. In a patient with a suspected infection involving an indwelling vascular catheter, collecting one set of blood cultures from the catheter in addition to peripheral blood cultures (with time-to-positivity testing) is one strategy to aid diagnosis of a catheter-related bloodstream infection, and in patients with suspected infection and signs of clinical instability (eg, hypotension), we recommend starting antibiotic therapy promptly after blood cultures are drawn.

### Clinical performance of the novel genMark Dx ePlex blood culture ID Gram-Positive panel [^34a4f63d]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Specimen collection.

A total of 719 samples with positive Gram stain results were prospectively collected; 400 samples were collected from June 2014 through July 2016 from three sites and frozen for future testing, and 319 samples were collected from January through March 2018 from five sites and tested fresh. The majority of samples were collected from subjects at hospitals or medical centers. To supplement the results of the prospective collection, 586 samples with positive Gram stain results for lower-prevalence Gram-positive organisms were retrospectively collected from 10 sites. Additionally, 566 samples were contrived for Gram-positive organisms with very low prevalence. For evaluation of the Pan targets only, 484 retrospective samples with Gram-negative or fungal Gram stain results were included.

Contrived samples were prepared by aseptically injecting 3 to 10 mL of human whole blood (Bioreclamation, Westbury, NY) into a BD Bactec blood culture bottle (Plus Aerobic/F, Plus Anaerobic/F, Lytic/10 Anaerobic/F, or Peds Plus/F). Table S1 in the supplemental material contains a list of organisms used for the contrived samples. The 27 Micrococcus samples were contrived using quantified glycerol stocks spiked into incubated blood. For the remaining samples, the bottles were then inoculated with a colony or colonies from a pure culture. The bacterial suspension was prepared by using a loop to collect fresh culture from an agar plate and suspending it in saline to approximately a 0.5 McFarland standard via reading the optical desity at 600 nm (OD 600) (0.5 McFarland is approximately 1.5 × 10 8 CFU/ml). This bacterial suspension was diluted either 1:100 (n = 483), 1:1,000 (n = 27), or 1:10,000 (n = 29), and then either 100 μl (n = 499) or 1 mL (n = 40) was used to inoculate a Bactec bottle containing blood. The 1-ml inoculum was used for some of the Bacillus andreplicates. The inoculum volumes were determined based on successful growth and time to detection in preliminary studies. The CFU added to the bottles ranged from ∼1 × 10 3 to 2 × 10 6. The time to detection varied from 7 h to 5 days in 97% of the samples and was up to 10 days for the remaining samples. Of note, the organisms that required more than 5 days were Bacillus spp. Lactobacillus spp. Corynebacterium spp. and.

### Controlled clinical comparison of BACTEC plus anaerobic / F to standard anaerobic / F as the anaerobic companion bottle to plus aerobic / F medium for culturing blood from adults [^e4c6d234]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the optimal anaerobic companion bottle to pair with BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F medium for recovery of pathogenic microorganisms from adult patients with bacteremia and fungemia, we compared Plus Anaerobic/F bottles with Standard Anaerobic/F bottles, each of which was filled with 4 to 6 mL of blood. The two bottles were paired with a Plus Aerobic/F bottle filled with 8 to 12 mL of blood. A total of 14,011 blood culture sets were obtained. Of these, 11,583 sets were received with all three bottles filled adequately and 12,257 were received with both anaerobic bottles filled adequately. Of 818 clinically important isolates detected in one or both adequately filled anaerobic bottles, significantly more staphylococci (P < 0.001), streptococci (P < 0.005), Escherichia coli isolates (P < 0.02), Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (P < 0.005), and all microorganisms combined (P < 0.001) were detected in Plus Anaerobic/F bottles. In contrast, significantly more anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were detected in Standard Anaerobic/F bottles (P < 0.05). Of 397 unimicrobial episodes of septicemia, 354 were detected with both pairs, 30 were detected with Plus Aerobic/F-Plus Anaerobic/F pairs only, and 13 were detected with Plus Aerobic/F-Standard Anaerobic/F pairs only (P < 0.05). Significantly more episodes of bacteremia caused by members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.05) and aerobic and facultative gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.025) were detected with Plus Anaerobic/F bottles only. In a paired-bottle analysis, 810 of 950 isolates were recovered from both pairs, 90 were recovered from Plus Aerobic/F-Plus Anaerobic/F pairs only, and 50 were recovered from Plus Aerobic/F-Standard Anaerobic/F pairs only (P < 0.001). Paired Plus Aerobic/F-Plus Anaerobic/F bottles yielded significantly more staphylococci (P < 0.001), streptococci (P < 0.05), and members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (P < 0.001). We conclude that Plus Anaerobic/F bottles detect more microorganisms and episodes of bacteremia and fungemia than Standard Anaerobic/F bottles as companion bottles to Plus Aerobic/F bottles in the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system.

### Direct identification of Staphylococcus aureus from positive blood culture bottles [^f720ea97]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2003). Low credibility.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes targeting Staphylococcus aureus 16S rRNA is a novel method for direct identification of S. aureus from positive blood culture bottles. The test (S. aureus PNA FISH) is performed on smears made directly from positive blood culture bottles with gram-positive cocci in clusters (GPCC) and provides results within 2.5 h. A blinded comparison of S. aureus PNA FISH with standard identification methods was performed in collaboration with eight clinical microbiology laboratories. A total of 564 routine blood culture bottles positive for GPCC recovered from both aerobic and anaerobic media from three different manufacturers (ESP, BACTEC, and BacT/Alert) were included in the study. The sensitivity and specificity of S. aureus PNA FISH were 100% (57 of 57) and 99.2% (116 of 117), respectively, with 174 GPCC-positive ESP blood culture bottles, 98.5% (67 of 68) and 98.5% (129 of 131), respectively, with 200 GPCC-positive BACTEC blood culture bottles, and 100% (74 of 74) and 99.1% (115 of 116), respectively, with 190 GPCC-positive BacT/Alert blood culture bottles. It is concluded that S. aureus PNA FISH performs well with commonly used continuously monitoring blood culture systems.
