## Question

A 42-year-old woman with well-controlled hypertension presents to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever, myalgia, sore throat, and dry cough. She is otherwise healthy and has no history of immunodeficiency. A rapid influenza diagnostic test is positive for influenza A. She is admitted for supportive care due to persistent vomiting and inability to tolerate oral medications. The admitting resident considers starting intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in addition to standard antiviral therapy, citing possible immune benefits.

According to current IDSA guidelines, should intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) be administered routinely to this patient for the treatment of seasonal influenza? Justify your answer based on the guideline recommendation.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) should be administered routinely to a 42-year-old immunocompetent woman hospitalized with seasonal influenza A, and how to justify that decision based on current IDSA guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's risk profile and whether she meets criteria for standard-of-care antivirals. Then, I should verify what the IDSA guideline actually recommends regarding IVIG for seasonal influenza. Next, I will examine the strength of evidence and grading behind that recommendation. After that, I should review the pivotal randomized trial data on hyperimmune IVIG to ensure there isn't a subgroup signal I'm missing. Finally, I will consider practical alternatives for vomiting and outline the bottom-line recommendation with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and risk stratification. The patient is a 42-year-old with well-controlled hypertension, no immunodeficiency, and a 2-day history of influenza A confirmed by rapid testing. She is hospitalized primarily for persistent vomiting precluding oral intake, which is a logistical issue rather than a marker of severe influenza disease, and she does not meet high-risk categories for complications such as age ≥ 65, pregnancy, chronic lung disease, immunocompromise, or extreme obesity, so her baseline risk is not high for severe outcomes [^7fec5449] [^367b808f].

> Wait, let me verify the standard of care before discussing IVIG. The IDSA recommends initiating antiviral therapy as soon as possible for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed influenza, irrespective of vaccination status, and to use a single neuraminidase inhibitor such as oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or IV peramivir. Combination neuraminidase inhibitors are not recommended, and higher-than-approved dosing is not advised, though in patients unable to take oral medications, IV peramivir is a reasonable option to ensure timely antiviral delivery [^e7d789ef] [^84fab550] [^56a890c4].

> I need to check the guideline stance on IVIG specifically. The IDSA explicitly recommends that clinicians should not routinely administer immunomodulation with immunoglobulin preparations such as IVIG for treatment of adults or children with suspected or confirmed seasonal influenza, assigning this a strong recommendation with moderate-quality evidence (A-III), which directly addresses the resident's proposal [^b25d3944] [^ca74aa92] [^924aa4e7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should review the pivotal evidence underpinning that recommendation. The FLU-IVIG randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized adults with influenza A or B found no overall benefit of hyperimmune IVIG over placebo on the primary ordinal outcome at day 7, with an odds ratio of 1.25 and a 95% CI that crossed 1, indicating no significant improvement. Importantly, there was a signal of benefit in influenza B but not in influenza A, and the trial was not powered to establish mortality differences, so routine use cannot be justified for influenza A based on this study [^932399a9] [^e429184b] [^103bc19b].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence and grading. The IDSA's A-III rating reflects good evidence supporting a recommendation against routine use, with evidence from well-designed clinical trials and expert consensus, and the negative results of FLU-IVIG, along with other randomized and observational data showing no consistent benefit of passive immunotherapy in seasonal influenza, align with this grading and recommendation [^ba4a5b78] [^b25d3944] [^c3faeee8].

> But wait, what if the vomiting is the barrier to oral therapy? I need to ensure we have a practical, guideline-concordant alternative. In patients who cannot take oral medications, IV peramivir is an appropriate single-dose neuraminidase inhibitor that maintains timely antiviral therapy without relying on enteral absorption, and this approach is consistent with IDSA guidance for hospitalized patients who cannot tolerate oral therapy [^84fab550] [^56a890c4].

> Let me reconsider any potential exceptions. The only subgroup signal in FLU-IVIG was a possible benefit in influenza B, not influenza A, and even that requires confirmation before routine adoption. Moreover, this patient has influenza A, so that potential exception does not apply, and the balance of evidence and guideline direction remains against IVIG here [^932399a9] [^e429184b].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the recommendation clearly. No, IVIG should not be administered routinely to this patient. The IDSA recommends against routine IVIG for seasonal influenza, the highest-quality randomized trial shows no benefit for influenza A, and the appropriate course is to provide standard antiviral therapy, using IV peramivir if oral intake is not feasible, while continuing supportive care for dehydration and symptom control [^b25d3944] [^ca74aa92] [^932399a9] [^84fab550].

---

Routine IVIG is **not recommended** for seasonal influenza in immunocompetent adults [^b25d3944], including this patient with confirmed influenza A and persistent vomiting. IDSA advises against routine IVIG because **no clinical benefit** has been demonstrated [^932399a9] and it carries risks and high cost. The standard of care is **timely antivirals** (oseltamivir via NG/OG or IV peramivir) plus supportive care; IVIG should be reserved for research or exceptional cases, not routine use [^924aa4e7].

---

## IDSA guideline recommendations

The IDSA explicitly **recommends against routine IVIG** for seasonal influenza in adults and children [^b25d3944] [^ca74aa92]. This is a strong recommendation (A-III) based on moderate-quality evidence showing no clinical benefit and potential harms [^ba4a5b78].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials

The FLU-IVIG randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in hospitalized adults with influenza A or B found **no overall benefit** of hyperimmune IVIG over placebo for clinical status at day 7 (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.79–1.97; p = 0.33) [^932399a9] [^e429184b]. A signal of benefit was seen in influenza B, but not in influenza A, and the authors concluded that routine use is not supported and that further research is needed [^127f66d0] [^3085f0c3]. Earlier small RCTs of hyperimmune IVIG in severe H1N1 showed mixed results and were underpowered, so they do not support routine use [^8ec91019] [^34e4b907].

---

## Risks and limitations of IVIG

IVIG carries **meaningful risks and limitations**:

- **Infusion reactions**: Headache, fever, chills, and rare anaphylaxis.
- **Thrombotic events**: Increased risk, especially in older adults or those with vascular disease.
- **Hemolysis**: Risk in patients with irregular antibodies.
- **High cost and limited supply**: Substantial expense and resource use without proven benefit [^5cfd5d80].

---

## Alternative evidence-based management

For this patient, **evidence-based management** includes:

- **Antiviral therapy**: Oseltamivir via NG/OG tube or IV peramivir as soon as possible; IV peramivir is appropriate when oral intake is not feasible [^84fab550] [^56a890c4].
- **Supportive care**: IV fluids, antiemetics, and monitoring for complications [^notfound].
- **Monitoring**: Watch for clinical deterioration, bacterial coinfection, or respiratory compromise [^fc44ed7a].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Routine IVIG is **not indicated** for this patient. IDSA recommends against its use given the lack of benefit, potential risks, and high cost. Management should focus on prompt antivirals and supportive care, with IVIG reserved for research or exceptional circumstances, not routine clinical practice [^b25d3944] [^924aa4e7].

Influenza — passive immunotherapy: Immunotherapy with plasma, immune serum globulin, or IVIg can result in immune-modulating as well as virus neutralizing activity. Following infection, influenza virus strain-specific antiviral activity is present in convalescent plasma of immunocompetent persons. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a prospective cohort study in Hong Kong reported that treatment with convalescent plasma containing virus-specific neutralizing antibodies reduced respiratory tract A(H1N1)pdm09 viral load, serum cytokine response, and mortality compared with untreated patients.

IDSA seasonal influenza — nonresponse or deterioration on antivirals: Clinicians should investigate other causes besides influenza virus infection in influenza patients who fail to improve or deteriorate despite antiviral treatment (A-III). In patients who do not demonstrate clinical improvement after at least 2–3 days of antiviral treatment, especially when treatment is initiated early in the clinical course, consideration should be given to potential alternative explanations. Evaluation and management should be individualized.

Serious adverse events and grade 3 and 4 adverse eventswere categorised according to codes used in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 21.0.

Statistical analysis

The trial was designed to enrol 320 patients. This sample size provides 80% power to detect an odds ratio (OR) of 1·77 for hIVIG versus placebo at the 0·05 (2-sided) level of significance (appendix p 7).ORs greater than 1·0 correspond to more favourable outcomes on hIVIG use compared with placebo.

An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board met five times during the trial to review interim safety and efficacy data (appendix p 13). The Board was asked to recommend early termination or modification of the trial only when there was clear and substantial evidence of a treatment difference. As a guideline, the Lan-DeMets spending function analogue of the O'Brien-Fleming boundaries was used to monitor the primary endpoint. After approximately 70% of patients were enrolled, a futility analysis was provided to the Board by the unmasked statisticians. As a guideline, the Board was asked to consider futility if conditional power was less than 10%, given the observed data and the hypothesised treatment effect thereafter. These reviews by the Board did not lead to any modifications of the trial. No one except Board members and the unmasked statisticians had access to data summarising treatment comparisons.

FLU-IVIG trial profile

hIVIG = hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin.

Apart from the patients enrolled while in intensive care, more of whom were in the placebo group (23 [15%]) than the hIVIG group (12 [8%]), the two treatment groups were well balanced at baseline (table 1, appendix p 14). Median age was 57 years (IQR 45–68), and 168 (55%) of the 308 patients were women. 73 (24%) of all patients had an A(H1N1) infection, 137 (44%) had an A(H3N2) infection, and 84 (27%) had an influenza B infection. The proportion of patients with influenza A ranged from 69 (64%) of 107 patients recruited between October, 2016, and September, 2017, to 14 (87%) of 16 patients recruited between December, 2013, and September, 2014, over the five seasons of enrolment (appendix p 27). The median number of days since symptom onset at entry was 3 (2–5) and median NEW score at enrolment was 4 points (2–6). 256 (83%) of the 308 evaluable patients were randomly assigned to groups on the date of screening, and for these patients the baseline and eligibility NEW scores are identical. The remaining 52 (17%) patients were screened on the day before randomisation, and for these patients the baseline NEW score could have decreased below 2 points. Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir) was prescribed to 148 (95%) patients in the hIVIG group and to 144 (95%) patients in the placebo group (appendix p 14). For 155 (50%) patients, oseltamivir was administered no later than 2 days after symptom onset.

These results raise at least two obvious questions: (1) whether conventional haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres, despite their longstanding use as predictors of post-vaccination efficacy against both influenza A and B, are truly an appropriate surrogate for an effective humoral response in therapeutic studies against influenza A, and hence whether better markers of antibody-mediated activity might exist that should be substituted, and (2) whether the overall host immune response to infection with influenza B might differ in some fundamental way from that against influenza A. It is known, for example, that acute influenza infection is also associated with pronounced impairment of the cellular immune response, including defective T-cell responses and a sometimes lethal unbridling of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade. It is possible that the two major types of influenza virus interact differentially with the immune system and that, for example, the neutralising activity of virus-specific antibodies is more important in the host response to B virus infection than to infection with virus A. Alternatively, the immunomodulatory effectsof the Fc portion of IVIG itself might behave differently in patients with either of these two types of influenza. It might also be conjectured that the generally greater antiviral potency of oseltamivir against influenza A subtypes than against influenza B might somehow have overshadowed the potential additive beneficial effects of the immunotherapy in the subset of patients with influenza A infection. However, arguing strongly against this possibility are the observations that (1) the improvement in viral titres over time in the influenza A subgroup was, in fact, worse than in the influenza B subgroup, and (2) the absence of benefit in the influenza A subgroup was no different in those for whom antiviral treatment was started early (ie, within 2 days of symptom onset) than in those in whom treatment was delayed.

Outcomes

An ordinal outcome with six mutually exclusive categories was used to describe the patient's clinical status during follow-up. The six categories were: (1) death; (2) in intensive care; (3) hospitalised but requiring supplemental oxygen; (4) hospitalised and not requiring supplemental oxygen; (5) discharged but unable to resume normal activities; or (6) discharged with full resumption of normal activities. Day 7 was the timepoint chosen for assesment of the primary ordinal outcome on the basis of the results of the pilot study, which showed that hIVIG rapidly increases haemagglutination inhibition titres against influenza A virus well above protective concentrations induced by seasonal vaccination, and that differences in haemagglutination inhibition titres between hIVIG and placebo solutions were greatest in the first few days after infusion of hIVIG. We also considered that measures of clinical status at subsequent timepoints could probably reflect the effect of comorbidities instead of influenza infection and potentially obscure any treatment differences. The properties of the novel ordinal outcome we used for the primary endpoint have already been described.

Prespecified secondary outcomes to assess the clinical status of patients are detailed in the panel and the rationale for any modifications is detailed in the appendix (pp 42–45).

Summary

Background

Since the 1918 influenza pandemic, non-randomised studies and small clinical trials have suggested that convalescent plasma or anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) might have clinical benefit for patients with influenza infection, but definitive data do not exist. We aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hIVIG in a randomised controlled trial.

Methods

This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was planned for 45 hospitals in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Greece, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, UK, and the USA over five influenza seasons from 2013–14 to 2017–18. Adults (≥ 18 years of age) were admitted for hospital treatment with laboratory-confirmed influenza A or B infection and were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive standard care plus either a single 500-mL infusion of high-titre hIVIG (0·25 g/kg bodyweight, 24·75 g maximum; hIVIG group) or saline placebo (placebo group). Eligible patients had a National Early Warning score of 2 points or greater at the time of screening and their symptoms began no more than 7 days before randomisation. Pregnant and breastfeeding women were excluded, as well as any patients for whom the treatment would present a health risk. Separate randomisation schedules were generated for each participating clinical site using permuted block randomisation. Treatment assignments were obtained using a web-based application by the site pharmacist who then masked the solution for infusion. Patients and investigators were masked to study treatment. The primary endpoint was a six-category ordinal outcome of clinical status at day 7, ranging in severity from death to resumption of normal activities after discharge. The choice of day 7 was based on haemagglutination inhibition titres from a pilot study. It was analysed with a proportional odds model, using all six categories to estimate a common odds ratio (OR). An OR greater than 1 indicated that, for a given category, patients in the hIVIG group were more likely to be in a better category than those in the placebo group. Prespecified primary analyses for safety and efficacy were based on patients who received an infusion and for whom eligibility could be confirmed. This trial is registered with.

Findings

313 patients were enrolled in 34 sites between Dec 11, 2014, and May 28, 2018. We also used data from 16 patients enrolled at seven of the 34 sites during the pilot study between Jan 15, 2014, and April 10, 2014. 168 patients were randomly assigned to the hIVIG group and 161 to the placebo group. 21 patients were excluded (12 from the hIVIG group and 9 from the placebo group) because they did not receive an infusion or their eligibility could not be confirmed. Thus, 308 were included in the primary analysis. hIVIG treatment produced a robust rise in haemagglutination inhibition titres against influenza A and smaller rises in influenza B titres. Based on the proportional odds model, the OR on day 7 was 1·25 (95% CI 0·79–1·97; p = 0·33). In subgroup analyses for the primary outcome, the OR in patients with influenza A was 0·94 (0·55–1·59) and was 3·19 (1·21–8·42) for those with influenza B (interaction p = 0·023). Through 28 days of follow-up, 47 (30%) of 156 patients in the hIVIG group and in 45 (30%) of 152 patients in the placebo group had the composite safety outcome of death, a serious adverse event, or a grade 3 or 4 adverse event (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06, 95% CI 0·70–1·60; p = 0·79). Six (4%) patients in the hIVIG group and five (3%) in the placebo group died, but these deaths were not necessarily related to treatment.

Interpretation

When administered alongside standard care (most commonly oseltamivir), hIVIG was not superior to placebo for adults hospitalised with influenza infection. By contrast with our prespecified subgroup hypothesis that hIVIG would result in more favourable responses in patients with influenza A than B, we found the opposite effect. The clinical benefit of hIVIG for patients with influenza B is supported by antibody affinity analyses, but confirmation is warranted.

Introduction

About 650 000 people worldwide are estimated to die annually from respiratory complications of influenza, and all-cause excess mortality could be affecting twice as many people. The main treatment for both outpatients and inpatients with influenza is with neuraminidase inhibitors, although therapy with cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitors has also become available. However, considerable morbidity and mortality due to influenza still occur.

During the 1918 influenza pandemic, which accounted for an estimated 50 million deaths, convalescent sera, plasma, or blood from individuals who recovered from influenza were given to patients with severe influenza-induced pneumonia. These studies were largely predicated on the assumption that rapidly increasing titres of anti-influenza antibodies in acutely ill patients to protective convalescent concentrations might prevent clinical deterioration while the host's immune system mounts its own endogenous response. A meta-analysis of these studies suggested that there was clinical benefit for those patients who were treated early in the course of disease. A subsequent systematic review of studies using convalescent plasma or serum also found evidence of clinical benefit, but the investigators reported that these studies, none of which were randomised trials, were of poor quality by contemporary standards and recommended the evaluation of convalescent plasma in new, well designed clinical trials. Since that systematic review, a phase 2 trial of immune plasma plus standard care versus standard care alone was done in 98 patients with influenza A and B infection. The study did not show a clear benefit for immune plasma on the basis of the primary endpoint of normalisation of respiratory status at day 28, but favourable trends in several outcomes led to the design of a phase 3 trial of high-titre versus low-titre anti-influenza plasma in patients with influenza A infection. However, in that trial, high-titre plasma did not confer significant clinical benefit over low-titre plasma.

Results

329 patients were enrolled by 34 clinical sites over five influenza seasons, from 2013–14 to 2017–18. The 329 patients included 313 enrolled directly in the FLU-IVIG trial between Dec 11, 2014, and May 28, 2018, and 16 patients from the pilot study enrolled between Jan 15, 2014, and April 10, 2014. 160 patients were assigned to the hIVIG group and 153 were assigned to the placebo group. Additionally, eight of the pilot-study patients received hIVIG and eight received placebo. Thus, 168 recruited patients were included in the hIVIG group and 161 in the placebo group (figure 1). 21 patients were excluded (12 from the hIVIG group and nine from the placebo group) because they did not receive an infusion or their eligibility could not be confirmed. Of the 308 remaining patients, the day-7 outcome was partially missing (discharge status was known) for four patients, but they were included in the analysis after data for them were imputed. Thus, the primary analysis included all 308 patients (156 in the hIVIG group and 152 in the placebo group). All four patients with missing data were discharged before day 7; one withdrew consent after discharge and three could not be contacted. On the last day of follow-up, survival status was unknown for two patients, one in each treatment group.

A single randomised trialin severely ill patients with influenza A serotype H1N1 infection has also been done using anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG). Although not definitive, it suggested the need for further investigation on the basis of a subgroup analysis. In that trial, hIVIG was selected for its neutralising activity against the circulating strain A(H1N1)pdm09 and was compared with control intravenous immunoglobulin without neutralising activity. Overall, there was no evidence of a survival benefit of hIVIG in the 34 evaluable patients, who were in intensive care and on ventilator support. However, of the 22 patients who were treated within 5 days of symptom onset, there were no deaths in the hIVIG group (n = 12), but there were four in the control group (n = 10). Conversely, for those patients treated later than 5 days after symptom onset, all patients in the hIVIG group died (n = 5), but none did in the control group (n = 7). The subgroup results for patients who were treated early led the investigators to conclude that intravenous immunoglobulin should be considered in future pandemics.

Considering the limitations of the two meta-analyses and the results of the two clinical trials, the hypothesis that treating ill patients with convalescent products from immune patients might have clinical benefit remains unproven. To fill the gap in evidence on the efficacy of hIVIG and to potentially identify a treatment that could reduce morbidity and mortality in adults admitted to hospital with influenza infection, we did a double-blind randomised trial of clinical outcomes in patients treated with hIVIG plus standard care versus standard care alone.

Methods

Study design and participants

FLU-IVIG was an international, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed and conducted by the International Network for Strategic Initiatives in Global HIV Trials (INSIGHT). We planned to include 45 major hospitals in Argentina, Australia, Denmark, Greece, Mexico, Spain, Thailand, UK, and the USA (appendix pp 3–4).

Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) admitted for hospital treatment with influenza A (ie, A[H1N1]pdm09, H3N2) or B infection, locally determined by nucleic acid testing or by a rapid antigen test from a specimen obtained within 2 days before randomisation, were eligible if they had a National Early Warning (NEW) scoreof 2 points or greater at the time of screening, had onset of any symptoms no more than 7 days before randomisation, and were expected to be hospitalised for more than 24 h. If the NEW score for eligibility was obtained before the day of randomisation, an updated NEW score was obtained as baseline at the time of randomisation, which did not need to be 2 points or greater. Women of childbearing age were included if they were willing to abstain from sexual intercourse or to use at least one form of contraception until day 28 of the study. Pregnant or breastfeeding women were excluded, as were patients who had received any other investigational drug therapy within the 30 days before the screening, had a history of allergic reaction to blood or plasma products, had IgA deficiency, or were at risk of thrombosis for any reason. Additional exclusion criteria were suspicion of infection with another type of influenza, inability to comply with the protocol, increased risk due to treatment as judged by the site study investigator, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at screening. All patients provided written informed consent. The trial was approved by the institutional review board or ethics committee for each clinical site. The protocol is available.

Of note, the trial's ability to assess the effect of hIVIG on mortality would have required a much larger sample size than we were able to enrol. Instead, a novel ordinal primary outcome was defined for a trial with a feasible sample size, and several secondary clinical outcomes were defined to further characterise the possible benefit of hIVIG compared with placebo. An advantage of the primary outcome used compared with mortality, including improved power, is that it assesses both improvement and deterioration in health status.

In summary, on the basis of our results and the two plasma trials, hIVIG and plasma are not recommended for patients hospitalised with influenza A. By contrast, the beneficial clinical and viral load results of hIVIG consistently seen in patients with influenza B warrant further investigation at both the laboratory and clinical levels.

About
- Influenza is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses.
- It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Symptoms Flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms:

- fever or feeling feverish/chills
- cough
- sore throat
- runny or stuffy nose
- muscle or body aches
- headaches
- fatigue
- some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever. Keep ReadingSigns and Symptoms of Flu. Flu complications Most people who get flu will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people will develop complications as a result of flu, some of which can be life-threatening and result in death.

Sinus and ear infections are examples of moderate complications from flu, while pneumonia is a serious flu complication that can result from either flu virus infection alone or from co-infection of flu virus and bacteria. Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can include inflammation of the heart, brain or muscle tissues, and multi-organ failure. Flu virus infection of the respiratory tract can trigger an extreme inflammatory response in the body and can lead to sepsis, the body's life-threatening response to infection. Flu also can make chronic medical problems worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma attacks while they have flu, and people with chronic heart disease may experience a worsening of this condition triggered by flu. Keep ReadingPeople at Increased Risk for Flu Complications.

People at higher risk from flu Anyone can get sick with flu, even healthy people, and serious problems related to flu can happen to anyone at any age, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and children younger than 5 years, but especially those younger than 2 years old.

### Anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin for adults with influenza A or B infection (FLU-IVIG): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^6723e151]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Before randomisation, demographics information and medical history were obtained, NEW score was assessed, use of antiviral medication was recorded, and targeted symptoms were ascertained. Nasopharyngeal swabs from patients were obtained at baseline and on day 3 for central determination of influenza serotypes and viral loads by RT-PCR (appendix p 6). Blood was obtained before infusion of the assigned solution and on days 1, 3, and 7 for measurement of haemagglutination inhibition titres.

On the basis of the favourable pharmacokinetics and haemagglutination inhibition titres measured during a pilot trial, hIVIG was given at a dose of 0·25 g/kg (up to a maximum of 24·75 g, corresponding to approximately 100 kg actual bodyweight) dissolved in as much saline as needed to reach a total volume of 500 mL. A single infusion was given as soon as possible after randomisation over a period of approximately 2 h. 302 (98%) of patients were infused on the day of randomisation and six (2%) were infused on the day after randomisation.

Patients were followed up for 28 days after randomisation. Clinical data were collected on days 1–3, 7, 14, and 28. These data included NEW score on days 1–3 if the patient was hospitalised; targeted symptoms on days 3 and 7; nasopharyngeal swab on day 3; blood draws on days 1, 3, and 7; use of antiviral drugs; and adverse events throughout the entire follow-up period. Data were also collected on resolution of influenza symptoms. After infusion, the volume used and any subsequent adverse events were recorded.

The adjusted OR of hIVIG versus placebo for the primary endpoint was 1·25 (95% CI 0·79–1·97, p = 0·33; table 2). The clinical status of patients on the basis of the primary ordinal outcome after data imputation is summarised in the appendix (p 29). The unadjusted OR was similar (1·26 [0·83–1·90], p = 0·28), and there was no evidence that the proportional odds assumption was violated (p = 0·79), as seen from the similarity of the five ORs (hIVIG vs placebo) estimated from the six categories of the ordinal outcome (table 2). Planned sensitivity analyses for the primary outcome showed consistent results, including the sensitivity analysis that excluded the pilot study participants (OR 1·31 [0·82–2·08], p = 0·26; appendix p 17).

### Anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin for adults with influenza A or B infection (FLU-IVIG): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^acb9d86a]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The rationale for choosing hIVIG as a potential therapeutic was based on the known course of the development of haemagglutination inhibition antibodies during natural infection that appears to correlate temporally with clinical recovery. Infusion of an anti-influenza IVIG product produces a substantial rise in haemagglutination inhibition titres against A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) at least 3–4 days sooner than those induced by natural infection itself. By contrast, acute infection with influenza B (or after seasonal vaccination) produces a haemagglutination inhibition response against B virus that typically is much more muted when tested by conventional means, and the corresponding increase in anti-influenza B titres after hIVIG infusion is generally smaller. For this reason, we launched the hIVIG trial expecting to observe a greater treatment effect against the two major influenza A subtypes.

In preclinical studies of A(H5N1) infection in ferrets, increasing IVIG dose was associated with improved efficacy. Measurement of post-infusion haemagglutination inhibition titres against contemporaneously circulating influenza A strains in our trial did indeed suggest that the expected boost in titres was achieved in recipients of hIVIG. Accordingly, we anticipated that this measurably greater increase in haemagglutination inhibition titres against influenza A than against B might yield better efficacy in patients with influenza A infection. Yet this strategy to jumpstart the humoral response to acute infection by several days translated into more rapid clinical recovery and more rapid virological decline only in patients with influenza B, whose post-infusion titres increased little beyond baseline. As such, the conventional haemagglutination inhibition titres resulting from administration of hIVIG appear to have been poor predictors of both clinical and virological efficacy in our trial.

Similar to the primary outcome, differences between the hIVIG and placebo group in other clinical outcomes were not significant (table 2).

Through 28 days of follow-up, a similar number of patients administered hIVIG and placebo died (six [4%] in the hIVIG group and five [3%] in the placebo group), had serious adverse events (25 [16%] in the hIVIG group, 26 [17%] in the placebo group), and had grade 3 or 4 adverse events (45 [29%] in the hIVIG group and 40 [26%] in the placebo group; table 3, appendix pp 19–20). The composite outcome of death, serious adverse events, or grade 3 or 4 events was seen in 47 (30%) patients in the hIVIG group and in 45 (30%) patients in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 1·06 [95% CI 0·70–1·60], p = 0·79; table 3, appendix p 30). Viral load and safety outcome treatment differences followed a pattern similar to the primary endpoint for patients with influenza A and B. In patients with influenza A, the decline in viral load from baseline to day 3 was actually greater for the placebo group than the hIVIG group (difference 0·50; p = 0·021), whereas for those with influenza B the decline in viral load was greater for the hIVIG group than for the placebo group (difference −0·85, p = 0·053, p = 0·0052 for interaction between treatment group and influenza serotype; figure 5, appendix p 26).

Death and adverse events

In patients with influenza A, the composite of death, serious adverse events, or grade 3 or 4 events occurred for 40 (35%) patients administered hIVIG and 29 (26%) patients administered placebo (HR 1·49 [95% CI 0·91–2·42], p = 0·11; appendix p 33). For those with influenza B infection, this composite occurred for seven (17%) patients in the hIVIG group and 16 (38%) patients in the placebo group (0·38 [0·15–0·97], p = 0·043 interaction p = 0·010; appendix p 34).

Research in context

Evidence before this study

We identified 9520 articles through searching PubMed with the terms "influenza"[All Fields]) AND ("immunotherapy"[All Fields]) AND "human". The search was restricted to articles in English. We did not include any date restrictions; the earliest article we found was published in 1946. Although numerous case reports or small randomised or non-randomised studies of passive immunotherapy as either primary or adjunctive therapy have been published over the past century, to our knowledge, none have provided definitive evidence that there is a true clinical and virological benefit of passive immunotherapy for patients with severe influenza.

Added value of this study

In this international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial we found that despite robust increases in haemagglutination inhibition titres for influenza A, and smaller magnitude increases in titres for influenza B, there was no clinical benefit observed in patients receiving a single infusion of weight-based anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) either overall or for the predefined subgroup of interest with influenza A. Paradoxically, and contrary to our expectation, the addition of hIVIG to standard care for patients with influenza B had both a significant clinical benefit at day 7 and a significant virological benefit at day 3 compared with placebo. Anti-haemagglutinin antibody affinities were measured in the hIVIG lots administered, and much stronger antibody affinities were observed for B strains than for A strains.

Implications of all the available evidence

This trial provides strong evidence that passive immunotherapy as an adjunctive therapy for adults hospitalised with severe influenza A does not provide clinical benefit. Although the beneficial effect of hIVIG for patients with influenza B is supported by the antibody affinity analyses done on the lots of the study drug, confirmation of clinical and virological benefit is warranted in a further randomised controlled trial enrolling participants hospitalised with influenza B.

### About influenza | Influenza (flu) [^72272072]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses
- Flu can cause mild to severe illness
- Most experts believe that flu viruses spread mainly by tiny droplets made when people with flu cough, sneeze, or talk
- The first and most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccine each year. Understanding Influenza Flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat, and sometimes the lungs. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. The best way to prevent flu is by getting a flu vaccine each year. Symptoms Flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu symptoms usually come on suddenly.

People who have flu often feel some or all of these signs and symptoms:

- fever or feeling feverish/chills
- cough
- sore throat
- runny or stuffy nose
- muscle or body aches
- headaches
- fatigue
- some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults. It's important to note that not everyone with flu will have a fever. Not everyone with flu has symptoms Some people with influenza virus infections do not develop any symptoms at all. A household study conducted during the 2017–2023 flu seasons found that 8 percent of people who tested positive for flu did not have symptoms. Onset of Symptoms The time from when a person is exposed and infected with influenza virus to when symptoms begin is about two days but can range from about one to four days.

People at risk Anyone can get flu, and serious problems related to flu can happen at any age, but some people are at higher risk of developing serious flu-related complications if they get sick. This includes people 65 years and older, people of any age with certain chronic medical conditions, people with a body mass index of 40 kg/m 2 or higher, those who are pregnant, and children younger than five years. Quick facts U. S annual flu infection rates A 2018 CDC study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases looked at the percentage of the U. S. population who got sick with flu using two different methods and compared the findings. Both methods had similar findings, which suggested that on average, about 8 percent of the U. S. population gets sick from flu each season, with a range of between 3 percent and 11 percent, depending on the season.

Estimating seasonal flu incidence Influenza virus infection is very common, and the number of people infected each season can only be estimated because not everyone will seek medical care or get tested for flu. Statistical estimations are based on CDC-measured flu hospitalization rates that are adjusted to estimate the total number of influenza virus infections in the United States for a given flu season. The estimates for the number of influenza virus infections are then divided by the census population to estimate how common influenza virus infections are in the population. Impact of flu season severity on incidence of flu The proportion of people who get sick with flu varies. A paper published in CID found that between 3 percent and 11 percent of the U. S. population gets infected and develops flu symptoms each year.

From the outset of the FLU-IVIG trial, we planned to include the 16 patients who participated in the pilot study and met the eligibility criteria of FLU-IVIG in the primary analysis to reduce the cost of the trial (ie, enrolment costs and costs of preparing batches of hIVIG). The clinical outcomes of the 16 patients from the pilot study remained concealed until the results of the FLU-IVIG trial were unmasked. These patients were enrolled during the influenza season before the FLU-IVIG trial began. Data collected during the pilot study allowed all major outcomes to be determined.

All analyses were done in patients who received an infusion and for whom eligibility could be confirmed. A proportional odds model was used to analyse the primary ordinal outcome at day 7. The proportional odds model uses all six categories and estimates a common OR over all possible clinical states of the ordinal outcome. We defined an OR greater than 1 for a given category as the odds of patients in the hIVIG group being in a better category at day 7 than patients in the placebo group. The model included a treatment indicator and covariates: (1) whether the patient was enrolled from the intensive care unit or general ward and whether they required oxygen; (2) geographical region (USA, South America, and Mexico; Europe and Australia; and Thailand); and (3) participation in the previous pilot study. In addition to the adjusted OR specified for the primary analysis, an unadjusted OR is cited for the primary ordinal outcome. Proportional odds models with the same covariates are summarised for secondary ordinal outcomes at day 3, day 14, and day 28 (appendix p 9). Separate ORs were also estimated for each dichotomised definition of improvement from the ordered categorical scale on day 7. A test for the proportional odds assumption from a model that allowed different slopes for the baseline covariates (a partial proportional odds model) was done. Multiple imputation was used to estimate the day-7 clinical status of patients for whom data on the primary outcome were partially missing (appendix p 8). The ordinal outcome was also assessed on each of the first 7 days of follow-up. Generalised estimating equations were used to assess evidence of heterogeneity for these repeated assessments of the ordinal outcome. The interaction of study follow-up day and treatment was assessed and is referred to as an interaction p value. Sensitivity analyses are described in the appendix (p 8).

The lack of efficacy of hIVIG measured by the primary endpoint for patients with influenza A was evident for both serotypes (A[H1N1] OR 0·61 [95% CI 0·21–1·78], A[H3N2] 0·79 [0·41–1·54]; appendix p 31). Conversely, treatment differences for the two influenza B lineages both favoured hIVIG. The OR for those patients with the major Yamagata lineage was 4·37 (1·3–14·7). For those with the minor Victoria lineage, the OR could not be determined, but all six patients randomly assigned to receive hIVIG were discharged at day 7, whereas only four of the 7 assigned to placebo had been discharged.

In patients with A(H1N1)pdm09 infection, haemagglutination inhibition titres for A/California/07/2009/A(H1N1) and A/Michigan/45/2015, the two reference viruses we considered, increased in the hIVIG group on day 1 (p < 0·0001 for California, p < 0·0001 for Michigan) and remained significantly higher than titres in the placebo group at day 3 (p = 0·0001 for California, p < 0·0001 for Michigan; figure 3, appendix p 15). By day 7, patients in the placebo group had developed natural immune responses and the treatment differences were no longer significant (p = 0·18 for A/California/07/2009/A[H1N1], p = 0·10 for A/Michigan/45/2015). A similar pattern of a smaller treatment difference in titres at day 7 (p = 0·13) compared with day 1 (p < 0·0001) and 3 (p < 0·0001) was evident for patients infected with A(H3N2) for the reference virus A/Hong Kong/4801/2014. For those infected with A/Switzerland/2013/50/2012, titres in the hIVIG group differed from the placebo group at day 1 (p = 0·0001) but not afterwards (p = 0·65 for day 3, p = 0·25 for day 7).

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — antiviral agent and duration: Clinicians should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible with a single neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) (either oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, or intravenous peramivir) and not use a combination of NAIs (A-I), and clinicians should not routinely use higher doses of US Food and Drug Administration–approved NAI drugs for the treatment of seasonal influenza (A-II). Clinicians should treat uncomplicated influenza in otherwise healthy ambulatory patients for 5 days with oral oseltamivir or inhaled zanamivir, or a single dose of intravenous peramivir (A-I). Clinicians can consider longer duration of antiviral treatment for patients with a documented or suspected immunocompromising condition or patients requiring hospitalization.

Observational studies have reported effectiveness of influenza vaccination to reduce the risks of severe disease requiring hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and death. A diagnosis of influenza should be considered in critically ill patients admitted with complications such as exacerbation of underlying chronic comorbidities, community-acquired pneumonia, and respiratory failure during influenza season. Molecular tests are recommended for influenza testing of respiratory specimens in hospitalized patients. Antigen detection assays are not recommended in critically ill patients because of lower sensitivity; negative results of these tests should not be used to make clinical decisions, and respiratory specimens should be tested for influenza by molecular assays.

Because critically ill patients with lower respiratory tract disease may have cleared influenza virus in the upper respiratory tract, but have prolonged influenza viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, an endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen should be tested by molecular assay for detection of influenza viruses. Observational studies have reported that antiviral treatment of critically ill adult influenza patients with a neuraminidase inhibitor is associated with survival benefit. Since earlier initiation of antiviral treatment is associated with the greatest clinical benefit, standard-dose oseltamivir for enteric administration is recommended as soon as possible as it is well absorbed in critically ill patients. Key Points
- There are an estimated 291, 000–646, 000 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths every year worldwide.

- Annual influenza vaccination is the primary method of preventing influenza and influenza-related complications, especially in high-risk persons.
- Influenza molecular diagnostic testing is recommended for all patients requiring hospitalization with suspected influenza.
- Influenza antiviral treatment should be started as soon as possible in hospitalized patients with suspected influenza, including critically ill patients, and should not be delayed while awaiting results of influenza diagnostic tests.
- Enterically administered oseltamivir is recommended for influenza patients except for those with contraindications.
- Repeat virologic testing in lower respiratory tract specimens may be required to determine therapeutic endpoints in ventilated patients with influenza
- Corticosteroids are not recommended for the routine treatment of influenza except when indicated for treatment of underlying medical conditions or septic shock. Risk factors for severe influenza outcomes
- Age < 5 years, especially those < 2 years
- Age
- Pregnant women
- Extreme obesity
- Native Americans/Alaskan Natives
- Current or past tobacco use
- Children and adolescents receiving aspirin or salicylate-containing medications who might be at risk for Reye syndrome
- Underlying chronic medical conditions: ○ Pulmonary ○ Cardiovascular ○ Renal ○ Hepatic ○ Neurologic ○ Hematologic ○ Metabolic ○ Immunocompromised state. Groups at high risk for influenza complications From the U. S.

### Anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin for adults with influenza A or B infection (FLU-IVIG): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^3085f0c3]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

In this randomised controlled trial assessing immunotherapy as a potential therapeutic adjunct in patients with severe influenza, a significant treatment benefit of hIVIG plus standard care (oseltamivir) compared with placebo plus standard care was not found either overall or for the predefined subgroup of interest with influenza A infection (224 [73%] of 308 trial participants). The findings for the primary clinical outcome and several secondary clinical outcomes were matched by the inability of hIVIG treatment to induce a larger reduction in influenza A viral load in the upper respiratory tract than placebo. These findings for patients with influenza A are consistent with the results of a contemporaneous randomised trial (IRC005) of high-titre anti-influenza plasma done in 140 patients with influenza A infection. In that trial, which enrolled a moderately sicker cohort than ours, the same primary endpoint was used and the OR (high-titre vs low-titre plasma) for a favourable outcome on day 7 was 1·22 (95% CI 0·65–2·29). Taken together, the findings from the subgroup of patients with influenza A in our trial of hIVIG and the IRC005 trial provide no support for the use of immunotherapy to treat patients with severe influenza A.

Unlike the trial of high-titre anti-influenza plasma that only enrolled patients with influenza A, in our trial of hIVIG 84 (27%) patients had influenza B infection. Contrary to what was hypothesised on the basis of conventional haemagglutination inhibition titres, the addition of hIVIG to standard care did result in both a demonstrable clinical and a virological benefit in patients with influenza B. The OR in favour of a clinical benefit on the primary outcome for hIVIG use in patients with influenza B was 3·19 (95% CI 1·21–8·42). Secondary clinical and viral load outcomes were consistent with the primary outcome results for this subgroup. Particularly, the effect of hIVIG treatment on deaths and adverse events, which might reflect the underlying medical condition of patients better than adverse effects of treatment, was also greater in patients with influenza B than those with influenza A infection.

Seasonal influenza (IDSA 2018) — immunocompromised patients: Influenza viral replication, including asymptomatic shedding, can be prolonged and resistant variants during or after antiviral treatment can occur more frequently than in immunocompetent patients. Retrospectively collected data suggest treatment can safely extend to 10 days or longer, and rebound viral replication has been observed in some patients treated for 5 days; longer duration is advisable if disease is severe and influenza viral RNA remains detectable. There are no data to support the use of higher doses of oseltamivir in this population. Early initiation of antiviral therapy is associated with the best outcomes, although clinical benefit has been reported when starting treatment > 48 hours after symptom onset.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — vaccination status, immunocompromised hosts, and treatment initiation — Annual influenza vaccination can prevent influenza, but influenza vaccine effectiveness has ranged from low to moderate in preventing medically attended outpatient visits and hospitalizations, and may have lower effectiveness in immunocompromised patients, who may also experience prolonged influenza viral replication. A history of current season influenza vaccination does not exclude a diagnosis of influenza in either immunocompetent or immunocompromised patients. Therefore, antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible in hospitalized patients, high-risk persons, and those with severe or progressive disease if influenza is suspected, irrespective of receipt of influenza vaccine.

Randomisation and masking

Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 500 mL of either hIVIG solution (hIVIG group) or saline as placebo (placebo group), in addition to standard care. Randomisation was stratified by clinical site; a schedule for each site was prepared by the INSIGHT Statistical and Data Management Center at the University of Minnesota (Minneapolis, MN, USA) using permuted block randomisation. These schedules were maintained in secure files. After obtaining the treatment assignment using a web-based application, site pharmacists unmasked to treatment prepared the masked infusion bags of hIVIG or placebo. hIVIG solutions were slightly opaque. Thus, to ensure that the patient and clinical site staff were masked to the assigned treatment, the pharmacist placed a coloured sleeve over the 500 mL bag containing either the hIVIG or placebo.

Patients and investigators were masked to the study treatment administered. Apart from the site pharmacist, access to treatment assignment was restricted to the unmasked statisticians who prepared reports for the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. To assess the masking process, at the final follow-up visit on day 28, patients and a staff member primarily responsible for evaluating symptoms during follow-up were asked to guess which treatment was administered (appendix p 9).

Procedures

The hIVIG product was manufactured on an annual basis by Emergent BioSolutions (formerly Cangene Corporation; Winnipeg, MB, Canada) under contract to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, using high-titre anti-influenza plasma collected either from fractionated whole blood or by plasmapheresis from immune volunteers at sites in the USA and Canada. Donors and plasma units were selected on the basis of increased haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres against contemporary vaccine strains. Haemagglutination inhibition titres varied by hIVIG lot, and all lots were required to have substantial activity against contemporary circulating strains to be used (appendix p 12). The manufacturing methods and determination of neutralising antibody titres in the individual IVIG lots did not vary over the course of the trial. After unmasking of the primary study results, additional characterisation of the antibody composition of each hIVIG lot administered during the study was done. This included measurement of the total antibody binding and antibody affinity to the HA0 protein (the native functionally intact form of haemagglutinin) for each of the influenza vaccine strains (appendix p 7).

Since December 31, 2019, unknown causes of pneumonia have been reported in Wuhan, China. This special pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus was named 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO) in January 2020. From the beginning of this infectious disease, clinicians and researchers have been endeavoring to discover an effective and suitable treatment for affected patients. To date, there is no definitive and specific treatments for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection while drugs introduced are still in the clinical trial phase. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is a biological product prepared from the serum and an optional treatment for patients with antibody deficiencies. In many countries, much attention has been paid to the use of IVIG in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Due to the therapeutic importance of IVIG in virus infections, in the current study, we reviewed the possible effect of IVIG in viral infections and potential evidence of IVIG therapy in patients with COVID-19 virus.

### Intravenous immunoglobulin as a potential treatment for long COVID [^adb674e4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

On 31 July 2023, the United States Department of Health and Human Services announced the formation of the Office of Long COVID Research and Practice and the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) opened enrollment for the therapeutic arm of the RECOVER initiative, a prospective, randomized study to evaluate new treatment options for long coronavirus disease 2019 (long COVID).

Areas Covered

One of the first drugs to be studied in this nationwide initiative is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), which will be a treatment option for subjects enrolled in RECOVER-AUTO, a randomized trial to investigate therapeutic strategies for autonomic dysfunction related to long COVID.

Expert Opinion

IVIG is a mixture of human antibodies (human immunoglobulin) that has been widely used to treat a variety of diseases, including immune thrombocytopenia purpura, Kawasaki disease, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and certain infections such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, and measles. However, the role of IVIG in the treatment of post-COVID-19 conditions is uncertain. This manuscript examines what is known about IVIG in the treatment of long COVID and explores how this therapeutic agent may be used in the future to address this condition.

Figure 3
Haemagglutination inhibition titres by reference virus and treatment group

Patients infected with influenza A(H1N1) with (A) A/California/07/2009 or (B) A/Michigan/45/2015 used as the reference virus for analysis. Patients infected with influenza A(H3N2) with (C) A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 or (D) A/Switzerland/2013/50/2012 used as the reference virus for analysis. Patients infected with influenza B with (E) B/Brisbane/60/2008 or (F) B/Phuket/3073/2013 used as the reference virus for analysis. hIVIG = hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin.

For patients with influenza B infection, haemagglutination inhibition titres were measured for both the B/Brisbane/60/2008 and B/Phuket/3073/2013 serotypes (figure 3). The increase in titres over time for both the hIVIG and placebo groups was lower than for patients with influenza A. Treatment differences were not significant at days 1, 3, or 7 for B/Brisbane/60/2008 (p values ranged from 0·13 to 0·33). For the B/Phuket/3073/2013 reference virus, titres in the hIVIG group were significantly higher than in the placebo group at days 1 (p = 0·0004) and 3 (p = 0·021), but not day 7 (p = 0·78).

The greater increase in haemagglutination inhibition titres with hIVIG against influenza A compared with influenza B is consistent with the lot analysis (appendix p 12). However, in a post-trial exploratory laboratory analysis, the antibody kinetics showed an approximately tenfold (range 5·3–17·7) higher antibody affinity (slower antigen-antibody complex dissociation rates) against the haemagglutinin of influenza B strains than that of either the H1 or H3 vaccine strain for all hIVIG lots (figure 4). In most lots, anti-influenza B haemagglutinin-binding antibodies were higher than anti-H1 or anti-H3 antibodies, but not by much (appendix p 28).

### Anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin for adults with influenza A or B infection (FLU-IVIG): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^7a282b91]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Rather, perhaps a more probable explanation for this difference might be found in the antibody kinetic analyses of hIVIG lots after unmasking of the primary data. Striking differences between the affinities of anti-A and anti-B antibodies within the hIVIG lots were found. Unlike conventional haemagglutination inhibition testing, these analyses showed that the antibody avidity against influenza B was often up to tenfold higher than it was against either subtype of influenza A. A studyshowed that higher anti-haemagglutinin antibody affinity provided better control of viral load in nasal washes and weight loss in vaccinated ferrets after challenge with wild-type H7N7 or H7N9 influenza virus. Although the mechanism for these avidity differences in human plasma is unknown, it is clear that the role of antibody affinity and other antibody effector functions need to be carefully evaluated to assess their importance in providing protection against severe disease due to influenza A and influenza B.

A limitation of our results is that the subgroup with influenza B included only 84 patients (27% of all participants in the trial). Thus, our estimates of efficacy have wide CIs. The consistent findings for this subgroup across other clinical outcomes and viral load argue for further exploration of this finding. Another limitation is the fact that 17 patients from one site had to be excluded because their eligibility could not be confirmed. In the sensitivity analyses, their exclusion had little impact on estimated ORs for the primary endpoint, but did reduce our power slightly. Finally, we note that our target population of patients hospitalised with influenza included only 35 (11%) of patients in intensive care at the time of enrolment and about half had NEW scores less than or equal to 3 points. Thus, we are not able to generalise our findings to severely ill patients. However, subgroup analyses according to NEW score, location of enrolment, use of oxygen at entry, and duration of symptoms at the time of enrolment did not identify consistent trends. Taken together with the lack of overall benefit in severely ill patients in the two plasma trials, and the Hong Kong trial of hIVIG, the absence of benefit of immunotherapy for patients with influenza A might apply to a broader population than we studied.

### Hyperimmune IV immunoglobulin treatment: a multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial for patients with severe 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection [^8ec91019]. Chest (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Experience from influenza pandemics suggested that convalescent plasma treatment given within 4 to 5 days of symptom onset might be beneficial. However, robust treatment data are lacking.

Methods

This is a multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. Convalescent plasma from patients who recovered from the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) (A[H1N1]) infection was fractionated to hyperimmune IV immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) by CSL Biotherapies (now BioCSL). Patients with severe A(H1N1) infection on standard antiviral treatment requiring intensive care and ventilatory support were randomized to receive H-IVIG or normal IV immunoglobulin manufactured before 2009 as control. Clinical outcome and adverse effects were compared.

Results

Between 2010 and 2011, 35 patients were randomized to receive H-IVIG (17 patients) or IV immunoglobulin (18 patients). One defaulted patient was excluded from analysis. No adverse events related to treatment were reported. Baseline demographics and viral load before treatment were similar between the two groups. Serial respiratory viral load demonstrated that H-IVIG treatment was associated with significantly lower day 5 and 7 posttreatment viral load when compared with the control (P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively). The initial serum cytokine level was significantly higher in the H-IVIG group but fell to a similar level 3 days after treatment. Subgroup multivariate analysis of the 22 patients who received treatment within 5 days of symptom onset demonstrated that H-IVIG treatment was the only factor that independently reduced mortality (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.02–0.92; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Treatment of severe A(H1N1) infection with H-IVIG within 5 days of symptom onset was associated with a lower viral load and reduced mortality.

### Clinical guidance for outpatients with acute respiratory illness at… [^367b808f]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Background SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, and influenza viruses as well as other respiratory viruses usually co-circulate during the fall and winter months in most of the United States. Both viruses can cause acute respiratory illnesses with similar signs and symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, malaise, sore throat, and headache. Therefore, the decision to start empiric antiviral treatment can be challenging. Co-infections with SARS CoV-2 and influenza can occur but are not common. Clinicians should consider several factors when evaluating patients with acute respiratory illness, particularly when influenza and COVID-19 are suspected, to facilitate early antiviral treatment. A thorough medical history to understand recent exposures and risk factors can provide valuable information to direct treatment. A positive test result is not required to initiate antiviral treatment for COVID-19 or influenza, but testing can guide appropriate treatment.

Risk for severe disease Clinicians should especially consider treatment among patients who are at higher risk of severe disease such as hospitalization and death. Age is the most important factor in assessing risk for severe disease for both influenza and COVID-19. Risk for severe disease increases as age increases; persons 65 years and older are at highest risk of hospitalization and death due to influenza or COVID-19. Risk factors for severe influenza include children aged < 2 years, adults aged ≥ 65 years, pregnant persons, and people with certain medical conditions such as chronic lung disease, neurologic and neurodevelopmental conditions, blood disorders, endocrine disorders, heart disease, liver disorders, kidney disease, extreme obesity, and immunocompromising conditions. Certain medical conditions also increase the risk for severe COVID-19 and many are the same as those that increase risk for severe influenza and other respiratory diseases such as respiratory syncytial virus.

Studies have shown that risk for severe COVID-19 increases substantially with the presence of multiple medical conditions which commonly occurs in older individuals. Additionally, residents of nursing homes are at increased risk of severe respiratory disease due to influenza and COVID-19. Some racial and ethnic minority groups are at higher risk of severe disease due to multiple barriers accessing health care including lack of insurance, transportation, child-care, or ability to take time off from work. Clinical judgment is needed to accurately assess a person's risk on a case-by-case basis and determine whether treatment is indicated. Specimen collection For specimen collection, it is important to implement recommended infection prevention and control measures and collect respiratory specimens as indicated for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 testing. Two different specimens may need to be collected if multiplex testing for influenza viruses and SARS-CoV-2 is unavailable on-site.

Testing Testing can support diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment. For patients who are at risk for severe disease, molecular assays, such as nucleic acid detection assays are preferred, however, antigen detection assays can be used if nucleic acid detection assays are not available. Antigen testing may be used to help with diagnostic and treatment decisions for patients in outpatient clinical settings, such as whether to prescribe antiviral medications. Several types of tests are available for influenza, including rapid molecular assays which have high sensitivity and specificity, and rapid influenza diagnostic tests. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests are antigen detection assays with moderate sensitivity and high specificity. Due to the limited sensitivities, negative results of rapid influenza diagnostic tests do not exclude influenza virus infection in patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of influenza.

IDSA 2018 seasonal influenza — testing and empiric treatment during community circulation: Confirmation of influenza virus infection by diagnostic testing is not required for decisions to prescribe antiviral medication, and initiation of empiric antiviral treatment should not be delayed while influenza testing results are pending; antiviral treatment is clinically most beneficial when started as close to illness onset as possible. All hospitalized patients with suspected influenza should be tested, and influenza testing may be used to inform decisions on use of antibiotics or continuation of antiviral medication, on need for further diagnostic tests, on consideration for home care, or on recommendations for ill persons living with others who are at high risk for influenza complications; influenza testing may be useful in order to inform decisions in infection control practices. Antiviral treatment is recommended for outpatients with suspected influenza who are at high risk for complications or those with progressive disease not requiring hospital admission, and antiviral treatment of outpatients who are not at high risk can be considered based upon clinical judgment if presenting within 2 days of illness onset.

### Efficacy of convalescent plasma for the treatment of severe influenza [^c3faeee8]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Seasonal and pandemic influenza cause substantial disease and a high economic burden. The main treatment for influenza is neuraminidase inhibitor administration. Despite this therapy, pandemic influenza remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Therefore, there is a need for effective therapy against influenza. Convalescent plasma therapy is a promising option that has been used experimentally for the last 100 years, since the Spanish flu of 1917–1918, and is currently being tested as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).

Preclinical animal studies have demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of hyperimmune immunoglobulin and IgG antibody from convalescent plasma. It has been suggested that the administration of high-titer anti-influenza immune plasma derived from convalescent or immunized individuals may be clinically beneficial for the treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza. Additionally, treatment with convalescent plasma was reported to reduce hospital stays and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV infection and in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1). Some systematic reviews of studies using convalescent plasma concluded that there is evidence of clinical benefits in such patients.

Until recently, the collective evidence based on previous studies has been of relatively poor quality because very few randomized trials had been conducted. However, two randomized, controlled, and multicenter trials were reported in 2019, and in both trials, convalescent plasma or hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) prepared from pooled plasma, obtained from convalescent patients, and conferred no significant benefit over placebo in patients with influenza infection. This is not concordant with previous studies. To investigate this discrepancy, the current study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the clinical efficacy of either convalescent plasma or H-IVIG for the treatment of severe influenza.

### I.V. immunoglobulin therapy for infectious diseases [^5cfd5d80]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Intravenous human normal immunoglobulin (IVIG) is used as replacement therapy for patients with immunoglobulin deficiency and also for a few other licensed indications. Scientific rationale suggests that IVIG might help as treatment for certain serious infectious diseases that carry a high risk of death and for which there are limited alternative treatments. However, there is a limited worldwide supply of IVIG and the treatment is expensive. Here we assess the evidence on the efficacy of IVIG in certain infectious diseases.

### Cross-reactive influenza-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in intravenous immunoglobulin as a potential therapeutic against emerging influenza viruses [^4dd2323e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a purified pool of human antibodies from thousands of donors that is used to prevent or treat primary immune deficiency, several infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. The antibodies that mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against heterologous influenza strains may be present in IVIG preparations.

Methods

We tested 8 IVIG preparations prior to the 2009 H1N1 swine-origin influenza pandemic and 10 IVIG preparations made after 2010 for their ability to mediate influenza-specific ADCC.

Results

ADCC mediating antibodies to A(H1N1)pdm09 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) were detected in IVIG preparations prior to the 2009-H1N1 pandemic. The HA-specific ADCC targeted both the HA1 and HA2 regions of A(H1N1)pdm09 HA and was capable of recognizing a broad range of HA proteins including those from recent avian influenza strains A(H5N1) and A(H7N9). The low but detectable ADCC recognition of A(H7N9) was likely due to rare individuals in the population contributing cross-reactive antibodies to IVIG.

Conclusions

IVIG preparations contain broadly cross-reactive ADCC mediating antibodies. IVIG may provide at least some level of protection for individuals at high risk of severe influenza disease, especially during influenza pandemics prior to the development of effective vaccines.

Unlabelled

Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody responses to anti-influenza virus hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) were characterized. Thirty-one patients with influenza during the 2013–2014 season were randomly assigned to receive 0.25 g/kg of hIVIG (n = 16) or placebo (n = 15). For hIVIG recipients, the ratio of geometric mean titers (1 hour after infusion/before infusion) was 4.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.61–6.13) for 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) and 1.76 (95% CI, 1.33–2.32) for influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B. Among patients with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), ratios for hIVIG (n = 9) versus placebo (n = 8) were higher 1 hour after infusion (3.9 [95% CI, 2.3–6.7]) and sustained through day 3 (2.0 [95% CI, 1.0–4.0]). hIVIG administration significantly increases HAI titer levels among patients with influenza, supporting the need to perform a clinical outcomes study.

### Outcomes of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment of immunocompromised patients with viral respiratory infections [^4fc3436f]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited guidelines exist for treating immunocompromised patients hospitalized for acute viral respiratory infection. Little is known about clinical and economic benefits of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration in patients with acute viral respiratory infections.

Objective

To compare clinical and economic outcomes among immunocompromised patients hospitalized with viral respiratory infections who received IVIG with those who did not.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study on all patients hospitalized for a respiratory viral infection between 2011 and 2016 at 2 large academic centers including data on age, sex, virus species, immunosuppression type, and receipt of IVIG. Outcomes included death, hospital readmission, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital, and LOS in the intensive care unit (ICU).

Results

A total of 270 patient admissions were reviewed, and 35.6% received IVIG. The average age was 40.6 years, 50% were female, and 74% were transplant patients. The most common virus was rhinovirus (50.7%). Use of IVIG was significantly associated with a shorter ICU LOS (β = -0.534, P = 0.012) and a longer hospital LOS (β = 0.887, P < .01). IVIG administered within 48 hours of hospitalization (n = 229) was associated with a shorter ICU LOS (β = -2.08, P = 0.001) and a shorter hospital LOS for patients hospitalized at least 2 days (β = -0.461, P = 0.007). There were no significant differences in readmission rates or death.

Conclusion

This double-center, retrospective cohort analysis is one of the first studies to evaluate the effect of IVIG on immunocompromised patients hospitalized with respiratory viral infections. IVIG was associated with a shorter hospital and ICU LOS, especially when administered within 48 hours of admission.

- patients with an immunocompromising condition and evidence of persistent influenza viral replication who remain ill during or after neuraminidase inhibitor treatment

- patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza who inadvertently received subtherapeutic neuraminidase inhibitor dosing and remain ill

- patients with severe influenza who do not improve with neuraminidase inhibitor treatment and have evidence of persistent influenza viral replication

### Host immunomodulatory interventions in severe influenza [^77f50b7a]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, no immunomodulatory agents have been conclusively shown to benefit severe influenza. The World Health Organization conditionally advises against the use of systemic corticosteroids, macrolides, plasma therapy, mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for such patients. High-dose systemic corticosteroids may increase mortality and morbidity in severe influenza; the potential of low-dose corticosteroids merits further study given survival benefits in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Passive immunotherapy using convalescent plasma or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) from healthy donors has not proven effective, suggesting that future research should focus on hyperimmune plasma or IVIG from recent infections. An open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) found that a triple combination of oseltamivir, clarithromycin, and naproxen improved outcomes in severe influenza. One RCT has indicated that sirolimus with corticosteroids can expedite liberation from mechanical ventilation and reduce viral load, warranting larger trials of sirolimus alone. In contrast, adding macrolides or nitazoxanide has not consistently improved clinical outcomes. Promising evidence exists for anti-C5a antibodies in COVID-19, while case reports hint that intravenous N-acetylcysteine may benefit severe influenza pneumonia. Observational data on statins remain conflicting. Further studies on COX-2 inhibitors in combination with antivirals and other immunomodulators are needed. Mycophenolic acid, pamidronate, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists are low priorities due to toxicity concerns. Research into human mesenchymal stromal cells and herbal medicine remains inconclusive. Overall, these findings support large-scale trials to validate promising results and address limitations in small studies. Treatment of severe influenza requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates antiviral and immunomodulatory strategies. Clarifying these roles may enhance patient outcomes.

Human immunoglobulin preparations for intravenous or subcutaneous administration are the cornerstone of treatment in patients with primary immunodeficiency diseases affecting the humoral immune system. Intravenous preparations have a number of important uses in the treatment of other diseases in humans as well, some for which acceptable treatment alternatives do not exist. We provide an update of the evidence-based guideline on immunoglobulin therapy, last published in 2006. Given the potential risks and inherent scarcity of human immunoglobulin, careful consideration of its indications and administration is warranted.

### 7th international immunoglobulin conference: immunoglobulin in clinical practice [^5db3cdf0]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Intravenous and subcutaneous immunoglobulins (IVIg and SCIg, respectively) are increasingly used in clinical practice, not only as replacement therapy but also for immunomodulation. Physicians have learned that primary immunodeficiency (PID) patients are susceptible to recurrent respiratory tract infections even when appropriately treated with immunoglobulin (Ig) therapy. Further investigation will establish whether a combined therapeutic approach including Ig dose optimization will prevent progressive lung disease in PID. The wear-off effects observed with IVIg can be minimized by adjusting the dosing regimen. It is also possible to avoid the cyclic wear-off following transition to SCIg administration. Consideration of benefit versus risk with Ig therapy includes evaluating the potential occurrence of thromboembolic and haemolytic events, which may be more frequent when Ig is administered in high doses and in the presence of pre-existing risk factors. The ability to select an administration method from IVIg, SCIg or hyaluronidase-facilitated SCIg infusions provides patient choice and alternatives if one or other administration route is not suitable for a patient. The evolution in indications, applications, and understanding of Ig therapy described here has reinforced the need for robust methods to prioritize Ig use.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^351d9abe]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — extrapulmonary testing and serology are generally not useful for routine diagnosis. Seasonal influenza viruses infect the respiratory tract and typically are not associated with viremia, and except for research purposes or for special patient populations, there is no diagnostic utility to routinely collect whole blood, plasma, or serum specimens for seasonal influenza virus testing by any assay. Influenza viral RNA or infectious virus has rarely been detected in stool and such detection is of unknown clinical importance; therefore, testing of stool for influenza virus is not recommended. For suspected seasonal influenza-associated central nervous system disease, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for influenza is not routinely recommended, and clinicians should test respiratory specimens for influenza if influenza-associated neurologic disease is suspected. For serologic diagnosis, paired acute and convalescent serum specimens must be collected and tested together, there is no validated immunoglobulin M assay or other available serologic assay to diagnose seasonal influenza virus infection in a single serum specimen, and therefore single serum or paired sera specimens should not be collected for influenza serology except for research purposes.

### British society for immunology and United Kingdom primary immunodeficiency network (UKPIN) consensus guideline for the management of immunoglobulin replacement therapy [^ea0a88db]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation 16

Subcutaneous immunoglobulin should be favoured in patients with:

- past thrombosis
- renal failure
- risk of hyperviscosity syndromes
- conditions associated with IgM paraprotein (e.g. Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia)
- past history of aseptic meningitis
- past complications with IV therapy
- poor venous access

Evidence review: One study (PID, n = 13) supported switching to SC after severe adverse events under IV, with the majority of patients who withdrew from IV later tolerating SC therapy.

Recommendation 17

Intravenous immunoglobulin delivery should be favoured in patients:

- Who have a past history of adverse reactions to subcutaneous delivery
- Are physically unable to administer via the subcutaneous route and have no infusion partner to do so (and where no homecare nursing provision is available)

There was a broad consensus on giving patients the options between SC and IV therapy and this was supported by feedback from patient groups. Respondents commented that other side effects of Ig therapy have not been included in the statement. It was highlighted that in some cases a change in product rather than route might improve tolerance depending on the nature of the adverse effects. Overall comments favour an individualised, multifactorial approach to recommending the route of therapy to patients. One comment suggested SC should be considered in all children unless there are absolute contraindications. Many respondents mentioned that an infusion partner is not required for SC home therapy. It should also be noted that these guidelines were circulated before the COVID-19 pandemic; clinicians and patients should also consider the risks associated with attending hospital sites in the context of extraordinary circumstances such as a pandemic. However, patient choice should remain the overriding consideration.

Recommendation 18

First dose of immunoglobulin should not be routinely given to patients with evidence of severe active infection.

Recommendation 19

Rarely, it may be necessary to administer the first dose of immunoglobulin to patients with active infection on antibiotic treatment; this should be done with close inpatient monitoring (e.g. in High Dependency Unit) under consultant supervision.

This document relates to the use of IgRT in the management of primary and secondary immunodeficiency, it was highlighted in the comments that there may be circumstances when the use of immunoglobulin is indicated for treatment of other specific conditions (e.g. toxic shock and for immunomodulation) where guidelines specific to those conditions should be followed. In addition to reaching consensus, comments suggested that appropriate treatment settings and level of supervision required would vary between units according to local policies and staffing arrangements.

### Anti-influenza hyperimmune immunoglobulin enhances Fc-functional antibody immunity during human influenza infection [^39367c0e]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Background

New treatments for severe influenza are needed. Passive transfer of influenza-specific hyperimmune pooled immunoglobulin (Flu-IVIG) boosts neutralizing antibody responses to past strains in influenza-infected subjects. The effect of Flu-IVIG on antibodies with Fc-mediated functions, which may target diverse influenza strains, is unclear.

Methods

We studied the capacity of Flu-IVIG, relative to standard IVIG, to bind to Fcγ receptors and mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vitro. The effect of Flu-IVIG infusion, compared to placebo infusion, was examined in serial plasma samples from 24 subjects with confirmed influenza infection in the INSIGHT FLU005 pilot study.

Results

Flu-IVIG contains higher concentrations of Fc-functional antibodies than IVIG against a diverse range of influenza hemagglutinins. Following infusion of Flu-IVIG into influenza-infected subjects, a transient increase in Fc-functional antibodies was present for 1–3 days against infecting and noninfecting strains of influenza.

Conclusions

Flu-IVIG contains antibodies with Fc-mediated functions against influenza virus, and passive transfer of Flu-IVIG increases anti-influenza Fc-functional antibodies in the plasma of influenza-infected subjects. Enhancement of Fc-functional antibodies to a diverse range of influenza strains suggests that Flu-IVIG infusion could prove useful in the context of novel influenza virus infections, when there may be minimal or no neutralizing antibodies in the Flu-IVIG preparation.

### Cross-reactive neutralizing antibody against pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza a virus in intravenous immunoglobulin preparations [^4b492bf8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Prepandemic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and sera from Kawasaki disease patients treated with this IVIG were analyzed for 2009 H1N1-specific microneutralization and hemagglutination inhibition antibodies. All 6 different IVIG preparations tested had significant levels of cross-reactive-specific antibody at a concentration of 2.0 g/dL of immunoglobulin. Sera from 18 of 19 Kawasaki disease patients had significant increases of cross-reactive-specific antibody after 2.0 g/kg of prepandemic IVIG. These results suggest a role for adjunctive IVIG therapy for severe and/or drug-resistant 2009 H1N1 virus and other highly antigenically drifted influenza strains, particularly in the immunocompromised.

### Year in review 2013: critical care – respiratory infections [^ad16867d]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

In contrast to the discussion above, bacterial infection commonly complicates viral respiratory infection and is often associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Muscedere and colleagues evaluated the risk of coexistent or secondarily acquired bacterial respiratory tract or bloodstream-positive cultures in 681 patients with influenza A (H1N1) infection during the 2009 outbreak. They noted that 38% of patients (n = 259) had at least a positive blood or respiratory culture during their ICU stay (29.7% had co-existent and 44.4% had ICU-acquired infection; 15.4% had both) despite almost all patients receiving antibiotics. Patients with any positive culture had higher morbidity with more days on the ventilator, longer ICU and hospital LOS and higher hospital mortality (24.7% versus 19.9%, P = 0.15). The interesting finding from this study is that influenza infection (H1N1) is not as mild as previously thought; the majority of ICU patients required MV and the morbidity and mortality were high even in patients without bacterial co-infection. Hung and colleagues in a double-blind, randomized controlled trial evaluated the use of hyperimmune IV immunoglobulin (H-IVIG) fractionated from convalescent plasma of patients who had 2009 H1N1 infection (n = 17) versus normal IV immunoglobulin (n = 18) in 35 patients with severe H1N1 infection. Patients who received H-IVIG had significantly lower viral loads post-treatment and, if treatment was given within 5 days of onset, had mortality benefit (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.92, P = 0.04). Although the study is limited by a relatively small sample size, the H1N1 antibody present in the convalescent H-IVIG, if used early, offers potential benefit in the treatment of H1N1 infection.

### Clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America: 2018 update on diagnosis, treatment, chemoprophylaxis, and institutional outbreak management of seasonal influenzaa [^e7d789ef]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). High credibility.

Seasonal influenza — patients for antiviral treatment states that clinicians should start antiviral treatment as soon as possible for adults and children with documented or suspected influenza, irrespective of influenza vaccination history, including persons of any age who are hospitalized with influenza, regardless of illness duration prior to hospitalization (A-II); outpatients of any age with severe or progressive illness, regardless of illness duration (A-III); outpatients who are at high risk of complications from influenza, including those with chronic medical conditions and immunocompromised patients (A-III); children younger than 2 years and adults aged ≥ 65 years (A-III); and pregnant women and those within 2 weeks postpartum (A-III).
