## Question

Diarrhea constipation blood in stool

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate a patient presenting with diarrhea, constipation, and blood in the stool. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and whether this constellation constitutes an emergency. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that distinguish functional from organic disease. Next, I will examine the physical exam priorities, especially anorectal and abdominal findings. After that, I need to check which initial laboratory and stool tests are appropriate and why. Then, I will consider when colonoscopy is indicated and when it can be deferred. Finally, I will outline initial management strategies and follow-up, while keeping red flags and mimics in mind throughout.

> Let me first confirm the triage implications of the triad of diarrhea, constipation, and blood in stool. I should not jump to conclusions, but rectal bleeding is an alarm feature that lowers the threshold for urgent evaluation and possible endoscopy, whereas isolated constipation without alarms can often be managed conservatively, so I need to check for acuity, hemodynamic instability, fever, severe abdominal pain, and weight loss right away [^115uZLzd] [^116Fio8C] [^112jPYpF].

> Wait, let me verify the history elements that most efficiently narrow the differential. I need to characterize stool form and frequency using the Bristol Stool Form Scale, map the temporal pattern of diarrhea versus constipation, and ask about nocturnal symptoms, urgency, incontinence, mucus, and visible blood, because inflammatory diarrhea tends to be continuous with blood and urgency, whereas IBS-D is intermittent, daytime, and may include mucus without systemic features [^116qHVnP] [^112Rbjc6] [^116Si5YT].

> Hold on, I should verify the bleeding features carefully. Bright red coating on stool or toilet paper suggests anorectal sources like hemorrhoids or fissures, dark red mixed with stool raises concern for colitis or neoplasia, and black tarry melena implies proximal bleeding, so I need to ask about pain with defecation, constipation, and straining to support an anorectal source, while remembering that even small amounts of blood with altered bowel habits warrant colon evaluation in the right context [^1142LsjP].

> I need to check for alarm features that mandate expedited workup. New-onset symptoms after age 50, unintentional weight loss, iron deficiency anemia, nocturnal diarrhea, family history of colorectal cancer or IBD, and hematochezia not attributable to hemorrhoids or fissures all increase the likelihood of organic disease and should prompt colonoscopy rather than empiric medical therapy alone [^112mf9wd] [^115uZLzd] [^116Fio8C].

> Next, I should review medications and comorbidities. Opioids, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, calcium and iron supplements, and antidepressants can cause constipation, whereas metformin, PPIs, NSAIDs, antibiotics, and chemotherapeutic agents can precipitate diarrhea, and I must also ask about immunosuppression, recent travel, and diet changes because these factors shift pretest probabilities for infections, celiac disease, and medication-induced colitis [^115uZLzd] [^113uFvCT] [^116UUwad].

> Let me consider the physical examination priorities. A focused abdominal exam for tenderness, masses, or distension, and a careful anorectal exam including visual inspection for fissures, hemorrhoids, and prolapse, digital rectal exam for masses, stricture, and tone, and anoscopy when indicated, are essential, and I should confirm whether the blood is on the surface versus mixed and whether there is an anal fissure or painful defecation suggesting a benign anorectal source [^115uZLzd] [^111mCp4n].

> I should double-check the initial laboratory strategy. In the presence of bleeding or alarm features, a complete blood count to assess for anemia, inflammatory markers such as CRP, and a basic metabolic panel for electrolytes are appropriate, whereas routine broad metabolic panels are not recommended for isolated constipation without alarms, and I need to ensure I do not over-order tests that will not change management [^116Fio8C] [^113Y3eya] [^116UUwad].

> Next, I should review stool testing indications. Fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin helps screen for inflammatory diarrhea and IBD when diarrhea is present, fecal immunochemical testing can detect occult blood and guide urgency, and in patients with risk factors or persistent symptoms I should test for C. difficile, ova and parasites including Giardia, and consider bacterial culture, tailoring the panel to duration, travel, and immune status [^116JKjHE] [^1168yV1K] [^1169dzYE] [^112mkkny].

> Hold on, I should verify when colonoscopy is indicated. Any rectal bleeding not confidently attributable to hemorrhoids or fissures, iron deficiency anemia, weight loss, age over 50 without up-to-date screening, strong family history of colorectal cancer or IBD, or persistent altered bowel habits with any alarm feature should prompt colonoscopy to exclude neoplasia and inflammatory disease, and I should not defer endoscopy in these scenarios [^115uZLzd] [^1142LsjP] [^114DjdUx].

> But wait, what if the bleeding is clearly from a fissure or external hemorrhoids and there are no other alarms? In that case, conservative management with fiber, fluids, and topical therapy is reasonable, with colonoscopy reserved for those who fail conservative therapy, have recurrent bleeding, or develop new alarm features, and I should document the anorectal findings carefully to support this plan [^115uZLzd] [^114DjdUx].

> I will now examine the initial management approach while awaiting results. For diarrhea, loperamide can be used judiciously if infectious etiologies are reasonably excluded and there is no dysentery, for constipation I should optimize fiber, fluids, and activity and adjust offending medications, and for anorectal bleeding I should treat hemorrhoids or fissures conservatively while arranging indicated colon evaluation, and I need to ensure follow-up within 2 to 4 weeks to reassess symptoms and test results [^113uFvCT] [^116rjVGw] [^113aRMN6].

> Let me reconsider the differential so I do not anchor prematurely. Inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, ischemic colitis, and infectious colitis must be considered when blood is present, whereas IBS with mixed bowel habits is a diagnosis of exclusion after appropriate negative evaluation, and I should keep in mind that functional disorders and organic disease can coexist, particularly in older adults or those with prior abdominal surgery [^111KpHv8] [^117SwRsC] [^116qHVnP].

> I should confirm that my documentation captures stool form and frequency, bleeding characteristics, alarm features, medication review, exam findings, and the rationale for testing or deferring colonoscopy, because clear documentation supports safe observation and timely escalation if the clinical picture evolves [^notfound].

> In summary, I need to ensure that rectal bleeding with altered bowel habits is never dismissed as "just hemorrhoids" without a careful anorectal exam and consideration of age and risk, and I should escalate to colonoscopy when alarms are present or when conservative therapy fails, while using a targeted, cost-conscious initial workup to exclude infection, inflammation, and malabsorption when appropriate [^115uZLzd] [^1142LsjP] [^116UUwad].

The combination of **diarrhea, constipation, and blood in stool** signals a serious underlying condition and warrants **urgent evaluation** [^115MSYwf]. The most common causes include **inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)** [^111KpHv8], colorectal cancer [^notfound], and infectious colitis [^115MSYwf]; less frequent causes include ischemic colitis [^117SwRsC], radiation colitis, and medication-induced injury [^115tDpPA]. Red flags — anemia, weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, or family history of colorectal cancer or IBD — require **prompt colonoscopy** [^1142LsjP] and laboratory testing (CBC, CRP/ESR, stool calprotectin, and infection studies) [^116JKjHE] [^116UUwad]. Management is cause-specific: anti-inflammatory therapy for IBD [^notfound], antibiotics for infection [^notfound], and surgical or oncologic care for malignancy. Delayed diagnosis increases morbidity and mortality, so **early referral is essential** [^1118wjD4].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for concurrent diarrhea, constipation, and blood in stool includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) | - Ulcerative colitis <br/> - Crohn's disease [^114oMz7Y] |
| Colorectal cancer | - Adenocarcinoma <br/> - Polyp-related bleeding [^notfound] |
| Infectious colitis | - Bacterial (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli O157:H7) <br/> - Parasitic (Entamoeba histolytica, Schistosoma) [^112mkkny] [^117Lsfn1] |
| Ischemic colitis | - Vascular insufficiency <br/> - Hypoperfusion states [^notfound] |
| Radiation colitis | History of pelvic irradiation |
| Medication-induced injury | - NSAIDs <br/> - Anticoagulants <br/> - Chemotherapy agents [^112bzjP9] |
| Functional disorders | - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with mixed features (less likely to cause bleeding) [^112Rbjc6] |

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** is essential to determine the underlying cause:

- **History**: Detailed assessment of symptom duration, frequency, severity, associated symptoms (weight loss, fever, abdominal pain), dietary habits, medication use, travel history, and family history of gastrointestinal diseases [^116Si5YT].

- **Physical examination**: Abdominal examination for tenderness, masses, or distension; digital rectal examination to assess for rectal masses, hemorrhoids, or anal fissures [^115u3Z1u].

- **Laboratory tests**: Complete blood count (CBC), inflammatory markers (CRP, ESR), stool calprotectin, stool occult blood test, and stool cultures for infectious pathogens [^116JKjHE] [^1168yV1K].

- **Endoscopy**: Colonoscopy is the gold standard for evaluating chronic diarrhea, constipation, and rectal bleeding, allowing direct visualization of the colon and rectum, biopsy of suspicious lesions, and removal of polyps [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)**: Anti-inflammatory medications (aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologic agents), dietary modifications, and regular monitoring [^notfound].

- **Colorectal cancer**: Surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and palliative care as indicated [^notfound].

- **Infectious colitis**: Targeted antibiotic therapy based on identified pathogens, supportive care, and hydration [^1168yV1K].

- **Ischemic colitis**: Supportive care, management of underlying vascular insufficiency, and surgical intervention if necessary [^notfound].

- **Radiation colitis**: Anti-inflammatory medications, endoscopic therapy, and surgical intervention in severe cases.

- **Medication-induced injury**: Discontinuation of offending medications, supportive care, and alternative therapies.

---

## Potential complications

Untreated or poorly managed conditions presenting with diarrhea, constipation, and blood in stool can lead to **severe complications**, including:

- **Severe anemia**: Due to chronic blood loss [^notfound].

- **Electrolyte imbalances**: Resulting from chronic diarrhea or constipation [^notfound].

- **Bowel obstruction**: Particularly in cases of colorectal cancer or severe IBD [^115T9Qen].

- **Sepsis**: In cases of severe infectious colitis [^notfound].

- **Malnutrition**: Due to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms and nutrient loss [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with the **underlying cause**, disease severity, and timeliness of intervention. Early diagnosis and appropriate management significantly improve outcomes, whereas delayed diagnosis can lead to severe complications and increased mortality, particularly in cases of colorectal cancer or severe IBD [^1118wjD4].

---

The combination of diarrhea, constipation, and blood in stool is a **red-flag constellation** that requires urgent evaluation. Early, **cause-directed therapy** prevents complications and improves outcomes [^1142LsjP].

### Chronic diarrhea as the presenting feature of primary systemic AL amyloidosis: serendipity or delayed diagnosis? [^113atKe3]. BMC Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic diarrhea is common with a prevalence of 3% to 5% in the general population. The major causes of chronic diarrhea can be assessed by combining a patient's history and characteristic of the stool (inflammatory, fatty or watery). The differential diagnosis covers a wide range of diseases from common encountered entities such as chronic infection, inflammatory bowel disease, laxative abuse, and irritable bowel syndrome to rare disorders. Guidelines recommend categorizing chronic diarrhea as osmotic, inflammatory, secretory or motile, which help focus the diagnosis and further tests. Despite careful evaluation of the differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea, physicians can sometimes fail to recognize the cause. In this case, physicians should take into consideration causes less frequent or even rare diseases. In the present report, a case of primary AL amyloidosis with GI involvement presented as chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Although similar conditions have been reported scantly, none of them was initially diagnosed via random intestine biopsy, and with a detailed therapeutic follow-up.

### Recommendations for pharmacological clinical trials in children with irritable bowel syndrome: the Rome foundation pediatric subcommittee on clinical trials [^114mY5Lb]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is little published evidence of efficacy for the most commonly used treatments. Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct clinical trials on existing and novel therapies.

Purpose

In order to address these issues the Rome Foundation and members of the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency formed a subcommittee on clinical trials to develop guidelines for the design of clinical trials in children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The following recommendations are based on evidence from published data when available and expert opinion.

Key Recommendations

The subcommittee recommends randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, clinical trials to assess the efficacy of new drugs. The combined endpoints for abdominal pain are a decrease in intensity of at least 30% compared with baseline and to meet or exceed the Reliable Change Index (RCI) for the sample. Stool consistency is measured with the Bristol Stool Scale Form (BSFS). The subcommittee recommends as entry criteria for abdominal pain a weekly average of worst abdominal pain in past 24 h of at least 3.0 on a 0–10 point scale or at least 30 mm in 100 mm Visual Analog Scale. For stool endpoints the committee recommends an average stool consistency lower than 3 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-C and an average stool consistency greater than 5 in the BSFS during the run-in period for clinical trials on IBS-D. Changes in stool consistency are the primary endpoints for both IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) and IBS with constipation (IBS-C).

### Real-world delivery of rucaparib to patients with ovarian cancer: recommendations based on an integrated safety analysis of ARIEL2 and study 10 [^116tSNu2]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea and Constipation

Across the two rucaparib studies, the incidence of any grade diarrhea was 34.5% (n = 130), with only nine patients (2.4%) experiencing a grade ≥ 3 toxicity 26. Constipation was reported in a similar number of patients (any grade, n = 150 [39.8%]; grade ≥ 3, n = 6 [1.6%]) 26. Many patients with advanced EOC experience GI‐related symptoms such as constipation alternating with loose stools and abdominal bloating or cramps, which are thought to be due to peritoneal bowel serosal disease. In these studies, 55 patients (14.6%) were taking one or more medication to treat constipation at baseline (data on file). It is hard to establish from these single‐arm studies if the incidences of diarrhea and constipation were related to rucaparib or symptoms of the cancer. Results from the ARIEL3 study, in which patients with advanced EOC were randomized to maintenance treatment with either rucaparib or placebo, suggest a combination of both, as diarrhea and constipation were reported at relatively high levels in the placebo group and at increased incidence rates in the rucaparib group: diarrhea was reported in 118 of 372 patients (31.7%) receiving rucaparib and 41 of 189 (21.7%) receiving placebo, and constipation was reported in 136 of 372 patients (36.5%) receiving rucaparib and 45 of 189 (23.8%) receiving placebo 25.

Recommendations: patients who develop diarrhea while taking rucaparib should first undergo clinical assessments and investigations to exclude and treat any underlying causes, including infection, overflow from constipation, or medication‐induced diarrhea. Patients may require intravenous fluids and the addition of antibiotics per ASCO guidelines 31. Uncomplicated cases may be treated with loperamide. Rucaparib dose interruptions, followed by dose reductions, may be considered based on severity.

### Clinical perspective on management of key adverse events with sacituzumab govitecan [^116rjVGw]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Follow-up: The patient was evaluated and underwent laboratory assessment before each SG dose in the infusion center.

Concern at follow-up: The patient noted that her pain improved after cycle 1. She was feeling well except for grade 1 diarrhea with loose watery stools 3–4 times daily that would start 3–4 days after each infusion. She had problems with constipation in the past and had been hesitant to use loperamide.

Treatment plan: C. diff assessment was negative. Blood laboratory assessments were within normal limits. Loperamide was started at 4 mg initially, followed by 2 mg with every episode of diarrhea for a maximum of 16 mg daily. The patient was also given a prescription for 5 mg diphenoxylate-0.05 mg atropine to use up to 4 times a day if loperamide was not effective. She was also encouraged to orally hydrate and notify her oncology team if diarrhea symptoms were not responding to these management strategies.

Follow-up and outcome: After using loperamide as needed for diarrhea, symptoms were controlled. Cycle 2, Day 1 of SG was administered at full dose without delay. A regimen for early loperamide therapy for diarrhea was again reinforced to the patient (as outlined in the Diarrhea subsection) as part of chemotherapy education during cycle 2, Day 1. The patient again experienced diarrhea that was treated immediately with loperamide at home, leading to early control and absence of progression to grade 2 diarrhea. The patient had renewed confidence that early and regular use of loperamide, as needed, was a proactive approach for managing her symptoms.

Key learnings:

Therapy with SG may continue while managing grade 1 diarrhea with diagnostic assessments and supportive measures.
Control of grade 1–2 diarrhea with medication and supportive measures, followed by resumption of the same dose of therapy on subsiding to grade ≤ 1 is prudent.
For grade 3–4 diarrhea, SG should be withheld while managing the toxicity. Then, SG can be resumed with a dose reduction, if necessary, once diarrhea subsides to grade 1 or resolves.
Loperamide can be employed once infectious causes of diarrhea are excluded. If loperamide is not effective, diphenoxylate-atropine may be administered. In severe cases resistant to diphenoxylate-atropine, octreotide can be employed.

### Factors associated with consultation behaviour for primary symptoms potentially indicating colorectal cancer: a cross-sectional study on response to symptoms [^1118wjD4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Colorectal cancer (CRC): the burden of illness

Internationally, CRC is diagnosed in over one million persons annually (9.4% of all cancer diagnoses) and ranks as the fourth leading cause of cancer related death. On average, 50% of CRC cases are living five years following diagnosis. Survival rates for CRC are inversely related to stage at diagnosis with early staged-localised CRC 5-year survival rate at 90% compared to approximately 10% for distant metastatic CRC. The rate of early detection is relatively low with approximately 40% of CRC patients diagnosed at a localised stage.

Primary symptoms and clinical presentation of CRC

Rectal bleeding and change in bowel habit are common potential symptoms of CRC experienced in the population. Past studies have estimated 37–84% of all CRCs present with rectal bleeding. Change in bowel habit, broadly termed as diarrhoea or constipation, generally refers to a change in frequency of defecation, consistency of stool, shape of stool or difficulty in evacuation. Change in bowel habit is the symptom most associated with patient delay in presentation and presents in approximately 48–77% of CRCs, with increased frequency of defecation/diarrhoea accounting for the largest proportion of cases.

### Intestinal schistosomiasis in mothers and young children in Uganda: investigation of field-applicable markers of bowel morbidity [^117Lsfn1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

We report the results of an investigation designed to identify markers that could be used in a field situation to assess morbidity associated with intestinal schistosomiasis in young children and mothers in Uganda. These age classes potentially represent early and late stages of morbidity. We found that fecal calprotectin is not a suitable morbidity indicator for intestinal schistosomiasis. Conversely, a self-reported history of blood in stool or diarrhea showed a positive association with schistosomiasis infection in children. In addition, FOB tests show particular promise, especially for assessment of morbidity in young children.

A number of studies have investigated whether questionnaires enquiring about current or past experience of symptoms such as blood in stool and diarrhea can be used for individual assessment of morbidity or to determine which communities are at high risk of disease. Overall blood in stool has been found to be most strongly associated with schistosomiasis infection but the results were variable with a diagnostic sensitivity of 7–66% and specificity of 54–96%. We found that a history of blood in stool or diarrhea was associated with S. mansoni infection in children but not in mothers. However, if children near the two lakes were considered separately, the evidence for a relationship between positive questionnaire responses and S. mansoni infection was much weaker, indicating that questionnaire data may only be useful for assessing morbidity when studying large numbers of young children. The fact that questionnaire data were not particularly reliable as morbidity indicators is not surprising. Symptoms such as blood in stool and diarrhea are not specific for intestinal schistosomiasis and can be caused by a number of different infections. In addition, the data depend on the mother's recall of her own symptoms and those of her children, which may be imperfect. In contrast, self-reported blood in urine is found to be commonly associated with urinary schistosomiasis, caused by S. haematobium, in schistosomiasis-endemic areas.–

### Acute bloody diarrhea: a medical emergency for patients of all ages [^115MSYwf]. Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Acute bloody diarrhea should be considered a medical emergency. Its causes are frequently serious or actionable or both and are usually identified. However, acute bloody diarrhea as a stand-alone clinical presentation has received little scholarly attention in the past several decades. Although the range of possible causes of acute bloody diarrhea is broad, infectious considerations are paramount and should always be prioritized in the evaluation of such patients. History, examination, and laboratory testing should be focused on minimizing time to diagnosis (and, by extension, to implementing appropriate therapy). Strategically chosen tests and imaging, avoidance of extraneous diagnostic pursuits, and provision of supportive care while awaiting diagnostic clarity are central to the adroit management of patients with acute bloody diarrhea. Diagnostic considerations differ somewhat between adults and children but have many elements in common, including the need for vigilance in detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 infection. In this review, we discuss diagnostic approaches (emphasizing the importance of rapid, accurate, and thorough microbiologic investigation) and measures that can be taken to support patients while awaiting information that determines the cause of their disease. These topics are discussed in the context of the medical care that is available to children and adults with bloody diarrhea in most institutions in developed nations.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colonic ischemia, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, ACG 2015 guidelines recommend to assess for colon ischemia in the presence of symptoms including sudden cramping, mild, abdominal pain; an urgent desire to defecate; and passage within 24 hours of bright red or maroon blood or bloody diarrhea.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the surveillance and survivorship care of patients after curative treatment of colon and rectal cancer [^116EeRFL]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer surveillance — symptom triggers: During the course of surveillance, the development of suspicious symptoms should prompt investigation because these may be the first sign of CRC recurrence. In randomized studies, 16% to 66% of patients with CRC were symptomatic at the time of their diagnosis of recurrence, yet < 7% of patients with symptomatic CRC recurrence have resectable disease. Suspicious symptoms commonly include new-onset abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, blood in stool, abdominal mass, weight loss, and obstructive symptoms.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation and management of chronic constipation [^115uZLzd]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Initial evaluation of constipation — A directed history and physical examination should be performed in patients presenting with constipation, with strength of recommendation: strong based on low-quality evidence; history and examination can help ensure that a serious or even life-threatening disease is not the underlying cause, patients with rectal bleeding, change in caliber of stools, blood in the stool, weight loss, anemia, or a family history of colorectal cancer should be evaluated endoscopically for an endoluminal neoplastic process, a directed history may elucidate modifiable behavioral factors and medications that may be contributing to constipation, opioids, antidepressants, anticholinergics, calcium channel blockers, and calcium supplements are commonly associated with constipation and may need to be stopped or adjusted for symptomatic relief, patients may also have psychiatric, neurological, or endocrine disorders that may require treatment, and patients should be questioned regarding coexisting pelvic floor conditions.

Diagnostics — outbreak and public health coordination: A broader set of bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents should be considered regardless of the presence of fever, bloody or mucoid stools, or other markers of more severe illness in the context of a possible outbreak of diarrheal illness. Selection of agents for testing should be based on a combination of host and epidemiologic risk factors and ideally in coordination with public health authorities.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the laboratory evaluation of functional diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome in adults (IBS-D) [^114Vtb6H]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Grading framework — definitions of evidence quality and recommendation strength used by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA): Evidence quality levels include High ("We are very confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect".), Moderate ("We are moderately confident in the effect estimate… there is a possibility that it is substantially different".), Low ("Our confidence in the estimate is limited".), Very low ("We have very little confidence in the effect estimate".), and Evidence gap ("Available evidence is insufficient to determine true effect".). Recommendation strength includes Strong ("The AGA recommends… ") with patient/clinician guidance that "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course and only a small proportion would not" and "Most individuals should receive the recommended course of action… ", Conditional ("The AGA suggests… ") with guidance that "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course, but many would not" and that "Different choices would be appropriate for different patients… ", and No recommendation ("The AGA makes no recommendation… ") when "The confidence in the effect estimate is so low that any effect estimate is speculative at this time".

### Prevention and management of adverse events related to regorafenib [^112bzjP9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is common among patients receiving regorafenib. Five grades of diarrhea are described in the CTCAE version 4.03 (Table 1). Although grade 1 diarrhea (an increase of < 4 stools per day over baseline) may not present a significant problem for patients, grade 2 diarrhea (increase of 4–6 stools per day over baseline) can have a moderate effect on quality of life, limiting the patient's ability to leave the house, and grade 3 diarrhea (increase of ≥ 7 stools per day over baseline and incontinence) severely affects self-care activities of daily living (ADL). That said, in our experience, the prolonged occurrence of grade 2 diarrhea may negatively affect a patient's quality of life and ADL more than a short-lasting grade 3 event, and so it is important that patients are educated about the need to report and manage any occurrence of diarrhea.

Dietary advice that may minimize the likelihood of diarrhea (e.g. ensuring a low intake of fiber) should be given to patients on initiation of treatment. In order to effectively manage diarrhea and prevent symptoms from increasing in severity, patients should be advised to contact their healthcare team if they have an increase of more than three stools per day. Patients should also be educated about the variation in stool form and advised that changes to stool number or consistency do not always indicate diarrhea that requires treatment. The Bristol stool chart is a useful tool to help explain the variation to patients — stools are classified into seven types, with types 5–7 tending towards diarrhea.

We recommend that patients experiencing diarrhea of grades 1 and 2 should be advised to take loperamide (two 2-mg tablets) after the first stool and one additional tablet every 2 h, until 12 h after the last watery stool, for a maximum of 48 h. It is important to confirm that the patient is experiencing diarrhea, as the use of loperamide could otherwise cause constipation. In addition, the risk of developing constipation is increased in a patient already taking opioids for cancer-related pain. If loperamide does not control the diarrhea, for example when diarrhea remains grade 3 or higher after the 48-h loperamide period, the patient is likely to become dehydrated — the patient should be encouraged to increase fluid intake and hospital admission should be considered.

### Functional bowel disorders [^116mMFZM]. Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Employing a consensus approach, our working team critically considered the available evidence and multinational expert criticism, revised the Rome II diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders, and updated diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Diagnosis of a functional bowel disorder (FBD) requires characteristic symptoms during the last 3 months and onset ≥ 6 months ago. Alarm symptoms suggest the possibility of structural disease, but do not necessarily negate a diagnosis of an FBD. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are best identified by symptom-based approaches. Subtyping of IBS is controversial, and we suggest it be based on stool form, which can be aided by use of the Bristol Stool Form Scale. Diagnostic testing should be guided by the patient's age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Treatment of FBDs is based on an individualized evaluation, explanation, and reassurance. Alterations in diet, drug treatment aimed at predominant symptoms, and psychotherapy may be beneficial.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Gastrointestinal

The most common adverse reactions are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. To achieve minimal GI disturbance with an optimal LDL-C lowering effect, a gradual increase of dosage starting with 2 grams, once or twice daily is recommended. Constipation is the major single complaint and at times is severe. Most instances of constipation are mild, transient, and controlled with standard treatment. Increased fluid intake and inclusion of additional dietary fiber should be the first step; a stool softener may be added if needed. Some patients require decreased dosage or discontinuation of therapy. Hemorrhoids may be aggravated.

Other, less frequent gastrointestinal complaints consist of abdominal discomfort (abdominal pain and cramping), intestinal gas (bloating and flatulence), indigestion and heartburn, diarrhea and loose stools, and nausea and vomiting. Bleeding hemorrhoids and blood in the stool have been infrequently reported. Peptic ulceration, cholecystitis, and cholelithiasis have been rarely reported in patients receiving colestipol hydrochloride granules, and are not necessarily drug related.

Difficulty swallowing and transient esophageal obstruction have been rarely reported in patients taking colestipol hydrochloride tablets.

Transient and modest elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) and alkaline phosphatase were observed on one or more occasions in various patients treated with colestipol hydrochloride.

The following nongastrointestinal adverse reactions have been reported with generally equal frequency in patients receiving colestipol hydrochloride tablets, colestipol granules, or placebo in clinical studies:

Cardiovascular

Chest pain, angina, and tachycardia have been infrequently reported.

Hypersensitivity

Rash has been infrequently reported. Urticaria and dermatitis have been rarely noted in patients receiving colestipol hydrochloride granules.

Musculoskeletal

Musculoskeletal pain, aches and pains in the extremities, joint pain and arthritis, and backache have been reported.

Neurologic

Headache, migraine headache, and sinus headache have been reported. Other infrequently reported complaints include dizziness, light-headedness, and insomnia.

Miscellaneous

Anorexia, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and swelling of the hands or feet, have been infrequently reported.

### Ramosetron for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113Q6oN7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Safety

As shown in Fig. 5, safety profile was evaluated in all the included studies. In total, 54.9% of patients assigned to ramosetron experienced adverse events, compared with 49.0% of patients allocated to placebo. The RR (95%CI) for reported adverse events of ramosetron in comparison with placebo was 1.10 (0.97, 1.26) across all studies. There were no serious adverse events, especially no cases of ischemic colitis and severe constipation were reported. The most common adverse events with usage of ramosetron were hard stool and constipation. When data were pooled, the incidence of hard stool and constipation were both significantly higher in patients randomized to ramosetron than those receiving placebo, as the RRs (95% CI) were 4.74 (3.00, 7.51) and 2.53 (1.57, 4.10), respectively.

### Tegaserod (Zelnorm) [^112CnqFA]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Ischemic Events, Including Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE)

Stroke, MI, and cardiovascular death (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]) have been reported in adults taking ZELNORM who had an increased risk of developing an adverse cardiovascular event based on their medical history [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

ZELNORM is contraindicated in patients with a history of MI, stroke, TIA, or angina [see Contraindications (4)]. Assess female patients less than 65 years of age for a history of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors prior to treatment with ZELNORM [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The potential risks of treatment must be balanced with expectations in improvements in symptoms of IBS-C.

Discontinue ZELNORM in patients who experience an MI, stroke, TIA, or angina [see Contraindications (4)]. Evaluate the risks and benefits of continued use of ZELNORM in patients who develop clinical or other evidence of cardiovascular ischemic heart disease (e.g., coronary artery disease) and/or experience changes in health status that could increase cardiovascular risk during treatment with ZELNORM.

5.2 Ischemic Colitis

Ischemic colitis and other forms of intestinal ischemia have been reported postmarketing in patients receiving ZELNORM [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. In some cases, hospitalization was required. Discontinue ZELNORM in patients who develop symptoms of ischemic colitis, such as rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, or new or worsening abdominal pain. Evaluate patients experiencing these symptoms promptly and perform appropriate diagnostic testing. Do not reinitiate ZELNORM in patients who develop findings consistent with ischemic colitis or other forms of intestinal ischemia [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Volume Depletion Associated with Diarrhea

Diarrhea is one of the most common adverse reactions in ZELNORM-treated patients from the pooled IBS-C double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Diarrhea resulted in discontinuation in 1.6% of ZELNORM-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

In postmarketing experience, serious consequences of diarrhea including hypovolemia, hypotension, and syncope have been reported in patients treated with ZELNORM. In some cases, these complications have required hospitalization for rehydration. Avoid use of ZELNORM in patients who are currently experiencing or frequently experience diarrhea. Instruct patients to discontinue ZELNORM and contact their healthcare provider if severe diarrhea, hypotension, or syncope occur.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^114euyFG]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Irritable Bowel Syndrome Subtypes

Irritable bowel syndrome is categorized as one of four subtypes according to the predominant stool pattern: IBS-D, IBS with constipation, IBS with a mix of both diarrhea and constipation, or IBS unclassified. Of these, IBS-D has the highest prevalence, affecting up to 40% of adults diagnosed with IBS. Internationally, 1.2% of individuals experience IBS-D, and, like IBS overall, there is a slight preponderance of females compared with males (1.3% vs. 1.0%).

Patients with IBS-D pass Bristol Stool Form Scale type 6 or type 7 stools (loose, mushy, watery) during more than 25% of bowel movements and types 1 and 2 stools (hard, lumpy, pellet-like) less than 25% of the time (Fig. 1). Rome IV diagnostic criteria specify that stool texture should be assessed on days with abdominal pain to enable greater precision in differentiating the IBS subtype.

Because the symptoms of IBS-D may overlap with those of other conditions, such as EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, disaccharidase deficiencies, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and infections, diagnosis is not always straightforward. However, the initial classification of diarrhea as watery (indicative of IBS), fatty or/greasy (indicative of EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of inflammatory bowel disease) can begin to narrow the differential diagnosis (Table 2).

### Chronic constipation in the elderly: a primer for the gastroenterologist [^115u3Z1u]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

In clinical practice, dealing with a constipated patient requires accurate collection of anamnestic data, with particular attention to family history, medications (especially those that are known to slow down the gastrointestinal transit) and comorbidities, together with a physical examination that includes digital rectal examination.

In an effort to improve diagnostic categorization, an International group of experts has proposed a number of symptom-based criteria for FGID, including chronic constipation, known as the Rome criteria. In Table 2 are listed the main criteria as reported in the latest edition (Rome III). These, together with the exclusion of alarm symptoms (such as rapid weight loss, hematochezia, family history of colorectal cancer or inflammatory bowel disease, positive faecal occult blood test, iron deficiency anaemia and a recent onset constipation) may lead to the diagnosis of functional constipation, often avoiding unnecessary and costly examinations. The presence of any alarm symptom requires further investigations, including colonoscopy.

Table 2
Rome III diagnostic criteria for chronic constipation

While the diagnostic predictivity of Rome III criteria in irritable bowel syndrome-related constipation has been evaluated in several studies, data on chronic constipation are still lacking. In addition, although often applied in clinical trials the Rome III criteria are not commonly used in the clinical practice. O the other hand, the Bristol stool scale could be a useful tool in daily practice. This is a seven level scale based on the texture degree and morphology of faeces, which correlates with gastrointestinal transit times. The first two levels are representative of slow intestinal transit, while stool consistency levels of 6 and 7 correlate to an accelerated transit and diarrhea.

A well performed digital rectal examination may reveal the presence of morphology alterations of the pelvic floor (proctitis, rectal prolapse, rectal cancer, etc.), additionally allowing for functional evaluation of the anorectum (anal sphincter tone, evacuatory dysfunction).

### Latent class analysis does not support the existence of Rome IV functional bowel disorders as discrete entities [^11279L8K]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2022). Medium credibility.

The functional bowel disorders share the same core gastrointestinal symptoms, namely abdominal pain, change in bowel habit, including both diarrhea and constipation, abdominal bloating, and abdominal distension. They are differentiated solely according to the relative frequency with which these symptoms are reported, with no compelling evidence of distinct pathophysiological mechanisms separating the conditions. Indeed, they all share a common etiological construct as disorders of gut‐brain interaction. Consequently, it is debatable whether they are truly discrete disorders, or instead represent a spectrum of gastrointestinal illness. This possibility is emphasized by the observation that relatively minor changes in symptom frequency can change the diagnosis for any individual patient. In the absence of organic disease, a patient who has diarrhea, but who reports pain less than weekly, will meet criteria for functional diarrhea. However, should the frequency of their pain increase to at least weekly, they will instead be diagnosed with IBS with diarrhea (IBS‐D). The same is true of the relationship between symptom reporting and diagnosis in functional constipation compared with IBS‐C. Similarly, bloating and distension are frequently reported by patients with IBS but are not essential to make the diagnosis. Conversely, a patient with functional abdominal bloating and distension might also experience some abdominal pain and/or altered bowel habit, albeit at a threshold insufficient to meet criteria for IBS, functional diarrhea, or functional constipation. Finally, those individuals with unspecified functional bowel disorder can experience any or all of these symptoms whilst not meeting criteria for any other functional bowel disorder. Overall, it could therefore be suggested that people with functional diarrhea, functional constipation, functional abdominal bloating and distension, and unspecified functional bowel disorder are better characterized as suffering from a milder form of IBS.

### Chronic diarrhoea in adults: what not to miss [^1169dzYE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Chronic diarrhoea remains a diagnostic challenge, with numerous causes and few effective symptomatic treatments. This review focuses on new methods for diagnosis of common disorders and alerts readers to rarer causes through a systematic approach to the underlying mechanisms.

Recent Findings

New strategies are emerging to stratify the need for endoscopic investigation. Faecal immunochemical testing, combined with standard blood tests, shows promise in excluding colorectal cancers, adenoma and inflammatory bowel disease, challenging the current use of faecal calprotectin. Serum analysis for markers of bile acid synthesis has been refined, potentially streamlining diagnostic pathways of bile acid malabsorption for those who are unable to access nuclear medicine scans, but the positive predictive value of faecal elastase in low prevalence populations has been questioned. Novel markers such as volatile organic compounds and stool DNA analyses continue to develop.

Summary

A systematic approach to investigation of chronic diarrhoea will ensure all relevant causes are considered and minimize the chance of a missed diagnosis. Combination of clinical features with noninvasive testing supports a judicious approach to endoscopic investigations but further innovation will be needed to resolve the diagnostic challenge that diarrhoea poses.

### Medical management of fecal incontinence [^113aRMN6]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Diarrhea and constipation are known risk factors for fecal incontinence. This report reviews how to diagnose and medically treat patients with chronic diarrhea, chronic constipation with overflow incontinence, and incontinence resulting from rectal mucosal prolapse secondary to hemorrhoids. Antidiarrheal agents (including loperamide, diphenoxylate, and difenoxin) and the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline improve continence in patients with diarrhea-associated incontinence. Other antidiarrheal agents are under investigation. The mechanism is believed to be decreased intestinal motility and stool frequency resulting in more formed stools. Increases in anal canal resting pressure may also contribute to improvement in continence. Adverse effects are constipation from excessive use. In addition to antidiarrheal drugs, fiber supplements may improve incontinence associated with diarrhea. Transient, benign cases of constipation usually respond to increasing fluid intake and dietary fiber, improving mobility, or eliminating the concurrent use of constipating drugs. For mild to moderate constipation, bulking agents, laxatives, and stool softeners are used cautiously so as not to excessively loosen stools and exacerbate anal incontinence. Laxatives have been shown to improve continence, possibly through the mechanism of eliminating fecal impaction. Prolapsing hemorrhoids may partially obstruct defecation and cause soilage from the passage of fecal material, mucus, or blood. With endoscopic banding, a ligator is attached to an endoscope and a tight band is placed around the enlarged vein, causing the hemorrhoid to thrombose.

### Colorectal cancer pre-diagnostic symptoms are associated with anatomic cancer site [^113xQQrp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Main findings

In this study, we observed statistically significant associations between CRC symptoms and CRC anatomic site. There was evidence that those who experienced blood in stool and changes to stool were more likely to be diagnosed with rectal cancer, while those who experienced abdominal pain, anemia, and other symptoms were more likely to be diagnosed with colon cancer. The observed positive association between the experience of blood in stool and rectal cancer site were particularly pronounced for early-onset CRC.

Interpretation of findings

Rectal cancer patients diagnosed under the age of 50 (early-onset) are more likely to display symptoms for a length of time before they seek medical care perhaps due to a lack of risk awareness for their age or access to health services. Early onset rectal cancer patients are also more likely to present with a later disease stage. Furthermore, there is an average 6-month time to diagnosis from symptom presentation in early-onset CRC patients. Our study indicates that blood in stool is a more common pre-diagnostic symptom in patients who go on to a diagnosis of rectal vs. colon cancer. For early-onset CRC patients, the likelihood of being diagnosed with rectal cancer among those experiencing blood in stool increases. Because we know that patients with rectal cancer are more likely to display symptoms for a duration of time, this may differentially impact time to diagnosis in rectal cancer patients compared to colon cancer patients. The results also suggest that red flag symptoms may be predictive of early-onset rectal cancer. Specifically, blood in stool (a form of rectal bleeding) should be investigated further, as a common clinical scenario that is mistakenly attributed to hemorrhoids or other benign etiology and not generally evaluated further in a young patient.

### Classification of pediatric functional gastrointestinal disorders related to abdominal pain using Rome III vs. Rome IV criterions [^1127KpPA]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Data sources

Gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms

All patients that fit the inclusion criteria had previously completed a standardized medical history form as part of the routine clinical evaluation for chronic abdominal pain. The standardized form included questions regarding the occurrence of abdominal pain, change in frequency or consistency of stools, and the presence of relief from defecation. Furthermore, patients labeled the location of their pain on a diagram of an abdomen that was placed on the form. Patients also indicated if the pain woke them up at night and if it increased following a meal. Further questions included whether the subjects experienced nausea or vomiting, early satiety, early satiety that prevented them from finishing a regular sized meal, and/or postprandial bloating. Other gastrointestinal symptoms assessed included having loose or hard stools, mucus or blood in stool, excessive flatulence, heart burn, acid regurgitation, diarrhea, or constipation.

Information acquired from this standardized form was entered into a database and used to classify their condition using the pediatric Rome III and Rome IV criteria, respectively. Under Rome III criteria, the patient was considered to have FD if they reported any upper abdominal pain not relieved by stooling and not associated with a change in stool frequency or form. Under Rome IV, a diagnosis of FD was made if the patient reported "bothersome" early satiety, postprandial bloating, or epigastric pain or burning unrelated to stool symptoms. FD was further classified per Rome IV as postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) if they had postprandial bloating or early satiety that prevented them from finishing a normal sized meal, and/or as epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) if they had pain or burning localized only to the epigastrium. IBS was diagnosed by Rome III if they had at least two of the following symptoms or Rome IV if they had at least one of the following symptoms: a change in stool frequency, a change in stool form, or if pain was relieved by a stool. As the questionnaire had been created, and information collected, before the Rome IV criteria were released, information regarding whether pain increased with a stool was not ascertained. When IBS classification did not match between Rome III and Rome IV (i.e. no IBS diagnosis under Rome III, but fulfilled IBS criteria under Rome IV), the symptom accounting for the new Rome IV diagnosis was recorded and enumerated. Diagnosis of an overlap syndrome consisted of having both FD and IBS within each respective Rome criterion.

This article, which follows a debate between the authors on the topic at the 2010 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Annual meeting, discusses the differential diagnoses of a young child presenting with the so-called toddler diarrhoea.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^116YLzzu]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

3 Primary clinical assessment

The initial assessment of patients with chronic diarrhoea can be mostly carried out in the primary care setting. The importance of careful history taking and examination cannot be overemphasised.

3.1 Initial presentation in primary care

In most countries where there is a split primary/secondary care system, the first consultation is with the primary care physician. Around 10% of all consultations in primary care are for gastroenterological problems, of which half are for lower gastrointestinal (GI) problems. Most of these are for self-limiting symptoms or for functional GI disorders and only a very small proportion comprise chronic or persistent diarrhoea. Based on the accepted definition of chronic diarrhoea being abnormal passage of ≥ 3 loose stools per day for more than 4 weeks and a rate of 3–5% per year, a primary care physician with an average list size of 1700 patients may have 50–85 such patients each year. Only a proportion of these will consult, with many managing with self- or pharmacy-based treatments, while others will be managed within primary care, often with antidiarrhoeals.

No data are available on the proportion referred to secondary care, but these are likely to be a small minority of the total number of people with chronic diarrhoea in the community. First-line investigations are normally performed within primary care and patients may be referred if their condition causes interference with normal activities or a compromise of quality of life sufficient to warrant further action. As with other conditions, many patients merely adapt their lives to their symptoms. No formal primary care referral guidelines or recommendations exist for patients with chronic diarrhoea, but the presence of normal first-line investigations with symptoms severe enough to impair quality of life and not responding to treatment constitutes a rationale for referral.

The impact of the symptoms of chronic diarrhoea and the differential diagnoses that need to be considered are clearly different in individual patients. A patient with recent change in bowel habit to include diarrhoea over 6 weeks is likely to need a different approach compared with another patient who has suffered from intermittent watery diarrhoea which has been present for over 5 years. Blood, stool (if an infectious aetiology or if an inflammatory component is suspected) and serological tests (for coeliac disease, hyperthyroidism and anaemia) should be performed in primary care as an initial assessment. Equally, if alarm features (such as unexplained change in bowel habit, persistent blood in the stool and unintentional weight loss) are detected, then referral for further investigations should be initiated.

### The patient with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms: when to investigate and how? [^11232DYU]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disorder whose clinical presentation varies considerably between patients as well as within the same individual over time. Many of its symptoms, such as pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating, may be manifestations of a host of other gastrointestinal diseases; some accompanied by increased mortality. This presents the clinician with a real dilemma: how to sensibly investigate the patient in which one suspects IBS but there is a nagging doubt that 'it could be something else'? Could one miss 'something serious'? This short review attempts to provide both an evidence-based response to these vexing questions and a practical guide to detecting alternative diagnoses in the subject with IBS-type symptoms.

Recent Findings

Clinical features, patient demographics and the clinical context can help to significantly narrow the differential diagnosis of the individual with IBS-type symptoms and may permit a positive diagnosis of IBS. The advent of noninvasive serological and stool tests has greatly facilitated differentiation from celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, respectively. In the older, female diarrhea sufferer microscopic colitis should be considered. The role of bile acid diarrhea in the individual with diarrhea-predominant IBS is emphasized; the status of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth in IBS remain uncertain.

Summary

Attention to detail in the clinical evaluation of the individual with IBS-like symptoms will facilitate a selective and targeted approach to investigation. Wherever indicated, widely available serological and fecal tests will serve to bolster the diagnosis by excluding other options. Proceeding to more invasive testing should be dictated by clinical presentation and scenario with the threshold for intervention being generally lower among those with prominent diarrhea.

Background

Abdominal pain is a bothersome and lifestyle limiting symptom in patients with functional bowel disorders. It is associated with decreased quality of life in affected individuals, as well as significant annual healthcare expenditure. Knowledge of specific factors that predict improvement in abdominal pain in those with functional bowel disorders is thus far limited.

Consecutive patients presenting for outpatient care at a major academic medical center between October 2017 and March 2020 completed an electronic symptom survey prior to initial clinic visit, and again after 3 months. The Rome IV questionnaires for functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea were all included. Additionally, all subjects completed the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Anxiety, Depression, and sleep disturbance questionnaires. Patients with a diagnosis of a Rome IV functional gastrointestinal disorder without any organic cause for symptoms were identified based on both chart review as well as survey response data. Univariable and multivariable analysis was used to assess predictors of improved abdominal pain after 3 months.

Key Results

180 patients with a mean age of 45.3 years were included in the final analysis. 78.3% of patients were female, and 77.2% met Rome IV criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. On multivariable analysis, improvement in constipation and diarrhea were both independent predictors of improved abdominal pain after 3 months.

Conclusions and Inferences

Improvement in constipation and diarrhea both predicted improvement in abdominal pain, suggesting that addressing these factors is central to the management of abdominal pain in functional gastrointestinal disorders.

### Alosetron [^115pSzpH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Serious Complications of Constipation

Some patients have experienced serious complications of constipation without warning.

Serious complications of constipation, including obstruction, ileus, impaction, toxic megacolon, and secondary bowel ischemia, have been reported with use of alosetron tablets during clinical trials. Complications of constipation have been reported with use of 1 mg twice daily and with lower doses. A dose response relationship has not been established for serious complications of constipation. The incidence of serious complications of constipation was approximately 0.1% (1 per 1,000 patients) in women receiving either alosetron tablets or placebo. In addition, rare cases of perforation and death have been reported from postmarketing clinical practice. In some cases, complications of constipation required intestinal surgery, including colectomy. Patients who are elderly, debilitated, or taking additional medications that decrease gastrointestinal motility may be at greater risk for complications of constipation.

Alosetron tablets should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop constipation [see Boxed Warning].

5.2 Ischemic Colitis

Some patients have experienced ischemic colitis without warning.

Ischemic colitis has been reported in patients receiving alosetron tablets in clinical trials as well as during marketed use of the drug. In IBS clinical trials, the cumulative incidence of ischemic colitis in women receiving alosetron tablets was 0.2% (2 per 1,000 patients, 95% confidence interval 1 to 3) through 3 months and was 0.3% (3 per 1,000 patients, 95% confidence interval 1 to 4) through 6 months. Ischemic colitis has been reported with use of 1 mg twice daily and with lower doses. A dose-response relationship has not been established. Ischemic colitis was reported in one patient receiving placebo. The patient experience in controlled clinical trials is insufficient to estimate the incidence of ischemic colitis in patients taking alosetron tablets for longer than 6 months.

Alosetron tablets should be discontinued immediately in patients with signs of ischemic colitis such as rectal bleeding, bloody diarrhea, or new or worsening abdominal pain. Because ischemic colitis can be life-threatening, patients with signs or symptoms of ischemic colitis should be evaluated promptly and have appropriate diagnostic testing performed. Treatment with alosetron tablets should not be resumed in patients who develop ischemic colitis.

### Differential diagnosis of chronic diarrhea: an algorithm to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea from other organic gastrointestinal diseases, with special focus on exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [^116Si5YT]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC DIARRHEA

Early and accurate diagnosis is essential in disease management. A patient with chronic diarrhea may present with a spectrum of symptoms indicating one of several disorders, including IBS-D, EPI, celiac disease, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections (eg, giardiasis). All of these conditions may include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence among their symptoms. To assist in the accurate diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, we suggest a four-step diagnostic process (Fig. 2).

Step 1: Thorough History and Physical Examination

Diagnosis should begin by taking a thorough history and physical examination. Patients presenting with chronic diarrhea, defined as persisting for ≥ 4 weeks, should be questioned in detail on their symptoms and prior diarrhea history. Although the clinical definition of diarrhea is loose or watery stools ≥ 3 times in a 24-hour period, patients use various definitions (eg, loose stools, increased stool frequency, or fecal urgency), underscoring the importance of an accurate and detailed patient history. Abnormal stool form can be more important in defining diarrhea because patients with functional constipation will also present with a chief complaint of diarrhea owing to increased defecatory frequency. However, further questioning may cause illicit symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, obstruction, and the passage of hard stools.

As an initial approach, we recommend determining if diarrhea can be categorized as watery (indicative of IBS, celiac disease, endocrinopathy, or laxative misuse), fatty or greasy (which may indicate a malabsorptive or maldigestion disease, such as celiac disease or EPI), or inflammatory (indicative of infectious or inflammatory bowel disease); however, definitive categorization is not always possible using these criteria because some conditions overlap (Table 2). Further questioning should include the following: What is the pattern of diarrhea? Is it continuous, intermittent, or meal-related (this may differentiate secretory from osmotic diarrhea)? When did it start? Was there a precipitating event? What is the volume of feces? Is there blood, mucus, or fat in the stool or toilet basin? Is there a nocturnal component to diarrhea? Is there fecal urgency or incontinence?, In addition, other gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms should be explored, and potential aggravating factors, such as diet, stress, or medications, and alleviating factors should be queried.

### Constipation, diarrhea, and symptomatic hemorrhoids during pregnancy [^115MxRa4]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Constipation, diarrhea, and symptomatic hemorrhoids are disorders common in the general population, particularly in women. These conditions, if mild, often are self-treated with various home remedies or nonprescription preparations. Few of these patients, moreover, are referred to gastroenterologists, as primary care providers generally are confident managing these conditions, unless they are severe, refractory to conventional management, or require additional diagnostic studies.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Gastrointestinal

The most common adverse reactions are confined to the gastrointestinal tract. To achieve minimal GI disturbance with an optimal LDL-C lowering effect, a gradual increase of dosage starting with 2 grams, once or twice daily is recommended. Constipation is the major single complaint and at times is severe. Most instances of constipation are mild, transient, and controlled with standard treatment. Increased fluid intake and inclusion of additional dietary fiber should be the first step; a stool softener may be added if needed. Some patients require decreased dosage or discontinuation of therapy. Hemorrhoids may be aggravated.

Other, less frequent gastrointestinal complaints consist of abdominal discomfort (abdominal pain and cramping), intestinal gas (bloating and flatulence), indigestion and heartburn, diarrhea and loose stools, and nausea and vomiting. Bleeding hemorrhoids and blood in the stool have been infrequently reported. Peptic ulceration, cholecystitis, and cholelithiasis have been rarely reported in patients receiving colestipol hydrochloride granules, and are not necessarily drug related.

Difficulty swallowing and transient esophageal obstruction have been rarely reported in patients taking COLESTID Tablets.

Transient and modest elevations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) and alkaline phosphatase were observed on one or more occasions in various patients treated with colestipol hydrochloride.

The following nongastrointestinal adverse reactions have been reported with generally equal frequency in patients receiving COLESTID Tablets, colestipol granules, or placebo in clinical studies:

Cardiovascular

Chest pain, angina, and tachycardia have been infrequently reported.

Hypersensitivity

Rash has been infrequently reported. Urticaria and dermatitis have been rarely noted in patients receiving colestipol hydrochloride granules.

Musculoskeletal

Musculoskeletal pain, aches and pains in the extremities, joint pain and arthritis, and backache have been reported.

Neurologic

Headache, migraine headache, and sinus headache have been reported. Other infrequently reported complaints include dizziness, light-headedness, and insomnia.

Miscellaneous

Anorexia, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and swelling of the hands or feet, have been infrequently reported.

### Parasitic infections in Swiss children: are we overtesting? [^112mkkny]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Bloody diarrhea is usually evidence of a bacterial infection (Salmonella, Shigella or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli pathotypes;), but can also be caused by Entamoeba histolytica. Most infections are asymptomatic, but invasive intestinal disease may occur manifesting with several weeks of cramping, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea and weight loss. Persistent diarrhea lasts for at least 14 days can suggest a parasitic etiology, such as Cryptosporidium species, Giardia intestinalis, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Dientamoeba fragilis, Cystoisospora belli etc. A differential diagnosis of bloody and persistent diarrhea is inflammatory bowel disease and has to be ruled out.

3% of the negative tested children received the final diagnosis of functional constipation. The only situation, in which constipation can be caused by parasites is a partial/total blockage of the gut due to an excessive presence of them. In terms of size, Ascaris lumbricoides, is the largest roundworm that parasitize the human gastrointestinal tract and can cause constipation and intestinal obstruction in endemic regions, in patients with high worm loads. Although it is among the most common helminthic human infections with an estimated one billion people infected, it only exists in tropical and subtropical environments and should not be an indication to regularly test European children with signs of constipation.

Worldwide, areas with high rates of parasitic infection include India, Africa, and Central and South America, due to poor sanitation and socioeconomic conditions. Studies have reported that travelers to low- and middle-income countries (mainly areas in South America, Africa and South Asia) are between 9 and 151 times more likely to develop diarrhoeal illness. This is in line with our findings, where 80% of all patients with a negative stool result did not have a history of travelling abroad.

5.5 Diarrhea or Colitis

Severe diarrhea, resulting in dehydration and in some cases in acute kidney injury, can occur in patients treated with PIQRAY. Most patients (58%) experienced diarrhea during treatment with PIQRAY. Grade 3 diarrhea occurred in 7% (n = 19) of patients. Among patients with Grade 2 or 3 diarrhea (n = 71), the median time to onset was 46 days (range, 1 to 442 days).

In clinical trials, 63% of patients who experienced diarrhea required antidiarrheal medications (e.g., loperamide) to manage symptoms. Dose reductions of PIQRAY were required in 6% of patients, and 2.8% of patients permanently discontinued PIQRAY due to diarrhea.

Colitis has been reported in the postmarketing setting in patients treated with PIQRAY [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor patients for diarrhea and additional symptoms of colitis, such as abdominal pain and mucus or blood in stool. Based on the severity of the diarrhea or colitis, PIQRAY may require dose interruption, reduction, or discontinuation as described in Table 4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Advise patients to start antidiarrheal treatment, increase oral fluids, and notify their healthcare provider if diarrhea occurs while taking PIQRAY.

Patients with colitis may require additional treatment, such as enteric-acting and/or systemic steroids.

### Colonic mucosal eosinophilia in children without inflammatory bowel disease [^113EE1kJ]. Human Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Children undergoing colonoscopy and mucosal biopsies may show increased colonic mucosal eosinophils, which may or may not be associated with inflammatory bowel disease. There is not much clinical data on American children who have isolated increased colonic mucosal eosinophils. We sought to study the clinical correlates of children without inflammatory bowel disease who show increased mucosal eosinophils to understand their clinical presentation, etiological associations, and outcome. A retrospective analysis of children seen at a tertiary-level Children's hospital was performed by reviewing their medical charts and extracting pertinent data. There were 110 children in the study who had increased colonic mucosal eosinophils. Most children presented with abdominal pain, but several of them also had constipation, blood in stools, and diarrhea. Food allergies, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, and lactase deficiency were the top four conditions present in these patients. Pathology of the colonic distribution revealed involvement of more than two colonic regions in 86% of the subjects, and only two subjects showing epithelial or crypt involvement by eosinophils. All subjects had a good outcome. Children with colonic mucosal eosinophilia (CME) who do not have an inflammatory bowel disease most frequently present with abdominal pain and primarily an increase of lamina propria eosinophils in two or more colonic regions. Based on the etiological associations we noted in the study, a work-up of children with CME may encompass detailed history for functional gastrointestinal disorders and lactose intolerance, testing for food and environmental allergies, stool examination for parasites, and peripheral blood counts. Almost all children had resolution of symptoms in the studied period suggesting that CME in children has a good clinical outcome.

Chronic constipation — colonoscopy indications and colorectal neoplasia yield are summarized as follows: A meta-analysis of 8 cross-sectional studies found that constipation alone, as a presenting symptom, was not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. In a retrospective study of 985 patients who underwent colonoscopy as part of their evaluation for constipation, the polyp detection rate was 9.7%, and 9 patients (6.3%) were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. In general, a colonoscopy should be recommended if patients meet guideline criteria for general screening or if patients present with concerning symptoms, such as hematochezia, weight loss, or change in bowel habits; have a strong family history of colorectal cancer; or have anemia and warrant further investigation.

The Questionnaire on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS) is a questionnaire assessing symptoms and disability associated with FGIDs, with separate versions available for parents and children. Included in this questionnaire are 6 items asking how often the child missed activities at school, including class work, sports, or other activities, due to specific gastrointestinal complaints (e.g. pain, vomiting, bowel issues) in the past 3 months, as well as a duplicate 6 items asking how often the child missed activities with friends or at home. Individual items are scored on a 5-point scale from "Never" (0) to "Everyday" (4) and were summed within category to provide separate total scores (range = 0–24) by reporter for missed school and missed family/friend activities.

A review of systems (ROS) was completed as part of the initial visit to the abdominal pain clinic. The child and the parent were asked verbally, while together in the same room, to respond "yes" or "no" to a list of symptoms that the child may have experienced in the past. Consensus on these items was obtained at the time of checklist completion. Symptoms included weight loss, weight gain, constipation, soiling, diarrhea, vomiting, heartburn, blood in stool, difficulty swallowing, nausea, liver disease, chest pain, headache, dizziness, ADHD, asthma, joint problems and allergies.

1 Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common disorders within the category of disorders of gut–brain interaction (DGBI), with a global prevalence of 3%–6% according to the Rome IV criteria and is a frequent cause of referral to a gastroenterologist. The pathophysiology of IBS is complex, involving an interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. Key contributors to the pathophysiology in patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders include visceral hypersensitivity, alterations in gut microbiota and immune function, disturbances in motility, and changes in the communication between the gut and the central nervous system.

According to the Rome IV criteria, IBS is defined as recurrent abdominal pain associated with defecation or a change in stool form or frequency. Abdominal pain must be present, on average, at least once per week for the past 3 months, with symptom onset occurring at least 6 months before the diagnosis. IBS is divided into subtypes based on the predominant bowel habit: IBS with predominant constipation (IBS‐C), IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS‐D) and IBS with mixed bowel habits (IBS‐M). Patients who exhibit unexplained bowel symptoms but do not meet the Rome IV criteria for IBS, functional diarrhea and functional constipation, are classified under the category "unspecific functional bowel disorder", the most prevalent subgroup of functional bowel disorders. This classification is useful in guiding treatment toward the predominant symptom.

IBS with predominant constipation (IBS-C) — diagnosis and alarm features: IBS-C is described as a subtype of IBS that accounts for more than one-third of IBS cases. A positive diagnosis of IBS-C can be made on the basis of medical history and physical examination, evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms (especially alarm signs), limited diagnostic testing, and use of the symptom-based Rome IV criteria, and the presence of alarm features such as new symptom onset after age 50 years; rectal bleeding not attributable to hemorrhoids or anal fissures; unintentional weight loss; iron deficiency anemia; nocturnal diarrhea; and a family history of colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac disease requires more patient-specific investigations.

### Predictive values of an immunological fecal occult blood test for the diagnosis of colorectal cancer compared using colonoscopy in symptomatic patients in yaounde (Cameroon) [^115T9Qen]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

This study found a significant number of patients for which colonoscopy indication was a change in bowel habits. Most of them was constipation, but we also found diarrhea or alternation between diarrhea and constipation. El Housse et al. in Morocco in 2015, identified a symptomatology dominated by transit disorders, diarrhea and/or constipation in a study of the anatomoclinical profile of patients with CRC. A large mass of CRC could lead to a large bowel obstruction responsible for these symptoms.

We obtained a positive occult blood test in 45 patients (43.7%). This result is higher than rates observed in Lagos urban area and other regions in Nigeria. The Lancet review "Colorectal cancer screening in sub-Saharan Africa" reveals the positivity rates of 11% in Lagos, 20% in Osun, and 28% in Kwara. The high frequency of positivity of the occult blood test in our sample could be explained by the criteria's selection of patients. In our study, we included symptomatic patients with symptoms such as abdominal pains, constipation, diarrhea, and bloating. There are some other digestive disorders justifying the need for colonoscopy without any macroscopic visible blood in their stools. But these symptoms could also suggest a colonic lesion, increasing the risk of microscopic bleeding. While the iFOB test has been developed for asymptomatic patients without macroscopic digestive bleeding nor other signs, the inclusion of symptomatic patients could explain the high prevalence of positive test in our study.

### Gastrointestinal symptoms predictors of health-related quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^112rhEug]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of the study was to investigate the multidimensional gastrointestinal symptoms predictors of generic health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the perspectives of pediatric patients and parents.

Methods

The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a 9-site study by 260 families of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Gastrointestinal Symptoms Scales measuring stomach pain, food and drink limits, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were identified as clinically important symptom differentiators from healthy controls based on prior findings, and subsequently tested for bivariate and multivariate linear associations with overall HRQOL (Generic Core Scales).

Results

Stomach pain, food and drink limits, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in stool, and diarrhea were significantly associated with decreased HRQOL in bivariate analyses (P < 0.001). In predictive models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for age, sex, and race/ethnicity, gastrointestinal symptoms accounted for an additional 40% of the variance in patient self-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001) and 37% of the variance in parent proxy-reported HRQOL (P < 0.001), reflecting large effect sizes. Stomach pain, food and drink limits, and constipation were significant individual patient-reported predictors after controlling for the other gastrointestinal symptoms in the predictive models.

Conclusions

Patient-reported gastrointestinal symptoms differentially predicted HRQOL. Identifying the specific gastrointestinal symptoms from a standardized multidimensional gastrointestinal symptoms profile that are the most important predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a patient-centered approach for interventions designed to ameliorate impaired HRQOL.

### CTI as a biomarker for diarrhea in U.S. adults: insights from NHANES 2005–2010 [^111Y3b8d]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The bowel is an extremely vital organ for digestion in the human body, and it also serves as the largest immune organ, playing a crucial role in maintaining overall health and immunity. Constipation and diarrhea, as the most common bowel dysfunction, are widespread health issues affecting a significant portion of the global population. Constipation affects approximately 15% of individuals worldwide, while diarrhea impacts around 20%, making both conditions prevalent concerns in public health. Diarrhea can originate from multiple organic disorders of the gastrointestinal tract as well as select systemic conditions, exemplified by celiac disease and bile acid diarrhea. Bowel dysfunctions ​​adversely affect quality of life​​, contributing to ​​rising healthcare expenditures​, representing a public health issue. However, there is a current lack of objective methods for evaluating diarrhea and constipation, ​​diarrhea and constipation are most frequently diagnosed using the Bristol Stool Scale as the standard criterion in clinic practice and treatment often focuses on symptomatic management, which frequently yields unsatisfactory results. This underscores the need for more effective and targeted approaches to address these prevalent bowel dysfunction conditions.

Differential diagnosis

Given the lack of any diagnostic marker or examination, IBS can be presented or misdiagnosed as another disease with similar signs or symptoms. The differential diagnosis includes many diseases, not only of the gastrointestinal tract, but also from extraintestinal causes. Diseases that commonly present with diarrhea and should be excluded first are microscopic colitis, IBD, celiac disease, infections, hyperthyroidism, carbohydrate malabsorption, and bile acid diarrhea. On the other hand, disorders that present with constipation and should be excluded are colorectal cancer or anal malignancy that obstructs the lumen, dyssynergic defecation, and hypothyroidism. Other reasons for abdominal pain should also be excluded in patients with IBS. Endometriosis, diverticulitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and ovarian cancer are just some examples of diseases that could possibly present with similar abdominal pain.

IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME

Irritable bowel syndrome is the most common cause of diarrhea in the developed world, with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 4% to 9%, based on Rome III/IV criteria. Although patients can present with IBS at any age, it is most common in women aged 20 to 40 years, with women being diagnosed about twice as often as men (14% vs. 8.9%).

According to Rome IV clinical criteria, IBS may be diagnosed if abdominal pain is present at least 1 day per week, is associated with changes in visceral perception with defecation and/or alterations in stool form/frequency, and the symptoms affect patients' quality of life or their abilities to carry out normal activities of daily living. While these clinical criteria do not require symptoms to be present for a specific period of time, the practitioner must be confident that other diagnoses have been appropriately excluded. The Rome IV research-based criteria are more stringent, requiring symptoms to be present for the previous 3 months with onset > 6 months before diagnosis (Table 1). Symptoms not included in the definition of IBS-D, but commonly identified at presentation, include abdominal bloating and/or distension, fecal urgency, sensations of incomplete evacuation, and the passage of mucus in stools. Stools are characteristically watery (Bristol Stool Form Scale 6–7, Fig. 1) and passed during waking hours. Stress is a well-known mediator. Importantly, the development of symptoms in those older than 50 years, unintentional weight loss, acute unexplained symptom changes, recurrent bleeding and/or anemia, and a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or colorectal cancer are considered alarm features or 'red flags' necessitating further diagnostic evaluation for organic causes other than IBS (Figs. 2 and 3).

Certainty of evidence and grading — the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for RCTs and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Evidence from RCTs starts at high certainty, and evidence derived from observational studies starts at low certainty; for each outcome, the evidence is graded as high, moderate, low, or very low. The evidence can be rated down for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, and can be rated up for large magnitude of effect or dose–response relationship. Judgments about the certainty of evidence were determined via consensus and an overall judgment of certainty of evidence was made for each PICO.

Chronic constipation — tests for medical causes: In the absence of other symptoms and signs, only a complete blood cell count is necessary (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Unless other clinical features warrant otherwise, metabolic tests (glucose, calcium, sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone) are not recommended for chronic constipation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). A colonoscopy should not be performed in patients without alarm features (eg, blood in stools, anemia, weight loss) unless age-appropriate colon cancer screening has not been performed (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Whereas the presence of chronic abdominal pain, the defining symptom of IBS, distinguishes these patients from those with functional diarrhea, there is significant overlap between the two; indeed, patients may oscillate between the diagnoses. Patients with IBS, especially those with frequent pain, have been shown to experience increased psychological distress and somatic comorbidities compared with patients with functional diarrhea, and they should therefore be evaluated accordingly. Early treatment of these overlapping conditions may be beneficial.

### Evaluation of chronic diarrhea [^114oMz7Y]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea, defined as a decrease in stool consistency for more than four weeks, is a common but challenging clinical scenario. It can be divided into three basic categories: watery, fatty (malabsorption), and inflammatory. Watery diarrhea may be subdivided into osmotic, secretory, and functional types. Watery diarrhea includes irritable bowel syndrome, which is the most common cause of functional diarrhea. Another example of watery diarrhea is microscopic colitis, which is a secretory diarrhea affecting older persons. Laxative-induced diarrhea is often osmotic. Malabsorptive diarrhea is characterized by excess gas, steatorrhea, or weight loss; giardiasis is a classic infectious example. Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is also malabsorptive, and typically results in weight loss and iron deficiency anemia. Inflammatory diarrhea, such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, is characterized by blood and pus in the stool and an elevated fecal calprotectin level. Invasive bacteria and parasites also produce inflammation. Infections caused by Clostridium difficile subsequent to antibiotic use have become increasingly common and virulent. Not all chronic diarrhea is strictly watery, malabsorptive, or inflammatory, because some categories overlap. Still, the most practical diagnostic approach is to attempt to categorize the diarrhea by type before testing and treating. This narrows the list of diagnostic possibilities and reduces unnecessary testing. Empiric therapy is justified when a specific diagnosis is strongly suspected and follow-up is available.

### Fecal microbiota profiling in irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease patients with irritable bowel syndrome-type symptoms [^116mE9y4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Changes in the intestinal microbiota can result in the loss of intestinal homeostasis, which has been found in a variety of intestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBD is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract with unknown etiology and includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). The pathogenesis of IBD remains incompletely understood, though it is currently recognized that it is closely related to genetic susceptibility, environment, a disruption of the intestinal microbiota, and immune disorders, especially of the intestinal microbiota. A large number of studies have confirmed that the interaction between intestinal flora and genetic susceptibility can be considered a contributor to the pathogenesis of IBD by triggering an exacerbated immune response. Previous studies indicate that altered gut microbiota composition was found in IBD patients, including reductions in microbial diversity and richness. Specifically, beneficial bacteria decrease, while harmful bacteria increase.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel disease characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. IBD patients in the active stage often have abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools and other uncomfortable symptoms. Some IBD patients in remission (IBDR) have persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea and abdominal discomfort. For IBDR, these symptoms meet the criteria for IBS and can be defined as IBS-type symptoms. According to previous studies, the prevalence of IBS-type symptoms in patients with IBD with clinically quiescent disease ranges from 25 to 60% due to the different definitions of remission and population sizes. There is a lack of evidence-based therapeutic options available for the management of such patients, who experience a reduced quality of life equivalent to that of patients with overt inflammatory disease activity.

### Can we predict the development of ischemic colitis among patients with lower abdominal pain? [^117Hep7c]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study was performed to find clinical risk factors for developing ischemic colitis in patients experiencing lower abdominal discomfort with or without bloody diarrhea.

Methods

A total of 467 patients who underwent sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy because of lower abdominal discomforts with or without blood in stool were consecutively enrolled; 147 patients were diagnosed endoscopically and histologically as having ischemic colitis. The control group was composed of the remaining 320 patients with nonspecific endoscopic/histologic findings. Clinical variables were compared between the ischemic colitis group and the control group.

Results

After excluding 67 patients in the ischemic colitis group, we compared the remaining 80 patients to the control group, using various clinical parameters. According to the logistic regression analysis, six factors were significantly related to ischemic colitis: older than aged 60 years (adjusted odds ratio, 5.7; 95 percent confidence interval: 2.6–11.7), hemodialysis (5; 1.2–21.6), hypertension (4.9; 2.3–10.5), hypoalbuminemia (3.5; 1.8–6.7), diabetes mellitus (3.4; 1.3–8.8), and constipation-inducing medications (2.8; 1.1–7.1). Through our analysis, we were able to predict the development of ischemic colitis for the patients with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4+ risk factors: 8, 21, 55, 79, and 100 percent, respectively.

Conclusions

Old age, hemodialysis, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypoalbuminemia, and constipation-inducing medications are clinically important risk factors for ischemic colitis in patients experiencing lower abdominal discomfort with or without bloody stool. By considering these factors, we were able to predict with high accuracy the development of ischemic colitis.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the pharmacological management of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea [^114PwBRW]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) diagnostic criteria context for trials notes that the Rome IV criteria differ from Rome III by deleting abdominal discomfort and requiring abdominal pain to be present at least 1 day per week on average during the preceding 3 months, resulting in fewer individuals meeting Rome IV than Rome III. For randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that generally measure changes in abdominal pain, Rome IV criteria are described as more applicable, but it is not known whether these diagnostic changes would alter the efficacy and safety of IBS treatments in RCTs.

### Early symptoms preceding post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome following COVID-19: a retrospective observational study incorporating daily gastrointestinal symptoms [^117SC8Bc]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Study population

We included patients (1) aged ≥ 18 years, (2) diagnosed with COVID-19 with a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 from an upper respiratory tract sample obtained by nasopharyngeal swab, and (3) admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 treatment because of oxygen requirement or risks for exacerbation. Patients who had been diagnosed with IBS before COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded.

Data collection and definition

The collected data included patient demographics; comorbidities; date of a positive RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2; RT-PCR quantification cycle (Ct) for SARS-CoV-2; vital signs recorded by patient-monitoring devices and healthcare providers; laboratory data, such as white blood cell (WBC) count and hemoglobin, platelet, albumin, total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels; medications for COVID-19, including dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, tocilizumab, and remdesivir; a descriptive record of GI symptoms; GI diseases diagnosed after admission; and the date and time for each collected data. Length of hospitalization, length of ICU admission, and survival status were also assessed.

Daily GI symptoms during hospital stay were recorded by registered nurses at least three times a day and included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distention, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal pain. The stool form was observed by a healthcare provider and classified using the Bristol Stool Scale. Diarrhea was defined as 6 or 7 on the Bristol scale, and constipation was defined as 1 or 2 on the Bristol scale or absence of defecation for 3 consecutive calendar days. IBS was clinically diagnosed by board certified physicians who completed gastroenterology training using the Rome IV criteria with at least 3 months of observation of symptoms. In addition, among patients with data available on the duration of all medications and the timing of diagnosis, IBS was objectively confirmed either by (1) the date of IBS diagnosis that was ≥ 4 months after COVID-19 admission (at least 1-month interval before the initial IBS symptoms) or by (2) ≥ 3 months of use of medication for IBS with at least a 1-month interval before the initial IBS symptoms (therefore, ≥ 4 months of observation). Subtypes of IBS were not recorded in the registry and the follow-up periods varied across patients from 1 month to 1 year, depending on the date of admission for COVID-19 and presence of symptoms.

### An insight into patients' perspectives of ulcerative colitis flares via analysis of online public forum posts [^114Cyxib]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient-perceived initial symptoms of UC flares

In most of the posts related to flare management (60.2% [N = 4042]), patients monitored their symptoms (absence, presence, and severity) in an attempt to understand and manage their flares, while in the remaining posts (39.8%), patients placed additional importance on clinical tests. However, among posts related to identifying flares (N = 645), patients did not commonly make a distinction between initial (experienced at the start of a flare) or general (experienced throughout a flare) symptoms when discussing their perceived flare symptoms. Blood in the stool was the most frequently discussed flare indicator (experienced at the start of a flare; 57.8% of posts [N = 645]) and was often co-mentioned with mucus in the stool, followed by diarrhea and loose stools (19.1% of posts), and increased frequency of bowel movements (stool frequency; 18.6% of posts) (Table 1). Patients reported that they often confused blood in the stool with hemorrhoidal bleeding, and also reported diarrhea as a common symptom for gastrointestinal infections and dietary intolerances, which resulted in a delay in seeking medical advice for some patients (28.2% of posts from patients with blood in their stool and 83.4% of posts from patients with diarrhea).

### The spectrum of constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome and chronic idiopathic constipation: US survey assessing symptoms, care seeking, and disease burden [^117L8aM9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common symptom-based functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, estimated to affect between 5 and 20% of the population. It is more common in females than males and more common in younger adults (< 50 years old). Specifically, the Rome III diagnostic criteria for functional GI disorders define IBS as recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort (at least 3 days per month in the last 3 months) associated with at least two of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in stool frequency, and/or onset associated with change in stool form. The diagnosis of IBS is subtyped by the predominant stool pattern: constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed (IBS-M).

Similar to IBS, chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC), also referred to as functional constipation, is a symptom-based functional GI disorder. Prevalence estimates vary by geographic region and disease definition; a recent meta-analysis based on 41 studies reported a pooled prevalence of 14%, with a confidence interval of 12–17%. CIC has been observed to be more common in females and older adults. The Rome III diagnostic criteria use the term functional constipation, defining it based on the frequency of specific bowel symptoms (e.g. straining, lumpy/hard stools, incomplete evacuation, sensation of anorectal obstruction, manual maneuvers for defecation, and ≤ 3 defecations/week) combined with the requirement that the patient does not meet the criteria for IBS.

### Chronic diarrhea: diagnosis and management [^113uFvCT]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff. Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria). Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis. Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.

### Duvelisib (Copiktra) [^115tDpPA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.3 Diarrhea or Colitis

Serious, including fatal (1/442; 0.2%), diarrhea or colitis occurred in 18% of patients receiving COPIKTRA 25 mg BID (N = 442). The median time to onset of any grade diarrhea or colitis was 4 months (range: 1 day to 33 months), with 75% of cases occurring by 8 months. The median event duration was 0.5 months (range: 1 day to 29 months; 75thpercentile: 1 month).

Advise patients to report any new or worsening diarrhea. For non-infectious diarrhea or colitis, follow the guidelines below:

For patients presenting with mild or moderate diarrhea (Grade 1–2) (i.e. up to 6 stools per day over baseline) or asymptomatic (Grade 1) colitis, initiate supportive care with antidiarrheal agents as appropriate, continue COPIKTRA at the current dose, and monitor the patient at least weekly until the event resolves. If the diarrhea is unresponsive to antidiarrheal therapy, withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g. budesonide). Monitor the patient at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea, consider restarting COPIKTRA at a reduced dose.

For patients presenting with abdominal pain, stool with mucus or blood, change in bowel habits, peritoneal signs, or with severe diarrhea (Grade 3) (i.e. > 6 stools per day over baseline) withhold COPIKTRA and initiate supportive therapy with enteric acting steroids (e.g. budesonide) or systemic steroids. A diagnostic work-up to determine etiology, including colonoscopy, should be performed. Monitor at least weekly. Upon resolution of the diarrhea or colitis, restart COPIKTRA at a reduced dose. For recurrent Grade 3 diarrhea or recurrent colitis of any grade, discontinue COPIKTRA. Discontinue COPIKTRA for life-threatening diarrhea or colitis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

### Persistent constipation and abdominal adverse events with newer treatments for constipation [^115PSmKc]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Twenty-five trials gave the number or percentage of patients who reported diarrhoea as a spontaneous adverse event. Figure 3 displays the percentage of patients who reported diarrhoea with active treatment, or placebo stratified by type of constipation and then by active treatment. Results from 24 of the 25 trials were above the identity line, indicating that the percentage of individuals with diarrhoea with active treatment was greater than the percentage of patients with diarrhoea with placebo in the same trial.

Figure 3
Relationship between diarrhoea with active treatment and that with placebo. The percentage of participants with diarrhoea with active treatment is plotted as a function of the corresponding value with placebo. If more than one dose of active treatment was tested in a particular trial, the value from the highest dose is analysed. The dashed diagonal line is the identity line. Symbols above the identity line indicate that the value for diarrhoea with active treatment is higher than the corresponding value with placebo, and values below the identity line indicate the opposite.

### Do the symptom-based, Rome criteria of irritable bowel syndrome lead to better diagnosis and treatment outcomes? The con argument [^114FFJ5M]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Some claim that symptom-based Rome criteria are diagnostic and enhance clinical practice and choice of therapy for patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. This overview focuses on lower gastrointestinal symptoms: constipation, diarrhea, pain and bloating. The main con arguments for using such criteria for diagnosis are: insufficient specificity, overlap of symptom-based categories or disorders, insufficient and therefore non-specific characterization of pain in the criteria, inability to differentiate the "mimics" of IBS-C and IBS-D, and inability to optimize treatment for IBS-M or bloating in the absence of objective measurements. While doctors may not land in trouble using "symptom diagnosis" of IBS, this should not deter them from optimizing diagnosis and treatment of diseases associated with gastrointestinal dysfunction.

Dysentery is diagnosed clinically as the presence of gross blood in diarrheal stools. Dysentery stools can be quite scanty and composed mainly of mucus and blood (shown here). Bacillary dysentery is typically preceded by 18–24 hours of watery diarrhea, accompanied by high fever and toxemia, before the loose stools become scanty and bloody. Dysentery indicates substantial damage to the mucosa of the colon and terminal ileum.
