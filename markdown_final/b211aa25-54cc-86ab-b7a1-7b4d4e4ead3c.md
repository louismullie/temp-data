## Question

How do you treat neuropathic pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat neuropathic pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing a baseline. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic options and their comparative efficacy. Next, I will consider second- and third-line therapies, including topicals and opioids, and check where neuromodulation fits. After that, I need to review combination therapy, nonpharmacologic strategies, and special populations. Finally, I will outline monitoring, safety, and when to escalate care, making sure each step aligns with current high-quality evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and establish a baseline, because treatment hinges on accurate identification of neuropathic pain and quantifying severity and impact. I should confirm a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system using history, exam, and, when needed, diagnostic tests, and then quantify pain with validated scales and document sleep, mood, and function to track response and tolerability over time [^113JieAf] [^112n1nF5].

> Next, I should review first-line pharmacologic options and their relative efficacy. Wait, let me verify the most current comparative data. The 2025 NeuPSIG meta-analysis supports strong recommendations for tricyclic antidepressants, α2δ-ligands, and SNRIs as first-line, with NNTs around 4.6 for TCAs, 8.9 for α2δ-ligands, and 7.4 for SNRIs, which aligns with prior NeuPSIG and Cochrane estimates and supports choosing among these based on comorbidity, contraindications, and patient preference [^112PY1yN] [^115S7auQ] [^113J3HNe] [^111dyx2h] [^111DENQb].

> I will now examine TCAs in more detail. Amitriptyline has long-standing evidence and a low NNT near 2–3 in some analyses, but I need to ensure I screen for cardiac disease, orthostasis, and anticholinergic risk, and I should remember that unbiased high-quality evidence is limited, so I should set expectations and monitor closely for adverse effects like sedation and dry mouth [^116PdoQc] [^113ymtNU].

> Let me consider α2δ-ligands next. Gabapentin and pregabalin have consistent benefit in postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy, with pregabalin showing dose-responsive efficacy and gabapentin requiring titration to 1800–3600 mg/day; I should double-check for dizziness, somnolence, and edema, and note that pregabalin has more robust data in some central pain states than gabapentin, though evidence in HIV neuropathy is limited or negative [^113J3HNe] [^111dyx2h] [^113KihfK].

> Now, SNRIs. Duloxetine and venlafaxine have moderate NNTs and favorable cardiac profiles compared with TCAs; I should confirm hepatic status for duloxetine and monitor for nausea, insomnia, and blood pressure effects with venlafaxine, recognizing that venlafaxine's evidence base is smaller but supportive in painful polyneuropathy [^115S7auQ] [^111VSjww].

> Hold on, I should verify where topicals fit. High-concentration capsaicin 8% patch and lidocaine 5% plasters are reasonable second-line options, particularly for localized peripheral neuropathic pain or when systemic therapy is contraindicated; capsaicin has an NNT near 10–13 for 50% pain reduction and the advantage of minimal systemic exposure, though local burning and the need for preapplication anesthesia should be discussed and planned [^112PY1yN] [^1114TRhs] [^112wq7BA].

> I need to check the role of opioids. Strong opioids have modest efficacy with NNTs around 6 and meaningful safety concerns; guidelines consistently place them as third-line or reserved options, with careful risk assessment, dose limits, and close monitoring; tramadol may be considered earlier in select cases given its dual mechanism, but again, evidence quality is limited and adverse effects are common [^112PY1yN] [^114vo4ZF] [^114pp9Wi].

> Let me think about neuromodulation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has low-certainty benefit with an NNT near 4.2 and is a noninvasive option for refractory cases, while spinal cord stimulation has evolving evidence and is recommended by NICE for chronic refractory neuropathic pain after a successful trial; I should confirm multidisciplinary evaluation and realistic expectations before referral [^112PY1yN] [^116n1kud].

> Next, I should review combination therapy. My first instinct is to assume combinations are superior, but wait, I should verify the meta-analytic data. A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis found no consistent superiority of common combinations over monotherapy, so if I use combinations, it should be as carefully monitored individual trials, often pairing agents with different mechanisms at lower doses to improve tolerability rather than efficacy per se [^114a5HmK] [^114a5HmK].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic strategies as essential adjuncts. Cognitive behavioral therapy, pain neuroscience education, graded motor imagery, and exercise can improve pain, function, and coping; I should confirm access and integrate these early, especially in chronic or centralized pain phenotypes, and consider them foundational alongside medications rather than optional extras [^115eMBcL] [^113Yow3m].

> But wait, what if the patient is older or has multiple comorbidities. In older adults, I should prioritize topicals or agents with lower anticholinergic and hypotensive risk, consider duloxetine if hepatic function allows, and use TCAs cautiously; for patients with cardiac disease, I should avoid TCAs and consider duloxetine or gabapentinoids with monitoring; for renal impairment, I need to adjust gabapentin and pregabalin dosing; for hepatic disease, I should avoid duloxetine and consider gabapentin or topicals; for substance use disorder, I should avoid opioids and consider nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacotherapy [^115jrQsH] [^113KihfK].

> I should double-check special etiologies. For spinal cord injury, updated CanPainSCI guidelines emphasize individualized, multidisciplinary care and classify options into B, C, and D categories rather than rigid lines, reflecting variable evidence; for cancer-related neuropathic pain, ESMO supports first-line adjuvants and judicious opioid combinations when needed; for HIV neuropathy, evidence for gabapentinoids is limited and some guidelines allow cautious opioid trials after first-line failures [^113StEAA] [^114YLtrk] [^112bpuZE].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I need to ensure reassessment at 2–4 weeks for efficacy and tolerability, titrate to effect or adverse effects, and if there is inadequate response after an adequate trial, switch mechanism or class rather than simply escalating dose; I should monitor for sedation, falls, suicidality, cardiac effects with TCAs, blood pressure with venlafaxine, and misuse with opioids, and I should document functional outcomes alongside pain scores [^111NK1fd].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate. If two adequate trials of different first-line classes fail, I should consider a topical, tramadol, or neuromodulation depending on phenotype and access; if three or more adequate trials fail, I should refer to a multidisciplinary pain center for advanced therapies such as SCS, DRG stimulation, or targeted drug delivery, ensuring shared decision-making and alignment with patient goals [^111NK1fd] [^116n1kud].

> Finally, I need to ensure the plan is dynamic and patient-centered. I should revisit the diagnosis if response remains poor, consider phenotyping or QST where available, and adjust treatment to evolving comorbidities, preferences, and access; I should also counsel that complete pain relief is uncommon and that modest, clinically meaningful improvements in pain and function are realistic targets, which helps maintain adherence and engagement over time [^113JieAf] [^113TjGfA].

Neuropathic pain is best managed with a **stepwise, mechanism-based approach** that starts with first-line agents (gabapentinoids, SNRIs, TCAs) and escalates to second-line options (topicals, tramadol) or third-line therapies (opioids, neuromodulation) if needed [^112PY1yN] [^115S7auQ]. Combination therapy is often required because monotherapy rarely achieves adequate relief, and **individualized selection** should consider comorbidities, side effects, and patient preference [^114a5HmK] [^112suxbK]. Nonpharmacologic care (CBT, exercise, acupuncture) is essential adjuncts, and **regular reassessment** guides titration, switching, or adding agents to optimize outcomes [^115eMBcL] [^113Yow3m].

---

## Diagnostic confirmation and baseline assessment

Before treatment, **confirm neuropathic pain** using a structured clinical approach (history, exam, and, when needed, diagnostic tests) [^112n1nF5] and establish a baseline with validated scales (e.g. DN4, LANSS, PainDETECT) and patient-reported outcomes to track response [^notfound].

---

## First-line pharmacological treatments

First-line agents have the **strongest evidence** and should be prioritized:

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Gabapentinoids | Gabapentin, pregabalin | α2δ-1 subunit blockade; reduces calcium influx and excitatory neurotransmitter release | Strong; NNT ~6–8 for 50% pain relief [^115S7auQ] [^113J3HNe] [^111dyx2h] |
| Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) | Duloxetine, venlafaxine | Inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake; enhance descending inhibition | Strong; NNT ~6–7 [^115S7auQ] [^111DENQb] |
| Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) | Amitriptyline, nortriptyline | Inhibit serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake; sodium channel blockade | Strong; NNT ~3–4 [^115S7auQ] [^111DENQb] |

---

Selection should be **individualized** based on comorbidities, contraindications, and side-effect profiles. Gabapentinoids are preferred in patients with anxiety or insomnia; SNRIs in those with depression or anxiety; and TCAs when sedation is desired or in older adults with caution [^notfound].

---

## Second-line pharmacological treatments

Use second-line options when first-line agents are ineffective or poorly tolerated:

- **Topical agents**: Lidocaine 5% patches (postherpetic neuralgia) and capsaicin 8% patches (peripheral neuropathic pain) provide localized relief with minimal systemic effects [^112wq7BA] [^1114TRhs].
- **Tramadol**: A weak opioid with SNRI activity; consider for moderate pain or when first-line agents are insufficient [^112PY1yN] [^114pp9Wi].

---

## Third-line and advanced therapies

Reserve third-line options for refractory cases:

- **Strong opioids**: Morphine, oxycodone, or methadone may be considered short-term with careful monitoring due to limited efficacy and significant risks [^112PY1yN] [^114vo4ZF].
- **Neuromodulation**: Spinal cord stimulation or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for refractory neuropathic pain [^112PY1yN] [^116n1kud].
- **Botulinum toxin A**: Local injections for focal neuropathic pain syndromes [^112PY1yN].

---

## Combination therapy

Given modest monotherapy efficacy, **rational combinations** (e.g. gabapentinoid + SNRI/TCA) are often used to improve analgesia and tolerability; evidence is growing but still limited, so monitor closely for additive side effects [^114a5HmK] [^112suxbK].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacologic care is essential and should be integrated early:

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: Reduces pain catastrophizing and improves coping [^notfound].
- **Exercise**: Low-intensity, longer-duration programs improve symptoms and function [^115eMBcL].
- **Acupuncture**: Moderate evidence for symptom relief in diabetic neuropathy [^115eMBcL].
- **Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)**: Adjunctive option for some patients [^113StEAA].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment

Regularly reassess pain, function, mood, sleep, and side effects every 2–4 weeks initially, then every 3–6 months. Titrate to effect or tolerability, and if response is inadequate, switch mechanism or combine agents rather than escalating indefinitely [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Elderly patients**: Prefer gabapentinoids or topical agents; use TCAs cautiously due to anticholinergic effects [^115jrQsH].
- **Patients with substance use disorder**: Avoid opioids; prioritize non-opioid options and non-pharmacologic care [^notfound].
- **Cancer-related neuropathic pain**: Consider opioids earlier with adjuvant agents per oncology guidelines [^114YLtrk].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Personalized medicine**: Sensory profiling and biomarkers may guide therapy selection [^113TjGfA].
- **Novel agents**: Nav1.7 blockers, GABAergic modulators, and anti-inflammatory agents are under investigation [^notfound].
- **Digital therapeutics**: App-based CBT and neuromodulation interfaces are promising adjuncts [^notfound].

---

Effective neuropathic pain management requires a **stepwise, mechanism-based approach** with first-line agents, judicious use of second- and third-line therapies, and integration of non-pharmacologic care. Regular reassessment and individualized selection optimize outcomes, and emerging strategies offer hope for refractory cases.

### Unmet needs in the management of neuropathic pain [^113BY5gW]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a challenging condition to treat. It is heterogeneous in nature and largely resistant to treatment with commonly prescribed analgesics. Current management strategies fail to achieve adequate or satisfactory pain relief in a high proportion of patients. The four main reasons that treatments for neuropathic pain fail are: inadequate diagnosis and a lack of appreciation of the mechanisms involved; insufficient management of comorbid conditions; incorrect understanding or selection of treatment options; and the use of inappropriate outcomes measures. These unmet needs in the current management of neuropathic pain are reviewed in this article. The review focuses on the need for a methodical and mechanistic approach to diagnosis, and a flexible, interdisciplinary approach to treatment of neuropathic pain conditions, in order to improve pain relief and quality of life in patients with neuropathic pain.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common condition affecting a large portion of the population. Treatment choices are broad and diverse, giving clinicians a variety of options that can be tailored to the individual patient. While medications have the highest level of evidence for treatment, other options including therapy, modality, psychological, and lifestyle approaches should be considered as a part of the treatment algorithm. These approaches can often be used in tandem to hopefully provide the patient with a well‐rounded treatment plan for peripheral neuropathic pain.

### Peripheral neuropathies: new recommendations for neuropathic pain pharmacotherapy [^111bFbBi]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

A recent review and meta-analysis on pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain provides a precise update on treatment efficacy and adverse effects. The authors offer revised evidence-based recommendations for first-line therapies and subsequent options, but we still a need to improve individual treatment decisions, including nonpharmacological therapies, in affected patients.

### Future directions in neuropathic pain therapy: closing the translational loop [^113cEcBr]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

In the majority of patients, existing therapies for neuropathic pain are far from effective. Furthermore, all current treatments are symptomatic rather than disease-modifying or curative. A range of therapeutic modalities is emerging, targeting a variety of mechanisms, but choosing the best target and evaluating the resulting therapies against the many types of neuropathic pain disorders is not an easy task. In this article, we suggest a shift in emphasis of the drug discovery paradigm toward unbiased evaluation of the particular neurobiological mechanisms contributing to neuropathic pain in individual patients. Genomewide association studies and other discovery science approaches to identify significant novel targets should be given priority as should the development of increasingly sophisticated tools for measuring and categorizing neuropathic pain.

### Considerations for neuropathic pain conditions in life care planning [^116P4Yi6]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

Significant progress has been made in assessing and managing neuropathic pain. Newer, more effective treatments with minimal side effects are available. Despite advances in treatments, neuropathic pain remains a multifaceted phenomenon that can be difficult to alleviate. Diagnosis, mechanisms of injury, and treatment recommendations are critical components of life care plans for patients with neuropathic pain. A clear understanding of the underlying issues and careful coordination with neurologists and other treatment providers are key to providing optimal life care plans. Understanding that pain treatments vary over time and by individual patient is integral to comprehensive life care planning.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: a systematic review [^1171tnuQ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), defined as "statements that include recommendations intended to optimize patient care that are informed by a systematic review of the evidence and an assessment of the benefits and harms of alternative care options", have been expected to facilitate more consistent, effective and efficient medical practice, and ultimately improve health outcomes. Many organizations worldwide have published CPGs on similar topics in the past several decades, but their quality has been found to vary highly. Therefore, concerns have risen about the quality of CPGs.

Neuropathic pain (NP), caused by a somatosensory lesion or various diseases, comprises a wide range of heterogenous conditions. NP affects millions of people worldwide, and its estimated prevalence in the general population is as high as 7–8%. Generally, NP is chronic, severe and resistant to over-the-counter analgesics. Thus, the management of NP is challenging. To improve the management for NP, the European federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS), the Canadian Pain Society Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NePSIG), the Assessment Committee of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as well as an expert panel of the Middle East region (MER), Latin American (LA), and South Africa (SA), have developed the CPG for the management of NP.

In the present study, we systematically reviewed the available CPGs for NP, focusing on their methodological quality, using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument, and also assessed the consistency of the CPG recommendations.

### Pharmacotherapy and non-invasive neuromodulation for neuropathic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112PY1yN]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Background

There remains a substantial unmet need for effective and safe treatments for neuropathic pain. The Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group aimed to update treatment recommendations, published in 2015, on the basis of new evidence from randomised controlled trials, emerging neuromodulation techniques, and advances in evidence synthesis.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, PubMed, the International Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov from data inception for neuromodulation trials and from Jan 1, 2013, for pharmacological interventions until Feb 12, 2024. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated pharmacological and neuromodulation treatments administered for at least 3 weeks, or if there was at least 3 weeks of follow-up, and which included at least ten participants per group. Trials included participants of any age with neuropathic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain. We excluded trials with enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal designs and those with participants with mixed aetiologies (ie, neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain) and conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain without radicular pain, fibromyalgia, and idiopathic orofacial pain. We extracted summary data in duplicate from published reports, with discrepancies reconciled by a third independent reviewer on the platform Covidence. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of responders (50% or 30% reduction in baseline pain intensity or moderate pain relief). The primary safety outcome was the number of participants who withdrew from the treatment owing to adverse events. We calculated a risk difference for each comparison and did a random-effects meta-analysis. Risk differences were used to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) for each treatment. Risk of bias was assessed by use of the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2 and certainty of evidence assessed by use of GRADE. Recommendations were based on evidence of efficacy, adverse events, accessibility, and cost, and feedback from engaged lived experience partners. This study is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023389375.

Findings

We identified 313 trials (284 pharmacological and 29 neuromodulation studies) for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Across all studies, 48 789 adult participants were randomly assigned to trial groups (20611 female and 25078 male participants, where sex was reported). Estimates for the primary efficacy and safety outcomes were tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) NNT = 4.6 (95% CI 3.2–7.7), NNH = 17.1 (11.4–33.6; moderate certainty of evidence), α2δ-ligands NNT = 8.9 (7.4–11.10), NNH = 26.2 (20.4–36.5; moderate certainty of evidence), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) NNT = 7.4 (5.6–10.9), NNH = 13.9 (10.9–19.0; moderate certainty of evidence), botulinum toxin (BTX-A) NNT = 2.7 (1.8–9.61), NNH = 216.3 (23.5-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), capsaicin 8% patches NNT = 13.2 (7.6–50.8), NNH = 1129.3 (135.7-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), opioids NNT = 5.9 (4.1–10.7), NNH = 15.4 (10.8–24.0; low certainty of evidence), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) NNT = 4.2 (2.3–28.3), NNH = 651.6 (34.7-∞; low certainty of evidence), capsaicin cream NNT = 6.1 (3.1-∞), NNH = 18.6 (10.6–77.1; very low certainty of evidence), lidocaine 5% plasters NNT = 14.5 (7.8–108.2), NNH = 178.0 (23.9-∞; very low certainty of evidence). The findings provided the basis for a strong recommendation for use of TCAs, α2δ-ligands, and SNRIs as first-line treatments; a weak recommendation for capsaicin 8% patches, capsaicin cream, and lidocaine 5% plasters as second-line recommendation; and a weak recommendation for BTX-A, rTMS, and opioids as third-line treatments for neuropathic pain.

Interpretation

Our results support a revision of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Treatment outcomes are modest and for some treatments uncertainty remains. Further large placebo-controlled or sham-controlled trials done over clinically relevant timeframes are needed.

### Advances and challenges in neuropathic pain: a narrative review and future directions [^116pquyd]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the past few decades, substantial advances have been made in neuropathic pain clinical research. An updated definition and classification have been agreed. Validated questionnaires have improved the detection and assessment of acute and chronic neuropathic pain; and newer neuropathic pain syndromes associated with COVID-19 have been described. The management of neuropathic pain has moved from empirical to evidence-based medicine. However, appropriately targeting current medications and the successful clinical development of drugs acting on new targets remain challenging. Innovative approaches to improving therapeutic strategies are required. These mainly encompass rational combination therapy, drug repurposing, non-pharmacological approaches (such as neurostimulation techniques), and personalised therapeutic management. This narrative review reports historical and current perspectives regarding the definitions, classification, assessment, and management of neuropathic pain and explores potential avenues for future research.

### The clinical challenge of chronic neuropathic pain [^116G4yAK]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The clinician often faces the problem that certain types of chronic pains remain refractory to the commonly used analgesic treatment options. Neuropathic pain, which is defined as pain caused by direct nerve lesions, may have different causes and a variety of clinical presentations. A correct management of chronic neuropathic pain requires a thorough understanding of the potential causes, the diagnosis and the pathophysiological mechanisms.

Objectives

The purpose of this review article is to provide the reader with the latest insights in the diagnostic work-out and the clinical presentation of neuropathic pain. Additionally, the possible pathophysiological changes induced by nerve lesions are explained.

Methods

An extensive literature review was performed using Pubmed citations.

Results and Conclusions

This article, which is based on extensive literature review, aims at providing a concise review of the current knowledge regarding aetiology, diagnosis and pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.

### A treatment algorithm for neuropathic pain [^1163L378]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Neuropathic pain is a chronic pain syndrome caused by drug-, disease-, or injury-induced damage or destruction of sensory neurons within the dorsal root ganglia of the peripheral nervous system. Characteristic clinical symptoms include the feeling of pins and needles; burning, shooting, and/or stabbing pain with or without throbbing; and numbness. Neuronal hyperexcitability represents the hallmark cellular mechanism involved in the underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain. Although the primary goal is to alleviate pain, clinicians recognize that even the most appropriate treatment strategy may be, at best, only able to reduce pain to a more tolerable level.

Objective

The purpose of this review is to propose a treatment algorithm for neuropathic pain that health care professionals can logically follow and adapt to the specific needs of each patient. The algorithm is intended to serve as a general guide to assist clinicians in optimizing available therapeutic options.

Methods

A comprehensive review of the literature using the PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane, and Toxnet databases was conducted to design and develop a novel treatment algorithm for neuropathic pain that encompasses agents from several drug classes, including antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, topical antineuralgic agents, narcotics, and analgesics, as well as various treatment options for refractory cases.

Results

Any of the agents in the first-line drug classes (tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, topical antineuralgics, analgesics) may be used as a starting point in the treatment of neuropathic pain. If a patient does not respond to treatment with at least 3 different agents within a drug class, agents from a second drug class may be tried. When all first-line options have been exhausted, narcotic analgesics or refractory treatment options may provide some benefit. Patients who do not respond to monotherapy with any of the first- or second-line agents may respond to combination therapy or may be candidates for referral to a pain clinic. Because the techniques used at pain clinics tend to be invasive, referrals to these clinics should be reserved for patients who are truly refractory to all forms of pharmacotherapy.

Conclusions

Neuropathic pain continues to be one of the most difficult pain conditions to treat. With the proposed algorithm, clinicians will have a framework from which to design a pain treatment protocol appropriate for each patient. The algorithm will also help streamline referrals to specialized pain clinics, thereby reducing waiting list times for patients who are truly refractory to traditional pharmacotherapy.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^1167GdV3]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain has a significant impact on patients' quality of life, as well as social, economic, and psychological well-being. Notably, it has an even larger economic burden on society as a whole when one considers the financial cost of managing it in the chronic setting. Estimates of its prevalence in the general population vary from as little as 1% to as much as 7–8%; however, when taking into account conditions such as diabetes (26%), herpes zoster/shingles (19%), and postsurgical pain (10%), the incidence is much higher. There are a number of national and international guidelines/recommendations for the assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain, yet there remains to be a consensus or agreement on the positioning of pharmacologic management (specifically opioids), neurostimulation, or targeted drug delivery. The purpose of this publication is to create a comprehensive algorithm for the treatment and management of chronic, noncancer neuropathic pain by merging the aforementioned guidelines/recommendations and integrating the currently available data from systemic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and published case reports/series (Figure 1).

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^113Yow3m]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Peripheral neuropathic pain is common in patients with peripheral nerve injury and can significantly impact both their function and quality of life. There is a wide variety of non‐interventional treatment approaches, including pharmacologic therapy, physical/occupational therapy, modalities (therapeutic, mechanical, thermal, etc.), psychology, and lifestyle modification. First line pharmacologic therapy for peripheral neuropathic pain includes gabapentinoids, tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin‐norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Other classes of medications, such as topical treatments, opioids, and cannabinoids, have more limited usefulness in treatment but remain part of a treatment regimen. Physical and occupational therapy, psychological interventions, and lifestyle medicine are important adjuncts in the treatment and prevention of future peripheral neuropathic pain. The strength of the evidence supporting each intervention varies, with that for pharmacologic intervention being the strongest. A combination of these options tailored to the individual needs of the patient likely will result in the best treatment outcome for peripheral neuropathic pain.

### The evidence for pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain [^114BTr2o]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials on neuropathic pain treatment are accumulating, so an updated review of the available evidence is needed. Studies were identified using MEDLINE and EMBASE searches. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) values were used to compare the efficacy and safety of different treatments for a number of neuropathic pain conditions. One hundred and seventy-four studies were included, representing a 66% increase in published randomized, placebo-controlled trials in the last 5 years. Painful poly-neuropathy (most often due to diabetes) was examined in 69 studies, postherpetic neuralgia in 23, while peripheral nerve injury, central pain, HIV neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia were less often studied. Tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin, and opioids are the drug classes for which there is the best evidence for a clinical relevant effect. Despite a 66% increase in published trials only a limited improvement of neuropathic pain treatment has been obtained. A large proportion of neuropathic pain patients are left with insufficient pain relief. This fact calls for other treatment options to target chronic neuropathic pain. Large-scale drug trials that aim to identify possible subgroups of patients who are likely to respond to specific drugs are needed to test the hypothesis that a mechanism-based classification may help improve treatment of the individual patients.

### New developments in the treatment algorithm for peripheral neuropathic pain [^111nxpTr]. Pain Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain often imposes a substantial and unrelenting burden on those individuals who have it; single-agent analgesics typically only reduce pain at best. Worldwide, five sets of treatment recommendations offer insight into managing neuropathic pain, including two European guidelines, one Canadian, one Latin American, and another constructed under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). The analgesics common to these guidelines are topical lidocaine, secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin and norepinephrine dual reuptake inhibitors, calcium channel α(2)-δ ligands, tramadol, and opioid antagonists. Still, significant knowledge gaps in the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions have hampered the development of algorithms and multimodal approaches. As the evidence base expands, the addition of new comparative trial data will further refine the development of new guidance for clinical management of neuropathic pain. New alternatives for managing neuropathic pain, such as the high-concentration capsaicin patch, will enlarge the treatment armamentarium and potentially impact therapeutic guidelines.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: a systematic review [^113NyaEt]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines need to be evaluated not only for methodological quality but also for validity of their content in terms of recommendations. Thus, this study also analyzed the recommendations of these guidelines for the management of NP. In general, these recommendations were consistent on the diagnosis, assessment and pharmacological management despite scoring poorly in their rigor of development. It was difficult to tell whether we obtained these results because there was insufficient evidence to develop the guidelines or because the CPG authors did not search and make use of the best evidence available.

A large number of the drug development research has been devoted to the field of NP. A large number of analgesic agents have shown efficacy for the treatment of NP. However, no more than 40–60% of patients have obtained sufficient pain relief with medications alone and in combination. Thus, it should be noted that treatment of patients with NP should be considered an integral component of a more comprehensive approach.

In general, the guidelines for the management of NP vary considerably in terms of quality, because of the apparently low standards. To reduce the variability of the CPGs, guideline development groups should have standard methodology and strategy. Further, it would be helpful to become familiarized with the AGREE II instrument domains to know what information should be reported and how it ought to be reported in the CPGs. Here, we also give some pointers to reduce the variability among the CPGs:

1) The study should describe the specific health question it aims to address, such as prevention, screening, diagnosis, or treatment, and target population, including sex, age clinical condition, severity stage of the disease, comorbidities, and others. 2) The guideline development group should include individuals from all relevant professional groups, not only or mainly health care providers. Competing interests of guideline development group members should be fully recorded and addressed. 3) In the guideline development process, appropriate methodologies and rigorous strategies are important for successful implementation of the resulting recommendations, such as the systematic methods and criteria for selecting the evidence, methods for formulating the recommendations, health benefits, side effects considered in formulating the recommendations, links between the recommendations and the evidence. Additionally, guidelines should be externally reviewed prior to their publication, and a procedure for guideline updating should be planned and described. 4) The different options for the management of the condition or health issue should be clearly presented and the recommendations should be specific and unambiguous. 5) The views of the funding body and interests of the development group should been recorded and addressed.

### Pharmacologic management part 2: lesser-studied neuropathic pain diseases [^114yY7hj]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

This second part of a review of the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain diseases describes the current treatment options for three lesser-studied neuropathic syndromes: Central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome II. Diagnosis can be difficult in patients with these syndromes, because the pain experienced is much greater and of a different type than would normally be expected following a stroke or injury to the spinal cord or a peripheral nerve. Even when an accurate and timely diagnosis is made, treatment options are limited and frequently suboptimal. However, the results of published trials do support the use of anticonvulsants and/or tricyclic antidepressants as first-line pharmacotherapy in these three neuropathic pain syndromes. To maximize treatment outcomes, future research must: Continue to more fully elucidate the relationship between the signs and symptoms of pain and the underlying pathophysiology; Delineate the natural history of central poststroke pain, spinal cord injury, and complex regional pain syndrome; Identify patient-related factors that may indicate an increased risk of developing neuropathic pain following stroke or nerve injury; Investigate emerging treatments that target underlying pain mechanisms.

### From data to decision: critical appraisal of the 2025 neuPSIG review and recommendations on neuropathic pain treatments [^114NF7GX]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2025 recommendations of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) constitute a methodologically rigorous update on the management of neuropathic pain, integrating a large-scale meta-analysis of pharmacological treatments and neuromodulation intervention. Yet, they also expose persistent challenges: under-representation of common aetiologies, a narrow scope of neuromodulation, reliance on placebo-controlled designs, and conflicts of interest that might affect the perception of neutrality. Addressing these issues requires not only transparency, but also broader inclusion of neglected conditions, adaptation of methods to nonpharmacological interventions, and attention to diverse healthcare contexts. We aim to both to critically appraise the current guidelines and to encourage broader reflection on how future research and guideline development could foster greater relevance and generalisation.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^111pMTts]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common finding in patients with peripheral nerve injury. It has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a pain "caused by lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system". Peripheral neuropathic pain is typically chronic in nature and is caused by a heterogenous group of diseases. It has an estimated prevalence of between 6.9% and 10% of the population. It is typically described as a "pins and needles", burning, cramping, or tingling pain by patients. Prior research has demonstrated that neuropathic causes of pain may be underrecognized and inadequately managed. In this review, we seek to briefly outline the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathic pain and provide a comprehensive list of non‐interventional treatment approaches.

### Painful peripheral neuropathy and its nonsurgical treatment [^111AAzWS]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of neuropathic pain is the primary focus of management for many patients with painful peripheral neuropathy. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants are the two pharmacological classes most widely studied and represent first-line agents in the management of neuropathic pain. The number of pharmacological agents that have demonstrated effectiveness for neuropathic pain continues to expand. In the current review, we summarize data from randomized, controlled pharmacological trials in painful peripheral neuropathies. Although neuropathic pain management remains challenging because the response to therapy varies considerably between patients, and pain relief is rarely complete, a majority of patients can benefit from monotherapy using a well-chosen agent or polypharmacy that combines medications with different mechanisms of action.

### Maximizing treatment efficacy through patient stratification in neuropathic pain trials [^113TjGfA]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Treatment of neuropathic pain remains inadequate despite the elucidation of multiple pathophysiological mechanisms and the development of promising therapeutic compounds. The lack of success in translating knowledge into clinical practice has discouraged pharmaceutical companies from investing in pain medicine; however, new patient stratification approaches could help bridge the translation gap and develop individualized therapeutic approaches. As we highlight in this article, subgrouping of patients according to sensory profiles and other baseline characteristics could aid the prediction of treatment success. Furthermore, novel outcome measures have been developed for patients with neuropathic pain. The extent to which sensory profiles and outcome measures can be employed in routine clinical practice and clinical trials and across distinct neuropathic pain aetiologies is yet to be determined. Improvements in animal models, drawing on our knowledge of human pain, and robust public-private partnerships will be needed to pave the way to innovative and effective pain medicine in the future.

### What is new in neuropathic pain? [^113j5PUG]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain occurs in 1% of the population and is difficult to manage. Responses to single drugs are limited in benefit. Thirty percent will fail to respond altogether. This is a review of newer drugs and treatment paradigms.

Methods

A literature review was performed pertinent to new drugs and treatment algorithms in the management of neuropathic pain.

Results

New information on opioids (tramadol and buprenorphine) suggests benefits in the management of neuropathic pain and has increased interest in their use earlier in the course of illness. Newer antidepressants, selective noradrenaline, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have evidence for benefit and reduced toxicity without an economic disadvantage compared to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in diabetic neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia. Treatment paradigms are shifting from sequential single drug trials to multiple drug therapies. Evidence is needed to justify this change in treatment approach.

Conclusion

Drug choices are now based not only on efficacy but also toxicity and drug interactions. For this reason, SNRIs and gabapentin/pregabalin have become popular though efficacy is not better than TCAs. Multiple drug therapies becoming an emergent treatment paradigm research in multiple drug therapy are needed.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^115jrQsH]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain, a type of chronic pain that arises as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, may affect ~30% of older adults (aged > 60 years). This compares to a prevalence of 3–18% in the general population in Western countries. Most commonly, localized neuropathic pain has a peripheral presentation characterized by a consistent and circumscribed area of maximum pain. Neuropathic pain impairs quality of life and can exacerbate functional decline with age. Persistent pain (of any type) in older adults has also been associated with an increased risk of frailty.

Pharmacotherapy is the recommended first-line treatment for localized neuropathic pain. However, neuropathic pain can be difficult to treat, and oral systemic treatment options (such as antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and/or opioids) often provide incomplete pain relief, with side effects and drug─drug interactions that can limit long-term use. Locally applied treatments that target the allodynic or hyperalgesic area with very limited systemic effects may be preferred, particularly in older patients with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain [^112LiBq9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Currently, no consensus on the optimal management of neuropathic pain exists and practices vary greatly worldwide. Possible explanations for this include difficulties in developing agreed diagnostic protocols and the coexistence of neuropathic, nociceptive and, occasionally, idiopathic pain in the same patient. Also, neuropathic pain has historically been classified according to its etiology (e.g., painful diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, spinal cord injury) without regard for the presumed mechanism(s) underlying the specific symptoms. A combined etiologic/mechanistic classification might improve neuropathic pain management. The treatment of neuropathic pain is largely empirical, often relying heavily on data from small, generally poorly-designed clinical trials or anecdotal evidence. Consequently, diverse treatments are used, including non-invasive drug therapies (antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs and membrane stabilizing drugs), invasive therapies (nerve blocks, ablative surgery), and alternative therapies (e.g., acupuncture). This article reviews the current and historical practices in the diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain, and focuses on the USA, Europe and Japan.

### Algorithm for neuropathic pain treatment: an evidence based proposal [^114n9Cn9]. Pain (2005). Low credibility.

New studies of the treatment of neuropathic pain have increased the need for an updated review of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials to support an evidence based algorithm to treat neuropathic pain conditions. Available studies were identified using a MEDLINE and EMBASE search. One hundred and five studies were included. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and numbers needed to harm (NNH) were used to compare efficacy and safety of the treatments in different neuropathic pain syndromes. The quality of each trial was assessed. Tricyclic antidepressants and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin were the most frequently studied drug classes. In peripheral neuropathic pain, the lowest NNT was for tricyclic antidepressants, followed by opioids and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and pregabalin. For central neuropathic pain there is limited data. NNT and NNH are currently the best way to assess relative efficacy and safety, but the need for dichotomous data, which may have to be estimated retrospectively for old trials, and the methodological complexity of pooling data from small cross-over and large parallel group trials, remain as limitations.

### Drug treatment of neuropathic pain [^1119Xjq1]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2000). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain results from damage to or dysfunction in the nervous system. The term usually refers to pain caused by a primary abnormality in the peripheral nervous system, while pain caused by damage to the central nervous system tends to be called central pain. Once established, neuropathic pain frequently runs a chronic course and can be severe and difficult to treat. Most doctors (but especially GPs, neurologists, neurosurgeons, oncologists and pain clinic specialists) will encounter patients with neuropathic pain. Management, ideally in a multidisciplinary pain-relief clinic, often involves the combined use of a range of pharmacological and non-drug approaches, the latter including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, psychological treatments, and specialist procedures to stimulate, block or destroy discrete areas of the nervous system. Here, we review just the drug treatments for neuropathic pain.

### Advances in neuropathic pain… [^114Q2wg8]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

Chronic neuropathic pain, caused by lesions in the peripheral or central nervous system, comes in many forms. We describe current approaches to the diagnosis and assessment of neuropathic pain and discuss the results of recent research on its pathophysiologic mechanisms. Randomized controlled clinical trials of gabapentin, the 5% lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, tramadol hydrochloride, and tricyclic antidepressants provide an evidence-based approach to the treatment of neuropathic pain, and specific recommendations are presented for use of these medications. First-line Medications. The efficacy of gabapentin, the 5% lidocaine patch, opioid analgesics, tramadol hydrochloride, and tricyclic antidepressants has been consistently demonstrated in multiple randomized controlled trials. Each one can be used as an initial treatment for neuropathic pain in certain clinical circumstances. Opioid analgesics and TCAs generally require greater caution than the other options.

For each of these 5 medications, brief reviews of the relevant randomized clinical trials and specific treatment recommendations follow. Treatment recommendations are summarized in Table 2. Gabapentin. There are 8 published double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials of gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain. These studies examined patients with PHN, PDN, mixed neuropathic pain syndromes, phantom limb pain, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and acute and chronic pain from spinal cord injury. 31–38 Gabapentin at dosages up to 3600 mg/d significantly reduced pain compared with placebo; improvements in sleep, mood, and quality of life were also demonstrated in some trials. On the basis of these results, the FDA approved the 5% lidocaine patch for the treatment of PHN. Notably, the efficacy of this treatment has been demonstrated only in patients with PHN and allodynia, and no controlled studies have been conducted for other pain conditions.

Anecdotal evidence of a beneficial effect in patients who have other types of neuropathic pain with allodynia has been published.
41. Treatment with the 5% lidocaine patch consists of the application of no more than 3 patches daily for a maximum of 12 hours, with the patch applied directly to the area of maximal pain. Titration of the 5% lidocaine patch is not necessary, and an adequate trial would last 2 weeks.

### Advances in understanding nociception and neuropathic pain [^11339HXk]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical insights into neuropathic pain from pre-clinical research

As described in the Introduction, neuropathic pain is common and chronic pain sufferers often receive inadequate pain relief from current medications. A 2015 meta-analysis of trials looking at pharmacological treatments for neuropathic pain identified that although there is strong recommendation for the use of certain drugs (e.g. gabapentin, pregabalin, serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants), the effects are relatively modest: the number needed to treat (NNT) to produce a 50% reduction in pain for those drugs with strong recommendation for use ranges from 3.6 to 7.7, i.e. 4–8 patients must be treated for one patient to experience at least 50% pain reduction when the placebo response is subtracted. In addition to pharmacological treatment, a variety of other interventions are available for neuropathic pain, including: physical and psychological therapies, spinal cord stimulation, surgery, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), but here, discussion will be focused on the potential for the development of novel pharmacotherapy resulting from enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of neuropathic pain.

### Management of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury: now and in the future [^112BDwaB]. Spinal Cord (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of our current understanding of the problem of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury (SCI) and to suggest possible therapeutic options in the near future.

Methods

Original research articles, reviews and book chapters on the subject of pain and SCI.

Results

Neuropathic pain following SCI has presented a challenge not only for traditional concepts of how pain occurs but also for more recent conceptualizations. We have made substantial progress in identifying the common types of pain that occur following SCI, determining the prevalence and characteristics of pain, investigating some of the pathophysiological changes in the nervous system that may contribute to the presence of neuropathic SCI pain and examining the effectiveness of some treatments. However major challenges remain. We still need to reach consensus on an SCI pain taxonomy; our understanding of mechanisms and the relative contribution of changes in the periphery, spinal cord and brain is incompletely understood; there are few studies that indicate effective treatment options, particularly for neuropathic SCI pain; and treatment of the biological and psychological contributors to pain is often fragmented.

Conclusion

Recent studies suggest the potential usefulness of new treatment approaches such as selective pharmacological agents, application of novel neurostimulation techniques and the use of cognitive approaches to modify the pain experience. Our increasing understanding of the problem combined with the promise of these new approaches offers hope for improved management of neuropathic pain following SCI in the near future.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^111NK1fd]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this review was to merge current treatment guidelines and best practice recommendations for management of neuropathic pain into a comprehensive algorithm for primary physicians. The algorithm covers assessment, multidisciplinary conservative care, nonopioid pharmacological management, interventional therapies, neurostimulation, low-dose opioid treatment, and targeted drug delivery therapy.

Methods

Available literature was identified through a search of the US National Library of Medicine's Medline database, PubMed.gov. References from identified published articles also were reviewed for relevant citations.

Results

The algorithm provides a comprehensive treatment pathway from assessment to the provision of first- through sixth-line therapies for primary care physicians. Clear indicators for progression of therapy from firstline to sixth-line are provided. Multidisciplinary conservative care and nonopioid medications (tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentanoids, topicals, and transdermal substances) are recommended as firstline therapy; combination therapy (firstline medications) and tramadol and tapentadol are recommended as secondline; serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors/anticonvulsants/NMDA antagonists and interventional therapies as third-line; neurostimulation as a fourth-line treatment; low-dose opioids (no greater than 90 morphine equivalent units) are fifth-line; and finally, targeted drug delivery is the last-line therapy for patients with refractory pain.

Conclusions

The presented treatment algorithm provides clear-cut tools for the assessment and treatment of neuropathic pain based on international guidelines, published data, and best practice recommendations. It defines the benefits and limitations of the current treatments at our disposal. Additionally, it provides an easy-to-follow visual guide of the recommended steps in the algorithm for primary care and family practitioners to utilize.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^112suxbK]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

For each of these combined pharmaceutical pain treatment options; all combinations with the other pharmaceutical pain therapies were considered and the quality of evidence and strength of recommendation of the specific combination was rated. Where no or limited scientific evidence was available, the experts discussed the combination therapy from their clinical experiences. For each of the combination therapies, the level of evidence is given.

Most of the included literature was provided to the expert panel 2 weeks before the Delphi process began. However, literature could be added during the process at the will of any of the experts. The literature provided upfront was a result of comprehensive literature searches in EMBASE and MEDLINE using the search terms; combination therapy, combination treatment, NeP for both central and peripheral neuropathic pain. Only literature in Danish or English was included. In order to have a more acceptable number of articles for the process, the comprehensive Cochrane review on combination therapy from 2012was included and relevant clinical studies published after 2012 was found and included.

The rating of the evidence is based upon the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) grading system presented below in Table 1. The CDC grading system is developed by the Infectious Diseases Society of America – US Public Health Service and chosen because this evidence grading system is a relatively simple and well-suited system for ranking recommendations in clinical guidelines. Also, in the absence of sufficient evidence to build a clear conclusion, final recommendations are based on the majority of panel experts' opinion. Because of the sparse literature on combination therapy, it was not possible to apply the more comprehensive GRADE system.

A combination of two types of pain pharmacotherapy with a rating of "I+A" in this system has the highest rating, as it indicates that there is at least one or more properly randomized controlled trial (RCT) as well as strong evidence for efficacy and substantial clinical benefit. In this case, the combination therapy would be highly recommended. On the other hand, a rating of "III+E" implies there is strong evidence against the combination therapy being efficacious or that it results in adverse outcomes, based on expert opinions only (no clinical trials). Such a pharmacologic combination would never be recommended.

### Management of peripheral neuropathic pain [^116fu9vM]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2005). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain results from a variety of medical conditions encountered in physiatric practice, including infection, trauma, metabolic abnormalities, and nerve compression. Unlike pain resulting from nociceptive or inflammatory processes, neuropathic pain is associated with primary lesion or dysfunction of the nervous system itself and is often difficult to treat. Existing treatment options include drug therapy (e.g., anticonvulsants, the lidocaine patch 5%, antidepressants, opioids, tramadol) or interventional treatments (e.g., peripheral or neuraxial nerve blockade, implanted spinal cord stimulators, implanted intrathecal catheters). The following article presents an overview of the cellular mechanisms associated with neuropathic pain, summarizes the results of randomized, controlled trials with the major classes of available drugs, and discusses treatment options that provide a rational basis for pharmacotherapy.

### Neurotrophic factors as novel therapeutics for neuropathic pain [^111dPuSo]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2003). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition that is caused by injury to the nervous system. Unlike acute pain, which is protective, neuropathic pain persists and serves no useful purpose, and severely affects quality of life. However, present therapies have modest efficacy in most patients, are palliative rather than curative, and their side effects represent significant limitations. Tremendous progress has been made over the past decade in our understanding of the biology of pain sensory neurons. The recent discovery that neurotrophic factors play an important role in neuropathic pain indicates that these pathways could serve as novel intervention points for therapy. Moreover, neurotrophic factors have the potential to address the underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain, thereby halting or reversing the disease process.

### Treatment of neuropathic pain: an overview of recent guidelines [^111RibRD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

A number of different treatments for neuropathic pain have been studied, but the literature is sizable, rapidly evolving, and lacks important information about practical aspects of patient management. Under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG), a consensus process was used to develop evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on health-related quality of life, convenience, and costs. On the basis of randomized clinical trials, medications recommended as first-line treatments for neuropathic pain included certain antidepressants (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants and dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine), calcium channel alpha(2)-delta ligands (i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics and tramadol were recommended as second-line treatments that can be considered for first-line use in selected clinical circumstances. Other medications that generally would be used as third-line treatments include certain other antidepressant and antiepileptic medications, topical capsaicin, mexiletine, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists. Two other national and international associations recently published pharmacologic treatment guidelines for neuropathic pain, which are summarized and contrasted with the NeuPSIG recommendations. Recent guidelines for the use of neurostimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain also are summarized. For all treatments for neuropathic pain, long-term studies, head-to-head comparisons, and studies of treatment combinations are a priority for future research.

### Advances in the treatment of neuropathic pain [^113PqQev]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Neuropathic pain remains difficult to treat. This review provides an update regarding recent advances in therapeutic management, particularly with regards to newer drugs, neurostimulation techniques and original study designs.

Recent Findings

Although the mainstay of neuropathic pain management is still represented by drug therapy, particularly antidepressants and antiepileptics, the place of nonpharmacological therapy including in particular brain neuromodulation techniques has substantially increased in recent years. Newer study designs are also increasingly implemented, based on in depth phenotypic profiling to achieve more individualized therapy, or on screening strategies to decrease placebo effect and contribute to increase assay sensitivity. These approaches are now considered the most promising to decrease therapeutic failures in neuropathic pain.

Summary

Neuropathic pain management should not be restricted to pharmacotherapy but now encompasses multiple approaches including particularly neuromodulation techniques. Multimodal assessment can also help identify predictors of the response in clinical trials in order to ensure appropriate management.

3.2 Therapy interventions

Treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain is incomplete without the involvement of therapy. Rehabilitation techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, mirror therapy, and graded motor imagery have been identified as ways to treat neuropathic pain. These techniques rely on principles of brain–body relationships in their approaches. For example, work in pain neuroscience education has contributed to an understanding of the interaction between the brain and pain perception to inform interventions such as graded motor imagery, offering a comprehensive approach to pain management.

The use of therapeutic modalities to treat peripheral neuropathic pain remains relatively understudied given the prevalence of the condition and lack of definitive treatments for peripheral neuropathic pain. Across the literature, studies often focus on single diagnoses, further limiting the generalizability of each conclusion. Akyuz and Kenis summarize the specific modality approaches used in therapy and cite evidence with trials examining each. Therapy modalities can be categorized into mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic, and light therapies.

Mechanical modalities to treat peripheral neuropathic pain include ultrasound, acupuncture, massage, and exercise. Ultrasound has mixed evidence as treatment for neuropathic pain, and further studies are needed to fully characterize its effect. Acupuncture, like other therapeutic modalities, has shown promise in treatment for peripheral neuropathy but further studies are needed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. For diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain, a meta‐analysis that strong evidence for acupuncture as a method to reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life. Limited data is available for massage or reflexology therapies regarding their role in treatment of neuropathic pain with mixed results. Macone and Otis cite multiple RCTs with small sample sizes demonstrating results ranging from no difference to statistical improvements in pain scores or quality of life. Numerous studies on exercise's role in improving neuropathic pain come to a consensus that low‐intensity exercise of longer duration has a positive effect on symptoms while short‐term or high‐intensity exercise may have an opposite effect.

### Antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^116PdoQc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.

Objectives

To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain. Migraine and headache studies were not considered.

Search Strategy

Randomised trials of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Dec 2003); EMBASE (1980 to Dec 2003); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library 2004, Issue 1; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Fifty trials of 19 antidepressants were considered eligible (2515 patients) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) estimates and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects.

Main Results

Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective treatments for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline has an NNT of 2 (95%CI 1.7 to 2.5) RR 4.1(95%CI 2.9–5.9) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs (SSRIs). There were insufficient data for an assessment of evidence of effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort, venlafaxine and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95%CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4(95%CI 5.2–29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.2 (95%CI 1.7 to 3.1), RR 4.8(95%CI 2.5–9.5)(three studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm(NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 16 (95%CI: 10–45). The NNH for minor adverse effects was 4.6 (95%CI 3.3–6.7)

Authors' Conclusions

Antidepressants are effective for a variety of neuropathic pains. The best evidence available is for amitriptyline. There are only limited data for the effectiveness of SSRIs. It is not possible to identify the most effective antidepressant until more studies of SSRIs are conducted.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^111aRCF6]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 1
Overview of Phase 2, 3, and 4 Trials (N = 18) in Peripheral Neuropathic Pain Conditions in the Capsaicin Patch Database

For analysis of safety and tolerability, data were pooled from all 18 interventional Phase 2, 3, and 4 studies, regardless of PNP indication (N = 4,099 treated patients) (Table 1). Overall, 1,924 patients had received a single application of the capsaicin patch, and 924 patients had received multiple (up to nine) capsaicin patch treatments. Of the 1,251 patients overall who received only control or standard of care (SoC) treatment, 819 patients received a control (low-dose capsaicin or placebo) patch, and 432 received SoC treatment. Capsaicin and control patches were applied for 30, 60, or 90 minutes. Adverse event (AE) data for the individual studies have been previously reported.

All trials had been approved by an institutional review board and conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. All patients enrolled in the trials provided their written informed consent.

### Treatment options for the management of diabetic painful neuropathy: best current evidence [^117MQGQP]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Key Points

(1) A large number of treatment options have shown generally moderate efficacy in the treatment of diabetic painful neuropathy.(2) Tricyclic antidepressants are the mainstay of therapy, with anticonvulsants, opioids and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors also having a place.(3) Head-to-head trials of current treatments are needed. Meanwhile, selection of therapeutic agents should be individualised.

### Contemporary assessment and management of neuropathic pain [^11687XZu]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Preclinical studies have increased our understanding of the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain at the anatomic, cellular, and molecular levels. These lines of investigation have enabled more logical uses of older therapies for neuropathic pain and have contributed to our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying the efficacy of newer remedies. The identification of receptor systems and the development of genetically modified animal models for the study of neuropathic pain have greatly increased our understanding of effective clinical treatments. This review focuses on the central and peripheral nervous system changes believed to be important in the initiation and perpetuation of neuropathic pain. Currently used medications, as well as medications that are on the horizon, are highlighted.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^114vo4ZF]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2010, Finnerup et al. reviewed 174 placebo-controlled RCTs (105 from an earlier review in 2005 and 69 additional as of 2010) of firstline drugs, including opioids, for chronic neuropathic pain. They calculated an NNT to achieve ≥ 30% pain reduction and an NNH (number treated for one patient to drop out of the study due to adverse effects) for specific drug classes and pain etiologies. In the case of opioids, the NNT ranged from 2.1 (1.5–3.3) for mixed neuropathic pain to 5.1 (2.7–36.0) for peripheral nerve injury. The combined NNH for opioids for all etiologies was 17.1 (9.9–66). The authors concluded that the lack of proven long-term effectiveness and the high risk for adverse effects called for alternative treatment options to target chronic neuropathic pain. More recently, Finnerup et al. from 13 trials of strong opioids calculated a combined NNT of 4.3 (3–4.5.8), with an NNH of 11.7 (8.4–19.3).

CDC and Canadian guidelines on use of opioids in noncancer chronic pain recommend optimization of nonpharmacological and non-opioid-based therapies. Commencement should be with immediate-release forms of the drug with the aim of utilizing the lowest possible dose. The patient is converted to slow release once a stable, effective dose has been achieved. Caution should be taken when exceeding 50 mg per day of morphine (or morphine equivalent dose [MED]), and > 90 MED should be avoided or have careful justification. A trial of therapy should occur for one to four weeks, after which the benefits relative to the risks should once again be reviewed. This should occur every three months.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: a systematic review [^113NRWmG]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The management of neuropathic pain (NP) is challenging despite it being the recent focus of extensive research. A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of NP have been published worldwide over the past 2 decades. This study aimed to assess the quality of these CPGs.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of published CPGs for the management of NP. Three reviewers independently assessed the quality of the CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument, and recommendations of CPGs were also appraised.

Results

A total of 16 CPGs were included. Thirteen CPGs were developed using an evidence-based approach, and the remaining CPGs were produced by consensus panels. None of CPGs obtained a score greater than 50% in all six AGREE II instrument domains mainly owing to poor performance in the "Applicability" domain. The highest score of the CPGs was achieved in "Clarity and Presentation" domain, followed by "Scope and Purpose" and "Editorial Independence" domains, and the lowest scores were found the in "Applicability" domain. The majority of the CPG recommendations on the management of patients with NP were relatively consistent, especially regarding the recommendation of stepwise treatment with medication.

Conclusions

Greater efforts are needed not only to improve the quality of development and presentation of the CPGs, but also to provide more efficacy evidence for the management of patients with NP.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^113KihfK]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

3 TREATMENT OF PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIC PAIN

3.1 Medications

Several medications from a wide range of pharmaceutical classes have been used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Summary of pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Gabapentinoids (gabapentin and pregabalin) are anti‐epileptic medications and are frequently used for treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. They work by inhibiting alpha 2‐delta subunits of voltage‐gated calcium channels. Gabapentin has a strong recommendation as a first line choice in peripheral neuropathic pain at doses of 1200 mg‐3600 mg daily divided into three different doses, or two different doses for an extended‐release formulation. Pregabalin is also a first line agent, dosed at 300–600 mg divided into two doses daily. Gabapentin and pregabalin are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for post‐herpetic neuralgia, with pregabalin also being approved for diabetic neuropathy and spinal cord injury pain. Additionally, both medications have evidence that endorses their benefits for use in peripheral diabetic neuropathy. The study of off label use for gabapentinoids has shown they provide little to no improvement in treating other etiologies of peripheral neuropathic pain, such as radiculopathy and HIV associated neuropathy. Common side effects of gabapentinoids include dizziness and sedation. Gabapentin has become subject to abuse in recent years with people taking it in large doses to induce euphoria.

### Topical capsaicin for treatment of chronic neuropathic pain in adults… [^1114TRhs]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

|1 in 11 patients reported human immuno-deficiency virus neuropathy pain reduction of at least 30% more than the control group at follow-up within 12 weeks|. Narrative: Chronic neuropathic pain is a common, sometimes debilitating, condition that can result from a multitude of origins. Currently, pregabalin is the only approved medication option. Physicians commonly prescribe off-label use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, gabapentin, tricyclic antidepressants, and antiepileptics. This review assesses the effectiveness and duration of a single application of high-concentration topical capsaicin for pain relief in patients with neuropathic pain lasting more than eight weeks. A 2017 Cochrane review of eight double-blind, randomized controlled studies included 2, 488 patients, and compared the effect of a single topical application of high-concentration capsaicin for long-term neuropathic pain relief compared with a control group. 1 A 0.

04% concentration capsaicin control was used in all studies to blind participants to the burning and erythema experienced after application. Pain was not assessed in the first posttreatment week because capsaicin preparations often cause localized pain at the application site for several days. For patients with postherpetic neuropathic pain, topical capsaicin provided moderate pain relief with a number needed to treat of 12 to reduce pain by 50% at follow-up within eight weeks, and an NNT of 10 to reduce pain by at least 30% within eight weeks. Three studies also looked at 30% pain reduction within 12 weeks and found a similar benefit, with an NNT of 10.

This review also included two studies that found at least a 30% reduction in pain in patients with human immunodeficiency virus neuropathy pain treated with a single application of high-concentration capsaicin with an NNT of 11 at follow-up within 12 weeks.

### Approaches to neuropathic amputation-related pain: narrative review of surgical, interventional, and medical treatments [^115T3mei]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Importance

Neuropathic amputation-related pain can consist of phantom limb pain (PLP), residual limb pain (RLP), or a combination of both pathologies. Estimated of lifetime prevalence of pain and after amputation ranges between 8% and 72%.

Objective

This narrative review aims to summarize the surgical and non-surgical treatment options for amputation-related neuropathic pain to aid in developing optimized multidisciplinary and multimodal treatment plans that leverage multidisciplinary care.

Evidence Review

A search of the English literature using the following keywords was performed: PLP, amputation pain, RLP. Abstract and full-text articles were evaluated for surgical treatments, medical management, regional anesthesia, peripheral block, neuromodulation, spinal cord stimulation, dorsal root ganglia, and peripheral nerve stimulation.

Findings

The evidence supporting most if not all interventions for PLP are inconclusive and lack high certainty. Targeted muscle reinnervation and regional peripheral nerve interface are the leading surgical treatment options for reducing neuroma formation and reducing PLP. Non-surgical options include pharmaceutical therapy, regional interventional techniques and behavioral therapies that can benefit certain patients. There is a growing evidence that neuromodulation at the spinal cord or the dorsal root ganglia and/or peripheral nerves can be an adjuvant therapy for PLP.

Conclusions

Multimodal approaches combining pharmacotherapy, surgery and invasive neuromodulation procedures would appear to be the most promising strategy for preventive and treating PLP and RLP. Future efforts should focus on cross-disciplinary education to increase awareness of treatment options exploring best practices for preventing pain at the time of amputation and enhancing treatment of chronic postamputation pain.

### The canPain SCI clinical practice guidelines for rehabilitation management of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: 2021 update [^113StEAA]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

The panel emphasized it was, however, still important to acknowledge that certain treatment options had a higher evidence basis and/or strength of recommendation from the expert panel than others (e.g. second-line vs. third- or fourth-line treatments). Thus, a distinction should still be present within the CPG between different groups of treatment options. Given that a hierarchical approach was not used for these treatment groupings, second- to fourth-line treatments were reclassified as "B options" (formerly second-line), "C options" (formerly third-line) and "D options" (formerly fourth-line). The criteria for classifying a treatment within one of these groupings were the same as for second/third/fourth-line treatments, and were based on GRADE/strength of the recommendation as follows (GRADE; strength of recommendation): B options (High/Moderate; Strong); C options (High/Moderate; Weak); D options (Moderate/Low; Weak). The phrasing of recommendations was also standardized to reflect the assessments of the expert panel on the different treatment groupings. B option recommendations are phrased as "can be used" for NP following SCI, while C and D option recommendations are phrased as "may be considered" for NP following SCI.

Although a hierarchy of treatment options was not used, the consensus panel agreed that classifying and phrasing the recommendations in this way would provide adequate clarity and information to the CPG user regarding the panel's assessment and evaluation of different treatment options. Figure 1 presents the treatment recommendations as a diagram; Table 5 presents a full text listing all treatment recommendations.

### Antidepressants for neuropathic pain [^111DENQb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 3, 2005 of The Cochrane Library. For many years antidepressant drugs have been used to manage neuropathic pain, and are often the first choice treatment. It is not clear, however, which antidepressant is more effective, what role the newer antidepressants can play in treating neuropathic pain, and what adverse effects are experienced by patients.

Objectives

To determine the analgesic effectiveness and safety of antidepressant drugs in neuropathic pain.

Search Strategy

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antidepressants in neuropathic pain were identified in MEDLINE (1966 to Oct 2005); EMBASE (1980 to Oct 2005); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, Issue 3, 2005; and the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Trials Register (May 2002). Additional reports were identified from the reference list of the retrieved papers, and by contacting investigators.

Selection Criteria

RCTs reporting the analgesic effects of antidepressant drugs in adult patients, with subjective assessment of pain of neuropathic origin. Studies that included patients with chronic headache and migraine were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors agreed the included studies, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality independently. Sixty one trials of 20 antidepressants were considered eligible (3293 participants) for inclusion. Relative Risk (RR) and Number-Needed-to-Treat (NNTs) were calculated from dichotomous data for effectiveness and adverse effects. This update includes 11 additional studies (778 participants).

Main Results

Sixty one RCTs were included in total. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are effective and have an NNT of 3.6 (95% CI 3 to 4.5) RR 2.1 (95% CI 1.8 to 2.5) for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer SSRIs but no studies of SNRIs were found. Venlafaxine (three studies) has an NNT of 3.1 (95% CI 2.2 to 5.1) RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.5 to 3.1). There were insufficient data to assess effectiveness for other antidepressants such as St Johns Wort and L-tryptophan. For diabetic neuropathy the NNT for effectiveness was 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) RR 12.4 (95% CI 5.2 to 29.2) (five studies); for postherpetic neuralgia 2.7 (95% CI 2 to 4.1), RR 2.2 (95% CI 1.6 to 3.1) (four studies). There was evidence that TCAs are not effective in HIV-related neuropathies. The number needed to harm (NNH) for major adverse effects defined as an event leading to withdrawal from a study was 28 (95% CI 17.6 to 68.9) for amitriptyline and 16.2 (95% CI 8 to 436) for venlafaxine. The NNH for minor adverse effects was 6 (95% CI 4.2 to 10.7) for amitriptyline and 9.6 (95% CI 3.5 to 13) for venlafaxine.

Authors' Conclusions

This update has provided additional confirmation on the effectiveness of antidepressants for neuropathic pain and has provided new information on another antidepressant - venlafaxine. There is still limited evidence for the role of SSRIs. Whether antidepressants prevent the development of neuropathic pain (pre-emptive use) is still unclear. Both TCAs and venlafaxine have NNTs of approximately three. This means that for approximately every three patients with neuropathic pain who are treated with either of these antidepressants, one will get at least moderate pain relief. There is evidence to suggest that other antidepressants may be effective but numbers of participants are insufficient to calculate robust NNTs. SSRIs are generally better tolerated by patients and more high quality studies are required.

### Pharmacologic management part 1: better-studied neuropathic pain diseases [^114Mgqoe]. Pain Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain impacts millions of people in the United States and around the world. Patients experience one of many symptoms, such as pain, paresthesia, dysesthesia, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, for many years because of unavailable or inadequate treatment. One of the major challenges in treating patients with neuropathic pain syndromes is a lack of consensus concerning the appropriate first-line treatment options for conditions associated with neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia. This review summarizes the published results of randomized trials involving treatment for neuropathic pain conditions. Anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine, and tricyclic antidepressants, including amitriptyline and desipramine, have demonstrated efficacy in relieving pain associated with postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, and trigeminal neuralgia, in several studies. However, the lack of head-to-head comparison studies of these agents limits the conclusions that can be reached. Clinicians who must make decisions regarding the care of individual patients may find some guidance from the number of randomized trials with a positive outcome for each agent. Using quality-of-life study outcomes, treatment strategies must encompass the impact of therapeutic agents on the comorbid conditions of sleep disturbance and mood and anxiety disorders associated with neuropathic pain. Looking to the future, emerging therapies, such as pregabalin and newer N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor blockers, may provide physicians and patients with new treatment options for more effective relief of pain.

### Pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain: evidence-based recommendations [^112YtQ4X]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with neuropathic pain (NP) are challenging to manage and evidence-based clinical recommendations for pharmacologic management are needed. Systematic literature reviews, randomized clinical trials, and existing guidelines were evaluated at a consensus meeting. Medications were considered for recommendation if their efficacy was supported by at least one methodologically-sound, randomized clinical trial (RCT) demonstrating superiority to placebo or a relevant comparison treatment. Recommendations were based on the amount and consistency of evidence, degree of efficacy, safety, and clinical experience of the authors. Available RCTs typically evaluated chronic NP of moderate to severe intensity. Recommended first-line treatments include certain antidepressants (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants and dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine), calcium channel alpha2-delta ligands (i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics and tramadol are recommended as generally second-line treatments that can be considered for first-line use in select clinical circumstances. Other medications that would generally be used as third-line treatments but that could also be used as second-line treatments in some circumstances include certain antiepileptic and antidepressant medications, mexiletine, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists, and topical capsaicin. Medication selection should be individualized, considering side effects, potential beneficial or deleterious effects on comorbidities, and whether prompt onset of pain relief is necessary. To date, no medications have demonstrated efficacy in lumbosacral radiculopathy, which is probably the most common type of NP. Long-term studies, head-to-head comparisons between medications, studies involving combinations of medications, and RCTs examining treatment of central NP are lacking and should be a priority for future research.

### Most relevant neuropathic pain treatment and chronic low back pain management guidelines: a change pain Latin America advisory panel consensus [^117UQQRA]. Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic pain conditions profoundly affect the daily living of a significant number of people and are a major economic and social burden, particularly in developing countries. The Change Pain Latin America (CPLA) advisory panel aimed to identify the most appropriate guidelines for the treatment of neuropathic pain (NP) and chronic low back pain (CLBP) for use across Latin America.

Methods

Published systematic reviews or practice guidelines were identified by a systematic search of PubMed, the Guidelines Clearinghouse, and Google. Articles were screened by an independent reviewer, and potential candidate guidelines were selected for more in-depth review. A shortlist of suitable guidelines was selected and critically evaluated by the CPLA advisory panel.

Results

Searches identified 674 and 604 guideline articles for NP and CLBP, respectively. Of these, 14 guidelines were shortlisted for consensus consideration, with the following final selections made: "Recommendations for the pharmacological management of neuropathic pain from the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group in 2015-pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis". Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society" (2007).

Conclusions

The selected guidelines were endorsed by all members of the CPLA advisory board as the best fit for use across Latin America. In addition, regional considerations were discussed and recorded. We have included this expert local insight and advice to enhance the implementation of each guideline across all Latin American countries.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^111umiFu]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neuropathic pain (NeP) is triggered by a lesion or a disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system that alters its structure and function, so that pain occurs spontaneously and responses to noxious and innocuous stimuli are pathologically amplified. Peripheral causes of NeP are for example, polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, postoperative pain, and posttraumatic neuralgia, while causes of central NeP are spinal cord injuries, stroke, and so on. The current Danish treatment algorithms–are founded on the evidence-based recommendations provided by the international pain societies. The European guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of NeP issued by the European Federation of Neurological Societies recommend tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), gabapentin, and pregabalin as first-line treatment for the most common NeP conditions, including diabetic neuropathy where serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are also recommended. Finnerup et al, recently revised the worldwide applied NeP pharmacotherapy recommendations from the Special Interest Group on neuropathic pain concluding that there was a strong Grades of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) recommendation for use and proposal as first-line treatment for TCA, SNRI, pregabalin, and gabapentin.

Combination therapy, that is, the combination of different pharmacological treatments, has not been a part of guidelines until recently. The combination of pregabalin or gabapentin with either TCAs or SNRIs is now mentioned as a treatment option if a patient cannot tolerate high-dose monotherapy. The idea of combination therapy using two drugs with different mechanisms of action is of great interest, as it is widely acknowledged that many patients have insufficient pain relief on monotherapy with the currently used drugs. Furthermore, the drugs used for treatment of NeP have severe dose-dependent side effects and tolerability issues, that often lead to discontinuation of high-dose monotherapies. Other fields of medicine apply combination therapy so as to avoid high-dose monotherapy such as for example, treatment of hypertension or diabetes. In a similar fashion, pain medicine could benefit from using lower dose combination therapies with different mechanisms of action. An example could be a moderate dose of a drug reducing calcium influx (pregabalin or gabapentin) combined with a moderate dose of a drug inhibiting the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake (duloxetine).

### Barriers and facilitators to optimal neuropathic pain management: SCI consumer, significant other, and health care provider perspectives [^1129SdYb]. Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Persistent neuropathic pain is a common and often severe consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI). There is a critical need to better understand how to overcome barriers and promote facilitators to optimal pain management. The present study was designed to identify, from the perspectives of persons living with SCI, their significant others, and SCI health care professionals, the barriers and facilitators to optimal pain management for intense neuropathic pain.

Design

Qualitative interviews.

Setting

University laboratory.

Subjects

People with SCI who had experienced intense neuropathic pain for a minimum of a year (N = 15), their significant others (N = 15), and SCI health care providers (N = 15).

Methods

Qualitative interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed based on grounded theory using ATLAS.ti software.

Results

Inadequate access to care, information, or pain management expertise were frequently perceived barriers to optimal pain management across all three groups. Another major barrier was SCI stakeholders' concerns regarding the risks of adverse effects and addiction to pain medication. Facilitators included having a better understanding of pain and available treatment options, effective patient-provider communication, resilience, and access to nonpharmacological treatment options.

Conclusions

Managing intense neuropathic pain poses significant challenges after SCI. SCI stakeholders felt that accessible treatment options were limited and primarily focused on pain medications with minimal benefit but with significant risks for addiction and adverse effects. Actionable facilitators to optimal pain management after SCI include education regarding neuropathic pain and treatment options for all stakeholders, better communication regarding neuropathic pain among stakeholders, and improved patient access to nonpharmacological treatment options.

### Combination pharmacotherapy for the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults: systematic review and meta-analysis [^114a5HmK]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Neuropathic pain causes substantial morbidity and healthcare utilization. Monotherapy with antidepressants or anticonvulsants often fails to provide relief. Combining different drugs sometimes provides improved analgesia and/or tolerability. More than half of patients receive 2 or more analgesics, and combination trials continue to emerge. This review comprehensively searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for relevant trials. Included studies are double-blind randomized controlled trials evaluating combinations of 2 or more drugs vs placebo or at least one monotherapy in adults with neuropathic pain. Outcomes included measures of efficacy and adverse effects. Risk of bias was assessed. Meta-analyses compared combination to monotherapy wherever 2 or more similar studies were available. Forty studies (4741 participants) were included. Studies were heterogenous with respect to various characteristics, including dose titration methods and administration (ie, simultaneous vs sequential) of the combination. Few combinations involved a nonsedating drug, and several methodological problems were identified. For opioid-antidepressant, opioid-gabapentinoid, and gabapentinoid-antidepressant combinations, meta-analyses failed to demonstrate superiority over both monotherapies. In general, adverse event profiles were not substantially different for combination therapy compared with monotherapy. Despite widespread use and a growing number of trials, convincing evidence has not yet emerged to suggest superiority of any combination over its respective monotherapies. Therefore, implementing combination therapy-as second- or third-line treatment-in situations where monotherapy is insufficient, should involve closely monitored individual dosing trials to confirm safety and overall added benefit. Further research is needed, including trials of combinations involving nonsedating agents, and to identify clinical settings and specific combinations that safely provide added benefit.

Peripheral neuropathy is a common long-term complication of diabetes mellitus. In many patients, neuropathy is accompanied by pain, which is often difficult to manage effectively. Drug treatment options include certain antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs. Another option is the use of topical capsaicin. In this article, we consider the evidence for capsaicin in the management of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and how it fits with current management strategies.

### Neuropathic pain in sickle cell disease: measurement and management [^115oZcsV]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

The identification of chronic pain and neuropathic pain as common contributors to the overall pain experience of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) has altered the way we should evaluate difficult-to-treat pain. The recognition of these 2 entities is not generally routine among various medical specialties and provider levels that treat SCD. Due to the relative recency with which neuropathic pain was first described in SCD, validated assessment tools and evidence-based treatments remain lacking. Although clinical assessment and judgment must continue to inform all decision making in this understudied area of SCD pain management, a number of validated neuropathic pain assessment tools exist that can make possible a standardized evaluation process. Similarly, investigation of available neuropathic pain treatments for the uniquely complex pain phenotypes of SCD has only just begun and is better established in pain conditions other than SCD. The aim of this review is to briefly summarize the proposed basic pathophysiology, assessment, and treatment of neuropathic pain in patients with SCD. Furthermore, the aim of this review is to encourage an expanded framework for the assessment and treatment of SCD pain that appreciates the hidden complexities of this common complication of SCD.

### Antidepressants for the treatment of neuropathic pain… [^112bSHUD]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical Scenario A 70-year-old man with a long-standing history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents with increasing burning and tingling in his feet. Clinical Question Should antidepressants be used for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Evidence-Based Answer Tricyclic antidepressants, particularly amitriptyline, are effective for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy and post herpetic neuralgia, and may be beneficial in other neuropathic pain syndromes, but they should be used with caution in patients at increased risk of adverse events.

1. 2 Other causes of neuropathic pain include trigeminal neuralgia, central neuropathic pain, and human immunodeficiency virus neuropathy. Treatment can be difficult, because neuropathic pain often responds poorly to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opiates, but antidepressants 3 and the anticonvulsants gabapentin and carbamazepine have shown promise. 4–6.

Archives of Neurology, advocate five options for the initial treatment of neuropathic pain: tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, 5% lidocaine patch, opioids, and tramadol. 2 This conference was sponsored by the manufacturer of the 5% lidocaine patch. The recommendations cite evidence supporting the use of gabapentin for postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain syndromes; the lidocaine patch for postherpetic neuralgia; opioids for postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy; and tramadol for diabetic neuropathy and painful polyneuropathy. They also note that although tricyclic anti-depressants were the first medications to be demonstrated effective for neuropathic pain in placebo-controlled trials, they must be used cautiously because of the potential for adverse effects.
2. Primary Results. Tricyclic antidepressants are effective treatments for neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline has an NNT of 2, RR 4. 1, for the achievement of at least moderate pain relief. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of the newer selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant drugs.

### Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115S7auQ]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

New drug treatments, clinical trials, and standards of quality for assessment of evidence justify an update of evidence-based recommendations for the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE), we revised the Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain based on the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

Between April, 2013, and January, 2014, NeuPSIG of the International Association for the Study of Pain did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind studies of oral and topical pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain, including studies published in peer-reviewed journals since January, 1966, and unpublished trials retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov and websites of pharmaceutical companies. We used number needed to treat (NNT) for 50% pain relief as a primary measure and assessed publication bias; NNT was calculated with the fixed-effects Mantel-Haenszel method.

Findings

229 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Analysis of publication bias suggested a 10% overstatement of treatment effects. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals reported greater effects than did unpublished studies (r(2) 9.3%, p = 0.009). Trial outcomes were generally modest: in particular, combined NNTs were 6.4 (95% CI 5.2–8.4) for serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, mainly including duloxetine (nine of 14 studies); 7.7 (6.5–9.4) for pregabalin; 7.2 (5.9–9.21) for gabapentin, including gabapentin extended release and enacarbil; and 10.6 (7.4–19.0) for capsaicin high-concentration patches. NNTs were lower for tricyclic antidepressants, strong opioids, tramadol, and botulinum toxin A, and undetermined for lidocaine patches. Based on GRADE, final quality of evidence was moderate or high for all treatments apart from lidocaine patches; tolerability and safety, and values and preferences were higher for topical drugs; and cost was lower for tricyclic antidepressants and tramadol. These findings permitted a strong recommendation for use and proposal as first-line treatment in neuropathic pain for tricyclic antidepressants, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, pregabalin, and gabapentin; a weak recommendation for use and proposal as second line for lidocaine patches, capsaicin high-concentration patches, and tramadol; and a weak recommendation for use and proposal as third line for strong opioids and botulinum toxin A. Topical agents and botulinum toxin A are recommended for peripheral neuropathic pain only.

Interpretation

Our results support a revision of the NeuPSIG recommendations for the pharmacotherapy of neuropathic pain. Inadequate response to drug treatments constitutes a substantial unmet need in patients with neuropathic pain. Modest efficacy, large placebo responses, heterogeneous diagnostic criteria, and poor phenotypic profiling probably account for moderate trial outcomes and should be taken into account in future studies.

### Neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: challenges and research perspectives [^115tHrG4]. Neurotherapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a debilitating consequence of spinal cord injury (SCI) that remains difficult to treat because underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In part, this is due to limitations of evaluating neuropathic pain in animal models in general, and SCI rodents in particular. Though pain in patients is primarily spontaneous, with relatively few patients experiencing evoked pains, animal models of SCI pain have primarily relied upon evoked withdrawals. Greater use of operant tasks for evaluation of the affective dimension of pain in rodents is needed, but these tests have their own limitations such that additional studies of the relationship between evoked withdrawals and operant outcomes are recommended. In preclinical SCI models, enhanced reflex withdrawal or pain responses can arise from pathological changes that occur at any point along the sensory neuraxis. Use of quantitative sensory testing for identification of optimal treatment approach may yield improved identification of treatment options and clinical trial design. Additionally, a better understanding of the differences between mechanisms contributing to at- versus below-level neuropathic pain and neuropathic pain versus spasticity may shed insights into novel treatment options. Finally, the role of patient characteristics such as age and sex in pathogenesis of neuropathic SCI pain remains to be addressed.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^111jPbTi]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

Opioids have also been used for peripheral neuropathic pain though evidence is mixed when it comes to their efficacy. Tramadol functions by acting as an agonist on the μ‐opioid receptor (MOP) in addition to inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. It is weakly recommended for use in all types of peripheral neuropathic pain as a second line agent. Dosing recommendations are 200–400 mg divided into three doses daily or two doses daily for the ER version. Side effects for tramadol include nausea, constipation, and fatigue. Strong opioids such as oxycodone and morphine act as an agonist on MOPs to achieve pain relief. They have a weak recommendation for use as a third line agent in peripheral neuropathic pain. Recommendations for dosing are to individually titrate strong opioids with no specific range for neuropathic pain outlined. Side effects include nausea/vomiting, fatigue, and constipation. Methadone, a synthetic opioid known for its efficacy in treating opioid use disorder, has also been studied for use in treating peripheral neuropathic pain. Methadone binds to MOPs as do other opioids, but it also inhibits the N ‐methyl‐‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Due to a lack of evidence in the literature on methadone's risks and benefits in treating peripheral neuropathic pain, current guidelines do not definitively recommend for or against its use. Side effects of methadone closely mirror those of other opioids as discussed above.

Cannabinoids have shown evidence supporting their use in the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. They work by modulating the CB1 and CB2 receptors which are part of the endogenous mammalian cannabinoid system and are distributed throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems. The effects of cannabinoids on CB1 and CB2 result in decreased release of nociceptive agents involved in pain pathways and have been shown to be beneficial in acute, chronic, and neuropathic pain. Cannabinoids carry a weak recommendation against use in neuropathic pain primarily due to concerns of potential misuse and potential negative long‐term effects. The most notable side effects of cannabinoid use include development of, or changes in psychiatric conditions, cognitive changes, cardiovascular effects, and respiratory effects with prevalence varying depending on route of administration.

### The canPain SCI clinical practice guidelines for rehabilitation management of neuropathic pain after spinal cord: introduction, methodology and recommendation overview [^114yCi4d]. Spinal Cord (2016). Low credibility.

Study Design

Clinical practice guidelines.

Objectives

The objective was to develop the first Canadian clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain in people with spinal cord injury (SCI).

Setting

The guidelines are relevant for inpatient and outpatient SCI rehabilitation settings in Canada.

Methods

The guidelines were developed in accordance with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool. A Steering Committee and Working Group reviewed the relevant evidence on neuropathic pain management (encompassing screening and diagnosis, treatment and models of care) after SCI. The quality of evidence was scored using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). A consensus process was followed to achieve agreement on recommendations and clinical considerations.

Results

The Working Group developed 12 recommendations for screening and diagnosis, 12 recommendations for treatment and 5 recommendations for models of care. Important clinical considerations accompany each recommendation.

Conclusions

The Working Group recommendations for the management of neuropathic pain after SCI should be used to inform practice.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^116n1kud]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Currently, NeuPSIG recommendations on interventional management of neuropathic pain are "inconclusive" for the use of spinal cord stimulation in PHN, DPN, spinal cord injury, and poststroke pain. Counter to this position, NICE updated their guidelines for spinal cord stimulation most recently in 2014, and their Neuropathic Pain Overview recommendations in 2018. They recommended spinal cord stimulation as a treatment option for all chronic pain conditions of neuropathic origin, with ≥ 50/100 on a 100-mm VAS, and that have persisted for at least six months despite appropriate medical management. Importantly, they recommended that the patient have a successful trial of stimulation (> 50% pain relief) before permanent implant and that care be provided in a multidisciplinary environment.

A systematic review of spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome noted that the biological consequences of SCS were less than those of long-term opioid use and concluded that spinal cord stimulation should be placed before long-term opioids in the treatment algorithm [12]. Recently, Krebs et al. reported the results of a randomized trial of patients with chronic back, hip, or knee pain, showing no benefit of opioid medications over nonopioid medications for pain-related function or pain intensity over 12 months of follow-up.

With consideration of the limited efficacy of opioids in neuropathic pain, the authors have recommended a trial of neurostimulation before commencing low-dose opioids, placing it as fourth-line treatment after appropriate conservative, pharmacological, and interventional management has failed to achieve an acceptable quality of life for the patient. This also fits with the current CDC guidelines on commencing opioids and the 2017 Canadian guidelines on the use of opioids in chronic pain. The authors have experience in both interventional and medical management of pain and have developed a predisposition toward interventional and implantable techniques based on the morbidity and mortality associated with the use of oral opioids.

### Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain in adults [^113ymtNU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 12, 2012. That review considered both fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, but the effects of amitriptyline for fibromyalgia are now dealt with in a separate review. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). It is recommended as a first line treatment in many guidelines. Neuropathic pain can be treated with antidepressant drugs in doses below those at which the drugs act as antidepressants.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of amitriptyline for relief of chronic neuropathic pain, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to March 2015, together with two clinical trial registries, and the reference lists of retrieved papers, previous systematic reviews, and other reviews; we also used our own hand searched database for older studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least four weeks' duration comparing amitriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain conditions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We performed analysis using three tiers of evidence. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design), second tier from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison, and third tier from data involving small numbers of participants that were considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both.

Main Results

We included 15 studies from the earlier review and two new studies (17 studies, 1342 participants) in seven neuropathic pain conditions. Eight cross-over studies with 302 participants had a median of 36 participants, and nine parallel group studies with 1040 participants had a median of 84 participants. Study quality was modest, though most studies were at high risk of bias due to small size. There was no first-tier or second-tier evidence for amitriptyline in treating any neuropathic pain condition. Only third-tier evidence was available. For only two of seven studies reporting useful efficacy data was amitriptyline significantly better than placebo (very low quality evidence). More participants experienced at least one adverse event; 55% of participants taking amitriptyline and 36% taking placebo. The risk ratio (RR) was 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 1.8) and the number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome was 5.2 (3.6 to 9.1) (low quality evidence). Serious adverse events were rare. Adverse event and all-cause withdrawals were not different, but were rarely reported (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Amitriptyline has been a first-line treatment for neuropathic pain for many years. The fact that there is no supportive unbiased evidence for a beneficial effect is disappointing, but has to be balanced against decades of successful treatment in many people with neuropathic pain. There is no good evidence of a lack of effect; rather our concern should be of overestimation of treatment effect. Amitriptyline should continue to be used as part of the treatment of neuropathic pain, but only a minority of people will achieve satisfactory pain relief. Limited information suggests that failure with one antidepressant does not mean failure with all.

### An update on the drug treatment of neuropathic pain. part 1: antidepressants [^1176ZdRV]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain refers to pain that arises as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system.(1) Many cases of neuropathic pain run a chronic course, and treatment may be difficult because commonly used analgesics, including NSAIDs and to some extent opioids, are often ineffective. In addition, the use of other pharmacological treatments can be limited by unwanted effects. Management requires a multidisciplinary approach and may involve the use of drug therapy (including antidepressants, anticonvulsants and opioids) with non-pharmacological interventions (including psychological therapies, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and interventional procedures). This month and next month we review the drug treatment of neuropathic pain. In this first part we discuss neuropathic pain and the use of antidepressants.

### Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults [^113J3HNe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is commonly used to treat neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). This review updates a review published in 2014, and previous reviews published in 2011, 2005 and 2000.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2014 to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing gabapentin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). We performed a pooled analysis for any substantial or moderate benefit. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included four new studies (530 participants), and excluded three previously included studies (126 participants). In all, 37 studies provided information on 5914 participants. Most studies used oral gabapentin or gabapentin encarbil at doses of 1200 mg or more daily in different neuropathic pain conditions, predominantly postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. Study duration was typically four to 12 weeks. Not all studies reported important outcomes of interest. High risk of bias occurred mainly due to small size (especially in cross-over studies), and handling of data after study withdrawal. In postherpetic neuralgia, more participants (32%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (17%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1); NNT 6.7 (5.4 to 8.7); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (46%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (25%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0); NNT 4.8 (4.1 to 6.0); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). In painful diabetic neuropathy, more participants (38%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (21%) (RR 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.3); NNT 5.9 (4.6 to 8.3); 6 studies, 1277 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (52%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (37%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6); NNT 6.6 (4.9 to 9.9); 7 studies, 1439 participants, moderate-quality evidence). For all conditions combined, adverse event withdrawals were more common with gabapentin (11%) than with placebo (8.2%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.7); NNH 30 (20 to 65); 22 studies, 4346 participants, high-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were no more common with gabapentin (3.2%) than with placebo (2.8%) (RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 19 studies, 3948 participants, moderate-quality evidence); there were eight deaths (very low-quality evidence). Participants experiencing at least one adverse event were more common with gabapentin (63%) than with placebo (49%) (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4); NNH 7.5 (6.1 to 9.6); 18 studies, 4279 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Individual adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Participants taking gabapentin experienced dizziness (19%), somnolence (14%), peripheral oedema (7%), and gait disturbance (14%).

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg daily (1200 mg to 3600 mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very limited. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by patients, and the achievement of this degree of pain relief is associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference, fatigue, and depression, as well as quality of life, function, and work. Around 3 or 4 out of 10 participants achieved this degree of pain relief with gabapentin, compared with 1 or 2 out of 10 for placebo. Over half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief but may experience adverse events. Conclusions have not changed since the previous update of this review.

### Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain… [^112b9UPL]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Details for This Review Study Population: Adults with postherpetic neuralgia or diabetic neuropathy Efficacy End Points: 50% pain intensity reduction Harm End Points: Dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, edema. Patients generally consider a 50% reduction in their chronic pain a useful outcome because it has been associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference and depression. This summary uses a Cochrane review, updated in 2014, to address the efficacy of gabapentin compared with placebo to palliate neuropathic pain. 3 The Cochrane review includes 37 trials enrolling more than 5, 600 patients. Overall, there were limited quality data to permit analysis of other neuropathic indications other than postherpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy. Oral gabapentin dosed at 1, 200 mg or more daily demonstrated a 50% reduction in pain intensity, with a number needed to treat of eight for postherpetic neuralgia and an NNT of six for diabetic neuropathy.

There are patients who appear to benefit from gabapentin. This is particularly important in the case of postherpetic neuralgia, which can severely impact quality of life, and psychological and physical well-being. 11, 12 The challenge is identifying the minority of patients who derive benefit and finding the proper dose, 13 both of which seem to depend on patients' clinical response to a trial of therapy. Notably, few guidelines exist for the treatment of neuropathic pain. One, from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, includes the use of gabapentin as a first-tier treatment for all neuropathic pain. 14 Similarly, the European Federation of Neurological Societies includes gabapentin as a first-tier agent in its guideline for neuropathic pain, specifically including painful polyneuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia.

15 The American Academy of Neurology with other organizations issued a joint guideline in 2011 indicating only that gabapentin should be considered for the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy.

### Pharmacology and treatment of neuropathic pains [^117HPk22]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review briefly discusses the definition and clinical presentation of neuropathic pain and highlights recent advances in the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Recent Findings

Recent publications have confirmed the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and tramadol for various neuropathic pain conditions. Selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors have been found to reduce pain in painful neuropathy. The new anticonvulsant lacosamide may have some effect in painful polyneuropathy, whereas levetiracetam has failed to relieve postmastectomy and spinal cord injury pain. The role of the old anticonvulsant phenytoin is still unsettled. A recent trial has found an effect of cannabinoids also in peripheral neuropathic pain. Various topical treatments such as topical lidocaine, topically applied capsaicin in high concentrations (8%), and botulinum toxin have recently been shown to have a pain-relieving effect in various peripheral neuropathic pain conditions. Spinal cord and transcranial magnetic stimulation are stimulation therapies with some evidence for efficacy.

Summary

Treating neuropathic pain remains a great challenge, and the treatment has to be individualized to the single patient, taking into account side effects, pain type, comorbidities, and drug interactions.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^113PXRD6]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Selection of Studies for Pooled Analysis

The studies included in this analysis were identified from the clinical development program for the capsaicin patch. This program comprised a series of interventional Phase 2, 3, and 4 trials, specifically aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of the capsaicin 179 mg patch in treating various neuropathic pain conditions. All trials were supported by companies with direct involvement in the development of the capsaicin patch. An additional search of the literature resulted in the identification of clinical trials that included adult and older patients but lacked specific information regarding older patients. Therefore these trials were not considered in this analysis. For the pooled analysis of efficacy according to participant age, only randomized, double-blind, 12-week efficacy studies with similar trial design, and that included patients older than the median age in the pooled dataset (ie aged ≥ 73 years), were selected. Four Phase 2/3 studies (C108, C110, C116, and C117) were identified (pooled n = 1,272), each of which compared the efficacy of a single treatment with the capsaicin patch with that of a low-concentration capsaicin (0.04%) control patch in patients with moderate-to-severe neuropathic pain resulting from PHN (Table 1). Excluded single-treatment randomized controlled trials included STEP (comparator, placebo) and trials C107, C109, C112, and C119 that did not include patients ≥ 73 years old. Duration of patch application was 60 minutes, except for trial C108 in which some patients were treated for 30 minutes or 60 minutes. Only patients who were treated for 60 minutes in the double-blind phase were included in the pooled capsaicin patch treatment group, whereas the pooled control group contained all patients treated with the control patch for any duration across the four studies. All treated patients received pretreatment of their painful areas with a topical local anesthetic cream (lidocaine 4%) before study patch application, to offset potential treatment-related discomfort or pain resulting from capsaicin. Patients used a diary to record numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) scores (from 0 to 10, with 0 indicating no pain and 10 indicating worst possible pain) from the evening of the treatment day (day 0) through to the evening before the week 12 visit. Baseline NPRS scores were recorded during the screening period (starting 7 days before randomization for trials C108 and C110, and 14 days before randomization for C116 and C117, and ending prior to randomization). The primary efficacy endpoint for each individual trial was the mean percent change from baseline to weeks 2–8 for "average pain for the past 24 hours" using the NPRS. However, as the trials were of 12 weeks' duration, the predefined analysis of the mean percent change from baseline to weeks 2–12 for "average pain for the past 24 hours" was considered for the current analyses, to ensure that the full duration of the trial was reflected.

Chronic neuropathic pain in PLWH — clinicians may consider a time-limited trial of opioid analgesics for patients who do not respond to first-line therapies and who report moderate to severe pain; as a second- or third-line treatment, a typical adult regimen should start with the smallest effective dose and combine short- and long-acting opioids (weak, low), and when opioids are appropriate, a combination regimen of morphine and gabapentin should be considered for neuropathic pain.

Neuropathic pain — systematic meta-analysis of 6 studies with 438 patients over 4–6 weeks provides level 3 evidence; the benefit from tramadol 100–400 mg/day in neuropathic pain was of low or very low quality because of small study size, few actual events, and the limited duration of the studies.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^116f6AJv]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Definite neuropathic pain is reached if all the above criteria are present, plus a diagnostic test confirming a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system explaining the pain.

It is recommended that the presence of probable or definite neuropathic pain prompt consideration of treatment according to the neuropathic pain treatment guidelines. Currently, in the context of spine-related leg pain, however, there is little evidence that neuropathic pain medications are effective. However, very few trials actually mandated the presence of neuropathic pain as an inclusion criterion, meaning we cannot preclude heterogeneity in case definitions, further confounding/complicating the interpretation of true efficacy. Other studies used underpowered (post hoc) subgroup analyses. Future research is required to determine whether neuropathic pain medications are effective in patients with spine-related leg pain with neuropathic characteristics and clarification of outcomes may in part be facilitated by the use of specific case definitions, as proposed in this paper. In the absence of clear evidence for efficacy in pharmacological treatment, targeted management strategies for people with neuropathic pain would still be distinct from those with nociceptive pain, for instance, related to explanations, education, and sense making. As such, the grading system classification has direct clinical implications for care recommendations including in spine-related leg pain.

### Combination treatment of neuropathic pain: Danish expert recommendations based on a Delphi process [^112ffmCt]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

The limited scientific literature on combination therapy makes it difficult to make recommendations based on hard evidence, which is also why the Cochrane review on combination pharmacotherapy for the treatment of NeP in adults from 2012 concluded: "no combination treatment has sufficient evidence to be recommended in NeP", Chaparro et al.

Overall, the level of evidence is low as it is primarily based on a low number of expert opinions and clinical experiences. However, we cover a broad spectrum of clinical practice and academia with differences in medical specialties and clinical settings. In spite of the lack of sufficient evidence, the Delphi panel reached a similar conclusion to that of a Lancet review in 2013: "Escalating efforts to develop novel analgesics that surpass the efficacy of current treatments have not yet been successful; therefore, combination therapy remains an important beneficial strategy", Gilron et al.

### Efficacy of venlafaxine in neuropathic pain: a narrative review of optimized treatment [^111VSjww]. Clinical Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

The prevalence of neuropathic pain is high in the general population, and high priority is given to the management of this pain condition. The treatment of neuropathic pain remains challenging, despite the publication of national and international recommendations. The purpose of this narrative review of venlafaxine (VLX) is to provide a better knowledge of the pharmacology of this drug and a clearer view of its efficacy and tolerability in neuropathic pain.

Methods

Two independent reviewers searched PubMed with the following search terms: serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors OR VLX hydrochloride AND pain. The reviewers included all clinical studies that investigated VLX in neuropathic pain conditions and excluded animal studies, studies on fibromyalgia, studies that focused on the prevention of neuropathic pain, case reports, and studies that did not clearly describe neuropathic pain in the included patients. We describe the 13 studies that we analyzed.

Findings

Eleven were randomized clinical trials, and the comparator was placebo in 8 studies. Nine studies reported that VLX was effective against neuropathic pain. However, among the trials, only one against placebo included a large number of patients with > 200 participants and one against prégabaline and carbamazepine had > 200 patients. Most of the adverse events reported in the selected studies were consistent with known adverse events of VLX, and most were mild to moderate. However, most studies were of very short duration.

Implications

Most of the clinical studies found that VLX was effective and well tolerated. However, given the limited number of study and the limitations of all these studies, further large clinical trials are needed. Currently, considering the limited therapeutic options for treating neuropathic pain and the highly variable nature of responses to all drugs, VLX has a place as a treatment option for neuropathic pain.

### Management of cancer pain in adult patients: ESMO clinical practice guidelines [^1158w2f4]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for cancer pain, more specifically with respect to management of cancer-related neuropathic pain, ESMO 2018 guidelines recommend to offer gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine or TCAs (doses ≤ 75 mg/day) as single agents as first-line therapy for neuropathic pain.

### Pregabalin for neuropathic pain in adults [^111dyx2h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This review updates part of an earlier Cochrane Review titled "Pregabalin for acute and chronic pain in adults", and considers only neuropathic pain (pain from damage to nervous tissue). Antiepileptic drugs have long been used in pain management. Pregabalin is an antiepileptic drug used in management of chronic pain conditions.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of pregabalin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2009 to April 2018, online clinical trials registries, and reference lists.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing pregabalin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and biases. Primary outcomes were: at least 30% pain intensity reduction over baseline; much or very much improved on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale (moderate benefit); at least 50% pain intensity reduction; or very much improved on PGIC (substantial benefit). We calculated risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 45 studies lasting 2 to 16 weeks, with 11,906 participants - 68% from 31 new studies. Oral pregabalin doses of 150 mg, 300 mg, and 600 mg daily were compared with placebo. Postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and mixed neuropathic pain predominated (85% of participants). High risk of bias was due mainly to small study size (nine studies), but many studies had unclear risk of bias, mainly due to incomplete outcome data, size, and allocation concealment. Postherpetic neuralgia: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (50% vs 25%; RR 2.1 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6 to 2.6); NNTB 3.9 (3.0 to 5.6); 3 studies, 589 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (32% vs 13%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 1.9 to 3.4); NNTB 5.3 (3.9 to 8.1); 4 studies, 713 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (62% vs 24%; RR 2.5 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.2); NNTB 2.7 (2.2 to 3.7); 3 studies, 537 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 15%; RR 2.7 (95% CI 2.0 to 3.5); NNTB 3.9 (3.1 to 5.5); 4 studies, 732 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 16% versus 5.5%, 600 mg 25% versus 5.8%; dizziness 300 mg 29% versus 8.1%, 600 mg 35% versus 8.8%. Painful diabetic neuropathy: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 300 mg than with placebo (47% vs 42%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.2); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 8 studies, 2320 participants, moderate-quality evidence), more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (31% vs 24%; RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5); NNTB 22 (12 to 200); 11 studies, 2931 participants, moderate-quality evidence), and more had PGIC much or very much improved (51% vs 30%; RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.0); NNTB 4.9 (3.8 to 6.9); 5 studies, 1050 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (63% vs 52%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 1.04 to 1.4); NNTB 9.6 (5.5 to 41); 2 studies, 611 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (41% vs 28%; RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.7); NNTB 7.8 (5.4 to 14); 5 studies, 1015 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence and dizziness were more common with pregabalin than with placebo (moderate-quality evidence): somnolence 300 mg 11% versus 3.1%, 600 mg 15% versus 4.5%; dizziness 300 mg 13% versus 3.8%, 600 mg 22% versus 4.4%. Mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (48% vs 36%; RR 1.2 (1.1 to 1.4); NNTB 8.2 (5.7 to 15); 4 studies, 1367 participants, low-quality evidence), and more had at least 50% pain intensity reduction (34% vs 20%; RR 1.5 (1.2 to 1.9); NNTB 7.2 (5.4 to 11); 4 studies, 1367 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Somnolence (12% vs 3.9%) and dizziness (23% vs 6.2%) were more common with pregabalin. Central neuropathic pain: More participants had at least 30% pain intensity reduction with pregabalin 600 mg than with placebo (44% vs 28%; RR 1.6 (1.3 to 2.0); NNTB 5.9 (4.1 to 11); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence) and at least 50% pain intensity reduction (26% vs 15%; RR 1.7 (1.2 to 2.3); NNTB 9.8 (6.0 to 28); 3 studies, 562 participants, low-quality evidence). Somnolence (32% vs 11%) and dizziness (23% vs 8.6%) were more common with pregabalin. Other neuropathic pain conditions: Studies show no evidence of benefit for 600 mg pregabalin in HIV neuropathy (2 studies, 674 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and limited evidence of benefit in neuropathic back pain or sciatica, neuropathic cancer pain, or polyneuropathy. Serious adverse events, all conditions: Serious adverse events were no more common with placebo than with pregabalin 300 mg (3.1% vs 2.6%; RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 17 studies, 4112 participants, high-quality evidence) or pregabalin 600 mg (3.4% vs 3.4%; RR 1.1 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.5); 16 studies, 3995 participants, high-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence shows efficacy of pregabalin in postherpetic neuralgia, painful diabetic neuralgia, and mixed or unclassified post-traumatic neuropathic pain, and absence of efficacy in HIV neuropathy; evidence of efficacy in central neuropathic pain is inadequate. Some people will derive substantial benefit with pregabalin; more will have moderate benefit, but many will have no benefit or will discontinue treatment. There were no substantial changes since the 2009 review.

### A cohort study on neuropathic pain of the sural nerve-can neurectomy Be considered a valid treatment option? [^113xsd6v]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Sural nerve neuroma is often caused by an injury during prior surgery, for example, osteosynthesis or ligament refixations at ankle level. Different surgical techniques to treat neuroma have been described. Neurectomy of an injured symptomatic sural nerve has been described as a treatment option for neuropathic pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of this technique to operatively treat sural nerve neuroma in our department.

Methods

From 2010 to 2020, a total of 30 consecutive patients with neuropathic pain and suspected neuroma of the sural nerve underwent sural nerve neurectomy. A medical chart review was performed to collect patient-, pain-, and treatment-specific factors. Outcomes were registered.

Results

After neurectomy, 22 patients (73.3%) had persisting pain. In logistic regression models evaluating the risk of persisting pain after sural nerve neurectomy, no independent predictor of higher risk of persisting pain could be identified.

Conclusion

For sural nerve neuromas, neurectomy remains an option as the surgical morbidity is minor, but patients need to be counseled that only a fourth of those undergoing surgery will be pain-free afterward.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^114bzfDT]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Pooled Dataset Analyses

Efficacy in the pooled efficacy population was evaluated in two patient subpopulations defined by median age at baseline: < 73 years and ≥ 73 years. The cut-off of 73 years was chosen as it represents the median age of participants in the included trials, providing a balanced perspective on the treatment's impact across the study population. The following outcomes, all based on the NPRS score for patients' average pain intensity experienced in the previous 24 hours, were evaluated in the capsaicin patch and low-dose capsaicin control patch groups: mean change and mean percent change from baseline to week 2–12; and responder status defined as mean decrease in NPRS score from baseline to week 2–12 of i) ≥ 30%; ii) ≥ 50%; and iii) ≥ 2 points. The cut-off values for the definition of responders have been based on the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT) recommendations.

In the pooled safety population, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were also evaluated in two patient subpopulations, < 75 years and ≥ 75 years, according to treatment received (capsaicin patch or control/SoC). The age threshold was set at 75 years in line with regulatory guidelines that emphasize the importance of evaluating treatment effects in patients aged 75 years and above, a demographic often underrepresented in clinical research. Overall, 1,924 patients had received a single application of the capsaicin patch, and 924 patients had received multiple (up to nine) capsaicin patch treatments. Some patients were offered the option to enter long-term open-label extension trials and receive capsaicin patch treatments after having completed a randomized single-application trial. As a result, of the 924 patients with multiple capsaicin patch treatments, 153 patients had already received a prior control treatment.

The cut-off of 75 years for the elderly subpopulation was selected to encompass the upper two of the three life stages that the older adult population is commonly divided into ("young-old" [65–74 years], "middle-old" [75–84 years], and "old-old" [≥ 85 years]). AEs were considered treatment-emergent if onset was on or after the first topical local anesthetic application or if a pre-existing medical condition worsened on or after the first day of treatment. All AEs for the pooled analysis were coded to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 13.1.

### Neuropathic pain [^113JieAf]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system, including peripheral fibres (Aβ, Aδ and C fibres) and central neurons, and affects 7–10% of the general population. Multiple causes of neuropathic pain have been described and its incidence is likely to increase owing to the ageing global population, increased incidence of diabetes mellitus and improved survival from cancer after chemotherapy. Indeed, imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory somatosensory signalling, alterations in ion channels and variability in the way that pain messages are modulated in the central nervous system all have been implicated in neuropathic pain. The burden of chronic neuropathic pain seems to be related to the complexity of neuropathic symptoms, poor outcomes and difficult treatment decisions. Importantly, quality of life is impaired in patients with neuropathic pain owing to increased drug prescriptions and visits to health care providers, as well as the morbidity from the pain itself and the inciting disease. Despite challenges, progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain is spurring the development of new diagnostic procedures and personalized interventions, which emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of neuropathic pain.

### Nortriptyline for neuropathic pain in adults [^114QDrbb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are widely used to treat chronic neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage), usually in doses below those at which they exert antidepressant effects. An earlier review that included all antidepressants for neuropathic pain is being replaced by new reviews of individual drugs examining individual neuropathic pain conditions. Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that is occasionally used for treating neuropathic pain, and is recommended in European, UK, and USA guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and associated adverse events of nortriptyline for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to 7 January 2015, and the reference lists of retrieved papers and other reviews. We also searched two clinical trials databases for ongoing or unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind studies of at least two weeks' duration comparing nortriptyline with placebo or another active treatment in chronic neuropathic pain. Participants were adults aged 18 years and over. We included only full journal publication articles and clinical trial summaries.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted efficacy and adverse event data, and examined issues of study quality. We considered the evidence using three tiers. First tier evidence derived from data meeting current best standards and subject to minimal risk of bias (outcome equivalent to substantial pain intensity reduction, intention-to-treat analysis without imputation for dropouts; at least 200 participants in the comparison, 8 to 12 weeks' duration, parallel design); second tier evidence from data that failed to meet one or more of these criteria and were considered at some risk of bias but with adequate numbers in the comparison; and third tier evidence from data involving small numbers of participants that was considered very likely to be biased or used outcomes of limited clinical utility, or both. We planned to calculate risk ratio (RR) and numbers needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) and harmful outcome (NNH) using standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included six studies treating 310 participants (mean or median age 49 to 64 years) with various neuropathic pain conditions. Five studies used a cross-over design, and one used a parallel-group design; 272 participants were randomised to treatment with nortriptyline, 145 to placebo, 94 to gabapentin, 56 to gabapentin plus nortriptyline, 55 to morphine, 55 to morphine plus nortriptyline, 39 to chlorimipramine, and 33 to amitriptyline. Treatment periods lasted from three to eight weeks. All studies had one or more sources of potential major bias. No study provided first or second tier evidence for any outcome. Only one study reported our primary outcome of people with at least 50% reduction in pain. There was no indication that either nortriptyline or gabapentin was more effective in postherpetic neuralgia (very low quality evidence). Two studies reported the number of people with at least moderate pain relief, and one reported the number who were satisfied with their pain relief and had tolerable adverse effects. We considered these outcomes to be equivalent to our other primary outcome of Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) much or very much improved. We could not pool data, but third tier evidence in individual studies indicated similar efficacy to other active interventions (gabapentin, morphine, chlorimipramine, and amitriptyline), and to placebo in the conditions studied (very low quality evidence). Adverse event reporting was inconsistent and fragmented. More participants reported adverse events with nortriptyline than with placebo, similar numbers with nortriptyline and other antidepressants (amitriptyline and chlorimipramine) and gabapentin, and slightly more with morphine (very low quality evidence). No study reported any serious adverse events or deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

We found little evidence to support the use of nortriptyline to treat the neuropathic pain conditions included in this review. There were no studies in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. The studies were methodologically flawed, largely due to small size, and potentially subject to major bias. The results of this review do not support the use of nortriptyline as a first line treatment. Effective medicines with much greater supportive evidence are available, such as duloxetine and pregabalin.

### EFNS guidelines on pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain [^115Qk8L2]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain treatment remains unsatisfactory despite a substantial increase in the number of trials. This EFNS Task Force aimed at evaluating the existing evidence about the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain. Studies were identified using first the Cochrane Database then Medline. Trials were classified according to the aetiological condition. All class I and II controlled trials (according to EFNS classification of evidence) were assessed, but lower-class studies were considered in conditions that had no top level studies. Only treatments feasible in an outpatient setting were evaluated. Effects on pain symptoms/signs, quality of life and comorbidities were particularly searched for. Most of the randomized controlled trials included patients with postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful polyneuropathies (PPN) mainly caused by diabetes. These trials provide level A evidence for the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin and opioids, with a large number of class I trials, followed by topical lidocaine (in PHN) and the newer antidepressants venlafaxine and duloxetine (in PPN). A small number of controlled trials were performed in central pain, trigeminal neuralgia, other peripheral neuropathic pain states and multiple-aetiology neuropathic pains. The main peripheral pain conditions respond similarly well to tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, and pregabalin, but some conditions, such as HIV-associated polyneuropathy, are more refractory. There are too few studies on central pain, combination therapy, and head-to-head comparison. For future trials, we recommend to assess quality of life and pain symptoms or signs with standardized tools.

### Topical analgesics for neuropathic pain: an evidence-informed guide for the practicing clinician [^112wq7BA]. Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate available evidence regarding efficacy and safety of topical analgesics for neuropathic pain and offer treatment guidance.

Methods

An expert panel searched PubMed (Medline) and reference lists of published articles for available literature assessing 8 categories of topical analgesics used to treat various neuropathic pain conditions. The panel rated the level of analgesic efficacy evidence for each treatment and considered safety, ease of use, and cost. Degree of consensus among panelists regarding recommendations was measured.

Results

There was strong evidence and high consensus that capsaicin 8% is effective for diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia, and lidocaine is effective for postherpetic neuralgia. There was strong evidence and moderate consensus that capsaicin 8% may be effective for HIV-induced neuropathy. There was moderate evidence and high consensus that lidocaine is likely effective for diabetic peripheral neuropathy, idiopathic neuropathy, and post-surgical neuropathy and that capsaicin 8% may be effective for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome. Evidence was weak for other topical medications, though the panel strongly agreed that antidepressants may help with postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, post-surgical neuropathy, and post-traumatic neuropathy; that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may help with post-surgical neuropathy; and that gabapentin may benefit vulvodynia. There was less agreement whether antidepressants may benefit diabetic peripheral neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and vulvodynia and whether capsaicin 8% could be effective for post-surgical neuropathy.

Conclusions

Recommendations were based on a survey and grading of existing literature and, when strong evidence was lacking, the collective clinical expertise of panelists.

### EFNS guidelines on neuropathic pain assessment [^112n1nF5]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

In September 2001, a Task Force was set up under the auspices of the European Federation of Neurological Societies with the aim of evaluating the existing evidence about the methods of assessing neuropathic pain and its treatments. This review led to the development of guidelines to be used in the management of patients with neuropathic pain. In the clinical setting a neurological examination that includes an accurate sensory examination is often sufficient to reach a diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies and somatosensory-evoked potentials, which do not assess small fibre function, may demonstrate and localize a peripheral or central nervous lesion. A quantitative assessment of the nociceptive pathways is provided by quantitative sensory testing and laser-evoked potentials. To evaluate treatment efficacy in a patient and in controlled trials, the simplest psychometric scales and quality of life measures are probably the best methods. A laboratory measure of pain that by-passes the subjective report, and thus cognitive influences, is a hopeful aim for the future.

Recommendations of the CPGs

As shown in Table 4, we summarized the consensus treatment recommendations. The anticonvulsants pregabalin and gabapentin, low-dose TCAs, SSNRIs duloxetine and venlafaxine, and topical lidocaine showed efficacy for the management of NP and were recommended as first-line and second-line medications, respectively.

### Topical treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain: applying the evidence [^117HW33B]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (NP) may only achieve partial pain relief with currently recommended first-line oral treatments, which are also associated with systemic adverse events. Topical treatments are currently considered second- or third-line options, but a recent pharmacologic treatment algorithm has called for broader first-line use of these agents. This has highlighted a need to communicate the benefits associated with topical agents, in particular around the efficacy, targeted local action, and limited systemic availability resulting in minimal systemic adverse events and drug-drug interactions.

Objectives

This review aims to evaluate the evidence base for topical therapies currently used to treat peripheral NP, discuss the evidence comparing these treatments head-to-head with oral standard of care, and evaluate how they fit into treatment regimens in the "real world".

Methods

This is a narrative review.

Results

Two topical treatments are currently licensed: lidocaine 5% medicated plaster (post-herpetic neuralgia) and the capsaicin 8% patch (peripheral NP). When compared head to head with the oral standard of care (pregabalin), the lidocaine 5% medicated plaster provided similar relief of pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia but did not meet the primary predefined criteria for noninferiority. The capsaicin 8% patch, however, demonstrated noninferior efficacy when compared head-to-head with pregabalin across a wide range of peripheral NP etiologies. Importantly, both treatments demonstrated effective pain relief without the systemic adverse events associated with oral therapies.

Conclusion

First-line use of topical agents may be of particular benefit in patients where the safety and tolerability of oral therapy is a concern.

### Neuropathic pain: diagnosis and treatment [^1175AKtc]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain (NP) develops as a consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory pathways in the peripheral or central nervous system, and occurs in many neurological diseases (eg, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, spinal cord injury, stroke and multiple sclerosis). It affects 6%-8% of the general population and its impact on quality of life, mood and sleep exceeds the burden of its causative pathology. A peculiar feature of NP is the coexistence of negative and positive symptoms and signs, reflecting loss-of-function and gain-of-function of the somatosensory system, respectively. NP has long been considered a difficult clinical issue because of the lack of a diagnostic gold standard and the unsatisfactory response to treatment. In recent years, a redefinition, diagnostic algorithm, and some guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of NP have been published. This review offers an updated overview on the definition, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of NP and focuses on some of the most frequent NP conditions. We intend to help overcome uncertainties on NP and bridge the gap between evidence based medicine and the real clinical world.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^114opd5L]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The 5% lidocaine plaster and capsaicin 179 mg (8% weight per weight) cutaneous patch (hereafter referred to as the capsaicin patch) are both recommended as first-line treatment options for localized neuropathic pain, with some guidelines positioning the capsaicin patch as second line. Of these, the capsaicin patch typically has the broader indication: for peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) in Europe, and for pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (pDPN) in the US. Up to four patches are applied by a physician (or a healthcare professional under physician supervision) to the most painful skin areas for a duration of 30 or 60 minutes, depending on the PNP condition and/or pain site. Treatment may be repeated every 3 months.

In a head-to-head trial, the capsaicin patch provided more rapid onset of pain relief and greater satisfaction than pregabalin in patients with PNP, while a network meta-analysis suggested similar efficacy and fewer side effects when compared with oral systemic agents (pregabalin, duloxetine, and gabapentin) in pDPN. Other topical or locally acting therapies have been evaluated or are in development for neuropathic pain, including phenytoin cream, botulinum toxin, topical cannabinoids, ketamine, muscle relaxants and α2-adrenergic agents, and locally applied μ-opioid peptide (MOP) and nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) agonists. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to recommend these.

Although clinical trials of topical cutaneous therapies (including the capsaicin patch) have included older patients, efficacy and safety data in this population have up to now not been reported separately. In the authors' experience, clinicians' concerns over the benefit–risk profile of the capsaicin 179 mg patch in the elderly (particularly regarding local tolerability) have sometimes limited its clinical use in this population. To address these concerns, analyses were conducted on pooled data from clinical trials of the capsaicin patch to evaluate its efficacy and safety in pooled subpopulations of older and other adult patients.

### Practical considerations in the pharmacological treatment of postherpetic neuralgia for the primary care provider [^111qEzjf]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

An estimated one million individuals in the US are diagnosed with herpes zoster (HZ; shingles) each year. Approximately 20% of these patients will develop postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complex HZ complication characterized by neuropathic pain isolated to the dermatome that was affected by the HZ virus. PHN is debilitating, altering physical function and quality of life, and commonly affects vulnerable populations, including the elderly and the immunocompromised. Despite the availability of an immunization for HZ prevention and several approved HZ treatments, the incidence of PHN is increasing. Furthermore, management of the neuropathic pain associated with PHN is often suboptimal, and the use of available therapeutics may be complicated by adverse effects and complex, burdensome treatment regimens, as well as by patients' comorbidities and polypharmacy, which may lead to drug-drug interactions. Informed and comprehensive assessments of currently available pharmacological treatment options to achieve effective pain control in the primary care setting are needed. In this article, we discuss the situation in clinical practice, review currently recommended prevention and treatment options for PHN, and outline practical considerations for the management of this neuropathic pain syndrome, with a focus on optimal, individual-based treatment plans for use in the primary care setting.
