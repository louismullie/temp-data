## Question

Opioid use disorder in females and during pregnancy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about opioid use disorder in females and during pregnancy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the epidemiology and why pregnancy is a critical window. Then, I should verify screening and diagnostic strategies. Next, I will examine first-line pharmacotherapy choices and dosing adjustments across gestation. After that, I need to check pain management principles for labor, vaginal delivery, and cesarean, including neuraxial strategies and opioid selection. I will then review neonatal considerations and postpartum care, including breastfeeding and dose adjustments. Finally, I should consider special populations, system-level issues, and evidence gaps, and close with a concise, clinically actionable summary anchored to guidelines and key studies.

> Let me first confirm the scope and epidemiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Opioid use in pregnancy has risen substantially, with opioid-related diagnoses at delivery increasing by 131% from 2010 to 2017, and about 7% of pregnant women report prescription opioid use, of whom 1 in 5 report misuse, underscoring the need for universal screening and early intervention [^a0da13b5]. Hold on, I should verify the maternal and infant risks: untreated OUD is associated with maternal death, poor fetal growth, preterm birth, stillbirth, specific birth defects, and neonatal abstinence syndrome, which reinforces the urgency of treatment rather than withdrawal management during pregnancy [^a0da13b5].

> Next, I should review screening and diagnosis, and I need to ensure I'm aligned with guidelines. Universal screening for substance use and OUD at the first prenatal visit using validated tools such as 4Ps, NIDA Quick Screen, or CRAFFT for those 26 and younger is recommended, with screening repeated as indicated, and this should be paired with brief intervention and referral to treatment when indicated [^4890f242] [^28b7f74e]. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach: diagnosis should follow DSM-5 criteria, and clinicians should distinguish medical opioid use, misuse, and OUD to guide appropriate management and counseling [^c7c93687].

> I will now examine first-line pharmacotherapy, and I should confirm the hierarchy of evidence. Medication for opioid use disorder with methadone or buprenorphine is the recommended therapy and should be initiated as early as possible in pregnancy; withdrawal management alone is inferior and associated with high relapse rates, so it should not be used routinely [^0eeb519a] [^3215c077]. Hold on, I should verify comparative benefits: buprenorphine is increasingly favored due to more favorable neonatal outcomes, including lower risk of preterm birth and less severe neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome compared with methadone, though both are acceptable and evidence-based choices [^fd1977ad] [^154477d6]. I need to ensure I note naltrexone: if a patient is already on naltrexone, continuation can be considered with counseling about limited pregnancy data, and if discontinued with relapse risk, switching to methadone or buprenorphine is advised [^3844555a].

> Let me think about dosing and pharmacokinetics across pregnancy, and I should double-check the need for adjustments. As pregnancy advances, metabolism and clearance of buprenorphine and methadone accelerate, often necessitating dose increases or split dosing to prevent withdrawal and maintain therapeutic levels, particularly in the third trimester [^34578902] [^42c59bdb]. For buprenorphine, expert consensus supports splitting to every 6–8 hours in the peripartum period to optimize analgesia and prevent withdrawal, and for methadone, twice-daily dosing may be more effective but can be logistically challenging in OTP settings [^34578902] [^0eeb519a]. Wait, I should verify postpartum dosing: after delivery, methadone doses often need reduction as metabolism normalizes, whereas buprenorphine adjustments are less commonly required but still warrant close monitoring [^aa65b22a].

> Now, I need to check pain management principles for labor and delivery, and I should confirm neuraxial strategies. Early epidural analgesia is recommended to mitigate opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance, and antenatal anesthesia consultation is advised to coordinate care, set expectations, and plan multimodal analgesia, especially given higher pain scores and analgesic requirements in patients with OUD or on MOUD [^9e62e40f] [^0227f913]. Hold on, I should verify agent selection: for patients on buprenorphine, high-affinity full agonists like fentanyl, sufentanil, or hydromorphone may be needed in higher doses for breakthrough pain, while partial agonists such as nalbuphine or butorphanol should be avoided due to risk of precipitated withdrawal; for methadone, continuation with consideration of dose fractionation and supplemental opioids is reasonable [^e2b8b9f9] [^71be5b7e]. I need to ensure I emphasize nonpharmacologic and nonopioid adjuncts as part of multimodal care, including NSAIDs and acetaminophen when appropriate, and document shared decision-making around any opioid exposure [^e2b8b9f9] [^2730821f].

> For cesarean delivery, let me reconsider the specifics so I don't miss key cautions. MOUD should be maintained without interruption perioperatively to prevent destabilization, and patients should be counseled that higher inpatient opioid requirements are common yet discharge opioid prescribing is often lower, necessitating careful planning and follow-up [^71be5b7e] [^8c1cf537]. I should confirm that buprenorphine's receptor pharmacology can blunt other opioids; strategies include increasing total daily buprenorphine to 24–32 mg in divided doses and using high-affinity full agonists for breakthrough pain, while avoiding partial agonists that can precipitate withdrawal [^71be5b7e] [^e2b8b9f9]. But wait, what if the patient desires to avoid opioids entirely? Shared decision-making should incorporate this preference and align analgesic choices with patient goals and safety considerations [^2730821f].

> Next, I should review neonatal considerations and ensure I capture monitoring and treatment. All infants with prenatal opioid exposure should be observed for neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome, with inpatient observation typically 4–7 days, and treatment using standardized protocols that include nonpharmacologic care and pharmacologic therapy when indicated, ideally with rooming-in and breastfeeding support to reduce severity and length of stay [^bbde741f] [^48804d76]. Hold on, I should verify breastfeeding guidance: breastfeeding is encouraged for patients stable on methadone or buprenorphine who are not using illicit drugs and have no contraindications, and mothers should be counseled to pause breastfeeding if they relapse [^0eeb519a] [^7deabef6]. I need to ensure delivery planning includes coordination with pediatric teams and consideration of centers equipped to monitor NOWS, with anticipatory guidance provided prenatally [^35362e1e] [^aac345bc].

> I will now examine postpartum care, and I should confirm dose adjustments and relapse prevention. Methadone doses often require reduction after delivery as metabolism returns to baseline, and all patients should continue MOUD with close follow-up given elevated relapse risk postpartum and the potential for overdose in the setting of reduced tolerance [^aa65b22a] [^58b7010a]. Let me verify supportive measures: comprehensive postpartum care should include mental health screening and treatment, contraception counseling and access, and linkage to addiction treatment and social support, with explicit plans for pediatric follow-up and developmental surveillance [^546443f7] [^dcd08600]. I should double-check that breastfeeding support continues with clear guidance on when to suspend nursing if relapse occurs [^7deabef6].

> But wait, what about special populations and system-level issues that can derail care. For patients in correctional settings, withdrawal management is inappropriate; methadone or buprenorphine should be initiated or continued with transfer to appropriate care when needed, and hospitalization may be required in the third trimester for initiation or stabilization [^42d89042] [^8d49899a]. I need to ensure I address urine drug testing and legal risks: testing should be done with informed consent, results interpreted in clinical context, and systems educated to avoid misinterpretation that could trigger punitive responses, which can drive patients away from care [^d87f9626] [^46ee8520]. Hold on, I should verify that universal screening and nonpunitive approaches improve engagement and outcomes, and that coordinated multidisciplinary care is emphasized across guidelines [^4890f242] [^546443f7].

> I should confirm evidence gaps and research directions so we don't overstate certainty. High-quality randomized trials are sparse for peripartum pain management in OUD, including optimal neuraxial dosing, the role of abdominal wall blocks, and the safest short-term opioid regimens postpartum, and there is limited evidence on psychosocial interventions to reduce pain or analgesic needs in this population [^c2845184]. Let me reconsider comparative effectiveness: while buprenorphine shows favorable neonatal outcomes versus methadone, head-to-head peripartum pain data are limited, and individualized care remains essential pending stronger evidence [^154477d6] [^c2845184].

> Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable approach and make sure it aligns with guidelines. Identify OUD early with universal screening, initiate buprenorphine or methadone promptly, adjust dosing as pregnancy progresses with consideration of split dosing, plan for early epidural and multimodal peripartum analgesia with MOUD continuation, anticipate higher postoperative opioid needs with careful discharge planning, ensure neonatal NOWS monitoring and breastfeeding support, and provide robust postpartum follow-up with relapse prevention and contraception, all within a nonpunitive, multidisciplinary framework that addresses psychiatric comorbidity and social determinants of health [^0eeb519a] [^b51df2b6] [^546443f7]. Hold on, I should verify that this summary matches the strength of recommendations: MOUD is strongly recommended, neuraxial analgesia and antenatal anesthesia consultation are expert-endorsed best practices, and many dosing and analgesic specifics are supported by consensus and pharmacologic reasoning given limited RCT data, which I have clearly noted [^0eeb519a] [^b51df2b6] [^c2845184].

Opioid use disorder (OUD) in females during pregnancy requires **MOUD as first-line therapy** (buprenorphine preferred, methadone acceptable) [^0eeb519a] [^33a5d356] to reduce maternal relapse/overdose and improve neonatal outcomes [^5e5408a7]; **avoid tapering or detoxification** unless carefully planned, as withdrawal increases relapse and fetal risk [^c74491ee] [^3215c077]. Pregnant patients with OUD have higher pain requirements and benefit from **early anesthesia consultation**, multimodal analgesia, and continued MOUD through delivery and postpartum [^b51df2b6] [^71be5b7e]. Universal screening, coordinated prenatal care, and postpartum relapse prevention are essential [^4890f242] [^546443f7]; **breastfeeding is encouraged** when stable on MOUD and not using illicit drugs [^0eeb519a] [^7deabef6].

---

## Epidemiology and clinical significance

Prevalence of OUD in pregnancy has **increased fourfold** over the past decade, with significant maternal and neonatal consequences [^3bc0c489]. Untreated OUD is associated with increased risks of maternal mortality, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, stillbirth, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) [^a0da13b5].

---

## Clinical management of OUD in pregnancy

### Medication-assisted treatment (MAT)

- **First-line therapy**: Methadone or buprenorphine is recommended for pregnant patients with OUD [^0eeb519a]; buprenorphine is preferred due to lower risk of NAS and better neonatal outcomes [^fd1977ad].

- **Timing**: Initiate MAT as early as possible in pregnancy to reduce relapse and improve outcomes [^0eeb519a] [^33a5d356].

- **Dosing adjustments**: As pregnancy progresses, increased metabolism may necessitate dose adjustments, particularly in the third trimester [^34578902] [^42c59bdb].

- **Avoid tapering**: Do not attempt tapering or detoxification during pregnancy due to high relapse risk and potential fetal harm [^c74491ee] [^3215c077].

---

### Pain management during pregnancy and delivery

- **Increased pain sensitivity**: Patients with OUD often experience heightened pain sensitivity, requiring higher analgesic doses [^240c57f6].

- **Multimodal analgesia**: Combine neuraxial anesthesia, acetaminophen, and NSAIDs (when appropriate) to optimize pain control [^b1b021bc].

- **Early anesthesia consultation**: Recommended to plan individualized pain management strategies [^0227f913] [^6d978c61].

- **Continue MAT**: Maintain buprenorphine or methadone throughout labor and delivery to prevent withdrawal and relapse [^71be5b7e] [^8c1cf537].

---

### Neonatal considerations

NAS is expected and **treatable**; infants should be monitored for 4–7 days postpartum [^bbde741f] [^37cb2a4e]. Breastfeeding is **encouraged** for stable patients on MAT without illicit drug use, as it reduces NAS severity and supports bonding [^0eeb519a] [^7deabef6].

---

## Postpartum care and long-term outcomes

Postpartum relapse risk is high; **continue MAT** and provide robust psychosocial support [^aa65b22a] [^58b7010a]. Long-term, children exposed to MAT in utero generally show **no significant differences** in cognitive development compared to controls, though ongoing monitoring is recommended [^546443f7].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Clinical aspect** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| MAT initiation | - Initiate as early as possible <br/> - Prefer buprenorphine [^0eeb519a] [^33a5d356] |
| Pain management | - Multimodal analgesia <br/> - Early anesthesia consultation [^b51df2b6] [^0227f913] |
| Neonatal care | - Monitor for NAS <br/> - Encourage breastfeeding [^bbde741f] [^0eeb519a] |
| Postpartum care | - Continue MAT <br/> - Provide psychosocial support [^aa65b22a] [^58b7010a] |

---

## Conclusion

OUD in females during pregnancy requires a **multidisciplinary approach**, with MAT as the cornerstone of care [^0eeb519a]. Buprenorphine is preferred, tapering is avoided, and pain management should be individualized with early anesthesia involvement [^b51df2b6]. Continued MAT postpartum, breastfeeding support, and coordinated care improve maternal and neonatal outcomes [^546443f7].

### Treating pregnant women dependent on opioids is not the same as treating pregnancy and opioid dependence: a knowledge synthesis for better treatment for women and neonates [^d9a2bf5c]. Addiction (2008). Low credibility.

Aims

Through a novel synthesis of the literature and our own clinical experience, we have derived a set of evidence-based recommendations for consideration as guidance in the management of opioid-dependent pregnant women and infants.

Methods

PubMed literature searches were carried out to identify recent key publications in the areas of pregnancy and opioid dependence, neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) prevention and treatment, multiple substance abuse and psychiatric comorbidity.

Results

Pregnant women dependent on opioids require careful treatment to minimize harm to the fetus and neonate and improve maternal health. Applying multi-disciplinary treatment as early as possible, allowing medication maintenance and regular monitoring, benefits mother and child both in the short and the long term. However, there is a need for randomized clinical trials with sufficient sample sizes.

Recommendations

Opioid maintenance therapy is the recommended treatment approach during pregnancy. Treatment decisions must encompass the full clinical picture, with respect to frequent complications arising from psychiatric comorbidities and the concomitant consumption of other drugs. In addition to standardized approaches to pregnancy, equivalent attention must be given to the treatment of NAS, which occurs frequently after opioid medication.

Conclusion

Methodological flaws and inconsistencies confound interpretation of today's literature. Based on this synthesis of available evidence and our clinical experience, we propose recommendations for further discussion.

### Anesthesia considerations and post-operative pain management in pregnant women with chronic opioid use [^adc3999e]. Seminars in Perinatology (2019). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of opioid use disorder in pregnancy has escalated markedly in recent years. Chronic opioid use during pregnancy poses several challenges for providing adequate analgesia and anesthesia in the peripartum period. These challenges include the potential for withdrawal, opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Here we discuss alterations in analgesic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics that are associated with chronic opioid use. In addition, when treating pain in patients with opioid use disorder it is important to distinguish between different subgroups. In this review, we will discuss practical management strategies for parturients with (1) untreated opioid use disorder, (2) parturients on medication-assisted treatment (methadone, buprenorphine) and (3) patients recovering from opioid use disorder that are currently abstinent. Finally, we offer an overview of non-opioid strategies that may be utilized as part of a multimodal approach to providing optimal analgesia in this patient population.

Conclusions — consensus recommendations for pain management in pregnancy with opioid-use disorder (OUD) state that "This consensus statement provides clinical recommendations for optimization of pain management during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum for people with OUD." The statement adds, "We emphasize the importance of early antenatal evaluations by anesthesia providers and a comprehensive and individualized approach to pain management, taking into consideration a history of opioid use, pain management, and the potential impact on obstetric management." It also notes that it "provides health care providers with practical and concise information to optimize pain management and reduce the risk of OUD during pregnancy," and that "Further research, especially where evidence has been rated weak or primarily based on expert opinion, is necessary to better understand the best practices for pain management in this special population and to address gaps in current evidence."

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^0eeb519a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — pregnant women with opioid use disorder: Treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is recommended and should be initiated as early as possible during pregnancy, and pregnant women who are physiologically dependent on opioids should receive treatment using methadone or buprenorphine rather than withdrawal management or psychosocial treatment alone; care should be managed by clinicians experienced in obstetrical care and in the treatment of opioid use disorder, and hospitalization during initiation of methadone or buprenorphine may be advisable, especially in the third trimester. Methadone should be initiated at a dose range of 10–30 mg, with incremental doses of 5–10 mg recommended every 3–6 hours as needed to treat withdrawal symptoms, to a maximum first day dose of 30–40 mg; after initiation, clinicians should increase the methadone dose by no more than 5–10 mg approximately every 5 days. Clinicians should be aware that the pharmacokinetics of methadone are affected by pregnancy and increased or split doses may be needed as pregnancy progresses, with twice-daily dosing more effective and having fewer side effects than single dosing but potentially impractical because methadone is typically dispensed in an OTP. If a woman becomes pregnant while receiving naltrexone, it may be appropriate to discontinue the medication if the patient and clinician agree that the risk of relapse is low; a decision to remain on naltrexone should be carefully considered with discussion of the insufficiency of research on risks, and if discontinuation is chosen with relapse risk, treatment with methadone or buprenorphine should be considered. Use of naloxone to test for opioid dependence and risk of precipitated withdrawal is not recommended for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, and unless otherwise contraindicated, mothers receiving methadone or buprenorphine should be encouraged to breastfeed.

### Guideline no. 443b: opioid use throughout women's lifespan: opioid use in pregnancy and breastfeeding [^55cdb81b]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, SOGC 2023 guidelines recommend to counsel pregnant patients about the risks and benefits of prescribed opioids for chronic pain to weigh the likelihood of increased pain when reducing or withdrawing medication against potential adverse effects on the pregnancy from continuing therapeutic doses of pain medication. Titrate opioids for chronic, non-cancer pain management to the lowest effective dose, with the understanding that the dose may need to be increased because of the metabolic changes caused by pregnancy.

### Indicated opioids in pregnancy: guidance on providing comprehensive care [^a82e37ea]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

In modern obstetric practice, providers will encounter patients for whom opioid use in pregnancy is reasonable or even necessary. A "one-size-fits-all" approach to the counseling and management of such patients is misguided. Understanding indications for ongoing opioid use in pregnancy is essential to patient-centered care. Specifically, recognition of the nuanced differences between opioid dependence and opioid use disorder is crucial for appropriate diagnosis, screening for common concurrent conditions, adequately counseling about individualized maternal and perinatal risks, and accurate documentation of diagnoses and medical decision-making. In this paper, we explore the current typical scenarios in which opioid use in pregnancy may be encountered, ongoing opioid prescribing should be considered, and provide a guide for the obstetric provider to navigate the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods. KEY POINTS: · Opioid use in pregnant and postpartum individuals is not rare. · Obstetric providers may elect to assume opioid prescribing. · Obstetric providers are positioned to optimize outcomes for the mother-infant dyad.

### Opioid use disorder in pregnant patients [^3bc0c489]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Anesthesia & Analgesia, Lim and colleagues offer a scoping review of the available literature encompassing opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnant patients. As discussed in their review, opioid use and abuse in pregnant patients have increased four-fold in the past decade. As such, these patients can present significant challenges with respect to pain management during labor and delivery. A baseline habituation to opioids can render patients resistant to conventional pain management plans. Those who are additionally prescribed opioid agonist-antagonists or other maintenance medications for OUD such as buprenorphine or methadone have even more complex pharmacologic considerations that make pain management unpredictable. As detailed in their analysis, there is a paucity of literature surrounding optimal management strategies in this population of patients. Reports are increasing over time, however, most publications are of lower tier evidence, with very few randomized trials and systematic reviews to inform practitioners. It becomes plainly evident that this is an area of clinical science that demands greater attention. Specific areas of focus elaborated by the authors include: better characterization of opioid selection and dosing in managing labor analgesia, effectiveness of different regional anesthetic techniques, non-pharmacologic management, and psycho-social support for these patients. The reader is strongly encouraged to review the cited article for an in-depth understanding of the concepts summarized in this infographic.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid-use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^db0ca2c5]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain management in pregnant and postpartum people with an opioid-use disorder (OUD) requires a balance between risks associated with opioid tolerance, including withdrawal or return to opioid use, considerations around social needs of the maternal-infant dyad, and the provision of adequate pain relief for the birth episode that is often characterized as the worst pain a person will experience in their lifetime. This multidisciplinary consensus statement between the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP), Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM), and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA) provides a framework for pain management in obstetric patients with OUD. The purpose of this consensus statement is to provide practical and evidence-based recommendations and is targeted to health care providers in obstetrics and anesthesiology. The statement is focused on prenatal optimization of pain management, labor analgesia, and postvaginal delivery pain management, and postcesarean delivery pain management. Topics include a discussion of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic options for pain management, medication management for OUD (eg, buprenorphine, methadone), considerations regarding urine drug testing, and other social aspects of care for maternal-infant dyads, as well as a review of current practices. The authors provide evidence-based recommendations to optimize pain management while reducing risks and complications associated with OUD in the peripartum period. Ultimately, this multidisciplinary consensus statement provides practical and concise clinical guidance to optimize pain management for people with OUD in the context of pregnancy to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes.

American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Peripartum pain management for pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD) — communication, shared decision-making, documentation, and systems education are emphasized. It is stated that it is critically important that patients be aware of what medications are being used during labor and delivery, with a frank and open discussion so patients can decline any opioid if so desired or, conversely, use planned opioid medications if desired and indicated for effective analgesia by clinical care standards. This discussion is also relevant for patients who may require or desire short courses of postoperative opioid analgesia on discharge. Documentation of these discussions in the medical record, along with communication and coordination with the primary obstetrician, primary care, and primary prescribing teams are paramount, and hospital systems and child/family services must be educated regarding expected positive urine toxicology results and accurate interpretation of these results. The conclusions state that the consensus provides clinical recommendations for optimization of pain management during pregnancy, labor and delivery, and postpartum for people with OUD, emphasizing early antenatal evaluations by anesthesia providers and a comprehensive and individualized approach to pain management; it provides practical and concise information to optimize pain management and reduce the risk of OUD during pregnancy and notes that further research is necessary to address evidence gaps.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^e277ab31]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Summary of recommendations — special populations: pregnant women — evaluation and initiation of treatment: The first priority in evaluating pregnant women for opioid use disorder should be to identify emergent or urgent medical conditions that require immediate referral for clinical evaluation. Treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is recommended and should be initiated as early as possible during pregnancy. Pregnant women who are physically dependent on opioids should receive treatment using methadone or buprenorphine rather than withdrawal management or psychosocial treatment alone. A medical examination and psychosocial assessment are recommended when evaluating pregnant women for opioid use disorder. However, completion of all assessments should not delay or preclude initiating pharmacotherapy for opioid use disorder. If not completed before initiating treatment, assessments should be completed as soon as possible thereafter. Obstetricians and gynecologists, and other healthcare providers that care for pregnant women, should be alert to signs and symptoms of opioid use disorder. The psychosocial needs of pregnant women being treated for opioid use disorder should be assessed and patients should be offered or referred to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs. A woman's decision to decline psychosocial treatment or the absence of available psychosocial treatment should not preclude or delay pharmacological treatment, with appropriate medication management, during pregnancy. Motivational interviewing or enhancement can be used to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services appropriate for addressing their individual needs.

### Committee opinion no. 711: opioid use and opioid use disorder in pregnancy [^340823da]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Opioid use and opioid use disorder in pregnancy — clinical care recommendations emphasize that for pregnant women with an opioid use disorder, opioid agonist pharmacotherapy is the recommended therapy and is preferable to medically supervised withdrawal; infants born to women who used opioids during pregnancy should be monitored by a pediatric care provider for neonatal abstinence syndrome; health care providers will need to consider modifying some elements of prenatal care such as expanded sexually transmitted infection testing, additional ultrasound examinations to assess fetal weight if there is concern for fetal growth abnormalities, and consultations with various types of health care providers; before prescribing opioids, obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care providers should ensure appropriate indication, discuss risks and benefits and review treatment goals, take a thorough history of substance use, and review the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program; breastfeeding should be encouraged in women who are stable on their opioid agonists, who are not using illicit drugs, and who have no other contraindications, and women should be counseled about the need to suspend breastfeeding in the event of a relapse; access to adequate postpartum psychosocial support services, including substance use disorder treatment and relapse prevention programs, should be made available; and contraceptive counseling and access to contraceptive services should be a routine part of substance use disorder treatment among women of reproductive age.

### Opioid management in pregnancy and postpartum [^93338e9d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Pregnant and postpartum women with opiate use disorder present a challenge in perinatal care. It is important for health care teams to provide sensitive and compassionate evidence-based care for these women, who often are stigmatized during the prenatal, delivery, and postpartum periods. Women with opiate use disorder are at risk for inadequate prenatal and postpartum care and for complications. Infants are at risk for neonatal abstinence syndrome and are expected to require neonatal intensive care. Pain management during labor and for cesarean delivery requires consultation and collaboration with providers who have expertise in management of addiction. Postpartum follow-up is essential.

### Treatment of perinatal opioid use disorder [^bb11779f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Opioid agonist therapy is the standard of care for pregnant women with Opioid Use Disorder, but medication-assisted withdrawal from opioid agonist therapy is increasingly prevalent. We review available literature evaluating the risks and benefits of medication-assisted withdrawal. We highlight the importance of supporting women in making an informed treatment choice that is best for them. Although it is tempting to choose medication-assisted withdrawal to decrease the risk of newborn opioid withdrawal, we caution against this practice. Facilitating treatment that assists pregnant women in recovery ultimately produces the best outcome for women and their children.

Opioid agonists versus withdrawal management in pregnancy. Pregnant women who are physically dependent on opioids should receive agonist medications with psychosocial treatment rather than withdrawal management or psychosocial treatment alone because these approaches may pose fetal risk, and withdrawal management has been found inferior to pharmacotherapy and increases relapse risk without fetal or maternal benefit.

Assessment and history considerations specific to females — opioid use disorder: Use of contraception and determination of pregnancy are factors in choosing treatment options for women with opioid use disorder. Women of childbearing potential should be tested for pregnancy, and all women of childbearing potential should be offered regular methods of contraception. Contraception and reproductive health are topics of discussion within the assessment process of female patients who are considering opioid use disorder treatment, and case management plans may need to include referral to gynecological services for female patients.

### Committee opinion no. 711: opioid use and opioid use disorder in pregnancy [^e1a2efe7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Role of the obstetrician–gynecologist and other obstetric care providers — For women, including pregnant women, with an opioid use disorder, opioid agonist pharmacotherapy is the recommended therapy. For chronic pain, practice goals include strategies to avoid or minimize the use of opioids for pain management, highlighting alternative pain therapies such as nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments. Clinicians should discuss risks and benefits at the outset, including the risk of becoming physiologically dependent and the possibility of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), and health care providers should not hesitate to prescribe opioids based on a concern for neonatal abstinence syndrome. A cautious approach to prescribing opioids should be balanced with the need to address pain in the pregnant woman, and pregnancy should not be a reason to avoid treating acute pain because of concern for opioid use or NAS. Care should include a thorough history of substance use and review of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, currently operational in 49 states and the District of Columbia; this resource can guide safe prescribing and help identify patients who suffer from opioid misuse or opioid use disorder, and several states now require that health care providers use Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs before prescribing certain controlled substances. Before initiating opioid therapy for chronic pain for reproductive-aged women, clinicians should discuss family planning and how long-term opioid use might affect care during a future pregnancy. Identifying patients with substance use disorders using validated screening tools, offering brief interventions, and referring for specialized care, as needed, are essential elements of care.

### Neonatal abstinence syndrome: presentation and treatment considerations [^06fcc20d]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The increase in opioid use among the general population is reflected in pregnant women and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) statistics. This increase has produced an unprecedented focus on NAS from both the political-judicial sphere and the medical community. Under the banner of fetal protection, judges and prosecutors have implemented punitive approaches against women who use prescribed and nonprescribed opioids during pregnancy, including arrest, civil commitment, detention, prosecution, and loss of custody or termination of parental rights. Within the medical community, questions have been raised regarding protocols to detect prenatal drug exposure at delivery, NAS treatment protocols, the need for quality-improvement strategies to standardize care and reduce length of stay for mother and infant, and the benefits of engaging the mother in the care of her infant. It is not uncommon for the expression of strong discordant views on these issues both between and among these political-judicial and medical constituencies. Closely examining the issues often reveal a lack of understanding of substance use disorders, their treatment, and the occurrence and treatment of NAS. This study provides an in-depth examination of NAS, including variations in presentation and factors that impact the efficacy of treatment, and also identifying questions that remain unanswered. Finally, 4 key areas on which future research should focus to guide both medical care and public policy are discussed.

### Pregnancy and the opioid crisis: heightened effects of COVID-19 [^16cde655]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The opioid epidemic continues to affect pregnant women with opioid use disorder adversely in unique and enduring ways. The onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the necessary public health measures implemented to slow the transmission have increased barriers to care for these same women. This commentary explores the implications of these measures and discusses strategies we have developed to manage these challenges based on our work in a clinical trial providing patient navigation to pregnant mothers with OUD. We believe these solutions can be applied in medical, behavioral health, and research settings through the pandemic and beyond to increase the quality of care and resources to this vulnerable population.

Opioid use disorder — pregnancy and breastfeeding management includes guidance that if a woman becomes pregnant while receiving naltrexone, it may be appropriate to discontinue the medication when relapse risk is agreed to be low, and remaining on naltrexone should be carefully considered with discussion of insufficient risk data; if discontinuing and relapse risk exists, treatment with methadone or buprenorphine should be considered. Use of a naloxone challenge to test for opioid dependence and risk of precipitated withdrawal is not recommended for pregnant women with opioid use disorder. Mothers receiving methadone or buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorders should be encouraged to breastfeed. Additional pragmatic dosing notes state that twice-daily methadone dosing may be more effective with fewer side effects than single dosing but may be impractical in OTP settings, and after childbirth doses may need adjustment (typically reduction) based on weight and metabolism changes.

### Medication for opioid use disorder during pregnancy… [^12ee4543]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Altmetric: Figures Tables Abstract Problem: Medication for opioid use disorder is recommended for persons with opioid use disorder during pregnancy. However, knowledge gaps exist about best practices for management of OUD during pregnancy and these data are needed to guide clinical care. Results: The MAT-LINK surveillance network gathered data on 5, 541 reported pregnancies with a known pregnancy outcome during 2014–2021 among persons with OUD from seven clinical sites. The mean maternal age was 29. 7 years. By race and ethnicity, 86. 3% of pregnant persons were identified as White,
25. 4% as Hispanic or Latino, and 5. 8% as Black or African American. 1).

Although medication for OUD, such as methadone and buprenorphine, is recommended for persons with OUD during pregnancy, knowledge gaps exist about risks for and benefits of each MOUD regimen and whether certain medications or prescribing patterns result in improved outcomes. Other treatment options are not first-line treatments and are less frequently used during pregnancy. Persons also might use nonpharmacologic treatments, switch between different types of MOUD, and have active substance use while taking MOUD during pregnancy. This report provides a detailed description of a sentinel surveillance system for MOUD during pregnancy, including data sources, types of variables, methods for secure data transfer and storage, and the process for making data available for future analyses.

In addition, selected population characteristics by MOUD status from clinical sites are described and the results of a surveillance evaluation are presented. Linked data on pregnant person–infant dyads might be used by public health professionals, clinicians, and policymakers seeking to improve the care of pregnant persons with OUD. Among the 5, 541 reported pregnancies at the seven clinical sites, 4, 381 included persons who received MOUD and 1, 160 included persons who did not receive any MOUD at any point during pregnancy.

### Treatments for opioid use disorder among pregnant and reproductive-aged women [^e1c03c94]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

The increased prevalence of opioid use disorder and access to medical insurance is subsequently increasing the likelihood that medical professionals will encounter individuals with opioid use disorder. Sharp increases in opioid use disorder among women mean that obstetricians, gynecologists, and other reproductive medicine providers may be especially likely to encounter such patients. Medical professionals' understanding of treatment for opioid use disorder and their roles in their patients' treatment may increase referrals to treatment, reduce stigma, and improve the quality of medical care. Treatment for opioid use disorder falls into four overlapping domains: medication management, medical care, behavioral/mental health care, and psychosocial support. In this review, we discuss these domains with an emphasis on pregnant women and women of reproductive age. Treatment for opioid use disorder is most effective when all providers coordinate care in an informed, nonjudgmental, patient-centered approach.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 524: opioid abuse, dependence, and addiction in pregnancy [^37cb2a4e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Opioid use in pregnancy is not uncommon, and the use of illicit opioids during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes. The current standard of care for pregnant women with opioid dependence is referral for opioid-assisted therapy with methadone, but emerging evidence suggests that buprenorphine also should be considered. Medically supervised tapered doses of opioids during pregnancy often result in relapse to former use. Abrupt discontinuation of opioids in an opioid-dependent pregnant woman can result in preterm labor, fetal distress, or fetal demise. During the intrapartum and postpartum period, special considerations are needed for women who are opioid dependent to ensure appropriate pain management, to prevent postpartum relapse and a risk of overdose, and to ensure adequate contraception to prevent unintended pregnancies. Patient stabilization with opioid-assisted therapy is compatible with breastfeeding. Neonatal abstinence syndrome is an expected and treatable condition that follows prenatal exposure to opioid agonists.

### Opioid use in pregnancy, neonatal abstinence syndrome, and childhood outcomes: executive summary of a joint workshop by the eunice Kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, centers for disease control and prevention, and the March of dimes foundation [^05dc4b57]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

In April 2016, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development invited experts to a workshop to address numerous knowledge gaps and to review the evidence for the screening and management of opioid use in pregnancy and neonatal abstinence syndrome. The rising prevalence of opioid use in pregnancy has led to a concomitant dramatic fivefold increase in neonatal abstinence syndrome over the past decade. Experts from diverse disciplines addressed research gaps in the following areas: 1) optimal screening for opioid use in pregnancy; 2) complications of pregnancy associated with opioid use; 3) appropriate treatments for pregnant women with opioid use disorders; 4) the best approaches for detecting, treating, and managing newborns with neonatal abstinence syndrome; and 5) the long-term effects of prenatal opioid exposure on children. Workshop participants identified key scientific opportunities to advance the understanding of opioid use disorders in pregnancy and to improve outcomes for affected women, their children, and their families. This article provides a summary of the workshop presentations and discussions.

Cesarean anesthesia and postcesarean delivery analgesia for pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD) receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) — It is recommended to maintain MOUD without interruption throughout the perioperative and peripartum period to prevent destabilization and potential opioid misuse. Buprenorphine's competitive antagonism may reduce the efficacy of other opioids for acute pain but increasing the total daily dose to 24 to 32 mg in divided doses can optimize its analgesic effects. Similarly, it is advised to continue the same daily dose of methadone, with consideration for fractionating the dose and supplementing with other opioids for analgesia as needed. For naltrexone, assessing recent dosing history and type can guide clinicians in determining the potential utility of additional opioids as naltrexone levels decline. A retrospective study with 553 participants found that individuals on methadone or buprenorphine consumed more opioids in-hospital postcesarean delivery compared to opioid-naïve patients, yet they were less likely to receive opioid prescriptions at discharge. Clinical recommendation. Available data suggest that pregnant people with OUD treated or untreated with MOUD may experience increased pain and opioid needs after cesarean delivery compared with pregnant people without OUD (Level C-LD). Pregnant people should be educated on risks and benefits of opioid exposure as part of multimodal and tailored analgesic strategies (Class I, Level C-EO).

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^48804d76]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

The opioid crisis has grown to affect pregnant women and infants across the United States, as evidenced by rising rates of opioid use disorder among pregnant women and neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome among infants. Across the country, pregnant women lack access to evidence-based therapies, including medications for opioid use disorder, and infants with opioid exposure frequently receive variable care. In addition, public systems, such as child welfare and early intervention, are increasingly stretched by increasing numbers of children affected by the crisis. Systematic, enduring, coordinated, and holistic approaches are needed to improve care for the mother-infant dyad. In this statement, we provide an overview of the effect of the opioid crisis on the mother-infant dyad and provide recommendations for management of the infant with opioid exposure, including clinical presentation, assessment, treatment, and discharge.

EVIDENCE REVIEW AND GRADING

All existing clinical guidelines that addressed the use of medications and psychosocial treatments in the treatment of opioid use disorders, including special populations (eg, pregnant women, individuals with pain, and adolescents), and that were published during the period from January 2000 to April 2014, were identified and reviewed. In total, 49 guidelines were identified and 34 were ultimately included in the analysis. See Supplemental Digital Content 1, for a list of the guidelines that were reviewed. The included guidelines offered evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of opioid use disorder using methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone, and/or naloxone.

The majority of existing clinical guidelines are based on systematic reviews of the literature including appropriateness criteria used in the RAM. Therefore, the aim of this exercise was not to re-review all of the research literature, but to identify within the existing clinical guidelines how they addressed common questions or considerations that clinicians are likely to raise in the course of deciding whether and how to use medications as part of the treatment of individuals with opioid use disorder.

On the basis of the previously reviewed existing clinical guidelines, an analytic table was created and populated to display the identified key components. This table served as the foundation for development of hypothetical statements. The hypothetical statements were sentences describing recommendations derived from the analysis of the clinical guidelines.

### Committee opinion no. 711: opioid use and opioid use disorder in pregnancy [^546443f7]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

Opioid-exposed infants and maternal care — long-term outcomes and treatment recommendations — observational studies of infants with in utero opioid exposure report that, for the most part, studies have not found significant differences in cognitive development between children up to 5 years of age exposed to methadone in utero and matched controls, though scores were often lower in both groups compared with population data; preventive interventions that support caregivers and enrich early child experiences are likely to be beneficial. Early universal screening, brief intervention, and referral for treatment of pregnant women with opioid use and opioid use disorder improve maternal and infant outcomes. Contraceptive counseling and access should be a routine part of treatment to minimize unplanned pregnancy. Pregnancy in women with an opioid use disorder should be co-managed with addiction medicine expertise, and appropriate 42 CFR Part 2-compliant consent for information release should be obtained. Providers may need to modify prenatal care elements (such as expanded STI testing, additional ultrasound examinations to assess fetal weight if there is concern for fetal growth abnormalities, and consultations) to meet clinical needs. Continuity of care, including ensuring consistent daily dosing of buprenorphine or methadone, is critical to success. For women, including pregnant women, with an opioid use disorder, opioid agonist pharmacotherapy is the recommended therapy and is preferable to medically supervised withdrawal because withdrawal is associated with higher relapse rates, which lead to worse outcomes. Infants born to women who used opioids during pregnancy should be monitored by a pediatric care provider for neonatal abstinence syndrome.

Pregnancy presents a window of opportunity for effecting positive change in the lives of women with opioid use disorder (OUD). Care should be empathetic and nonjudgmental with a focus on counseling for initiation and maintenance of beneficial health behaviors as well as development of a strong patient-provider relationship. 1 These include adherence to treatment of OUD through pharmacotherapy and behavioral counseling, smoking cessation, healthy nutrition, treatment of coexisting medical and psychosocial conditions, as well as preparation for the postpartum period through breastfeeding education and antenatal discussion of contraception. Women will also benefit from anticipatory guidance with regard to neonatal abstinence syndrome (see Chapter 7). This may include a consultation with pediatric or neonatal providers who will be caring for their infants. In the absence of other obstetric indications, minimal additional fetal assessment outside that of standard prenatal care is recommended for OUD.

### Committee opinion no. 711 summary: opioid use and opioid use disorder in pregnancy [^996910dd]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Opioid use in pregnancy has escalated dramatically in recent years, paralleling the epidemic observed in the general population. To combat the opioid epidemic, all health care providers need to take an active role. Pregnancy provides an important opportunity to identify and treat women with substance use disorders. Substance use disorders affect women across all racial and ethnic groups and all socioeconomic groups, and affect women in rural, urban, and suburban populations. Therefore, it is essential that screening be universal. Screening for substance use should be a part of comprehensive obstetric care and should be done at the first prenatal visit in partnership with the pregnant woman. Patients who use opioids during pregnancy represent a diverse group, and it is important to recognize and differentiate between opioid use in the context of medical care, opioid misuse, and untreated opioid use disorder. Multidisciplinary long-term follow-up should include medical, developmental, and social support. Infants born to women who used opioids during pregnancy should be monitored for neonatal abstinence syndrome by a pediatric care provider. Early universal screening, brief intervention (such as engaging a patient in a short conversation, providing feedback and advice), and referral for treatment of pregnant women with opioid use and opioid use disorder improve maternal and infant outcomes. In general, a coordinated multidisciplinary approach without criminal sanctions has the best chance of helping infants and families.

Cesarean anesthesia and postcesarean delivery analgesia for pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD) are summarized as follows: Overall, buprenorphine and methadone users may report higher pain scores and increased opioid use postsurgery, contrasting with naltrexone's blocking effects. Although evidence indicates that patients receiving MOUD may experience increased pain and opioid use postsurgery, it is recommended to maintain MOUD without interruption throughout the perioperative and peripartum period to prevent destabilization and potential opioid misuse. Buprenorphine's competitive antagonism may reduce the efficacy of other opioids for acute pain, but increasing the total daily dose to 24 to 32 mg in divided doses can optimize its analgesic effects, while it is advised to continue the same daily dose of methadone with consideration for fractionating the dose and supplementing with other opioids for analgesia as needed. For naltrexone, assessing recent dosing history and type can guide clinicians in determining the potential utility of additional opioids as naltrexone levels decline. A retrospective study with 553 participants found that individuals on methadone or buprenorphine consumed more opioids in-hospital postcesarean delivery yet were less likely to receive opioid prescriptions at discharge. Clinical recommendation: Available data suggest that pregnant people with OUD treated or untreated with MOUD may experience increased pain and opioid needs after cesarean delivery compared with pregnant people without OUD (Level C-LD), and pregnant people should be educated on risks and benefits of opioid exposure as part of multimodal and tailored analgesic strategies (Class I, Level C-EO).

### Opioid use and pregnancy | Overdose prevention… [^58b7010a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Considerations and risks Before initiating opioid therapy for women who can become pregnant, clinicians and their patients should discuss potential effects of long-term opioid use. For all women with reproductive potential, it is important to discuss future pregnancy intentions and engage in shared decision-making regarding contraception, if appropriate. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends balancing a cautious approach to prescribing opioids with the need to address pain, and that pregnancy should not be a reason to avoid treating acute pain. Clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh benefits and risks when making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during pregnancy. Opioid use during pregnancy might be associated with risks to both the pregnant woman and the fetus.

Certain observational studies have shown an association of opioid use in pregnancy with: ACOG recommends counseling about the risk of central nervous system depression for the postpartum woman and in the breastfed infant. If pain treatment includes codeine-containing medication, duration of therapy and neonatal signs of toxicity should be reviewed with patients and families. Tapering Clinicians should consult with experts in pain management or addiction medicine if considering tapering opioids during pregnancy. There are possible risks to both the woman and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal. OUD treatment during pregnancy Early universal screening, brief intervention, and referral for treatment for pregnant women with OUD improve both maternal and infant outcomes.
- For pregnant women with OUD, medication for opioid disorder is preferred over withdrawal management via tapering.
- MOUD is the recommended therapy. It should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the woman and the fetus (see also. Treating OUD after pregnancy According to SAMHSA and ACOG, MOUD should be continued postpartum for women with OUD. The postpartum period is a time of increased vulnerabilities, as the demands of caring for the new baby, sleep deprivation, and threat of loss of child custody are potential triggers for return to use. Women with OUD return to use far more often in the postpartum period compared with during pregnancy.

American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

Predelivery medication management: buprenorphine — metabolism and clearance are accelerated during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, so dose adjustments are often necessary; limited pharmacokinetic data suggest that at 4 to 12 mg twice daily median plasma concentrations fall below ranges required to prevent withdrawal within 4 hours of the last dose. Splitting the daily dose into 3- or 4-times-per-day dosing in the peripartum period may improve pain relief; in one study (n = 62), most chose to take buprenorphine 3 to 4 times daily. It is suggested that dosing every 6 to 8 hours may maximize the analgesic effect of buprenorphine, although this is based on expert opinion. Buprenorphine has high affinity but low intrinsic activity at the μ-opioid receptor, can displace other opioids at low doses, and high doses of full μ-opioid agonists are required to displace it, which could make acute peri-delivery pain treatment challenging.

Psychiatric comorbidity management in pregnant people with opioid-use disorder — clinical guidance: Pregnant people with OUD frequently have psychiatric comorbidities that may increase the risk for more severe pain and increased analgesic requirements in the peripartum period (Level B-NR). Screening for psychiatric comorbidities should be performed during pregnancy in accordance with ACOG recommendations for all prenatal people (Class I, Level B-NR), and referral for appropriate multidisciplinary care may be beneficial to achieve optimal care for these patients (Class IIA, Level C-EO). Although interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for pain management have been recommended by some, data are lacking on the effectiveness of such interventions for pain outcomes in pregnant people with OUD (Class IIB, Level B-NR), and there are no studies evaluating the outcome associated with such interventions specifically for pain outcomes.

Summary of recommendations — special populations: pregnant women — infectious disease testing, urine drug testing, and care coordination: Counseling and testing for HIV should be provided (in accordance with state law). Tests for hepatitis B and C and liver enzymes are also suggested. Hepatitis A and B vaccination is recommended for those whose hepatitis serologies are negative. Urine drug testing should generally be used to monitor patients for adherence to medication and for use of illicit and controlled substances. This should be done with informed consent from the mother, realizing that there may be adverse legal and social consequences for substance use. State laws differ on requirements for substance use during pregnancy. Laws that penalize women for substance use and for obtaining prenatal care may deter women to seek prenatal care or treatment and worsen outcomes. Care for pregnant women with opioid use disorder should be managed by a clinician experienced in obstetrical care and a clinician experienced in the treatment of opioid use disorder. Hospitalization during initiation of methadone or buprenorphine may be advisable due to the potential for adverse events, especially in the third trimester.

### Clinical care for opioid-using pregnant and postpartum women: the role of obstetric providers [^c61e9bca]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

We review clinical care issues that are related to illicit and therapeutic opioid use among pregnant women and women in the postpartum period and outline the major responsibilities of obstetrics providers who care for these patients during the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods. Selected patient treatment issues are highlighted, and case examples are provided. Securing a strong rapport and trust with these patients is crucial for success in delivering high-quality obstetric care and in coordinating services with other specialists as needed. Obstetrics providers have an ethical obligation to screen, assess, and provide brief interventions and referral to specialized treatment for patients with drug use disorders. Opioid-dependent pregnant women often can be treated effectively with methadone or buprenorphine. These medications are classified as pregnancy category C medications by the Food and Drug Administration, and their use in the treatment of opioid-dependent pregnant patients should not be considered "off-label". Except in rare special circumstances, medication-assisted withdrawal during pregnancy should be discouraged because of a high relapse rate. Acute pain management in this population deserves special consideration because patients who use opioids can be hypersensitive to pain and because the use of mixed opioid-agonist/antagonists can precipitate opioid withdrawal. In the absence of other indications, pregnant women who use opioids do not require more intense medical care than other pregnant patients to ensure adequate treatment and the best possible outcomes. Together with specialists in pain and addiction medicine, obstetricians can coordinate comprehensive care for pregnant women who use opioids and women who use opioids in the postpartum period.

### Prescribing opioids and psychotropic drugs in pregnancy [^bbde741f]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Treating for two

Use of medications in pregnancy must balance the health of the mother with the potential impact on developing fetus. These concerns led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to launch an initiative called "Treating for Two," emphasizing the value of better research and reliable guidance that will better inform women's and clinicians' decisions about medication use during pregnancy.

For clinicians who provide care for pregnant women and their children, these data have some additional important implications. Given clinical challenges in predicting risk of withdrawal among infants exposed to opioids, the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that all such infants should be observed for four to seven days after birth to monitor for signs of withdrawal. Huybrechts and colleagues found substantial differences in risk of withdrawal based on exposure to specific psychotropic agents, suggesting opportunities to tailor postnatal monitoring and treatment for the highest risk infants.

Lastly, these findings suggest a clear need for a comprehensive, evidence informed strategy regarding opioid use in pregnancy. To be effective, the strategy would specify opportunities for intervention in clinical and public health settings in all time periods related to pre-pregnancy, antepartum/prenatal, peripartum/perinatal, and postpartum/infancy. There remains a paucity of clinical guidance for obstetricians and pediatricians caring for the mother-child unit; development of a strategy will help to prioritize the development of specific evidence. As the US opioid epidemic accelerates in complexity, there is an urgent need to focus resources on this issue, including expansion of research funding for drug safety in pregnancy and improvement of outcomes for mothers and infants affected by opioid use disorder, more funding for the prevention of the disorder, and an expansion of treatment options for affected mothers and their infants.

### Treatment of opioid dependence in the setting of pregnancy [^405a5ac6]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Opioid dependence in the setting of pregnancy provides a distinct set of challenges for providers. Treatment plans must take into consideration psychiatric and medical comorbidities while balancing risks and benefits for the maternal-fetal dyad. Treatment is best offered through a comprehensive treatment program designed to effectively deliver opioid agonist maintenance treatment along with psychosocial and obstetric care. As misuse of prescription analgesics increases in the United States, identification of the problem in pregnancy will become more important because this misuse is expected to lead to an increased prevalence of opioid dependence in pregnancy. Buprenorphine as maintenance treatment of opioid dependence during pregnancy has promise and may offer some benefits, but more research is needed, especially regarding induction of actively addicted women during pregnancy. For the present, methadone maintenance remains the standard of care for agonist treatment of opioid dependence in pregnancy against which other treatments must be compared.

Postcesarean oral/parenteral opioids in OUD — agent selection, cautions, and individualized planning: There is limited evidence on the use of oral opioids in hospital and at discharge for postcesarean pain in pregnant people with OUD; the type, dose, and quantity of other oral or parenteral analgesics have not been identified, but expert reviews suggest that opioids with high μ receptor affinity such as sufentanil, fentanyl, or hydromorphone should be considered, although very high doses may be necessary in this context. Inpatient parenteral administration may be associated with higher abuse liability; high affinity, partial opioid agonists such as nalbuphine or butorphanol should not be used in patients receiving buprenorphine because these medications can precipitate withdrawal, and caution should be given to using combination opioid-acetaminophen preparations due to potential unintentional acetaminophen toxicity. The need, type, dose, and quantity of other analgesics should be based on specific MOUD and goals (Level C-EO); the decision to use or not use parenteral opioids should be made individually and ideally discussed before pain onset (Class I, Level C-EO). If used, high doses of oral opioids may be necessary, short-term parenteral opioids may be necessary for severe pain, and for breastfeeding patients with high systemic opioid exposure, neonatal sedation monitoring may be necessary (Class IIa, Level C-EO).

Determining Whether, When, and How to Taper Opioids

The benefits and risks of opioid therapy change over time and should be reevaluated periodically (see Recommendations 6 and 7). Opioid therapy should be limited to circumstances where benefits of therapy outweigh risks. Because tapering opioids can be harmful in some circumstances, benefits of continuing opioids in patients who have already received them long-term might include avoiding risks of tapering and discontinuing opioids. In situations where benefits and risks of continuing opioids are considered to be close or unclear, shared decision-making with patients is particularly important. At times, clinicians and patients might not be able to agree on whether tapering is necessary. When patients and clinicians are unable to arrive at a consensus on the assessment of benefits and risks, clinicians should acknowledge this discordance, express empathy, and seek to implement treatment changes in a patient-centered manner while avoiding patient abandonment. Unless there is a life-threatening issue such as warning signs of an imminent overdose, the benefits of rapidly tapering or abruptly discontinuing opioids are unlikely to outweigh the substantial risks of these practices. However, after slow, voluntary reduction of long-term opioid dosages, patients might experience improvements in function, quality of life, anxiety, and mood without worsening pain or with decreased pain levels. Clinicians and patients should consider whether opioids continue to meet treatment goals, including functional goals; whether opioids are exposing the patient to an increased risk for serious adverse events or opioid use disorder; and whether benefits continue to outweigh risks of opioids. Clinicians should not insist on opioid tapering or discontinuation when opioid use might be warranted (i.e. when benefits of opioids outweigh risks). Clinicians should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids during pregnancy because of possible risk to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal. For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medications for opioid use disorder are preferred over withdrawal management (i.e. discontinuation of opioids through either short- or medium-term tapering).

Implementation Considerations

Clinicians should ask patients about their drug and alcohol use and use validated tools or consult with behavioral specialists to screen for and assess mental health and substance use disorders.
When considering initiating long-term opioid therapy, clinicians should ensure that treatment for depression and other mental health conditions is optimized, consulting with behavioral health specialists when needed.
Clinicians should offer naloxone when prescribing opioids, particularly to patients at increased risk for overdose, including patients with a history of overdose, patients with a history of substance use disorder, patients with sleep-disordered breathing, patients taking higher dosages of opioids (e.g. ≥ 50 MME/day), patients taking benzodiazepines with opioids (see Recommendation 11), and patients at risk for returning to a high dose to which they have lost tolerance (e.g. patients undergoing tapering or recently released from prison).
Practices should educate patients on overdose prevention and naloxone use and offer to provide education to members of their households.
Naloxone coprescribing can be facilitated by clinics or practices with resources to provide naloxone training, by collaborative practice models with pharmacists, or through statewide protocols or standing orders for naloxone at pharmacies.
Resources for prescribing naloxone in primary care and emergency department settings can be found through Prescribe to Prevent at. Additional resources are at.
In part because of concerns about cost of naloxone and access for some patients and reports that purchasing of naloxone has in some cases been required to fill opioid prescriptions, including for patients without a way to afford naloxone, this recommendation specifies that naloxone should be offered to patients. To that end, clinicians, health systems, and payers can work to ensure patients can obtain naloxone, a potentially lifesaving treatment.
Clinicians should avoid prescribing opioids to patients with moderate or severe sleep-disordered breathing when possible to minimize risk for respiratory depression.
When making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during pregnancy, clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh benefits and risks. For pregnant persons already receiving opioids, clinicians should access appropriate expertise if tapering is being considered because of possible risks to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal (see Recommendation 5).
For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medication for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) is the recommended therapy and should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the patient and the fetus (see Recommendation 12).
Clinicians should use additional caution and increased monitoring (see Recommendation 7) to minimize risks of opioids prescribed for patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency and for patients aged ≥ 65 years. Clinicians should implement interventions to mitigate common risks of opioid therapy among older adults, such as exercise or bowel regimens to prevent constipation, risk assessment for falls, and patient monitoring for cognitive impairment.
For patients with jobs that involve potentially hazardous tasks and who are receiving opioids or other medications that can negatively affect sleep, cognition, balance, or coordination, clinicians should assess patients' abilities to safely perform the potentially hazardous tasks (e.g. driving, use of heavy equipment, climbing ladders, working at heights or around moving machinery, or working with high-voltage equipment).
Clinicians should use PDMP data (see Recommendation 9) and toxicology screening (see Recommendation 10) as appropriate to assess for concurrent substance use that might place patients at higher risk for opioid use disorder and overdose.
Clinicians should provide specific counseling on increased risks for overdose when opioids are combined with other drugs or alcohol (see Recommendation 2) and ensure that patients are provided or receive effective treatment for substance use disorders when needed (see Recommendation 12).
Although substance use disorders can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 12, Pain Management for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder for additional considerations specific to these patients.)
If clinicians consider opioid therapy for chronic pain for patients with substance use disorder, they should discuss increased risks for opioid use disorder and overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh increased risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan (e.g. offering naloxone [see Offering Naloxone to Patients] and increasing frequency of monitoring [see Recommendation 7]).
If patients experience nonfatal opioid overdose, clinicians should evaluate for opioid use disorder and treat or arrange treatment if needed. Clinicians should work with patients to reduce opioid dosage and to discontinue opioids when indicated (see Recommendation 5) and should ensure continued close monitoring and support for patients prescribed or not prescribed opioids.
If clinicians continue opioid therapy in patients with previous opioid overdose, they should discuss increased risks for overdose with patients, carefully consider whether benefits of opioids outweigh substantial risks, and incorporate strategies to mitigate risk into the management plan (e.g. offering naloxone and increasing frequency of monitoring [see Recommendation 7]).

Opioid misuse, opioid use disorder (OUD), and opioid overdose continue to be significant contributors to perinatal morbidity and mortality, including in the postpartum period. Medications for OUD including methadone and buprenorphine reduce the risk of pregnancy-associated overdose and improve perinatal outcomes. Newer medications and medication formulations are currently being investigated to provide additional treatment options. Modifications to obstetric and pediatric management may be required to best support maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes. Harm reduction tools, including Narcan and fentanyl testing strip distribution, as well as sterile syringe exchanges, play a key role in reducing overdose mortality.

### Postoperative cesarean pain management and opioid use disorder: anticipate the need for higher opioid doses and communicate expectations with patients and the obstetric team [^c80972e2]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Peripartum care coordination for the obstetric patient on medications for opioid use disorder (OUD) can be challenging and is best accomplished by a multidisciplinary team. The benefits of buprenorphine, methadone, or naltrexone initiation or continuation in pregnancy are well established and beyond the scope of this commentary; instead, we narrow the focus on planning for sufficient pain management in labor and during recovery from cesarean delivery. Conversations about postoperative pain management should begin in the antepartum period, and likely do for the 15%-20% of individuals with a history of cesarean delivery who schedule a repeat cesarean. Nevertheless, 18%-20% of pregnant individuals deliver via primary cesarean delivery, underscoring the need for universal antepartum counseling on the possibility of undergoing and recovering from an unanticipated major abdominal surgery. The optimal intrapartum and postpartum pain regimen for individuals with OUD remains incompletely characterized as research on this topic is limited. Enhanced understanding of the unique needs of postpartum individuals with OUD will aid in closing knowledge gaps and elevate the standard of care in this population.

Implementation Considerations

Although stigma can reduce the willingness of persons with opioid use disorder to seek treatment, opioid use disorder is a chronic, treatable disease from which persons can recover and continue to lead healthy lives.
If clinicians suspect opioid use disorder, they should discuss their concern with their patient in a nonjudgmental manner and provide an opportunity for the patient to disclose related concerns or problems.
Clinicians should assess for the presence of opioid use disorder using DSM-5 criteria.
For patients meeting criteria for opioid use disorder, particularly if moderate or severe, clinicians should offer or arrange for patients to receive evidence-based treatment with medications for opioid use disorder.
Clinicians should not dismiss patients from their practice because of opioid use disorder because this can adversely affect patient safety.
Medication treatment of opioid use disorder has been associated with reduced risk for overdose and overall deaths. Identification of opioid use disorder represents an opportunity for a clinician to initiate potentially life-saving interventions, and the clinician should collaborate with the patient regarding their safety to increase the likelihood of successful treatment.
For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medication for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) is the recommended therapy and should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the patient and the fetus.
Clinicians unable to provide treatment themselves should arrange for patients with opioid use disorder to receive care from a substance use disorder treatment specialist (e.g. an office-based buprenorphine or naltrexone treatment provider), or from an opioid treatment program certified by SAMHSA to provide methadone or buprenorphine for patients with opioid use disorder.
All clinicians, and particularly clinicians prescribing opioids in communities without sufficient treatment capacity for opioid use disorder, should obtain a waiver to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder.
Clinicians prescribing opioids should identify treatment resources for opioid use disorder in the community, establish a network of referral options that span the levels of care that patients might need to enable rapid collaboration and referral, when needed, and work together to ensure sufficient treatment capacity for opioid use disorder at the practice level.
Although identification of an opioid use disorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and opioid use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks.

Relapse risks include "communicable disease transmission, accidental overdose because of loss of tolerance, obstetric complications, and lack of prenatal care." If agonist therapy is declined or unavailable, medically supervised withdrawal "can be considered under the care of a physician experienced."

Prenatal anesthesia consultation — opioid-use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy and planning: No studies measured the effects of a prenatal anesthesia consult on delivery outcomes, but OUD in pregnancy is associated with a significant increase in maternal morbidity and mortality particularly if OUD is untreated, and experts considered that an antenatal consult with an anesthesiology service may be useful to allow early identification and counseling. Prenatal anesthesia consultation can facilitate focused patient counseling, preparation, and planning for pain experiences associated with vaginal and cesarean deliveries, and evidence suggests the possibility of worse pain and increased analgesia requirements among parturients receiving MOUD, with setting expectations and discussing options being key. In a retrospective review (n = 7449,1.1% with OUD), pregnant people using chronic opioids had higher utilization rates of epidural labor analgesia (47% vs 38%) and high rates (74%) of inadequate postcesarean analgesia compared to controls. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends MOUD with methadone or buprenorphine be initiated or continued for pregnant people with OUD, and opioid agonist treatment with methadone or buprenorphine is preferable to medically supervised withdrawal, as withdrawal may be associated with higher rates of return to opioid use and worse outcomes; MOUD with opioid agonist may improve obstetrical outcomes by improving adherence to prenatal care.

Antepartum care — prenatal care priorities for women with opioid use or use disorder include the following: Testing for STIs and other infectious agents such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, chlamydial infection, gonorrhea, syphilis, and tuberculosis should be considered, and repeat testing in the third trimester may be indicated if the woman is at increased risk; hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for HBsAg-negative pregnant women at high risk; screening for depression and other behavioral health conditions should be conducted; consideration should be given to first-trimester ultrasonography for best dating and interval assessment of fetal weight if there is concern for growth abnormalities; consultations with anesthesia, addiction medicine, pain management, pediatrics, maternal–fetal medicine, behavioral health, nutrition, and social services should be conducted as needed; breastfeeding should be encouraged in stable women on opioid agonists who are not using illicit drugs and have no other contraindications, and providers should offer anticipatory breastfeeding guidance during the antepartum period; close communication with the pediatric team before delivery is necessary and neonatal consultation can be considered prenatally; use of other substances is common, so screening and discussion are important and cessation services should be offered.

### Committee opinion no. 711: opioid use and opioid use disorder in pregnancy [^4890f242]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — opioid use and opioid use disorder in pregnancy emphasizes universal screening integrated into obstetric care, validated tools, brief intervention with referral, multidisciplinary follow-up, and newborn monitoring. Therefore, it is essential that screening be universal. Screening for substance use should be a part of comprehensive obstetric care and should be done at the first prenatal visit in partnership with the pregnant woman. Routine screening should rely on validated screening tools, such as questionnaires, including 4Ps, NIDA Quick Screen, and CRAFFT (for women 26 years or younger). Early universal screening, brief intervention (such as engaging the patient in a short conversation, providing feedback and advice), and referral for treatment of pregnant women with opioid use and opioid use disorder improve maternal and infant outcomes. Multidisciplinary long-term follow-up should include medical, developmental, and social support. Infants born to women who used opioids during pregnancy should be monitored for neonatal abstinence syndrome by a pediatric care provider.

### A systematic scoping review of peridelivery pain management for pregnant people with opioid use disorder: from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology and society for maternal fetal medicine [^c2845184]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD), including those receiving medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), is increasing. Challenges associated with pain management in people with OUD include tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, and risk for return to use. Yet, there are few evidence-based recommendations for pain management in the setting of pregnancy and the postpartum period, and many peripartum pain management studies exclude people with OUD. This scoping review summarized the available literature on peridelivery pain management in people with OUD, methodologies used, and identified specific areas of knowledge gaps. PubMed and Embase were comprehensively searched for publications in all languages on peripartum pain management among people with OUD, both treated with MOUD and untreated. Potential articles were screened by title, abstract, and full text. Data abstracted were descriptively analyzed to map available evidence and identify areas of limited or no evidence. A total of 994 publications were imported for screening on title, abstracts, and full text, yielding 84 publications identified for full review: 32 (38.1%) review articles, 14 (16.7%) retrospective studies, and 8 (9.5%) case reports. There were 5 randomized controlled trials. Most studies (64%) were published in perinatology (32; 38.1%) journals or anesthesiology (22; 26.2%) journals. Specific areas lacking trial or systematic review evidence include: (1) methods to optimize psychological and psychosocial comorbidities relevant to acute pain management around delivery; (2) alternative nonopioid and nonpharmacologic analgesia methods; (3) whether or not to use opioids for severe breakthrough pain and how best to prescribe and monitor its use after discharge; (4) monitoring for respiratory depression and sedation with coadministration of other analgesics; (5) optimal neuraxial analgesia dosing and adjuncts; and (6) benefits of abdominal wall blocks after cesarean delivery. No publications discussed naloxone coprescribing in the labor and delivery setting. We observed an increasing number of publications on peripartum pain management in pregnant people with OUD. However, existing published works are low on the pyramid of evidence (reviews, opinions, and retrospective studies), with a paucity of original research articles (< 6%). Opinions are conflicting on the utility and disutility of various analgesic interventions. Studies generating high-quality evidence on this topic are needed to inform care for pregnant people with OUD. Specific research areas are identified, including utility and disutility of short-term opioid use for postpartum pain management, role of continuous wound infiltration and truncal nerve blocks, nonpharmacologic analgesia options, and the best methods to support psychosocial aspects of pain management.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^4e15fb4a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinicians and patients together should carefully weigh benefits and risks when making decisions about whether to initiate opioid therapy for pain during pregnancy. In addition, before initiating opioid therapy for persons who can become pregnant, clinicians and patients should discuss family planning and potential effects of long-term opioid use on any future pregnancy. For all persons with reproductive potential, discussing future pregnancy intentions and engaging in shared decision-making regarding contraception, if appropriate, is a core component of care. A review of all prescription and nonprescription medications is recommended during prepregnancy and interpregnancy care. Intentional application of a patient-centered reproductive justice framework and use of a shared decision-making model is the recommended approach for providing supportive contraceptive counseling and care to help patients to achieve their reproductive goals. Counseling should be noncoercive and include a discussion of all contraceptive options. When opioids are needed for treatment of acute pain in pregnant persons, the lowest effective dose (see Recommendation 4) should be used for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6). For pregnant persons with chronic pain, ACOG recommends that practice goals include strategies to avoid or minimize the use of opioids for pain management, highlighting alternative pain therapies such as nonpharmacologic (e.g. exercise, physical therapy, and behavioral approaches), and nonopioid pharmacologic treatments. Pharmacokinetic and physiologic changes occur during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester, and these changes might require dose adjustments. For pregnant persons already receiving opioids, clinicians should access appropriate expertise if considering tapering opioids because of possible risk to the pregnant patient and the fetus if the patient goes into withdrawal (see Recommendation 5).

ACOG has noted that early universal screening, brief intervention (e.g. engaging in a short conversation and providing feedback and advice), and referral for treatment of pregnant persons with opioid use disorder improve both maternal and infant outcomes. For pregnant persons with opioid use disorder, medication for opioid use disorder (buprenorphine or methadone) is the recommended therapy, has been associated with improved maternal outcomes, and should be offered as early as possible in pregnancy to prevent harms to both the patient and the fetus (see Recommendation 12). In contrast, criminalization or otherwise punishing (e.g. through threatened loss of child custody) the use of opioids, including for opioid use disorder, discourages pregnant, postpartum, and parenting persons from seeking care; nonpunitive public health approaches to treatment result in better outcomes.

### Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome [^42ef3df2]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Public health considerations — Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) reflects the downstream implications of a complex public health crisis, and to prevent NOWS, pregnant women, women and men of reproductive age, and the communities they live in need effective access to prevention, treatment, and services (eg, access to comprehensive treatment of substance use disorder, access to highly effective contraception). A federal prevention strategy outlined in the 2015 Protecting Our Infants Act provides several mandates for the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address problems related to prenatal opioid exposure, and the strategy requires HHS agencies to plan, review, and coordinate activities related to prenatal opioid exposure and NOWS to develop recommendations for prevention, treat OUD in pregnant women and infants with NOWS, identify pregnant women and infants in need of services to treat OUD in pregnancy and NOWS (including any long-term consequences), and develop a coordinated strategy to address gaps in research; in fall 2018, the HHS held a summit to improve coordination of national surveillance, research, and prevention efforts. Reporting is inconsistent: currently, there is considerable variation in reporting of NOWS by state or jurisdiction; only a handful of states have mandatory reporting of NOWS, and states vary in case definitions; and in a study of 6 states with case reporting for NOWS during 2013–2017, considerable variability was found in how states defined and used surveillance. To improve consistency, the Council on State and Territorial Epidemiologists, in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, met with state health officials to improve reporting in all states on the basis of maternal opioid use reported in prenatal and delivery records as well as newborn hospitalization records, and with more consistent reporting, states may be able to better and more rapidly identify needs among and between localities. State and regional collaborations are developing strategies to improve access to maternal medications for OUD, improve the quality of care for newborn infants with NOWS, and reduce hospital length of stay and associated costs, exemplified by Ohio's Perinatal Quality Collaborative initiating a statewide approach that included standardized assessment and treatment, including both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.

### About opioid use during pregnancy… [^a0da13b5]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Opioid use during pregnancy can affect mothers and babies.
- Opioids are a class of drugs used to reduce pain.
- It is important to be aware of the possible risks of opioid use during pregnancy, as well as treatment options including medication for opioid use disorder. Overview Opioid use during pregnancy can affect women and their babies. Pregnant women may use opioids as prescribed, may misuse prescription opioids, or may use illicit opioids such as heroin. It is important for people to be aware of the possible risks of opioid use during pregnancy, as well as treatment options including medications for opioid use disorder. Opioid use disorder Opioid use disorder, sometimes referred to as opioid addiction, is a problematic pattern of opioid use that causes significant impairment or distress. OUD was previously classified as opioid abuse or opioid dependence in DSM-IV criteria.

Medication for opioid use disorder MOUD refers to the use of medicine to treat opioid use disorder. Methadone and buprenorphine are the primary medicines for pregnant women with OUD. Health outcomes from exposure during pregnancy Opioid exposure during pregnancy has been linked to poor health for both mothers and babies. Opioid use disorder has been linked to:

- Maternal death
- Poor fetal growth
- Preterm birth
- Stillbirth
- Specific birth defects
- Neonatal abstinence syndrome. The effects of prenatal opioid exposure on children over time are largely unknown, including among those with or without neonatal abstinence syndrome. Not all babies exposed to opioids during pregnancy experience signs of NAS, but there could be long-term effects on development that aren't obvious at birth. More research is needed to better understand the spectrum of possible outcomes related to opioid exposure during pregnancy.

Quick facts and stats Opioid use during pregnancy According to 2019 self-reported survey data, about 7% of women reported use of prescription opioid pain relievers during pregnancy. Of those, 1 in 5 reported misuse. Diagnoses at delivery In the most recent estimate available, the number of women with opioid-related diagnoses documented at delivery increased by 131% from 2010 to 2017.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid-use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^f9bf4991]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Planned mode of delivery in OUD: There are no data examining whether OUD in pregnancy should impact the choice between planned cesarean delivery and a trial of labor. In clinical practice, cesarean delivery generally is reserved for obstetric indications rather than based on the presence or absence of a patient history of OUD. Although cesarean delivery exposes patients with OUD to more opioids than vaginal delivery during the postpartum recovery period, continuing medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the postoperative period is associated with reduced opioid analgesia utilization compared to discontinuing MOUD. Decisions on the planned mode of delivery should be based on obstetrical indications and decided by the pregnant person and their obstetrician (Class IIa, Level C-EO).

Patient communication and systems coordination — management of urine toxicology issues and opioid decision-making in opioid-use disorder (OUD) emphasizes that circumstances may "potentially lead to unexpected positive urine toxicology results, sometimes unbeknownst to the patient" and "can cause stress and challenges for patients with OUD, may increase difficulty accessing medications, and could breed mistrust in the medical system." The authors state "it is critically important that patients be aware of what medications are being used during labor and delivery," with "a frank and open discussion" so that patients "can decline any opioid if so desired," or that "planned opioid medications be used if desired by the patient and as indicated for effective analgesia by clinical care standards." The discussion also applies to "short courses of postoperative opioid analgesia on discharge," and "Documentation of these discussions in the medical record, along with communication and coordination with the primary obstetrician, primary care, and primary prescribing teams are paramount." Additionally, "Hospital systems and child/family services must be educated regarding expected positive urine toxicology results and accurate interpretation of these results."

### SOGC clinical practice guidelines: substance use in pregnancy: no. 256, April 2011 [^9e959543]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To improve awareness and knowledge of problematic substance use in pregnancy and to provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of this challenging clinical issue for all health care providers.

Options

This guideline reviews the use of screening tools, general approach to care, and recommendations for clinical management of problematic substance use in pregnancy.

Outcomes

Evidence-based recommendations for screening and management of problematic substance use during pregnancy and lactation.

Evidence

Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, and The Cochrane Library were searched for articles published from 1950 using the following key words: substance-related disorders, mass screening, pregnancy complications, pregnancy, prenatal care, cocaine, cannabis, methadone, opioid, tobacco, nicotine, solvents, hallucinogens, and amphetamines. Results were initially restricted to systematic reviews and randomized control trials/controlled clinical trials. A subsequent search for observational studies was also conducted because there are few RCTs in this field of study. Articles were restricted to human studies published in English. Additional articles were located by hand searching through article reference lists. Searches were updated on a regular basis and incorporated in the guideline up to December 2009. Grey (unpublished) literature was also identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.

Values

The quality of evidence was rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on the Preventive Health Care. Recommendations for practice were ranked according to the method described in that report (Table 1).

Benefits, Harms, and Costs

This guideline is intended to increase the knowledge and comfort level of health care providers caring for pregnant women who have substance use disorders. Improved access to health care and assistance with appropriate addiction care leads to reduced health care costs and decreased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^42d89042]. BJA/NIC (2023). High credibility.

Pregnant and postpartum patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) in jail settings — care directives emphasize that psychosocial treatment alone or withdrawal management alone are not appropriate and that patients who are physically dependent on opioids should receive ongoing methadone or buprenorphine; treatment should be initiated as early as possible during pregnancy, with hospital transfer likely for appropriate management especially in the third trimester; opioid withdrawal risk should be treated with urgency and patients should be immediately transferred if the jail cannot initiate methadone or buprenorphine; care should be managed by providers experienced in obstetrical care and OUD with consultation or transfer if expertise is lacking and without delaying initiation or titration; pregnant patients should be counseled on the clear evidence of safety and efficacy of buprenorphine and methadone, and all staff should be educated on this evidence for preventing opioid withdrawal and treating OUD during pregnancy.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid-use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^240c57f6]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Peripartum pain and analgesic use among patients receiving MOUD: Pregnant people receiving methadone (n = 68) experienced more pain after vaginal delivery compared with controls, using 70% more opioid analgesics postpartum, and similar findings were observed in a cohort of n = 63 pregnant people receiving MOUD with buprenorphine. A retrospective cohort study comparing patients receiving MOUD with methadone versus buprenorphine found no significant differences in postcesarean analgesic use between the 2 groups, and there are no data or direct comparative evidence regarding differential effects of MOUD agents for pain and analgesia experiences in labor and delivery. Chronic exposure to opioids during pregnancy may also lead to opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, which in turn can make peripartum analgesia challenging, and patients recovering from OUD who are currently abstinent may desire strictly avoiding opioids in the peripartum period, whereas some argue that failure to provide adequate analgesia may lead to return to opioid use behaviors.
