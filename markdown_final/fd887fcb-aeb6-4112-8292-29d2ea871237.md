## Question

what does nitrates in a UA mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "nitrates" (i.e., nitrites) on dipstick urinalysis mean, including their biologic basis, diagnostic performance, pitfalls, population-specific nuances, and how to apply them in a guideline- and stewardship-conscious way. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the dipstick actually measures and the pathophysiology behind nitrites. Then, I should verify test performance characteristics and how pretest probability shapes predictive values. Next, I will interpret positive versus negative nitrites and account for false positives and false negatives. After that, I need to check population-specific performance and collection issues. Then, I should integrate nitrite with leukocyte esterase, microscopy, and possibly flow cytometry. Finally, I will align this with major guidelines and propose a practical algorithm while safeguarding against overtreatment and overculturing [^114CWdeL] [^1175DN7a].

> Let me first confirm the target: the dipstick detects nitrites, not nitrates, and this relies on nitrate-reductase–positive bacteria converting dietary urinary nitrate to nitrite during dwell time in the bladder, typically helped by a several-hour incubation such as an early-morning void, with Enterobacterales like Escherichia coli being common culprits; I should verify that non–nitrate-reducing organisms and short bladder dwell time blunt this signal, which is why nitrite can be absent despite infection [^117XeZs7] [^113uAgMS] [^113TqxMG].

> I should double-check the core operating characteristics: nitrite is highly specific but poorly sensitive, with large series showing specificity around 98.7% and sensitivity around 43.2%, meaning a positive nitrite rules in bacteriuria reliably but a negative nitrite cannot exclude UTI; meta-analyses and contemporary cohorts confirm that combining parameters improves rule-out, while positive predictive values vary with pretest probability and are notably poorer in older women, so I need to keep clinical context front and center [^111FUqvp] [^117R7Uff] [^1161SvQk] [^113NoEG5].

> Now, let me interpret a positive nitrite cautiously: because specificity is very high, a positive nitrite in a symptomatic patient strongly indicates a uropathogen burden and supports empiric treatment while culture is pending, with particularly high PPV in men and strong predictive value in pregnancy, but hold on, I should verify we do not treat asymptomatic bacteriuria or catheter-associated colonization solely on a dipstick signal to avoid overtreatment [^116C12Hu] [^111FPAyC] [^1175DN7a].

> Conversely, a negative nitrite does not exclude UTI, and I need to check for common explanations such as low bacterial counts, short dwell time, dilute urine, recent high fluid intake, or non–nitrate-reducing pathogens like Enterococcus or Staphylococcus saprophyticus; if clinical suspicion remains, I should pair nitrite with leukocyte esterase and microscopy, and send a urine culture as the diagnostic arbiter when appropriate, especially in children or higher-risk presentations [^117XeZs7] [^111FUqvp] [^1161SvQk] [^116bb7WC].

> But wait, population context matters: in pregnancy, nitrite remains highly specific with PPV near 85–90%, whereas in nursing home residents a negative dipstick (nitrite and leukocyte esterase) can be reassuring for ruling out in low-symptom contexts, in symptomatic men nitrite positivity is highly predictive of culture growth, while in febrile infants and young children nitrite sensitivity is too low to rely upon, and in older women overall UA performance for ruling in disease is suboptimal, so I should tailor decisions by group rather than assume uniform accuracy [^111FPAyC] [^113vEziY] [^116C12Hu] [^116bb7WC] [^113NoEG5].

> I should confirm factors that erode specificity and generate false positives: hyperbilirubinemia appears to increase the likelihood of spurious nitrite positivity and lower specificity, contamination from suboptimal collection can mislead, and although high dietary nitrate raises substrate availability, clinically meaningful false-positive nitrite from diet alone is uncommon in acute testing; when these risks are present, I need to verify with culture before committing to antibiotics [^114SK92t] [^117XeZs7] [^113TqxMG] [^1174z6T9] [^113271Xg].

> Next, I should review how nitrite integrates with other urinalysis components: combining nitrite with leukocyte esterase increases sensitivity and improves the negative likelihood ratio for ruling out UTI compared with either alone, while timely processing and microscopy for pyuria and bacteriuria refine accuracy; automated flow cytometry offers higher sensitivity and NPV compared with dipstick-only strategies, but practical availability varies, so I need to ensure prompt testing within a couple of hours or appropriate preservation to avoid degradation [^1161SvQk] [^117R7Uff] [^111FUqvp] [^117XeZs7] [^1146tnFP].

> Hold on, I should align with guidelines and stewardship: for acute cystitis, guidelines endorse dipstick testing and clinical diagnosis in straightforward cases, for suspected acute bacterial prostatitis nitrite and WBCs on dipstick inform empiric management, and for catheter-associated scenarios we must not use odorous or cloudy urine or dipstick alone to distinguish infection from asymptomatic bacteriuria; many systems use UA signals as reflex gates to culture to reduce unnecessary cultures, and in stone formers or complicated contexts, cultures are indicated when UA suggests infection or risk is high [^114CWdeL] [^115ngibR] [^1175DN7a] [^117Cf5Nn] [^115J9MxN] [^114REaDU].

> I will now examine practical decision points across common scenarios to ensure I am not overgeneralizing: in a symptomatic premenopausal woman with dysuria, a positive nitrite strongly supports empiric therapy, whereas a negative nitrite with absent pyuria makes UTI unlikely and warrants either watchful waiting or culture if symptoms persist or risk is elevated; in a febrile infant, whether nitrite is positive or negative, I need to obtain a catheterized specimen for urinalysis and culture given poor dipstick sensitivity; in early pregnancy, a positive nitrite is highly specific and should prompt timely treatment and culture given maternal-fetal risks; in catheterized patients, nitrite positivity does not distinguish CA-ASB from CA-UTI, so I must correlate with new localizing symptoms or systemic instability and culture appropriately [^114CWdeL] [^113NoEG5] [^1161SvQk] [^116bb7WC] [^113271Xg] [^111FPAyC] [^1175DN7a].

> Let me also verify collection and preanalytic variables so I do not misinterpret a good test poorly: midstream clean-catch specimens analyzed within two hours are preferred in ambulatory adults, first-morning voids increase nitrite yield by maximizing bladder dwell time, and in infants bagged specimens and certain catheterized samples have altered test performance and higher contamination, so I should interpret nitrite results through the lens of how the specimen was obtained and handled [^117XeZs7] [^111FUqvp] [^113271Xg] [^1146tnFP].

> I should double-check an important stewardship caveat: a positive nitrite in an asymptomatic patient, particularly in long-term care or neurogenic bladder, should not trigger antibiotics without supportive symptoms or signs, and some neuro-urology guidance advises against dipstick screening for UTI altogether in these populations to avoid harm from unnecessary treatment [^1175DN7a] [^113a4f66].

> Let me reconsider the overall message to ensure internal consistency: nitrite is best viewed as a rule-in signal when positive in a compatible clinical context, not as a rule-out when negative, it performs best when paired with leukocyte esterase and microscopy, and its clinical value improves when we honor population nuances, preanalytic quality, and guideline-based thresholds for culture and treatment while using UA as a gate for more selective culturing [^113NoEG5] [^117R7Uff] [^1161SvQk] [^117Cf5Nn].

> Final answer: Detectable urinary nitrites on dipstick imply the presence of nitrate-reducing bacteria at clinically meaningful loads and are highly specific for bacteriuria, so a positive result in a symptomatic patient strongly supports a UTI and can justify empiric therapy while culture is pending, whereas a negative nitrite does not exclude infection due to poor sensitivity and should be interpreted alongside leukocyte esterase, pyuria, microscopy, and the clinical picture, with population-specific adjustments, attention to specimen quality, and adherence to guideline- and stewardship-based pathways to avoid both missed infections and unnecessary antibiotics [^111FUqvp] [^114CWdeL] [^113NoEG5] [^1161SvQk] [^1175DN7a].

In urinalysis, nitrates are not clinically significant; the relevant test is **urine nitrites** [^117XeZs7], which reflect bacterial conversion of nitrates to nitrites [^113uAgMS] and suggest a Gram-negative UTI. A positive nitrite test is **highly specific** but **not very sensitive**, so a negative result does not rule out infection [^111FUqvp] [^117R7Uff] [^1161SvQk]. Confirm with **urine culture** [^116bb7WC] [^115J9MxN] and interpret results alongside leukocyte esterase and the clinical context [^114CWdeL] [^113NoEG5].

---

## Physiological basis of nitrite detection

- **Dietary nitrates**: Nitrates are commonly found in vegetables and are excreted in urine [^113TqxMG] [^1174z6T9].

- **Bacterial conversion**: Certain bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Proteus) reduce nitrates to nitrites via nitrate reductase [^113uAgMS].

- **Nitrite detection**: Dipsticks detect nitrites, not nitrates, indicating bacterial presence [^117XeZs7].

---

## Clinical significance of nitrites in urinalysis

- **Indicator of UTI**: Nitrites suggest Gram-negative bacterial infection [^117XeZs7] [^113271Xg].

- **Specificity and sensitivity**: High specificity (98.7%), low sensitivity (43.2%) [^111FUqvp] [^1173eXVD].

- **False negatives**: Short bladder incubation, low bacterial load, or non-nitrate-reducing bacteria [^117XeZs7].

- **False positives**: Contamination or prolonged storage [^117XeZs7] [^1146tnFP].

---

## Clinical implications and management

A positive nitrite test strongly suggests a Gram-negative UTI; **confirm with urine culture** [^116bb7WC] [^115J9MxN] and treat appropriately. A negative result does not exclude UTI; interpret in conjunction with leukocyte esterase, patient symptoms, and culture [^113NoEG5] [^114CWdeL].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Bacterial variability**: Not all bacteria reduce nitrates, limiting sensitivity [^113uAgMS].

- **Sample handling**: Timely analysis is critical; delays can alter results [^1146tnFP] [^117XeZs7].

- **Patient factors**: Diet, hydration, and medications can affect results [^113TqxMG] [^112u8TJ9].

---

In urinalysis, nitrates are not clinically significant; **nitrites indicate bacterial infection** and should be interpreted in clinical context and confirmed by culture.

### Performance of urinalysis tests and their ability in predicting results of urine cultures: A comparison between automated test strip analyser and flow cytometry in various subpopulations and types of samples [^111FUqvp]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Results of urinalysis are available earlier than urine culture results. If urinalysis can predict the results of culture, early decisions can be made on treatment and whether urine samples should be cultured. This study sought to compare the performance of urinalysis tests by automated test strip analyser (nitrite and leucocyte esterase) with flow cytometry (bacteria and white cell count) in different subpopulations and types of samples.

- **Methods**: Consecutive urine samples (n = 2351) from a population with a median age of 45 years, 37.2% men, were tested. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value (NPV) of the tests were calculated using contingency tables. The gold standard was a positive urine culture with a cut-off > 10⁵ CFU/mL.

- **Results**: Fourteen percent of the cultures were positive (95.6% monomicrobial, 74.7% Enterobacteriaceae). Overall, the nitrite test was the most specific (98.7%) but the least sensitive (43.2%). Bacteria count was the most sensitive (91.7%) and highly specific (87.5%). In infants < 24 months, the sensitivity of bacteria count was reduced (86.1%), but specificity was high (95.9%). The specificity of nitrite was reduced in urine from the in-and-out procedure (81.9%). The sensitivity of bacteria count was reduced in bag specimens urine (83.3%) and in urine from indwelling catheter (84.7%). All tests showed a high NPV. The NPV of the combined flow cytometry tests was higher than those of the automated test strip analyser (99.1% vs. 97.4%).

- **Conclusions**: Overall, the performance of urinalysis is excellent. Flow cytometry tests performed better in predicting the results of urine cultures.

### Is culture-positive urinary tract infection in febrile children accurately identified by urine dipstick or microanalysis [^116bb7WC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Fever from a urinary tract source remains the predominant etiology of serious bacterial infection in children ages 0–36 months. Urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosing a urinary tract infection (UTI); however, urine dipstick (UDip) and urine microanalysis (UA) are typically used in real time by emergency physicians to diagnose and treat UTIs, as cultures can take days to grow and be available. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the literature on the accuracy and utility of the UDip and UA in this pediatric population.

- **Methods**: A structured review of the medical literature was conducted to determine the accuracy of UDip and UA for the diagnosis of UTI in children before the result of the urine culture.

- **Results**: Upon comprehensive review and after applying predefined inclusion criteria, a total of 13 articles met the criteria, addressed the clinical question, and were reviewed in detail.

- **Conclusions**: The literature search did not conclusively identify any component of either the UDip or the UA that would allow a practitioner to definitively conclude that the source of an infant's fever is a UTI.

### Performance of urinalysis parameters in predicting urinary tract infection: Does one size fit all [^113NoEG5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

In a multihospital cohort study of 3,392 patients, positive urinalysis parameters demonstrated poor positive predictive value for diagnosing urinary tract infection (UTI). Combined urinalysis parameters, such as pyuria or nitrite, performed better than pyuria alone for ruling out UTI. However, the performance of all urinalysis parameters was poor in older women.

### Role of dipstick testing in the evaluation of urinary tract infection in nursing home residents [^113vEziY]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2007). Low credibility.

Among 101 nursing home residents with suspected urinary tract infection (UTI), we determined the negative predictive value of dipstick testing for leukocyte esterase and nitrite to be 100% (95% confidence interval, 74%-100%) compared with laboratory evidence of UTI (greater than 10 white blood cells/mm³ on urinalysis and greater than 100,000 colony-forming units/mL on urine culture). Nursing home dipstick testing effectively excluded the possibility of UTI.

### Pregnant patient in the emergency department: An observational investigation of predictive values of symptoms and lab measures in predicting culture confirmed urinary tract infection [^111FPAyC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Many women in their first trimester present to the Emergency Department (ED) for evaluation. Urinalysis is a common test performed on these patients to evaluate for possible urinary tract infections (UTIs). There are no clear results to determine if a patient requires antibiotics in the ED or should wait for the culture results before starting antibiotics.

We prospectively studied a convenience sample of 198 women in their first trimester of pregnancy who presented to a community ED. Standard symptoms and lab analyses were recorded and compared to subsequent urine culture results. We determined that no single symptom was significantly sensitive nor specific for ruling in or out a UTI.

Overall, the presence of nitrites was the most significant finding, with a specificity of 98.6%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 81.9%, and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 86.6%.

- **Symptoms and specificity**:
	- Dysuria had an 88% specificity.
	- Hematuria had a 93% specificity.
	- These findings performed well for predicting culture-positive UTIs but were not effective in ruling out the condition.

In conclusion, the diagnosis of a culture-confirmed UTI in the ED cannot be reliably predicted using symptomatology or lab values other than nitrates.

### Oxiconazole nitrate [^115fRZtC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

The following definitions were applied to the clinical and microbiological outcomes in patients enrolled in the clinical trials that form the basis for the approval of oxiconazole nitrate cream.

- **Mycological cure**: No evidence (culture and KOH preparation) of the baseline (original) pathogen in a specimen from the affected area taken at the 2-week post-treatment visit. For tinea (pityriasis) versicolor, mycological cure was limited to KOH only.

- **Treatment success**: Both a global evaluation of 90% clinical improvement and a microbiologic eradication, as described above, at the 2-week post-treatment visit.

There are no head-to-head comparison trials for the oxiconazole nitrate cream and lotion formulations in the treatment of tinea pedis. The two pivotal trials for the oxiconazole nitrate cream formulation involved 281 evaluable patients (total from both trials) with clinically and microbiologically established tinea pedis.

The improvement and cure rates of the b.i.d.- and q.d.-treated groups did not differ significantly (95% confidence interval) from each other but were statistically superior to the vehicle-treated group (95% confidence interval).

### Inorganic nitrate benefits contrast-induced nephropathy after coronary angiography for acute coronary syndromes: The NITRATE-CIN trial [^112bZYvC]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Statistical analysis

For our study calculations, we assumed a conservative CIN incidence of 12% in the control group, with a proposed reduction of 60% with inorganic nitrate. This reduction was based on preliminary data from the 80 STEMI patient NITRITE-AMI trial, where an acute intra-coronary bolus of sodium nitrite (10 µmol/L) was associated with an 80% reduction in CIN compared to patients who received placebo control. A total of 640 patients allowed for a power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05, while accounting for a 27% dropout rate for the primary endpoint.

All analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The statistical analysis plan (available with the protocol) was finalized before unblinding the trial group assignments. Data are presented as mean values with standard deviations or median values with interquartile ranges. The primary outcome of CIN was analyzed using logistic regression, with estimates made unadjusted and adjusted for diabetes status and creatinine level at baseline. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed on primary outcomes by incorporating and testing interaction terms in the models. Analyses of secondary outcomes were not adjusted for multiplicity. Differences in secondary outcomes between trial groups were estimated using linear regression for continuous outcomes and logistic regression for binary outcomes, with and without adjustment for diabetes status and creatinine level at baseline. Assumptions made for each model were tested and deemed not to be violated. Secondary endpoints are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

### Comparison of test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various test cutoff points [^1173eXVD]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

We compare the test characteristics of urine dipstick and urinalysis at various cutoff points in women presenting to emergency departments and an intermediate care center with symptoms of urinary tract infection.

- **Methods**: This prospective, observational study included adult women presenting to one of two community hospital EDs or an intermediate care center with dysuria, urgency, urinary frequency, suprapubic tenderness, or costovertebral angle tenderness. Exclusions were patients who had recently taken antibiotics, had indwelling Foley catheters, symptomatic vaginal discharge, diabetes mellitus, immunodeficiency disorders, or who were unable to provide a reliable history. Clean-catch or catheterized urine specimens were tested immediately by a nurse using a Multistix 9 SG reagent strip. A second aliquot was sent to the hospital laboratory within 1 hour for semiautomated microscopic urinalysis and urine culture. A positive urine culture was defined as more than 100,000 colonies of one or two uropathogenic bacteria per mL of urine at 48 hours. Dipstick and urinalysis data were compared with urine culture results. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were calculated for various "test cutoff points" for combinations of leukocyte esterase, nitrite, and blood on dipstick, and for RBCs and WBCs on urinalyses. The probability of an erroneous decision to withhold treatment based on a negative test result was defined as "undertreatment".

### Reproducibility of nitrate-stimulated tilt testing in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope and a healthy control group [^117TMhy3]. American Heart Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Nitrate-stimulated tilt testing may be used to diagnose vasovagal syncope or to guide therapy. At the time of writing, the reproducibility of the test in patients with clinically suspected vasovagal syncope and healthy controls is undetermined. A high reproducibility is a prerequisite for correct interpretation of the test result. This study investigates the reproducibility of a nitrate-stimulated tilt test in patients with clinically suspected vasovagal syncope and a healthy control group.

- **Methods and results**: We studied 43 patients (24 women, 19 men) with a typical history of vasovagal syncope and 18 healthy controls (3 women, 15 men). We used a combined tilt protocol with a 30-minute passive and 15-minute nitrate-stimulated phase. The second tilt test was performed 16 ± 12 days after the first. In both patients and controls, overall positive tilt responses were reproduced in the second test in 100%. In contrast to this, the reproducibility of an overall negative test was 50% in patients but 93% in controls. Overall hemodynamic responses to tilt were reproducible in 80%.

Nitrate-stimulated tilt testing in both patients with suspected vasovagal syncope and controls has an excellent reproducibility of positive results but a moderate reproducibility of negative results. Importantly, these results are still valid at a repeat interval of 2 weeks and longer. These data suggest that in patients with suspected vasovagal syncope, a nitrate-stimulated tilt test may provide a suitable tool to evaluate the efficacy of a therapeutic approach.

### Plasma nitrate and incidence of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in the community: The Framingham offspring study [^114XK42R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Plasma nitrate is frequently considered a measure of the individual's overall exposure to nitrate derived from various individual (patho-) physiological pathways and exogenous (i.e. dietary) sources, as well as the individual's capacity to eliminate nitrate. Dietary intake of nitrate in the United States is commonly estimated to range between 40 and 100 mg/d, but may exceed 1200 mg with specific diets or dietary supplements. High doses of nitrate may be required to significantly increase the plasma nitrate concentration. In adults, a low (≈35 mg/d of nitrate for a person of 70 kg) or high (≈133 mg/d of nitrate for a person of 70 kg) nitrate diet did not induce clinically relevant fluctuations or differences in the plasma nitrate concentration. However, specific nitrate-enriched diets or intake of dietary supplements corresponding to nitrate doses above 300 mg may lead to significant fluctuations and increases in plasma nitrate, with peak concentrations reached after ≈1 to 3.0 hours. Urinary nitrate excretion usually exceeds dietary intake, indicating a significant endogenous nitrate formation rate. Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis has been identified as the major endogenous source of nitrite and nitrate. However, NO is highly reactive and has a short half-life in vivo, which precludes its measurement outside of experimental settings. Free NO reacts within seconds to form nitrite (NO₂⁻), which, in turn, rapidly reacts to form nitrate (NO₃⁻).

### Nitroglycerin: nitro-bid [^116dDRQ8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during the metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients completely lacking cytochrome b5 reductase activity, and even when assuming that the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are fully applied to the oxidation of hemoglobin, approximately 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before any of these patients manifests clinically significant (≥ 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should require even larger doses of nitroglycerin. In one study where 36 patients underwent 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at doses of 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr, the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%. This was comparable to levels observed in parallel patients who received a placebo.

Nevertheless, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia associated with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients were thought to be unusually susceptible.

Methemoglobin levels can be obtained from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be considered in patients who exhibit signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and arterial pO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change upon exposure to air.

When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, administered intravenously at 1–2 mg/kg.

### The urine dipstick test useful to rule out infections. A meta-analysis of the accuracy [^117R7Uff]. BMC Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Many studies have evaluated the accuracy of dipstick tests as rapid detectors of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections (UTIs). The lack of an adequate explanation for the heterogeneity of dipstick accuracy stimulates ongoing debate. The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize the available evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of the urine dipstick test, taking into account various predefined potential sources of heterogeneity.

- **Methods**: Literature from 1990 through 1999 was searched in Medline and Embase, and through reference tracking. Selected publications addressed the diagnosis of bacteriuria or urinary tract infections, investigated the use of dipstick tests for nitrites and/or leukocyte esterase, and presented empirical data. A checklist was used to assess methodological quality.

- **Results**: Seventy publications were included. The accuracy of nitrites was high in pregnant women (Diagnostic Odds Ratio = 165) and elderly people (DOR = 108). Positive predictive values were ≥ 80% in elderly patients and in family medicine. The accuracy of leukocyte esterase was high in studies involving urology patients (DOR = 276), with sensitivities highest in family medicine (86%). Negative predictive values were high for both tests across all patient groups and settings, except in family medicine. The combination of both test results significantly increased sensitivity. Accuracy was high in studies involving urology patients (DOR = 52), children (DOR = 46), and if clinical information was present (DOR = 28). Sensitivity was highest in studies conducted in family med.

### SPL drug information for sulconazole nitrate [^113v7jfX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

The drug sulconazole nitrate is an antifungal agent used for the treatment of certain fungal infections. Its mechanism of action involves inhibiting the biosynthesis of ergosterol, an essential component of fungal cell membranes. This inhibition disrupts the structural integrity of the membrane, leading to cell death. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of sulconazole nitrate in managing skin conditions such as tinea pedis (athlete's foot), tinea cruris (jock itch), and tinea corporis (ringworm).

Sulconazole nitrate is typically administered topically in a cream formulation, allowing direct application to affected areas. Patients are advised to follow the prescribed dosing regimen to achieve optimal therapeutic outcomes. The safety profile of sulconazole nitrate is well-documented, with minimal adverse effects reported. Common side effects may include mild skin irritation or itching at the application site. However, these are generally transient and resolve without the need for discontinuation of therapy.

Healthcare professionals should counsel patients on the importance of adherence to treatment and the potential need for follow-up to assess response and adjust therapy as necessary. Additionally, healthcare providers must evaluate the patient's history and any concurrent medications to prevent drug interactions.

### Caution - not all UTIs are the same [^1143DosV]. Nature Reviews Urology (2025). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are one of the most common infections, accounting for approximately 400 million diagnoses per year worldwide. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections (uUTIs) occur in healthy individuals with no structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary system and primarily affect women. Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) are a type of complicated UTI affecting patients who have a urinary catheter in place, often hospitalized patients or patients with conditions that prevent them from urinating naturally. Both infections share common symptoms, diagnostics, and treatment options but differ greatly in pathophysiology, aetiology, risk factors, and comorbidities. These differences could explain why antibiotic treatments, which generally lead to positive outcomes in patients with uUTIs, often fail in patients with CAUTIs. Understanding these differences could guide evidence-based insights into why treatments for CAUTIs should be different from those for uUTIs, specifically by modifying catheters, which initiate the damage-induced segue for UTIs.

### Evaluation of the nitrite and leukocyte esterase activity tests for the diagnosis of acute symptomatic urinary tract infection in men [^116C12Hu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

For 422 male patients with symptoms indicative of a urinary tract infection, nitrite and leukocyte esterase activity dipstick test results were compared with the results of culture of urine samples. The positive predictive value of a positive nitrite test result was 96%. The addition of results from the leukocyte esterase test did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the nitrite test.

### Food sources of nitrates and nitrites: The physiologic context for potential health benefits [^113TqxMG]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of nitrates and nitrites in food is associated with an increased risk of gastrointestinal cancer and, in infants, methemoglobinemia. Despite their physiologic roles in vascular and immune function, consideration of food sources of nitrates and nitrites as healthful dietary components has received little attention. Approximately 80% of dietary nitrates are derived from vegetable consumption. Sources of nitrites include vegetables, fruits, and processed meats. Nitrites are produced endogenously through the oxidation of nitric oxide and via the reduction of nitrate by commensal bacteria in the mouth and gastrointestinal tract.

The dietary provision of nitrates and nitrites from vegetables and fruits may contribute to the blood pressure-lowering effects of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. We quantified nitrate and nitrite concentrations by HPLC in a convenience sample of foods. By incorporating these values into two hypothetical dietary patterns emphasizing either high-nitrate or low-nitrate vegetable and fruit choices based on the DASH diet, we found that nitrate concentrations in these patterns vary from 174 to 1222 mg. The hypothetical high-nitrate DASH diet pattern exceeds the World Health Organization's Acceptable Daily Intake for nitrate by 550% for a 60-kg adult.

These data call into question the rationale for recommendations to limit nitrate and nitrite consumption from plant foods; thus, a comprehensive reevaluation of the health effects of food sources of nitrates and nitrites is appropriate.

### Nitrate, nitrite and nitric oxide reductases: from the last universal common ancestor to modern bacterial pathogens [^113uAgMS]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

The electrochemical gradient that ensues from the enzymatic activity of cytochromes, such as nitrate reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and quinol oxidase, contributes to the bioenergetics of the bacterial cell. Reduction of nitrogen oxides by bacterial pathogens can, however, be uncoupled from proton translocation and the biosynthesis of ATP or NH4(+), but still linked to quinol and NADH oxidation. Ancestral nitric oxide reductases, as well as cytochrome c oxidases and quinol bo oxidases evolved from the former, are capable of binding and detoxifying nitric oxide to nitrous oxide. The NO-metabolizing activity associated with these cytochromes can be a sizable source of antinitrosative defense in bacteria during their associations with host cells. Nitrosylation of terminal cytochromes arrests respiration, reprograms bacterial metabolism, stimulates antioxidant defenses, and alters antibiotic cytotoxicity.

Collectively, the bioenergetics and regulation of redox homeostasis that accompany the utilization of nitrogen oxides and detoxification of nitric oxide by cytochromes of the electron transport chain increase the fitness of many Gram-positive and -negative pathogens during their associations with invertebrate and vertebrate hosts.

### Interleukin-6 concentrations in the urine and dipstick analyses were related to bacteriuria but not symptoms in the elderly: A cross sectional study of 421 nursing home residents [^111mDhRb]. BMC Geriatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Urine dipsticks were analyzed for nitrite and leukocyte esterase in urine specimens from 408 out of 421 residents. Urine dipstick analyses were not performed in 13 out of 421 residents, mostly due to insufficient urine volume. Among all residents, regardless of bacteriuria or not, 26% (106/408) of nitrite dipsticks were positive and 22% (90/408) of leukocyte esterase dipsticks were ≥ 3 +.

Leukocyte esterase dipsticks ≥ 3 + were more common (p < 10⁻⁶) among residents with significant growth of bacteria in the urine; 46% (61/132) versus 11% (29/276) in residents with negative urine cultures. Positive nitrite dipsticks were more common (p < 10⁻⁶) among residents with positive urine cultures; 64% (84/132) versus 8.0% (22/276) in residents with negative urine cultures.

- **Symptoms, bacteriuria, and antibiotic treatments**: The prevalence of new or increased symptoms, occurring during the last month and still present when urine specimens were obtained, is presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences in the proportion of positive urine cultures among those with or without nonspecific symptoms. However, there were fewer positive urine cultures among residents with urinary frequency. Residents with some of the symptoms had a higher prevalence of antibiotic treatments during the last month.

### Miconazole nitrate [^111gVnUA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back.

- **For best results**: Be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better very quickly. Avoid sexual intercourse if your doctor advises you to do so. The suppository formulation (not the cream) may damage the diaphragm. Therefore, use of the diaphragm during therapy with the suppository is not recommended. Consult your physician.

- **If your partner experiences symptoms**: If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection.

- **Using medication during menstruation**: You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external sanitary pads or napkins until you have finished your medication or if the vaginal medication leaks.

- **Maintaining dryness**: Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast.

- **Hygiene practices**: Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) following a bowel movement. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so, as douching may disturb the vaginal balance. Don't scratch if you can help it, as scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection.

- **Medication interactions and diet**: Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking, as certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health.

### Origin of nitrite and nitrate in nasal and exhaled breath condensate and relation to nitric oxide formation [^114BjRiV]. Thorax (2005). Low credibility.

Raised concentrations of nitrate and nitrite have been found in exhaled breath condensate (EBC) in airway disease, and it has been postulated that this reflects increased nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. However, the chemical and anatomical origin of nitrate and nitrite in the airways has not yet been sufficiently studied.

- **Methods**: The fraction of exhaled NO at an exhalation flow rate of 50 ml/s (FE(NO)) and nitrite and nitrate in EBC, nasal condensate, and saliva were measured in 17 tracheostomised and 15 non-tracheostomised subjects, all of whom were non-smokers without respiratory disease. Tracheal and oral samples were taken from the tracheostomised subjects, and nasal (during velum closure) and oral samples from the non-tracheostomised subjects. Measurements were performed before and after sodium nitrate ingestion (10 mg/kg) and use of antibacterial mouthwash (chlorhexidine 0.2%).

- **Results**: In tracheostomised subjects, oral FE(NO) increased by 90% (p < 0.01), while tracheal FE(NO) was not affected 60 minutes after nitrate ingestion. Oral EBC nitrite levels increased 23-fold at 60 minutes (p < 0.001), whereas the nitrite levels in tracheal EBC showed only a minor increase (fourfold, p < 0.05). Nitrate increased the same amount in oral and tracheal EBC at 60 minutes (2.5-fold, p < 0.05). In non-tracheostomised subjects, oral FE(NO) and EBC nitrite increased after nitrate ingestion and, after chlorhexidine mouthwash, they approached baseline levels again (p < 0.001). Nasal NO, nitrate, and nitrite were not affected by nitrate intake or mouthwash. At baseline, mouthwash reduced oral nitrite and nitrate levels back to pre-ingestion values.

### Urine trouble: Should we think differently about UTI [^115iUiqd]. International Urogynecology Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically important, given that it is one of the most common bacterial infections in adult women. However, the understanding of UTI remains based on a now disproven concept that the urinary bladder is sterile. Thus, standards for UTI diagnosis have significant limitations that may reduce the opportunity to improve patient care. Using data from our work and numerous other peer-reviewed studies, we identified four major limitations to the contemporary UTI description:

- **The language of UTI**: Current terminology may not accurately reflect the complexities and variations in UTI types.
- **UTI diagnostic testing**: The limitations of current tests may lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis.
- **The Escherichia coli-centric view of UTI**: Overemphasis on Escherichia coli may overlook other potential pathogens.
- **The colony-forming units (CFU) threshold-based diagnosis**: This traditional method could miss infections or over-diagnose when not appropriately contextualized.

Contemporary methods and technology, combined with continued rigorous clinical research, can be used to correct these limitations.

### Urinalysis: A comprehensive review [^117XeZs7]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often results from precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria can also be the cause. A strong odor may result from a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life-threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria can often be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### Diagnostic stewardship cutoffs for urinalysis results prior to performing a urine culture: Analysis of data from a healthcare system [^117Cf5Nn]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2025). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections are commonly overdiagnosed. To minimize overdiagnosis, some laboratories utilize reflex algorithms that use urinalyses as preliminary screening before potentially proceeding to urine culture. However, the optimal urinalysis cutoffs for this diagnostic stewardship intervention remain poorly defined.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis from 2/1/21 to 1/31/23 in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services healthcare system. We examined patient encounters in which urinalysis was ordered synchronously with a urine culture. We categorized urine culture isolates as uropathogens or non-uropathogens. We calculated receiver operating characteristic curves of urinalysis parameters' ability, singularly or in combination, to identify uropathogens.

- **Results**: Among 80,949 paired urinalysis and urine cultures (17,488 inpatient, 20,716 emergency department, 42,745 outpatient), cultures yielded 35% (n = 28,993) uropathogens, 4% (n = 2,960) non-uropathogens, 37% (n = 29,951) contaminants, and 24% (n = 19,045) no growth. Among urinalysis parameters, white blood cells (WBCs) had the highest diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.722, [95% CI 0.718–0.725]), followed by leukocyte esterase (AUC = 0.700, [95% CI 0.690–0.701]), bacteria (AUC = 0.673, [95% CI 0.670–0.677]), nitrite (AUC = 0.627, [95% CI 0.625–0.630]), and squamous epithelial cells (AUC = 0.530, [95% CI 0.526–0.534]). WBC AUC values were consistent across healthcare settings (outpatient, emergency department, and inpatient).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, specifically with respect to urine tests, the EAU 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a urinalysis with the following measurements in patients with stones of unknown composition:

- **pH measurement**: Ensures proper acid-base balance in urine.

- **Dipstick test**: Checks for leukocytes, erythrocytes, and nitrites, indicating potential infection or inflammation.

- **Protein and specific weight**: Helps evaluate kidney function and urine concentration.

- **Urine cultures**: Identifies microbial presence that may imply infection.

- **Microscopy of urinary sediment**: Conducted on morning urine to check for crystals, cells, or bacteria.

- **Cyanide nitroprusside test**: Used for cystine exclusion, important in diagnosing cystinuria.

### A randomized clinical trial of the effects of leafy green vegetables and inorganic nitrate on blood pressure [^1174z6T9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

Plasma and urinary nitrate and nitrite levels were assessed to understand the impact of dietary interventions. Baseline levels of nitrate and nitrite in plasma and urine were similar across all three intervention groups. After the intervention, plasma nitrate levels increased significantly in the potassium nitrate and leafy green vegetables groups (P = 0.99). However, plasma nitrite concentrations showed a significant increase only in the potassium nitrate group (P = 0.048) and not in the leafy green vegetables group (P = 0.115). Consistent with the plasma nitrate results, 24-hour urinary excretion of nitrate also increased (P = 0.99). The excreted nitrate was consistent with the given doses in the potassium nitrate group and leafy green vegetables group at 254 and 303 mg, respectively, indicating endogenous recycling of bioactive NO and nitrite back to nitrate. Salivary nitrate and nitrite levels increased significantly (P < 0.0001) in the groups receiving nitrate and remained unchanged in the placebo group. Postintervention effects on nitrate and nitrite levels in plasma, saliva, and urine are further detailed in Supplemental Figure 1.

### Intravesical nitric oxide production discriminates between classic and nonulcer interstitial cystitis [^115GTzvD]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is one of the most bothersome conditions in urological practice. There are two subtypes, classic and nonulcer IC, with similar symptoms but different outcomes concerning clinical course and response to treatment. Histologically, there are fundamental differences between the two subtypes. Classic IC presents a severe abnormality of the urothelium and characteristic inflammatory cell infiltrates, whereas inflammation is scant in nonulcer IC. Regulation of urinary nitric oxide synthase activity has been proposed to be of importance for immunological responses in IC. We present evidence of a profound difference between the two subtypes concerning nitric oxide production, mirroring the differences in inflammatory response in IC.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 17 patients with both subtypes and active disease, as well as patients with disease in remission, were included in the study. All were diagnosed according to National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases criteria. Luminal nitric oxide was measured in the bladders of patients using a chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyzer.

- **Results**: All patients with classic IC had high levels of nitric oxide (NO). None of the other patients had any significant increase in NO levels in the bladder. The NO level in patients with classic IC was not related to symptoms but rather to the assignment to this specific subgroup of IC. The highest levels of NO were found in patients in the initial phase of classic IC.

- **Conclusions**: The difference in NO evaporation between classic and nonulcer IC allows for subtyping.

### Diagnosis, evaluation and follow-up of asymptomatic microhematuria (AMH) in adults: AUA guideline [^115cQW3R]. The Journal of Urology (2012). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for asymptomatic microhematuria" is a tool designed to identify patients with asymptomatic microhematuria, a condition that can be an early indicator of serious urologic disease. This tool is particularly useful in primary care settings, where early detection can facilitate timely referral for further diagnostic evaluation and treatment.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of three or more red blood cells per high-power field in a properly collected urinary specimen, and the exclusion of an obvious benign cause. The diagnostic criteria are met if both these conditions are fulfilled. The presence of red blood cells in the urine is a key indicator of microhematuria, while the exclusion of benign causes helps to rule out conditions that may cause similar symptoms but do not require further urologic evaluation.

The result is determined based on these two components. If both conditions are met, the diagnostic criteria for asymptomatic microhematuria are fulfilled. If either condition is not met, the diagnostic criteria are not fulfilled, suggesting that the patient's symptoms may be due to a different cause. This tool thus aids in the accurate diagnosis of asymptomatic microhematuria, enabling appropriate management and treatment of the condition.

The diagnostic criteria for asymptomatic microhematuria are evaluated by considering two essential conditions related to urine analysis:

- **Presence of red blood cells**: A properly collected urinary specimen must show three or more red blood cells per high-power field.
- **Exclusion of benign causes**: It is crucial to exclude any obvious benign cause that could account for the presence of red blood cells, ensuring the necessity for further urologic evaluation.

### Diagnostic accuracy of dipsticks for urinary tract infections in acutely hospitalised patients: a prospective population-based observational cohort study [^111dR8Fc]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

In the study population of 1052 patients examined by a dipstick, a classic UTI symptom was present at admission among 184/1052 (17%) patients. The type of urine sample was not reported in 860/1052 (81%), from a newly placed urinary catheter in 111/1052 (11%), from a permanent urinary catheter in 79/1052 (8%), and 'other' in 2/1052 (0.2%). The indication for dipstick analysis was not reported in the electronic medical records in 632/1052 (60%) of patients. In the remaining patients, the attending physician explicitly listed suspected UTI or unknown infection as indications in 393/1052 (37%), suspected gross haematuria or kidney stones in 13/1052 (1%), proteinuria in 7/1052 (0.7%), and ketoacidosis in 3/1052 (0.3%). Overall, dipsticks were interpreted as 'probable UTI' in about half of patients with a strong reaction for LE, nitrite, or both.

Urine cultures were carried out in 609/1052 (58%) of which 272/609 (45%) were positive. Escherichia coli was the most commonly identified bacterium and was found in 139/272 (51%) of cultured urine samples. The proportions with significant bacteriuria did not differ noticeably between patients with or without specific symptoms of UTI, dementia, confusion, a history of fever, and in those with symptoms from other organ systems than the genitourinary tract.

The mCDC criteria of UTI were fulfilled by 89/1052 (8%) of patients. In contrast, a final clinical diagnosis of UTI was assigned by the attending physician in 155/1052 (15%) patients.

### Review on uraemic solutes II — variability in reported concentrations: causes and consequences [^115npyAL]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this manuscript is to initiate a constructive discussion about deviations in measured concentrations of uraemic solutes; these deviations, if not perceived or handled appropriately, may lead to incorrect interpretations of the pathophysiological role of uraemic solutes and/or to erroneous therapeutic decisions. To achieve an objective approach towards this problem, variability analysis of reported concentrations may be helpful. Striking outliers should either be discarded or considered alongside other values that are more consistent with the majority of reported data.

### Is there a link between hyperbilirubinemia and elevated urine nitrite [^114SK92t]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to determine whether hyperbilirubinemia affects the association between a positive urine nitrite test and a positive urine culture.

- **Methods**: We conducted an institutional review board-approved, retrospective review of 12 months of patient data, compiling information for patients having urinalysis, urine culture, and total serum bilirubin. Patients were divided into three groups according to total serum bilirubin: less than 1.5 mg/dL, 1.5 to 3.0 mg/dL, and greater than 3.0 mg/dL. The point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the sensitivity, specificity, false-positive proportion (proportion of false positives to all positive tests), and other test characteristics of urine nitrite as an indicator of urinary tract infection were calculated and tested for trend as a function of the three total serum bilirubin ranges.

- **Results**: Three thousand one hundred seventy-four patients met our study criteria. Specificity of the nitrite test decreased as a function of increasing total serum bilirubin (0.974, 0.966, and 0.855 for the three total bilirubin levels, respectively) with a significant trend (P < 0.05). Additionally, when total serum bilirubin was greater than 3.0 mg/dL, it was approximately four times more likely that a positive urine nitrite test would be a "false positive" (i.e. nitrite).

### Nitro-time [^115NDm4m]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Nitrate ions liberated during the metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients completely lacking cytochrome b reductase activity and assuming the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are quantitatively applied to hemoglobin oxidation, about 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin is required before clinically significant (≥ 10%) methemoglobinemia manifests. In patients with normal reductase function, more substantial doses of nitroglycerin should be necessary to produce significant methemoglobin.

In one study, 36 patients received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr. The average methemoglobin level was measured at 0.2%, comparable to levels observed in parallel patients who received a placebo. However, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients were thought to be unusually susceptible. Methemoglobin levels can be tested in most clinical laboratories. Suspect a diagnosis in patients showing signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and arterial pO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is chocolate brown, without color change upon exposure to air.

When methemoglobinemia is diagnosed, the treatment of choice is methylene blue, administered intravenously at 1 to 2 mg/kg.

### Isosorbide mononitrate [^115k2ECY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Methemoglobinemia has been reported in patients receiving other organic nitrates, and it could potentially occur as a side effect of isosorbide mononitrate. Nitrate ions liberated during the metabolism of isosorbide mononitrate can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients completely lacking cytochrome b5 reductase activity, approximately 2 mg/kg of isosorbide mononitrate would be required before any of these patients show clinically significant (≥ 10%) methemoglobinemia. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin would require even larger doses of isosorbide mononitrate. In one study involving 36 patients who received 2 to 4 weeks of continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 mg to 4.4 mg/hr (equivalent to 7.8 mg to 11.1 mg of isosorbide mononitrate per hour in total administered dose of nitrate ions), the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%, comparable to that in parallel patients who received placebo.

Despite these observations, there are case reports of significant methemoglobinemia associated with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients were considered unusually susceptible.

Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients who show signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial pO2.

### When should a new test become the current reference standard [^1179B8zu]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The evaluation of claims that a new diagnostic test is better than the gold standard test is hindered by the lack of a perfect reference judge. However, this problem may be sidestepped by focusing on the clinical consequences of the decision rather than on the estimation of accuracy. Consequences can be assessed by using a "fair umpire" test that is not perfect yet can discriminate between disease and non-disease cases and is not biased in favor of one test.

This article discusses three principles to aid judgments about the value of new tests:

- **Examination of consequences**: The consequences are best examined in cases with disagreement between the gold standard and new tests.
- **Resolving disagreements**: Resolving these disagreements requires a fair, but not necessarily perfect, umpire test.
- **Umpire tests and consequences**: Umpire tests include consequences, such as prognosis and response to treatment, as well as causal exposures and other test results.

### Comparison and interpretation of urinalysis performed by a nephrologist versus a hospital-based clinical laboratory [^113TDCbP]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Urinalysis (UA) is considered the most important laboratory test in evaluating patients with kidney disease. Anecdotally, we have observed differences between results of UA performed by nephrologists compared with those performed by certified medical technologists or clinical laboratory scientists that could affect a clinician's diagnosis. Whether there are differences between UA performed by the clinical laboratory and that performed by a nephrologist was determined, and the accuracy of diagnosis based on interpretation of the UA was compared.

- **Methods**: Urine samples were obtained from 26 patients with acute renal failure (ARF). An aliquot of urine was sent to the clinical laboratory for UA. Nephrologist A, blinded to the patient's clinical information, performed a UA on the other aliquot of urine, generated a report, and assigned the most likely diagnosis for ARF based on UA findings. Nephrologist B, also blinded to the clinical information, reviewed nephrologist A's UA reports and assigned a diagnosis for ARF to each report. Nephrologists A and B both assigned a diagnosis (or diagnoses) for the ARF based on laboratory UA results. These four sets of diagnoses were compared with those assigned by the consult nephrologists.

- **Results**: Nephrologist A correctly diagnosed the cause of ARF in 24 of 26 samples (92.3% success rate) based on his performance of the UA. Diagnoses by nephrologists A and B, based on their review of the clinical laboratory UA report, were correct in only 23.1% and 19.2% of the samples, respectively. Accuracy of diagnosis for nephrologist B improved.

### Can urine clarity exclude the diagnosis of urinary tract infection [^116QGkH8]. Pediatrics (2000). Low credibility.

To determine the association of clear urine by visual inspection with the absence of significant bacteruria, and to compare it with standard urinalysis, a study was conducted in the emergency department of Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio. It was a prospective, convenience sample of children with urine cultures indicating a colony-forming unit (CFU) count of ≥ 10⁴ CFU/mL of a urinary pathogen if obtained by catheterization, and ≥ 10⁵ CFU/mL if obtained by midstream.

Samples were obtained from 159 patients ranging in age from 4 weeks to 19 years. Females comprised 77% of the patients. One hundred ten of the samples (69%) were clear to visual inspection. There were a total of 29 positive cultures; however, 3 were in children with clear urine. The finding of clear urine on visual inspection had a negative predictive value of 97.3%. These results were similar to those obtained with standard urinalysis.

In conclusion, while clear urine on visual inspection cannot completely eliminate the possibility of a urinary tract infection in a child, it is a reproducible test that offers advantages in being simple to conduct.

### Nitro-dur [^1138jVr7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Methemoglobinemia: Nitrate ions liberated during the metabolism of nitroglycerin can oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients completely lacking cytochrome b5 reductase activity and assuming the nitrate moieties of nitroglycerin are fully applied to the oxidation of hemoglobin, approximately 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin should be required before clinical manifestations of significant (310%) methemoglobinemia appear. In patients with normal reductase function, significant production of methemoglobin should necessitate even larger doses of nitroglycerin.

In one study, 36 patients received continuous nitroglycerin therapy at 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr for 2 to 4 weeks; the average methemoglobin level measured was 0.2%, comparable to that observed in parallel patients who received a placebo. Despite these observations, case reports exist of significant methemoglobinemia associated with moderate overdoses of organic nitrates. None of the affected patients were considered unusually susceptible.

Methemoglobin levels are available from most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients exhibiting signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and adequate arterial PO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown, without color change when exposed to air.

Methemoglobinemia should be treated with methylene blue if the patient develops cardiac or CNS effects of hypoxia. The initial dose is 1 to 2 mg/kg, infused intravenously over 5 minutes.

### Mesnex [^112CTDSo]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **5.4 Laboratory test interferences**:

- **False-positive urine tests for ketone bodies**: A false-positive test for urinary ketones may arise in patients treated with Mesnex when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests, including dipstick tests. The addition of glacial acetic acid can differentiate between a false positive result, which appears as a cherry-red color that fades, and a true positive result, which appears as a red-violet color that intensifies.

- **False-negative tests for enzymatic CPK activity**: Mesnex may interfere with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that use a thiol compound, such as N-acetylcysteine, for CPK reactivation. This interference may result in a falsely low CPK level.

- **False-positive tests for ascorbic acid**: Mesnex may cause false-positive reactions in Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests for ascorbic acid.

- **5.5 Use in patients with a history of adverse reactions to thiol compounds**:

Mesnex is a thiol compound, meaning it contains a sulfhydryl (SH) group. Hypersensitivity reactions to mesna and to amifostine, another thiol compound, have been reported. It is not clear whether patients who experienced an adverse reaction to a thiol compound are at increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to Mesnex.

### Association of urinary nitrate with diabetes complication and disease-specific mortality among adults with hyperglycemia [^1126bzxd]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

**Sensitivity analysis**: Four sets of sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the association between urinary nitrate and diabetes complications, disease-specific and all-cause mortality. In set 1, participants who had a follow-up period of less than 2 years were excluded to assess the impact of acute illness or accident on results. In set 2, participants who had extreme values (> 99% and/or < 1%) of urinary creatinine, perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate were excluded. In set 3, corrected urinary perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate values were calculated by dividing by urinary creatinine, which was further used in the statistical model to exclude the impact of urine dilution on the results. In set 4, we evaluated whether age, gender, BMI, smoking, and drinking had a modification effect on these relationships.

### ASN guidelines on P values [^111d4hQZ]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2022). Low credibility.

To illustrate this point, consider a similar problem in clinical practice: a physician reports to a patient that the result of her diagnostic test was positive. When the patient asks whether the test result could be wrong, she would be poorly served with an answer that the test is highly specific (i.e.g.iven the absence of disease, it is very unlikely that the test result is positive). The patient's primary interest concerns the question: Given that my test result is positive, what is the probability of truly having the disease? This positive predictive value depends not only on specificity but also on sensitivity and the a priori probability of disease.

A clinician weighs the evidence of a test result in view of her combined understanding of the biology of the disease, patient characteristics, and the pre-test probability of disease. That is why the interpretation is not left to the laboratory technician. Similarly, statistically significant results should be interpreted taking the prior expectation and plausibility of the null hypothesis into account. By intuition, people usually get this right. For example, consider a trial report with a statistically significant benefit obtained with a homeopathic, super-diluted remedy. People who do not believe in homeopathy are unlikely to believe the test results. Statistical testing is like interpreting a diagnostic test result by looking only at its specificity — that is, under the null hypothesis of no disease. Interpretation of statistical tests should also take into account the plausibility or likelihood of the alternative hypothesis.

### Urinary nitrate concentration as a marker for kidney transplant rejection [^111FvRdm]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Early identification and treatment of kidney transplant rejection episodes are vital to limit the loss of function and prolong the life of the transplanted kidney and recipient. Current practice depends on detecting a rise in creatinine levels. A biomarker that can diagnose transplant rejection earlier than traditional practices or inform earlier decision-making to perform a biopsy could be transformative.

It has previously been shown that urinary nitrate concentration is elevated in cases of renal transplant rejection. Nitrate is a nitric oxide (NO) oxidation product. Transplant rejection upregulates NO synthesis via inducible nitric oxide synthase, leading to elevations in urinary nitrate concentration. We have recently validated a urinary nitrate concentration assay that could provide results in a clinically relevant timeframe. Our aim was to determine whether urinary nitrate concentration is a useful tool to predict renal transplant rejection in the context of contemporary clinical practice.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective observational study, recruiting renal transplant participants over an 18-month period. We made no alterations to the patients' clinical care, including medications, immunosuppression, diet, and frequency of visits. We collected urine samples from every clinical attendance. We assessed the urinary nitrate to creatinine ratio (uNCR) between patient groups: routine attendances, biopsy-proven rejection, biopsy-proven no rejection, and other call-backs. uNCR was examined over time for those with biopsy-proven transplant rejection. These four groups were compared.

### Sodium nitrite [^114Eagb3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Sodium nitrite can cause serious adverse reactions and death in humans, even at doses less than twice the recommended therapeutic dose. It causes hypotension and methemoglobin formation, which diminishes oxygen-carrying capacity. Hypotension and methemoglobin formation can occur concurrently or separately. Because of these risks, sodium nitrite should be used to treat acute life-threatening cyanide poisoning and be used with caution in patients where the diagnosis of cyanide poisoning is uncertain.

Patients should be closely monitored to ensure adequate perfusion and oxygenation during treatment with sodium nitrite. Alternative therapeutic approaches should be considered in patients known to have diminished oxygen or cardiovascular reserve (e.g. smoke inhalation victims, pre-existing anemia, cardiac or respiratory compromise), and those at higher risk of developing methemoglobinemia (e.g. congenital methemoglobin reductase deficiency) as they are at greater risk for potentially life-threatening adverse events related to the use of sodium nitrite [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1 and 5.2)].

- **Warning: Life-threatening hypotension and methemoglobin formation**: Sodium nitrite can cause serious adverse reactions and death from hypotension (5.1) and methemoglobin formation (5.2). Patients should be closely monitored to ensure adequate perfusion and oxygenation during treatment with sodium nitrite.

### Changes in the composition of urine over six hours using urine dipstick analysis and automated microscopy [^1146tnFP]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

The study shows that a timely urinalysis is critical for accurate results since delayed analysis can considerably change the makeup of the urine, thereby affecting clinical decisions and the management of patients. Future studies should consider more extended time frames, diverse patient populations, and methods of sample handling, such as refrigeration or preservatives, and analysis techniques being more optimized. Additionally, a combination of automated and manual microscopy may offer the most comprehensive and accurate approach to urine analysis, leveraging the strengths of both techniques while mitigating their respective limitations.

### Medical management of kidney stones: AUA guideline [^114REaDU]. The Journal of Urology (2014). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for nephrolithiasis, more specifically with respect to urine tests, the AUA 2014 guidelines recommend obtaining urinalysis, including both dipstick and microscopic evaluation, to assess urine pH, indicators of infection, and to identify crystals pathognomonic of stone type in patients with newly diagnosed kidney or ureteral stones.

### A randomized clinical trial of the effects of leafy green vegetables and inorganic nitrate on blood pressure [^117HVhT8]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2020). High credibility.

The strengths of our trial include what is, to our knowledge, the largest group of subjects tested at the time of writing, followed for a 5-week period preceded by a 2-week run-in period before random assignment to study groups. Moreover, the matching of the nitrate dose in subjects receiving the high-nitrate vegetables and those receiving the potassium nitrate pill enabled us to pinpoint the contribution from inorganic nitrate to any observed effects on blood pressure (BP). By giving every subject a pill (KCl or KNO3), we were able to compare the results in a blinded way. The weekly visits by study participants to a single-site research clinic, where they underwent BP measurements and received a collection of new fresh vegetables, likely contributed to the excellent compliance and low drop-out rates. The combination of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) measurements with weekly office measurements makes the overall interpretation of BP data maximally reliable.

In conclusion, our results show that intake of 300 mg nitrate daily via either leafy green vegetables or a nitrate supplement for 5 weeks does not lower BP in subjects with high-normal and grade I hypertension compared with intake of a control diet low in nitrate.

### Nitroglycerin [^113RcWN1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Methemoglobinemia is a condition that can occur when nitrate ions liberated during the metabolism of nitroglycerin oxidize hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Even in patients who completely lack cytochrome b5 reductase activity and assuming the nitrate components of nitroglycerin are fully utilized to oxidize hemoglobin, approximately 1 mg/kg of nitroglycerin is required before any of these patients show clinically significant (≥ 10%) methemoglobinemia. For patients with normal reductase function, significant methemoglobin production requires even larger doses of nitroglycerin.

In a study involving 36 patients, continuous nitroglycerin therapy at doses of 3.1 to 4.4 mg/hr for 2–4 weeks resulted in an average methemoglobin level of 0.2%, comparable to levels observed in patients who received a placebo. Despite these findings, case reports exist of significant methemoglobinemia following moderate overdoses of organic nitrates, although the affected patients were not considered unusually susceptible.

Methemoglobin levels can be determined by most clinical laboratories. The diagnosis should be suspected in patients showing signs of impaired oxygen delivery despite adequate cardiac output and arterial pO2. Classically, methemoglobinemic blood is described as chocolate brown and does not change color on exposure to air.

Upon diagnosis of methemoglobinemia, the treatment of choice is intravenous methylene blue at a dose of 1–2 mg/kg.

### The association between urinary nitrate and prostate specific antigen without prostatic disease: a cohort study [^116FGY17]. BMC Urology (2025). Low credibility.

The results were obtained after adjusting for age; race (Mexican American, Other Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Other Race); education level (high school graduate, less than, and above); BMI (≥ 25 kg/m², 10 ng/mL); urinary creatinine (mg/dL); drinking (no, yes).

This indicates a nonlinear correlation between the prostate-specific antigen ratio and urinary nitrate. Initially, urinary nitrate levels remain relatively stable or exhibit minimal change as the prostate-specific antigen ratio increases. However, as the ratio continues to rise, urinary nitrate levels gradually decrease, with the rate of decline accelerating over time.

### Dysuria: Evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^115TVrxC]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute cystitis, specifically in relation to urinalysis, the AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a urinalysis in patients with dysuria to determine the cause. This is particularly important in patients with recurrent urinary tract infections (reUTIs) when there is suspicion of a complicated UTI, and to prevent repeat encounters and courses of antibiotics.

### The use of urinary dipstick tests to exclude urinary tract infection: a systematic review of the literature [^1161SvQk]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Several systematic reviews have examined the use of dipstick tests to diagnose or rule in urinary tract infection (UTI). We examined the evidence relating to the use of urine leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests in adults to exclude or rule out UTI. A search of the literature from 1966 to 2003 revealed 30 studies as containing relevant and suitable information. Of these, 23 studies, which used a cut-off of 108 colony-forming units per liter, were combined in a meta-analysis.

The leukocyte esterase or nitrite test combination, with one or the other test positive, was used in 14 studies. It showed the highest sensitivity and the lowest negative likelihood ratio. While there was significant heterogeneity between the studies, 7 of the 14 demonstrated significant decreases in pretest to posttest probability, with a pooled posttest probability of 5% for the negative result. In certain circumstances, there is evidence for the use of urinalysis as a rule-out test for UTI.

### Screening with urinary dipsticks for reducing morbidity and mortality [^11168YvC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Urinary dipsticks are sometimes used for screening asymptomatic people and for case-finding among inpatients or outpatients who do not have genitourinary symptoms. Abnormalities identified on screening sometimes lead to additional investigations, which may identify serious diseases such as bladder cancer and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Urinary dipstick screening could improve prognoses due to earlier detection, but could also lead to unnecessary and potentially invasive follow-up testing and unnecessary treatment.

- **Objectives**: We aimed to quantify the benefits and harms of screening with urinary dipsticks in general populations and patients in hospitals.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 8 September 2014 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials and other study types that compared urinary dipstick screening with no dipstick screening were eligible for inclusion. We searched for studies that investigated the use of urinary dipsticks for detecting haemoglobin, protein, albumin, albumin-creatinine ratio, leukocytes, nitrite, or glucose, alone or in any combination, and in any setting. We planned to exclude studies conducted in patients with urinary disorders.

- **Data collection and analysis**: It was planned that two authors would independently extract data from included studies and assess risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. However, no studies met our inclusion criteria.

### Urinary nitrate concentration as a marker for kidney transplant rejection [^117Hxhv5]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

Kidney transplant rejection remains a persistent issue contributing to graft loss. It typically presents asymptomatically, making early diagnosis challenging. Transplanted kidneys are at risk of rejection despite significant advancements in immunosuppression. Early identification and treatment of rejection episodes are necessary to limit loss of function and prolong the life of the transplanted kidney and recipient. Current practices rely on detecting a rise in creatinine levels. Consequently, graft dysfunction and damage are likely by the time of a kidney transplant biopsy and subsequent treatment. A biomarker to diagnose transplant rejection earlier than current practices or to inform earlier decision-making for biopsy could be transformative.

In 1996, Smith et al. provided evidence that urinary nitrate concentration is elevated during kidney transplant rejection compared to urinary tract infection or a non-rejection state. The same group replicated these findings, showing that urinary nitrate concentration was elevated up to 5 days before a biopsy diagnosis of rejection was made. It has been demonstrated that urinary nitrate concentration increases due to increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), leading to increased production of nitric oxide (NO) in the transplanted organ. This NO is then rapidly metabolized to its stable oxidation product, nitrate. Furthermore, in 1996, Mugge et al. discovered similar findings in their cardiac transplant patients. An increased urinary nitrate concentration was noted with moderate to severe cardiac transplant rejection.

### Nitric oxide for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications [^115DjLp6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Pre-eclampsia, a multisystem disorder of pregnancy characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine, is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Nitric oxide mediates many functions of the endothelium, including vasodilatation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Pre-eclampsia may be associated with nitric oxide deficiency, but the evidence to support this suggestion is contradictory. Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that agents which increase nitric oxide may prevent pre-eclampsia.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effectiveness and safety of nitric oxide donors and precursors for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (November 2006), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, Issue 3), and EMBASE (2002 to December 2004).

- **Selection criteria**: Studies were included if they were randomized trials evaluating nitric oxide donors or precursors for preventing pre-eclampsia and its complications.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Both review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Data were extracted and double-checked for accuracy.

- **Main results**: Six trials (310 women) were included. Four were of good quality and two were of uncertain quality. Four trials (170 women) compared nitric oxide donors (glyceryl trinitrate) or precursors (L-arginine) with either placebo or no intervention. There are insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the effects on pre-eclampsia (four trials, 170 women; relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.

### Miconazole nitrate [^117GMNes]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Miconazole nitrate exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against species of the genus Candida. The pharmacologic mode of action is unknown. Following intravaginal administration of miconazole nitrate, small amounts are absorbed. Administration of a single dose of miconazole nitrate vaginal suppositories (100 mg) to healthy subjects resulted in total recovery from the urine and feces of 0.85% (± 0.43%) of the administered dose.

Animal studies indicate that the drug crosses the placenta, and doses above those used in humans result in embryo and fetotoxicity (80 mg/kg, orally), although this has not been reported in human subjects. See precautions.

In multi-center clinical trials in 440 women with vulvovaginal candidiasis, the efficacy of treatment with the Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Suppositories USP, 200 mg for 3 days, was compared with treatment for 7 days with Miconazole Nitrate Vaginal Cream 2%. The clinical cure rates, defined as free of microbiological evidence and clinical signs and symptoms of candidiasis at 8 to 10 days and 30 to 35 days post-therapy, were numerically lower, although not statistically different, with the 3-day suppository when compared with the 7-day cream.

### Validity of the urine dipslide under daily practice conditions [^115SwENU]. Family Practice (2003). Low credibility.

So far, the validity of urine dipslides has been studied only under optimal conditions, which may not reflect the situation in daily practice.

- **Objective**: We studied the validity of the urine dipslide as performed under daily practice conditions and assessed the influence of the incubation period (24 h versus 48 h) on validity.

- **Methods**: Fresh urine samples of patients with signs or symptoms of a possible urinary tract infection (UTI) were examined in general practice via a nitrite test, a urine sediment, and a dipslide. A second dipslide was inoculated and sent to the hospital microbiology laboratory for culture. This culture acted as the gold standard. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of the tests performed.

- **Results**: Of the 273 patient episodes included, 62% had a UTI (166 of 268 cultures). The sensitivity of the dipslide performed in daily general practice was 73% and the specificity was 94%.

- **Conclusion**: The validity of the dipslide read under practice conditions is lower than under optimal conditions. Actions to improve performance are needed. Nonetheless, using the dipslide instead of the sediment as a second step after the nitrite test would improve the diagnostic work-up of UTI.

### Chemet [^116qzp3b]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: Chemet may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests.

- **Laboratory test interference**: Chemet may interfere with serum and urinary laboratory tests. In vitro studies have shown Chemet to cause false positive results for ketones in urine using nitroprusside reagents and falsely decreased measurements of serum uric acid and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK).

- **Use with other chelation therapies**: Concomitant administration of Chemet with other chelation therapy, such as CaNa2EDTA, is not recommended.

### The EAU and AUA/CUA/SUFU guidelines on recurrent urinary tract infections: What is the difference [^11534DAr]. European Urology (2020). High credibility.

For the diagnosis of urinary tract infection (UTI), it is important to consider low bacterial counts in urine cultures more frequently. Non-antibiotic prophylaxis should be prioritized before antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with uncomplicated recurrent UTI (rUTI). Additionally, immunoprophylaxis in patients with rUTI deserves better consideration.

### Effects of CPAP on nitrate and norepinephrine levels in severe and mild-moderate sleep apnea [^111mL8yS]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Reduced plasma nitrate (NO(x)) levels and increased urinary norepinephrine (U-NE) levels have been described in severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and are reverted by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The effect of CPAP on these biomarkers in mild-moderate OSA is not well understood. The aim of this study was to compare NO(x) and U-NE levels and blood pressure (BP) between male patients with mild-moderate and severe OSA and determine the impact of 1 month of CPAP therapy on these parameters.

- **Methods**: We undertook a prospective study of 67 consecutive OSA patients (36 mild-moderate, 31 severe). Measurements of plasma NO(x) at 11 pm, 4 am, and 7 am, 24-h U-NE, and ambulatory BP were obtained at baseline and after 1 month of CPAP.

- **Results**: At baseline, NO(x) levels showed a significant decrease during the night in both groups (p < 0.001). U-NE level and BP were significantly higher in the severe OSA group. After 1 month of CPAP, there was a significant increase in NO(x) levels and a reduction in U-NE level and BP only in patients with severe OSA.

- **Conclusions**: One month of CPAP results in significant improvements in NO(x) levels, 24-h U-NE level, and BP in patients with severe OSA, but not in patients with mild-moderate OSA.

### Pediatric urine testing [^112uhHoH]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Today, urinalysis is one of the most common clinical tests ordered for both adult and pediatric patients. Because urine specimens are usually readily available and can be obtained noninvasively, urine testing is particularly well-suited for children. This article discusses the most common urine tests performed in children for screening purposes, as well as less common tests used for the diagnosis of specific disorders. Special considerations regarding urine specimen collection in children are also discussed. The article highlights some simple tests that are underused by clinicians and introduces exciting new molecular applications of urine testing.
