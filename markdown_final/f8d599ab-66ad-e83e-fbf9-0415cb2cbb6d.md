## Question

C4 energy drink and elevated blood pressure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether C4 energy drink raises blood pressure and by how much, with attention to dose, timing, mechanisms, and special populations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology of caffeine and other stimulants in energy drinks. Then, I should verify the magnitude and duration of blood pressure effects from randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine dose–response and whether effects persist beyond caffeine alone. After that, I need to consider vulnerable groups and clinical significance. Finally, I will translate this into practical guidance and monitoring recommendations, while noting any uncertainties or conflicting data I should flag.

> Let me first confirm the core pharmacology. Energy drinks like C4 typically contain 200–300 mg caffeine per can, plus taurine, guarana, and sometimes synephrine or other stimulants; caffeine antagonizes adenosine receptors, increases sympathetic tone, and can acutely raise blood pressure, while other ingredients may add hemodynamic effects or interact with caffeine, so I need to keep that in mind as I interpret data [^1f0bf34a] [^55879dea].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude of acute blood pressure effects. A meta-analysis of 15 studies found that acute energy drink consumption increases systolic blood pressure by about 4.4 mmHg and diastolic by about 2.7 mmHg, with larger effects when caffeine content is ≥ 200 mg, which aligns with the 200–300 mg range in many energy drinks; this is a modest but statistically significant acute pressor effect [^e3e7a203].

> I should confirm duration and whether effects extend beyond caffeine alone. Randomized crossover trials show that energy drinks can produce a sustained systolic blood pressure elevation up to 6 hours, with one study showing a 4.7 mmHg higher systolic pressure at 6 hours versus caffeine alone, suggesting non-caffeine ingredients contribute to a prolonged hemodynamic effect; this is clinically relevant because the pressor effect can outlast the early caffeine peak [^fa81a91a] [^43f5610c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about chronic effects. Most human data are acute, but repeated exposure could theoretically sustain elevations; in pediatrics, a single bodyweight-adjusted energy drink dose increased 24-hour systolic pressure by about 5.3 mmHg and diastolic by about 3.5 mmHg, indicating that even one dose can shift ambulatory profiles upward, which is concerning for cumulative risk in frequent consumers [^546e3bb2].

> I need to check dose–response and timing. Effects appear within 30–60 minutes and can persist 4–6 hours, with larger responses at higher caffeine doses; a meta-analysis showed the largest systolic increase with ≥ 200 mg caffeine, and pediatric data show higher daytime and nighttime blood pressure after a single dose, reinforcing a dose-related and temporally persistent effect [^e3e7a203] [^893b38b8].

> Let me consider vulnerable populations. Children and adolescents are at particular risk due to lower body mass, caffeine naivety, and higher susceptibility; the American Academy of Pediatrics advises against energy drinks in youth, and pediatric randomized data show measurable 24-hour blood pressure increases after a single dose, which is clinically meaningful in that context [^c120263a] [^546e3bb2]. Individuals with hypertension, cardiovascular disease, arrhythmias, or those taking stimulants or interacting medications should also avoid or limit intake because of additive sympathetic effects and potential QT effects, even though QT prolongation is not guaranteed in all users [^81838102] [^027dff99].

> I should double-check clinical significance. A sustained 2 mmHg rise in systolic pressure at the population level is associated with a 7% increase in ischemic heart disease mortality and a 10% increase in stroke mortality, so repeated energy drink–induced spikes, especially when combined with other pressors or stressors, could materially increase cardiovascular risk over time, even if individual acute changes seem small [^d99e9ebe].

> But wait, what if caffeine tolerance mitigates effects. Habitual caffeine consumers may show attenuated acute pressor responses, yet randomized data still show a persistent 24-hour blood pressure signal with energy drinks beyond caffeine alone, implying that tolerance does not fully negate the hemodynamic impact of the multi-ingredient formulation, particularly at higher doses or when consumed rapidly [^d69d67ef] [^43f5610c].

> Next, I should review practical guidance. For patients with hypertension, elevated blood pressure, or high cardiovascular risk, I recommend avoiding energy drinks; if used occasionally, limit to one standard can, avoid rapid consumption, and separate from other stimulants, exercise, or stressors. Clinicians should ask about energy drink use during blood pressure evaluation and consider ambulatory monitoring when white-coat or masked hypertension is suspected, as overstimulation can artifactually elevate office readings [^f0864be1] [^81838102].

> I will now examine special scenarios. In pregnancy, prepregnancy energy drink use has been associated with higher risk of gestational hypertension, so counseling to avoid energy drinks is prudent in reproductive-age patients; in adolescents, given documented 24-hour blood pressure increases and sleep disruption, abstinence is the safest course and aligns with pediatric guidance [^ac7cea2f] [^c120263a].

> Hold on, I should verify whether any conflicting data suggest no effect. Some small studies of low-dose or single-shot products show minimal or transient effects, but the weight of evidence from larger randomized trials and meta-analyses supports a consistent, dose-related acute pressor effect of energy drinks, particularly when caffeine content is high and when consumed in larger volumes, so the balance of evidence favors a clinically meaningful blood pressure increase in typical use scenarios [^e3e7a203] [^0df96fdd].

> In summary, yes, C4 and similar energy drinks acutely raise blood pressure by roughly 4–6 mmHg systolic and 2–3 mmHg diastolic within 30–60 minutes, with effects persisting up to 4–6 hours and potentially longer in some formulations; repeated or high-dose use can sustain elevations, and vulnerable patients should avoid these products, while occasional users should limit quantity, avoid stacking with other stimulants, and monitor blood pressure if they have hypertension or cardiovascular risk factors [^e3e7a203] [^fa81a91a] [^546e3bb2] [^81838102].

---

C4 energy drink can cause a **modest, acute rise in blood pressure** [^e3e7a203] due to its caffeine and other stimulants, with typical increases of about 4–6 mmHg systolic and 2–3 mmHg diastolic within 1–2 hours [^25c9d294]. Effects are **stronger in caffeine-naive users**, those with hypertension, and when multiple servings are consumed [^81838102]. The blood pressure rise is usually transient, but repeated use may pose risks for people with cardiovascular disease or hypertension. People with high blood pressure, heart conditions, or those on stimulant medications should limit or avoid C4.

---

## Mechanisms of blood pressure elevation

C4's pressor effects are driven by **caffeine and other stimulants** that increase sympathetic activity and vascular resistance:

- **Caffeine**: Antagonizes adenosine, increases catecholamines, and promotes vasoconstriction, raising SBP/DBP by ~4–6/2–3 mmHg within 1–2 hours [^e3e7a203] [^25c9d294].
- **Beta-alanine**: May enhance sympathetic tone and contribute to small BP increases.
- **Arginine**: Can cause transient vasodilation, but net effect with caffeine is often pressor.
- **Sugar**: Added sugars can worsen endothelial function and raise BP, especially with repeated use [^3d081960] [^999dfbc1].

---

## Magnitude and duration of blood pressure increase

Clinical studies show a **modest, time-limited rise** in BP after energy drinks:

| **Study** | **SBP increase** | **DBP increase** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Meta-analysis (2016) | +4.4 mmHg | +2.7 mmHg | 1–2 hours |
| Pediatric RCT (2023) | +5.3 mmHg | +3.5 mmHg | 24-hour ABPM |
| High-volume RCT (2019) | +4–5 mmHg | +3–4 mmHg | 4–6 hours |

---

These effects are **typically transient**, resolving within 4–6 hours, but repeated exposure can sustain elevations and increase cardiovascular risk [^e3e7a203] [^d99e9ebe].

---

## Individual variability in blood pressure response

BP responses vary with **genetics, tolerance, and health status**:

- **Caffeine tolerance**: Habitual users have smaller BP rises than naive users.
- **Age and body weight**: Younger, lighter individuals may have larger proportional increases.
- **Cardiovascular health**: Hypertension, arrhythmias, or heart disease amplify risks.
- **Medications**: Stimulants, antidepressants, and some decongestants can interact and raise BP.

---

## Clinical significance and health risks

Although modest, these BP changes can be **clinically meaningful** in susceptible people:

- **Hypertension**: Even small BP rises increase cardiovascular event risk, especially with repeated exposure [^d99e9ebe].
- **Arrhythmias**: Energy drinks can prolong QT and trigger arrhythmias, particularly with underlying disease or other drugs [^0df96fdd] [^027dff99].
- **Stroke and MI**: Case reports link energy drinks to stroke and myocardial infarction, especially with high doses or co-ingestants [^4a787453].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

Professional societies advise caution or avoidance for **high-risk groups**:

- **Hypertension**: Limit or avoid energy drinks; monitor BP if used.
- **Cardiovascular disease**: Avoid due to arrhythmia and BP risks [^027dff99].
- **Pregnancy**: Avoid because of gestational hypertension risk [^ac7cea2f].
- **Children and adolescents**: Avoid; pediatric studies show sustained BP effects [^546e3bb2] [^c120263a].

---

## Practical advice for consumers

Consumers can **mitigate risks** with these strategies:

- **Limit intake**: No more than one can per day; avoid multiple servings.
- **Avoid mixing**: Do not combine with alcohol, other stimulants, or medications that raise BP.
- **Monitor BP**: Check BP before and after use, especially if hypertensive.
- **Hydrate**: Drink water to offset dehydration and caffeine effects.
- **Choose alternatives**: Use decaf or non-stimulant options when possible.

---

C4 energy drink causes a **modest, acute BP rise** of about 4–6/2–3 mmHg for 1–6 hours, driven by caffeine and other stimulants. Effects are larger in sensitive users, and repeated use may increase cardiovascular risk; people with hypertension, heart disease, or those on interacting medications should avoid or limit intake.

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^b4bb5cde]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The single, bodyweight-adjusted ED consumption during morning hours is linked with a significantly higher systolic as well as diastolic 24-h blood pressure in healthy children and adolescents. Potentially, chronic ED consumption might lead to greater cardiovascular risk. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the chronic effects of EDs on the cardiovascular system. Minors, particularly those with an increased cardiovascular morbidity, should be discouraged from drinking EDs.

Conclusions

Caffeinated energy drinks significantly prolong the QTc interval and raise brachial and central blood pressure post‐acute exposure. Further investigation is warranted on whether an individual ingredient or a unique combination leads to the observed electrophysiological and hemodynamic changes. The impact of long‐term energy drinks consumption remains unknown.

### Impact of acute energy drink consumption on blood pressure parameters: a meta-analysis [^e3e7a203]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Hospitalizations associated with energy drinks have increased in the past decade. Whereas energy drinks are suspected to cause hemodynamic effects, the magnitude of risk remains controversial. We evaluated the effects of acute energy drink consumption on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and heart rate (HR).

Data Sources

A search in PubMed, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Cochrane database through December 31, 2015, was performed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective clinical studies assessing the effects of commercially available energy drinks on BP and HR were included. A weighted mean change from baseline was calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model for all end points.

Data Synthesis

In all, 15 studies were included, encompassing a total of 340, 322, and 340 individuals for SBP, DBP, and HR, respectively. SBP and DBP increased significantly by 4.44 mm Hg (95% CI = 2.71 to 6.17; Cochrane Q P = 0.001) and 2.73 mm Hg (95% CI = 1.52 to 3.95; Cochrane Q P = 0.050), respectively. HR changed nonsignificantly by 0.80 beats per minute (95% CI = -1.26 to 2.87; Cochrane Q P < 0.001). The largest change in SBP was seen with drinks administering ≥ 200 mg of caffeine (6.44 mm Hg, 95% CI = 4.62 to 8.27).

Conclusions

Our results indicate that acute consumption of caffeinated energy drinks significantly raises SBP and DBP. Further investigation of the ingredients in energy drinks and the impact of chronic energy drink consumption is warranted.

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^948dbf75]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Energy drinks (EDs) are popular beverages among minors. To date, clinical studies investigating ED-induced effects on the pediatric cardiovascular system are sparse. This study aimed to investigate the effects of a single, bodyweight-adjusted ED dosage on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) in healthy children and adolescents.

Methods

This study was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Study participants received a single, bodyweight-adjusted ED amount or a placebo drink on 2 consecutive days at similar morning hours. Twenty-four-hour ABPM was assessed via an automated oscillometric blood pressure device after beverage consumption on both study days.

Results

A total of 17 healthy children and teenagers (13.90 (12.29–17.89) years) were included in the final analysis. The ED consumption led, compared to the placebo intake, to a significantly higher 24-h systolic (115.90 (110.22–118.04) vs. 110.64 (108.09–115.45) mmHg, p = 0.013) and diastolic blood pressure (66.08 (64.20–68.32) vs. 62.63 (61.40–66.46) mmHg, p = 0.005).

Conclusions

The single, bodyweight-adjusted ED consumption is linked with a significantly higher systolic as well as diastolic 24-h blood pressure in healthy children and adolescents. Minors, particularly those with an increased cardiovascular morbidity, should be discouraged from drinking EDs.

Impact

Energy drinks (EDs) are consumed by many children and teenagers. While adverse cardiovascular events after ED consumption were reported in the literature, the effects of these beverages on the pediatric 24-h blood pressure profile have not been systematically evaluated yet. In our manuscript, we demonstrate for the first time that acute ED consumption is associated with a significantly higher 24-h systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in healthy minors.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^0df96fdd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background Energy drinks have been linked to an increase in emergency room visits and deaths. We aim to determine the impact of energy drinks on electrocardiographic and hemodynamic parameters in young healthy volunteers. Methods and Results A randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted in healthy volunteers. Participants consumed 32 oz of either energy drink A, energy drink B, or placebo within 60 minutes on 3 study days with a 6-day washout period in between. The primary end point of QT c interval and secondary end points of QT interval, PR interval, QRS duration, heart rate, and brachial and central blood pressures were measured at baseline, and every 30 minutes for 240 minutes. A repeated-measures 2-way analysis of variance was performed with the main effects of intervention, time, and an interaction of intervention and time. Thirty-four participants were included (age 22.1 ± 3.0 years). The interaction term of intervention and time was statistically significant for Bazett's corrected QT interval, Fridericia's corrected QT interval, QT, PR, QRS duration, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, central systolic blood pressure, and central diastolic blood pressure (all P < 0.001). The maximum change from baseline in Bazett's corrected QT interval for drinks A, B, and placebo were +17.9 ± 13.9, +19.6 ± 15.8, and +11.9 ± 11.1 ms, respectively (P = 0.005 for ANOVA) (P = 0.04 and < 0.01, respectively compared with placebo). Peripheral and central systolic and diastolic blood pressure were statistically significantly different compared with placebo (all P < 0.001). Conclusion Energy drinks significantly prolong the QT c interval and raise blood pressure. Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT03196908.

### Alcohol consumption, hypertension, and cardiovascular health across the life course: there is No such thing as a one-size-fits-all approach [^1ba47530]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Elevated blood pressure is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease and related disability worldwide. 1 It is a largely preventable condition influenced by a range of lifestyle behaviors, including but not limited to level of physical activity, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), 2 articles make important incremental contributions in extending the evidence base of the latter.

Roerecke and colleagues 2 carried out a systematic review and dose–response meta‐analysis of the association between alcohol consumption, defined using average number of drinks consumed per day, and incident hypertension separately in men and women. They found that no level of alcohol intake was associated with a lower risk of developing hypertension in either sex, which is in contrast to previous systematic reviews of this topic as well as observational studies of alcohol consumption and some cardiovascular outcomes. 3, 4

Piano and co‐workers 5 provide complementary findings, focusing on the cross‐sectional association of episodic heavy drinking (often referred to as "binge drinking" as the authors chose to, defined as men or women consuming 5 or 4 or more drinks in a single day, respectively) and indicators of cardiometabolic health, including blood pressure, in younger people. They found that frequency of binge drinking was associated with elevated levels of systolic blood pressure in men but not women. This result is in some ways supported by the work of Roerecke et al, 2 who similarly found a less pronounced effect of average alcohol intake on risk of developing hypertension in women. However, this study regrettably falls short of "completing the puzzle" of whether this difference in association with blood pressure by sex is driven by variation in drinking pattern (ie, episodes of heavy drinking being more common in men) through having not included either adjustment for, or the formal testing of an interaction with, overall volume of alcohol consumed.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^d99e9ebe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

While blood pressure changes can be attributed primarily to the caffeine, other ingredients in energy drinks may pose some hemodynamic activity. 37 Taurine has been shown to lower blood pressure in prehypertensive patients, indicating the need for investigating simultaneous caffeine and taurine intake. 39

Caffeine and ephedra‐containing supplements were withdrawn from market after discovery of adverse QTc interval effects. 40 Additionally, a sustained elevation in SBP of 2 mm Hg is associated with a 7% increased risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease and a 10% increased risk of stroke mortality. 41 The cardiovascular effects seen in this study warrant concern as the observation of increased cardiovascular adverse effects and fatalities related to energy drinks remains an important public health issue. 42

Several factors may limit the generalizability of this study. We did not investigate the effects of different doses and the volume of drink consumed (two 16‐ounce cans over 60 minutes) in this study may not be representative of real‐world consumption patterns. However, 24‐oz variants of certain energy drink brands are readily available, facilitating consumption of larger volumes of energy drink in one sitting. In a survey of 2040 respondents, 16% reported having once consumed > 2 energy drinks in a day. 43 We assessed the effects of acute consumption of an energy drink < 4 hours, which does not lend insight to long‐term effects nor the effects of chronic consumption. Additionally, we assessed energy drink consumption alone, and it is not uncommon for energy drinks to be consumed in combination with other substances such as alcohol. 44, 45 While all products were packaged identically, it is possible that some participants were able to identify the energy drink or placebo drinks based on taste or pharmacodynamic response. Our study included only healthy individuals between the ages of 18 to 40 years and results may not be applicable to populations with concomitant comorbidities or those who are not within the studied age range. We did not independently test the concentrations of the ingredients in the energy drinks but relied on publicly available data.

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^546e3bb2]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The results of this study reveal that the consumption of a single, bodyweight-adjusted ED dosage is linked with a significantly higher median 24-h SBP (+5.26 mmHg) and DBP (+3.45 mmHg), compared to a placebo beverage, in healthy children and adolescents. A meta-analysis by Conen et al. suggests that an increase of 10 mmHg in 24-h SBP is connected with a 27% higher risk for cardiovascular events. In addition, a population-based study by Hansen et al. indicates that an increase of 5 mmHg in 24-h DBP is associated with a 27% higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, the ED-induced alterations in the pediatric 24-h blood pressure profile displayed in this study can be considered alarming.

Moreover, chronic ED consumption could result in arterial hypertension and hence increased left ventricular afterload, ultimately leading to left ventricular dysfunction and hypertrophy. A previous publication conducted by our department reported a significantly lower cardiac efficiency after acute ED consumption in healthy children and adolescents. Furthermore, many EDs contain high amounts of sugar and thus "empty" calories. Chronic ED consumption could therefore lead to the onset of glucose metabolism disorders and aggravate weight gain. As ED consumption is associated with a shorter sleep duration, it might additionally increase cardiovascular risk. In summary, children and adolescents, particularly those with elevated cardiovascular morbidity (e.g. arterial hypertension, diabetes, excess weight), should be discouraged from consuming EDs. Moreover, minors should be made aware of the potential health risks of excessive ED intake as well as responsible ED consumption behaviors.

As a survey conducted by the EFSA suggests, ED consumption is very popular among children and adolescents, which could pose potential public health concerns considering the demonstrated results of this study. In total, 68% of adolescents stated to drink EDs. Of those, 26% reported drinking EDs at least 2 days per week. Medical organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics advise against the use of EDs in minors. Due to negative health concerns, some countries, including Lithuania and Latvia, have already prohibited selling EDs to minors.

The results of the EDUCATE-Study (Energy-Drinks — Unexplored Cardiovascular Alterations in TEens and TwEens) can be regarded as noteworthy since they offer policymakers with long-needed data on the cardiovascular effects of acute ED consumption in children and adolescents.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^25c9d294]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — acute cardiovascular effects in healthy people include marked short‑term hemodynamic and electrocardiographic changes. Increased norepinephrine levels of 74% have been noted, and 1 to 2 h after consumption healthy individuals usually have a ~ 6- to 10-mm Hg rise in systolic and 3 to 6 mm Hg rise in diastolic blood pressure with heart rate increasing approximately 3 to 7 bpm; in apparently healthy persons QTc prolongation up to 22 to 25 ms 1 to 2 h after consumption has been described.

### Effects of single and multiple energy shots on blood pressure and electrocardiographic parameters [^ae152d8a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

We assessed the effects of single and multiple caffeinated energy shots on hemodynamic and electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters. This was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study in otherwise healthy volunteers (n = 26) where a caffeinated energy shot or matching placebo was ingested. The study drink was consumed twice daily for 7 days during each phase, with a 7-day washout period in between. The primary end points of interest were systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT and QTc intervals. All parameters were evaluated at baseline, 1, 3, and 5 hours on the first and seventh day of each phase. Systolic BP after a single energy shot consumption was significantly higher than placebo at 3 and 5 hours (p = 0.050 and p = 0.038, respectively). Similarly, diastolic BP after a single energy shot consumption was significantly higher at 1 and 5 hours (p = 0.019 and p = 0.043, respectively). The systolic and diastolic BP elevations were not significant after consistent consumption (all p values ≥ 0.079). None of the ECG parameters were significantly affected (all p values ≥ 0.108) compared with placebo. In conclusion, a single shot of a caffeinated energy drink significantly raised systolic and diastolic BPs. However, these elevations were not sustained with chronic consumption. ECG parameters were not altered.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^4a787453]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Energy drinks are a growing industry with a market value predicted to reach $61 billion by 2021. 1 It is estimated that about 30% of teenagers between the ages of 12 through 17 years in the United States consume energy drinks on a regular basis. 2 A study of military personnel found that nearly 45% of deployed service members consumed at least 1 energy drink per day with 14% drinking ≥ 3 daily. 3 Although commonly promoted as supplements that can boost performance and cognition, these drinks have also been reported to have numerous detrimental side effects, particularly cardiovascular and neurological in nature. 4, 5, 6 The number of annual emergency department visits involving energy drinks increased from 10 068 in 2007 to 20 783 in 2011. 7 According to the Food and Drug Administration, there have been 34 deaths attributed to energy drinks warranting investigation into the safety of these beverages. 8

Energy drink consumption has been associated with cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, spontaneous coronary dissection, and coronary vasospasm. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 This association is strengthened with studies showing increased platelet aggregation, increased systolic blood pressure (SBP), and QTc prolongation. 17, 18, 19, 20 QT/QTc interval prolongation is a biologically plausible reason for the sudden cardiac arrest associated with energy drinks and QTc prolongation places patients at increased risk for developing torsades de pointes, which can lead to fatal ventricular arrhythmias. 21 Several small studies have demonstrated mild QTc prolongation with energy drink consumption but the data remain controversial because of energy drink dose and study design‐related confounders. 19, 20, 22, 23 To validate previous electrocardiographic findings and to assess the differences between energy drink types, we conducted a randomized, double‐masked, placebo‐controlled, crossover study in young healthy volunteers.

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^c980e64e]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The results presented in this study are in line with the findings by Franks et al. The authors investigated the effects of EDs versus caffeine supplementation on 24-h ABPM in nine healthy adults. Subjects received an ED (80 mg caffeine) or a placebo (80 mg caffeine) at four time points throughout the day (08, 11, 15, and 19 h). The authors revealed a 5.8 mmHg higher mean 24-h SBP (p = 0.04) and a 5.4 mmHg higher mean 24-h DBP (p = 0.02) on the day of ED consumption. It should be noted that both study designs are not fully comparable, as the current study used a non-caffeinated placebo drink, and both beverages were given only once at similar morning hours. However, the study of Franks et al. suggests that the various ingredients found in EDs may potentiate blood pressure response to caffeine due to pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions. In the literature, caffeine plasma half-lives are described to range between 2.5 and 5 h, if administered in a single dose of 4 mg per kilogram of bodyweight. Moreover, with half-lives ranging from 2.3 to 9.9 h, caffeine clearance can exhibit considerable interindividual variability. The results of the current study could potentially imply that the pediatric cardiovascular system reacts more sensitively to ED ingredients than the adult one. Furthermore, the ED-induced effects on the pediatric cardiovascular system might last distinctly longer.

The duration of sleep was significantly shorter after the acute ED consumption. However, sleep quality did not differ significantly between both beverages. As caffeine increases cortisol secretion, it is proposed to influence the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and, thus, the sleep-wake cycle. Multiple studies indicate that the consumption of caffeine is associated with shorter sleep duration as well as elevated sleep onset latency and wake time after sleep onset. A study conducted by Drake et al. demonstrated that the consumption of 400 mg caffeine 6 h prior to habitual sleep time resulted in a significant reduction of sleep duration in 12 healthy normal sleepers. Therefore, the consumption of large caffeine amounts, even at daytime, can negatively affect sleep. Furthermore, a survey conducted by Sampasa-Kanyinga et al. suggests that the consumption of EDs is linked with a shorter sleep duration in middle as well as in high school students.

### Intake of energy drinks before and during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^6cc64d61]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study found that energy drink intake was associated with higher risk of gestational hypertension. Given the low prevalence of energy drink intake in the study population, the results should be interpreted with caution. However, our findings suggest that caution regarding energy drink consumption in reproductive-aged individuals should be exercised and that replication in future studies is needed.

### Lifestyle management of hypertension: international society of hypertension position paper endorsed by the World Hypertension League and European Society of Hypertension [^7a36be9f]. Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Hypertension, defined as persistently elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP) > 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at least 90 mmHg (International Society of Hypertension guidelines), affects over 1.5 billion people worldwide. Hypertension is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (e.g. coronary heart disease, heart failure and stroke) and death. An international panel of experts convened by the International Society of Hypertension College of Experts compiled lifestyle management recommendations as first-line strategy to prevent and control hypertension in adulthood. We also recommend that lifestyle changes be continued even when blood pressure-lowering medications are prescribed. Specific recommendations based on literature evidence are summarized with advice to start these measures early in life, including maintaining a healthy body weight, increased levels of different types of physical activity, healthy eating and drinking, avoidance and cessation of smoking and alcohol use, management of stress and sleep levels. We also discuss the relevance of specific approaches including consumption of sodium, potassium, sugar, fibre, coffee, tea, intermittent fasting as well as integrated strategies to implement these recommendations using, for example, behaviour change-related technologies and digital tools.

### Increased fructose associates with elevated blood pressure [^4e81a936]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

The recent increase in fructose consumption in industrialized nations mirrors the rise in the prevalence of hypertension, but epidemiologic studies have inconsistently linked these observations. We investigated whether increased fructose intake from added sugars associates with an increased risk for higher BP levels in US adults without a history of hypertension. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using the data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003 to 2006) involving 4528 adults without a history of hypertension. Median fructose intake was 74 g/d, corresponding to 2.5 sugary soft drinks each day. After adjustment for demographics; comorbidities; physical activity; total kilocalorie intake; and dietary confounders such as total carbohydrate, alcohol, salt, and vitamin C intake, an increased fructose intake of ≥ 74 g/d independently and significantly associated with higher odds of elevated BP levels: It led to a 26, 30, and 77% higher risk for BP cutoffs of ≥ 135/85, ≥ 140/90, and ≥ 160/100 mmHg, respectively. These results suggest that high fructose intake, in the form of added sugar, independently associates with higher BP levels among US adults without a history of hypertension.

### Towards new recommendations to reduce the burden of alcohol-induced hypertension in the European union [^b222bbb1]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The evidence for alcohol interventions to reduce BP

Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that alcohol consumption and hypertension are linked in a dose-dependent fashion, although there may be a threshold level for alcohol consumption below which there are no effects, especially for women (for indirect evidence see). As indicated by the potential threshold, the dose-response relationship is not linear over the full range of alcohol consumption, but for both sexes there is a monotonic dose-response relationship for higher levels of consumption, and thus hazardous/harmful drinking and AUDs are closely associated with elevated BP and/or hypertension. The above described association between hazardous/harmful alcohol consumption and hypertension has been judged as causal, which means that a logical intervention to reduce BP is to reduce alcohol consumption.

Indeed, several studies support the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions to decrease alcohol consumption in reducing BP levels, with a clinically meaningful decline in BP occurring within a few weeks after reductions in alcohol intake among hypertensive patients. The most comprehensive systematic review and meta-analyses on the effect of alcohol consumption on BP in trials lasting at least 7 days (median duration: 4 weeks) found that, above a baseline drinking level of two drinks per day (drink size was assumed to be 12 g pure alcohol), reduction in alcohol intake was associated with BP reduction. The higher the alcohol consumption at baseline, the greater the reduction in alcohol consumption and in BP levels. The effect could also be shown for people with hypertension. The evidence supporting this intervention is of the highest possible grade, as it is based on a systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of interventions to reduce BP in both normotensives and hypertensives, with adequate control groups (for the importance of control groups specifically in the area of interventions for lowering BP see the paper by Patel et al.).

The available evidence has led to standard formulations in European and Canadian guidelines for the management of hypertension in the past decades to address lifestyle factors, including alcohol. In fact, most guidelines, including those from the NICE, stipulate that all patients undergoing assessment or treatment for hypertension should receive initial and periodic lifestyle advice, which includes ascertaining their alcohol consumption and encouraging a reduced intake if they drink hazardously.

The situation in the US is slightly different. Although American Society of Hypertension Community Guidelines briefly mention the contribution of alcohol to raised BP, the association between alcohol consumption and raised BP is not even mentioned in the main national hypertension guidelines or in the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines regarding lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk.

What is known and what is new?

Coffee and caffeinated drinks such as tea have beneficial effects on BP and overall cardiovascular health. Drinking coffee shows a consistent nonlinear association with the reduced risk in cardiovascular mortality with the greatest benefits seen with three cups a day. A recent study in the UK Biobank showed that those drinking two to three cups per day of coffee or tea 32 or 28%, respectively, have reduced risk of having a stroke and dementia when compared with nondrinkers. It appears that a consumption greater than three cups daily is safe but the benefits (in terms of reduction in cardiovascular risk) were less apparent. Interestingly, an inverse dose–response in coffee consumption has been associated with a 2% risk reduction of hypertension (relative risk = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.98–0.99) for each cup of coffee ingested daily. In contrast, a Japanese study reported that consumption of more than two cups of coffee daily increased risk of CVD mortality in people with grade 2–3 hypertension. This increased risk was not observed amongst green tea drinkers. Increased coffee consumption has also been associated with increased risk of aortic valve stenosis in a Swedish prospective population study.

Emerging data also suggests the benefits of the consumption of nitrate compounds found in beetroot juice in lowering BP. A recent meta-analysis showed beetroot juice significantly decreases SBP but not DBP in patients with arterial hypertension. Interestingly, the BP-lowering effects of beetroot juice in SBP and pulse pressure are enhanced when combined with grapefruit juice. Other beverages that can be beneficial include karkade (hibiscus) tea, pomegranate juice and cocoa. In contrast, the regular consumption of energy drinks, which have large amounts of caffeine, and liquorice root tea promote a spike in SBP and heart rate leading to metabolic changes. The effects of prolonged consumption of energy drinks have not been determined but may be relevant to individuals at risk of CVD.

International perspective

Coffee and tea consumption varies between countries worldwide. However, studies suggest that coffee and tea intake may be accompanied by smoking, which may revoke their benefits and could also be associated with BP differences in regions with high smoking rates.

Recommendation

1 Moderate regular coffee consumption (three to four cups per day) does not adversely affect BP and the cardiovascular system and can be moderately beneficial.
2 The addition of nitrate-rich beverages, such as beetroot juice, pomegranate juice and cocoa, may be considered.

### Sex-specific associations between alcohol consumption and incidence of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^a9a3aa6f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Implications

Clinicians are faced with a dilemma. On the one side, low‐level drinking has been associated with less risk for ischemic heart disease 69, 70; on the other side, the risk for hypertension seems increased, at least in men. In order to side with caution, patients should be advised to drink as little as possible for many reasons, including increased risk of cancer and injury, to name a few, 15 and the risk of hypertension should be added to the list of diseases where no alcohol consumption is safe. This may require a change in drinking advice in current guidelines for prevention and treatment of hypertension, which state that men should limit their alcohol intake to 2 drinks or less, a level which we found to be associated with increased risk for hypertension. Additional research with stronger, more‐experimental study design may help in answering outstanding questions on cardiovascular risk from low levels of drinking.

Other implications of this research are clear: Alcohol consumption should be assessed at the primary care level whenever there is elevated BP. 71 Unfortunately, despite some guidelines recommending such an approach, it is rarely followed in clinical practice (for the example of the 6 largest European Union countries 72). Efforts should be made to change clinical practice, given that alcohol‐induced hypertension is both preventable and reversible, 10, 59 and there are effective and cost‐effective interventions to reduce alcohol consumption level in primary care. 73, 74 Changing clinical practice promises to reduce substantial mortality and burden of disease associated with both alcohol consumption and hypertension. 10, 75

### Sex-specific associations between alcohol consumption and incidence of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^eb34b228]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension (raised blood pressure [BP], > 140 mm Hg systolic BP, and/or > 90 mm Hg diastolic BP) ranks as the third‐most important risk factor for global burden of disease, 1 responsible for considerable and increasing noncommunicable diseases burden and mortality. 1, 2 This condition affects more than 1 billion people worldwide with a global prevalence of close to 20%. Despite decreases in raised BP mainly in higher income countries, in part attributed to improved detection and treatment, 3 global prevalence of hypertension has been increasing and is predicted to further increase in the next decade. 1, 2 In 2015, hypertension was responsible for 10.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.6–11.8) million deaths and 211.8 (95% CI, 192.7–231.1) million disability‐adjusted life years globally. 1

Hypertension is largely a by‐product of modern lifestyle factors such as lack of physical activity, 4 unhealthy diet (in particular, salt intake 4), or consumption of alcohol. 5 In fact, some guidelines for clinical management, including those from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, stipulate that all patients undergoing assessment or treatment for hypertension should receive initial and periodic lifestyle advice, which includes ascertaining their level of alcohol consumption and encouraging a reduced intake if they drink hazardously or heavily. 6, 7 The American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention and treatment of high BP recommend limiting daily alcohol intake to 2 or less drinks for men and 1 or less drinks for women. 8

The relationship between alcohol consumption and hypertension was first reported by Lian 9 researching French soldiers serving in World War II. He found a dose‐response association with a 4‐fold increase between drinkers with the lowest (up to 2 L of wine per day) and highest (> 3 L of wine per day plus aperitifs) levels of consumption. Numerous studies since then have confirmed the association between heavy drinking and development of hypertension. 10 However, the association between light‐to‐moderate drinking and hypertension is still disputed, 11, 12 despite a number of meta‐analyses 13, 14 and countless reviews (overview of recent reviews 15). The association may also depend on sex, which could be related to differential alcohol metabolism 16 or drinking patterns. 17

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^55879dea]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

There are currently more than 500 energy drink products available on the market purported to boost physical and mental alertness. 1 In line with their increased popularity is a coinciding rise in energy drink–associated emergency department visits and deaths, which has led to questions about their true safety profile. 2, 3, 4 In a review of energy drink–associated adverse cardiovascular events, abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial and ventricular fibrillation, ST elevation, and QT prolongation have been reported. 5 However, the exact relationship between energy drinks and these adverse events has gone primarily unexplained.

Energy drinks usually consist of caffeine plus proprietary energy blends that vary between products. Caffeine has been around for centuries and is generally recognized as safe in doses less than 400 mg by the Food and Drug Administration. 6 Caffeine, a natural methylxanthine, acts as a central nervous stimulant in humans by antagonizing adenosine receptors, leading to additional cardiovascular effects such as peripheral vasoconstriction and subsequent increased blood pressure (BP). 7, 8 Caffeine alone is not suspected to induce any ECG changes in healthy volunteers at a dose of 400 mg. 9 Typically, caffeine toxicity–related adverse events have only been observed in case studies where doses far exceed 400 mg. 10, 11

Although the cardiovascular safety profile of caffeine has been relatively well established, there is little published literature on the electrophysiologic and hemodynamic changes with multi‐ingredient energy drinks. We conducted a randomized controlled trial assessing the cardiovascular safety of high‐volume energy drink consumption.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^801e4bb2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our study findings suggest significant prolongation of the QTc interval 2 hours after energy drink consumption when compared with caffeine. Systolic BP remained significantly elevated over the caffeine control at 6 hours post energy drink consumption. Ingredients contained in energy drinks other than caffeine warrant further investigation. Larger clinical trials controlling for the limitations of this study are warranted.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^701f6875]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The results are inconsistent in other studies where energy drink volumes under 32 oz were investigated. Brothers et al (n = 15) reported no changes in the QTc over 6.5 hours post‐consumption of a 24‐oz energy drink. 22 Tauseef et al found QTc prolongation of 13 ms after 500 mL (16.9 ounce) energy drink consumption. 20 An Australian study enrolled patients with congenital long QT‐syndrome (n = 24) and found no statistically significant changes within 90 minutes after consumption of 500 mL (16.9 ounce) of an energy drink. However, 3 patients did have a QTc increase > 50 ms when compared with baseline. 23 One parallel designed study assessed the impact of consuming 460 mL of 3 different types of caffeinated energy drinks on ECG parameters with no clinically significant changes. 32

In this study, both energy drinks had a similar effect on electrocardiographic parameters. Common ingredients contained in this study's products included a combination of caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone, and B‐vitamins. Caffeine at doses under 400 mg is not expected to induce any electrocardiographic changes. 33 Taurine is an endogenous molecule and supplementation is believed to be anti‐arrhythmic rather than pro‐arrhythmic. 34, 35 In animal models evaluating short QT syndrome, a taurine‐magnesium coordination compound has been shown to prolong the QT interval in a dose‐dependent manner. 36 Data on glucuronolactone and B‐vitamins are limited but they are typically regarded as safe. 37 Although the preponderance of data suggest these ingredients may be safe individually, their use in combination requires evaluation.

There was an ≈5 and 4 mm Hg increase in SBP and DBP, respectively after energy drink consumption relative to placebo. A previous meta‐analysis of 15 studies including > 300 participants similarly suggested a 4‐ and 3‐mm Hg change in SBP and DBP independent of dose. 18 An emerging predictor of cardiovascular risk is cSBP. 38 In this study, cSBP was significantly elevated after energy drink consumption but the long‐term consequences remain unknown.

### Intake of energy drinks before and during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^ac7cea2f]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

We evaluated the association between energy drink intake before and during pregnancy in 2 populations with moderate (14% in GUTS, 9% in NHS3) use of these beverages. Although intake of these beverages before pregnancy was not associated with any outcomes examined in GUTS, prepregnancy energy drink use was associated with higher risk of gestational hypertension in NHS3. This association persisted in pooled analyses of both cohorts. We also found no evidence that intake of energy drinks during pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of other APOs. Nevertheless, the divergence in findings between the 2 study populations along with the low frequency of energy drink consumption are reasons for caution in the interpretation of these findings.

The association of energy drink consumption with blood pressure has been investigated in multiple studies. Most of these studies used crossover study designs and measured participants' blood pressure after 0.5 to 5 hours of consuming energy drinks. A meta-analysis of 15 studies with more than 300 participants found that acute energy drink consumption was associated with increased SBP by 4.4 mm Hg and DBP by 2.7 mm Hg. Another review showed that ingestion of energy drink with caffeine doses of less than 100 mg was not associated with significant changes in blood pressure, and a higher consumption was associated with a dose-response increase in blood pressure (increases of 3–9 mm Hg for SBP and 2–5 mm Hg for DBP per 100-mg increment in caffeine intake via energy drink). However, few studies have examined the association of long-term energy drink intake with blood pressure, and our study suggests that habitual prepregnancy energy drink intake might be associated with higher risk of gestational hypertension. Although no statistical heterogeneity in association with gestational hypertension was identified between cohorts, there was a positive association in NHS3 but not in GUTS. The NHS3 and GUTS are different in terms of their sample source, as reflected by the baseline characteristics. Participants in NHS3 were older and had higher mean BMI than those in GUTS, both of which were factors associated with APOs. We found significant modification of associations by age, with greater ORs for energy drink use and risk of hypertensive disorder among older participants. These finding suggest that differences in age between cohorts may account for the discrepancy in findings between NHS3 and GUTS. It is possible that energy drink intake and age have a synergistic effect on gestational hypertension, which should be evaluated in future studies.

### Drinking water: the saltier the better? [^18d34a0c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The current literature is inconclusive with respect to these findings. Numerous studies have confirmed a link between high dietary sodium intake and blood pressure. 3, 4, 5, 7 This link is traditionally explained by the Guyton Hypothesis, whereby increased sodium intake promotes increased blood pressure via extracellular fluid volume expansion. 8 More recent literature also supports a key role of the vasculature to elevate blood pressure in response to sodium intake, independent of renal sodium excretion. 9 With regard to calcium, the literature is controversial. Some research supports that high urinary calcium excretion is associated with elevated blood pressure. 10, 11 Other evidence suggests that diets supplemented with calcium mildly reduce blood pressure, with a possible dose–response effect. 12 It should also be noted that high dietary calcium consumption may increase cardiovascular risk via promotion of arterial calcification. 13 The role of magnesium in blood pressure control is less clear. However, magnesium supplementation has been used to prevent eclampsia. 14 Although not completely characterized, magnesium likely acts as a vasodilator to reduce peripheral vascular resistance or to relieve vasoconstriction. 15

While most published research has focused on individual mineral impact on health, the current study's measurement of water EC to assess the contribution of multiple cations to salinity was novel. In addition, a large sample size was included to assess an important global health question in the context of changing climate. However, it is important to consider several limitations when interpreting the results of the study. As the authors note, the concentrations of individual cations in the drinking water could not be measured, because of high cost. The association of mild‐salinity drinking water with lower blood pressure was attributed to the protective effects of calcium and magnesium, because urinary levels of these cations associated negatively with blood pressure and differed across the 3 drinking water salinity categories. However, excretion cannot distinguish the source of these minerals, which may include alternate sources such as diet or supplements (Figure). It was assumed that the predominate source of measured minerals in the urine was from the drinking water, as a result of mineral deposition from the surrounding geology. There was also no direct measurement of consumed water volume. It is reasonable to hypothesize that participants who were drinking saltier water would tend to drink a higher volume of water; assuming normal renal function, this would increase both urine volume and sodium excretion, although information regarding kidney function was limited. Additionally, there may have been mineral loss to perspiration, particularly if activity level was high, which is challenging to quantify.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^272a4040]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The long‐term use of energy drinks also needs particular attention. In one study, consuming a single energy shot (60 mL) twice daily for 7 days conferred no significant ECG changes when compared with placebo. 29 Similarly, 500 mL of another energy drink consumed for 7 days showed no ECG‐related changes from baseline. 15 However, these results cannot be generalized across all energy drink products. While the degree of BP change seen in our study is generally not concerning in an acute setting, even mild sustained elevations in systolic BP at the population level can increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes. 30, 31

In this study, both the energy drink and caffeine arms exhibited a similar increase in pSBP from baseline for the initial 4 hours post study drink consumption. Caffeine is rapidly absorbed and typically peaks at about 1 hour, explaining the initial BP increase in both study arms. 32 This is similar to results from another study by Svatikova et al 33 that also suggested activation of the catecholamine pathway. However, the sustained pSBP elevation by ≈4 mm Hg at 6 hours post energy drink consumption suggests that other ingredients may be hemodynamically active. Guarana, another common ingredient in energy drinks, may contain 2% to 15% of its dry weight in caffeine. 34 This may or may not explain a delayed BP response when compared with caffeine alone. 35 Taurine, in contrast, is thought to have a BP‐lowering effect at higher doses, potentially altering the overall BP response. 36 The current literature is lacking regarding the hemodynamic profile of the ingredients contained in energy drinks, making it difficult to ascertain whether it is caffeine interacting with the other ingredients or the other ingredients alone that are driving the BP effects.

### The wrong white crystals: not salt but sugar as aetiological in hypertension and cardiometabolic disease [^3c79b851]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical trials: modifying sugar intake and CVD-related outcomes

Some individuals show a rise in blood pressure after just a few weeks on a high-sucrose diet (defined as 33% of total caloric intake from sucrose). In fact, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials showed that higher sugar intake significantly increases systolic (6.9 mm Hg, p < 0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (5.6 mm Hg, p = 0.0005) versus lower sugar intake in trials of 8 weeks or more in duration. Moreover, when studies that received funding from the sugar industry were excluded from the analysis, the magnitude of blood pressure elevation was even more pronounced (7.6 mm Hg systolic, 6.1 mm Hg diastolic on average). Higher sugar intake also significantly increased triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein, independent of effects on body weight and when matched for calories (suggesting that sugars may promote dyslipidemia through mechanisms unrelated to any additional calories they supply). Nonetheless, trial data show that patients consuming 28% of their energy from sucrose (approximately 152 g of sucrose per day, mainly from beverages) for just 10 weeks have a significant increase in body weight (1.6 kg), as well as increases in fat mass (1.3 kg) in addition to increases in blood pressure (3.8 mm Hg systolic, 4.1 mm Hg diastolic).

As for different effects from different sugars (eg, sucrose (fructose+glucose) vs fructose alone in particular), one study examined blood pressure responses to various sugar solutions in 20 healthy normotensive men. Ingestion of the sucrose solution significantly increased systolic blood pressure by 9 mm Hg. The increase in systolic blood pressure resulting from the fructose-only solution (4 mm Hg) was not statistically significant, however the lower response may have been due to poorer absorption of fructose unaccompanied by glucose. Nonetheless, fructose had the greatest antinatriuretic effect, suggesting a minimal role of sodium retention as a mechanism for blood-pressure response to added sugar intake. Another trial showed a more pronounced hypertensive response to drinking a HFCS (fructose+glucose)-sweetened beverage versus a sucrose-sweetened beverage in healthy individuals (15/9 mm Hg vs 12/9 mm Hg) and both drinks increased heart rate by 9 bpm.

### Energy drinks: another cause of QT prolongation? [^117ffd5f]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Since the first product appeared on US shelves in 1997, the caffeinated energy drink market has grown dramatically, with an estimated annual revenue of $10 billion in 2018. Advertising for products such as Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar emphasizes claims of enhanced energy level, mental focus, and physical performance. This marketing strategy resonates with teenagers and young adults, the dominant consumer group for these products. As the energy drink market has grown, so too has awareness of their health risks. 1, 2 Between 2004 and 2014, 34 deaths linked to energy drinks were reported to the US Food and Drug Administration, and serious adverse events described in the literature include cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and seizures. 3 Despite multiple articles in the medical literature and lay press describing the risks of energy drinks, especially when combined with alcohol, growth of this industry shows little sign of slowing.

Although the health risks of energy drinks have been widely recognized, the mechanism responsible for the cardiovascular complications associated with them remains uncertain. The acute hemodynamic effects of energy drinks in healthy volunteers have been well described: a modest increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (in the range of 3–5 mm Hg) with little change in heart rate. Although transient hemodynamic changes of this degree are unlikely to be harmful in the young consumers of energy drinks, the rapid ingestion of a large volume by a susceptible individual may result in potentially more dangerous changes. In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Shah and colleagues 4 test the hypothesis that energy drinks can cause QT‐interval prolongation, a well‐recognized risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. Previous small studies of the electrocardiographic effect of energy drinks, some lacking a placebo control, have reached conflicting conclusions. Using a double‐blinded crossover trial design, the effect of 2 different caffeinated energy drinks and a caffeine‐free placebo drink on the QT interval was assessed in healthy volunteers with a normal QT interval at baseline. Both energy drinks produced an average maximal increase in heart rate–corrected QT interval (QTc) of 18 to 20 ms that persisted up to 4 hours after consumption. In contrast, the placebo drink was followed by only a small transient increase in QTc. Although no subject developed a QTc > 500 ms, both energy drinks resulted in QTc prolongation > 50 ms in 2 subjects, a range clearly associated with increased risk of arrhythmia. The effect of the energy drinks on blood pressure and heart rate was similar to that observed in previous studies.

### Association of dairy consumption with metabolic syndrome, hypertension and diabetes in 147 812 individuals from 21 countries [^301edfa3]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Figure 1
Association of (A) total dairy, (B) whole fat dairy alone, (C) low fat dairy alone and (D) among those who consumed both whole fat and low fat dairy with prevalent metabolic syndrome and its component (OR, 95% CI). Metabolic syndrome: defined as presence of any three of the four components: elevated blood pressure (defined as those on blood pressure lowering medication, or systolic blood pressure) ≥ 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 85 mm Hg); elevated waist circumference (defined as women with waist > 80 cm, men with waist ≥ 94 cm, except among Asians or South Americans in whom waist was ≥ 90 cm), reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (defined as men on cholesterol lowering medications or with HDL-C < 1 mmol/dL (40 mg/dL), or women with HDL-C < 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL)); elevated triglycerides (defined as triglyceride levels > 1.7 mmmol/dL (150 mg/dL)); and elevated fasting blood glucose (defined as as those on glucose lowering medications or with a fasting glucose value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L). OR models for metabolic syndrome and waist circumference are adjusted for age (continuous), sex, smoking status, education, location, physical activity, energy intake, percent energy from carbohydrate, fruit and vegetable intake, and study center as random effect. Models for whole dairy intake are adjusted for low fat dairy intake and vice versa. OR model for elevated blood pressure, low HDL-C, elevated triglycerides and elevated fasting blood glucose are adjusted for age (continuous), sex, body mass index (continuous), smoking status, location, education, physical activity, energy intake, quintiles of percent energy from carbohydrate, fruit and vegetable intake, and study center as random effect. Models for whole dairy intake are adjusted for low fat dairy intake and vice versa. Panel (A) shows a significant inverse association between total dairy intake and metabolic syndrome and each of its components, except low HDL-C (no association); (B) shows a significant inverse association between whole fat dairy (alone) intake and metabolic syndrome, elevated blood pressure, elevated waist circumference, elevated triglycerides, and elevated fasting blood glucose. No association was observed between whole fat dairy and low HDL-C; (C) shows no association between low fat dairy (alone) intake and metabolic syndrome and its components, except elevated triglycerides and elevated fasting blood glucose (a trend towards lower prevalence); and (D) shows a significant inverse association between consumption of both whole fat and low fat dairy and metabolic syndrome, elevated blood pressure and elevated triglycerides, and no association with elevated waist circumference or HDL-C or elevated fasting blood glucose.

Blood Pressure Effects

A significant difference in baseline‐adjusted pSBP (Figure 3) was evident 6 hours after energy drink consumption when compared with the caffeine arm (4.72 ± 4.67 mm Hg versus 0.83 ± 6.09 mm Hg, respectively; P = 0.01). A significant decrease in baseline‐adjusted AI was evident 6 hours post energy drink when compared with the caffeine arm (−3.72 ± 7.61 versus 1.50 ± 9.85; P = 0.02). No evidence of difference was seen with pDBP, cSBP, or cDBP at any time point between the 2 groups (all P > 0.07).

Patterns of Energy Drink Use and Associated Symptoms Among a Population of Connecticut Factory Workers 2016/05/01 By Galusha DH; Lefkowitz RY; Pensa MA;. File Language: Details Personal Author: Galusha DH; Lefkowitz RY; Pensa MA; Redlich CA; Stowe MH. Description: Caffeinated energy drinks are new and increasingly popular beverages with possible concerning health effects. With the rise in consumption of CEDs, there has been a concurrent rise in the number of emergency room visits related to adverse reactions and/or co-consumption with other substances. In addition to caffeine, CEDs contain vitamins, amino acids, and herbs. Consumers are often unaware of the ingredients in CEDs beyond caffeine or of their potential adverse health effects. The most commonly reported adverse effects of CEDs include sleep disturbance, racing heart, headache, stomach upset, and nervousness. There are also reports of seizures and deaths.

Consumption of CEDs has been correlated with decreased sleep in nightshift worker and poor quality sleep in female Japanese workers. 14 Also of concern to factory workers, caffeine may alter thermoregulation and fluid balance during periods of exercise. Recognizing the potential adverse health effects ofCEDs, their use in the workplace may be of concern. On routine preemployment testing, we unexpectedly found elevated serum creatinine levels with normal blood urea nitrogen levels in several factory workers. History revealed increased amino acid intake through CED consumption. Return to normal creatinine levels after cessation ofCEDs supported the conclusion that elevations were attributable to recent CED consumption. This finding prompted us to survey workers on their CED consumption habits and associated symptoms.

### How many alcoholic drinks might benefit an older person with hypertension? [^7fe6e39a]. Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Lowering alcohol intake reduces blood pressure and hence cardiovascular risk. However, abstainers have an increase in cardiovascular risk and the advice to reduce intake to low levels may not be sound. This review examines the effects of lowering alcohol consumption in terms of blood pressure and coronary heart disease (CHD). The relationship between both CHD and stroke and alcohol consumption, and the benefits and disadvantages of alcohol consumption in the general population, are discussed. Where available, the results of large meta-analyses are reported. It is concluded that the hypertensive patient over the age of 60 who drinks over 16 drinks per week should be advised to reduce his or her alcohol intake but a daily drink may be advisable and the patient should not stop drinking entirely. It is not suggested that the non-drinker should start drinking, but most hypertensives are over the age of 60 when community studies suggest that drinking alcohol does more good than harm.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^81838102]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — conclusions on risk and monitoring emphasize that energy drinks are frequently consumed and there are reports of morbidity and mortality associated with their consumption. In particular, individuals known to be more susceptible to adverse events include those of young age, small stature, caffeine-naïve or caffeine-sensitive, pregnant or breastfeeding women, those with certain medical conditions and/or taking certain medications, consuming multiple energy drinks in one session, and those with underlying cardiovascular or other diseases. Of critical importance, children and adolescents appear to be at particularly high risk of complications from energy drinks due to their small body size, being relatively caffeine naive, and potentially heavy and frequent consumption patterns, as well as the amounts of caffeine. Although most healthy adults can consume an energy drink without any significant, negative, acute health effects, the long-term effects of chronic consumption have not been well studied. Continued monitoring of adverse events related to energy drink consumption is needed to fully understand the rate, severity and nature of reactions to these products across the lifespan.

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^703ecabb]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Energy drinks (EDs) are sweetened beverages that contain multiple stimulants such as caffeine, guarana, or taurine. Since their market introduction in the 1980s, EDs have experienced massive marketing. – EDs are advertised as physical as well as mental performance enhancers and are particularly popular among the younger population; according to a survey conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), 68% of adolescents reported drinking EDs. Among them, 26% drink EDs at least 2 days per week.

Closely linked with their popularity, reports on adverse cardiovascular events, such as arterial hypertension or cardiomyopathy, associated with the consumption of EDs are rising. – Even though children and teenagers are considered the main ED consumer group, clinical studies investigating ED-induced effects on the pediatric cardiovascular system are lacking.

A recent study conducted by our department evaluated the acute effects of ED consumption on clinic blood pressure in healthy children and adolescents. In this particular study, participants consumed a single, bodyweight-adjusted ED amount and a placebo beverage matched in sugar content but without conventional ED ingredients. Systolic (SBP, mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP, mmHg) were measured at baseline as well as 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after beverage consumption. Interestingly, mean clinic SBP was shown to be up to 5.23 mmHg (p < 0.0001) and mean clinic DBP up to 3.29 mmHg (p < 0.001) higher after the ED intake when compared to the placebo consumption.

While these results indicate a significant ED-induced raise in clinic blood pressure within a 4-h period, it remains unclear whether acute ED consumption also affects the pediatric 24-h blood pressure profile. To the best of our knowledge, studies focusing on the ED-induced effects on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) are sparse and have not been conducted in a pediatric cohort yet. However, multiple studies suggest that 24-h blood pressure is a stronger predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality than clinic blood pressure. – Moreover, the assessment of 24-h blood pressure can be regarded as crucial for additional and precise cardiovascular risk assessment.

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of a single, bodyweight-adjusted ED dosage on 24-h ABPM in healthy children and adolescents.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^4a81fdc0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at University of the Pacific (Stockton, CA). All participants were provided written informed consent consistent with university requirements for clinical studies involving human subjects. The clinical study was registered on(NCT03196908).

This was a randomized, double‐masked (participants and care providers), placebo‐controlled, crossover clinical trial conducted at a university campus setting (July 2017 to December 2017). Healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 40 years who were willing to avoid ingestion of caffeine and energy drinks for 48 hours before each study day were eligible for enrollment. Participants were excluded if they had any known medical condition (confirmed through participant interview), were pregnant or breastfeeding, were current smokers, had a baseline QTc > 450 ms, or brachial blood pressure > 140/90 mm Hg. Those who were taking any chronic prescription or over‐the‐counter medications were excluded except those who had been taking oral contraceptives for over 1 month. An overnight fast (with allowance for water only) was required preceding every study day, and no food was allowed during the study monitoring period. A commercially available non‐caffeinated granola bar (Nature Valley Crunchy Oats 'N Honey, General Mills) was provided after the 180‐minute time point upon participant request.

Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 intervention phases using a computer‐generated code from. Participants received two 16‐oz bottles of a commercially available caffeinated energy drink brand (drink A), another brand of a caffeinated energy drink (drink B), or a placebo‐drink (placebo) on 3 separate days with a minimum 6‐day washout period in‐between. The beverages were consumed within a 60‐minute period but no faster than 1 bottle in 30 minutes. Based on the package labeling, both drink A and drink B contained caffeine (304–320 mg/32‐fl oz), taurine, glucuronolactone, and vitamins along with other proprietary ingredients. 24 Some differences between the 2 energy drink brands include the presence of carnitine, guarana, and panax ginseng. The placebo drink contained carbonated water, lime juice, and cherry flavoring. All drinks were packaged in identical, masked containers prepared within 24 hours of administration and stored in a refrigerator before administration.

Significant prolongation in the QT interval was also evident within the first hour after energy drink consumption but these are thought to be HR related changes. There appears to be a mild PR shortening effect and is currently thought to be clinically non‐significant. Most previous studies used the Bazett's correction formula, but it is known to under correct at low heart rates. 46 Conversely, the Fridericia formula has been shown to be an acceptable alternate correction formula when compared with the Bazett's. 47 Our results are significant regardless of the heart rate correction formula used (Bazett's or Fridericia's). However, it is important to note that QTc prolongation does not necessitate onset of torsades de pointes and is simply a risk factor. While our study incorporates many aspects of a "Thorough QT/QTc Study", assay‐sensitivity could not be assessed due to the lack of a positive‐control (eg, moxifloxacin). 27

Individuals with acquired or congenital long QT syndrome and those with hypertension should be more vigilant and limit their energy drink intake. Based on currently available data, the class of energy drinks, rather than one particular product, warrants use with caution.

### Sex-specific associations between alcohol consumption and incidence of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^f7353d13]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite these limitations, the results are consistent in showing a dose‐response relationship between level of consumption and risk of hypertension based on observational data, corroborated by randomized controlled trials. For men, there seems to be no lower threshold, whereas for women, the dose‐response seems to emerge only beyond 2 drinks a day. For both sexes, no protective effect could be found (and was not expected given the biological pathways 10). What could explain the differences between men and women? One explanation could be the difference in heavy drinking occasions within an overall average intake of alcohol of less than 2 drinks. An average of 2 drinks/day could be achieved by actually drinking 2 drinks every day, or by drinking 7 drinks each on Saturday and Sunday. The latter has different effects on blood pressure 66 and thus on risk of hypertension. Further research (both observational and experimental) is necessary, however, to ascertain the effects of pattern of drinking (including peak blood alcohol level) on hypertension and thus the repeated plea to include more measures on patterns of drinking into all epidemiological work. 67, 68

### Reducing population salt intake worldwide: from evidence to implementation [^eef0bc75]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Raised blood pressure is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, responsible for 62% of stroke and 49% of coronary heart disease. There is overwhelming evidence that dietary salt is the major cause of raised blood pressure and that a reduction in salt intake lowers blood pressure, thereby, reducing blood pressure-related diseases. Several lines of evidence including ecological, population, and prospective cohort studies, as well as outcome trials, demonstrate that a reduction in salt intake is related to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence also suggests that a high salt intake may directly increase the risk of stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy, and renal disease; is associated with obesity through soft drink consumption; is related to renal stones and osteoporosis; is linked to the severity of asthma; and is probably a major cause of stomach cancer. In most developed countries, a reduction in salt intake can be achieved by a gradual and sustained reduction in the amount of salt added to foods by the food industry. In other countries where most of the salt consumed comes from salt added during cooking or from sauces, a public health campaign is needed to encourage consumers to use less salt. Several countries have already reduced salt intake. The challenge now is to spread this out to all other countries. A modest reduction in population salt intake worldwide will result in a major improvement in public health.

### Reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with reduced blood pressure: a prospective study among United States adults [^c5528b20]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has been associated with an elevated risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes mellitus. However, the effects of SSB consumption on blood pressure (BP) are uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between changes in SSB consumption and changes in BP among adults.

Methods and Results

This was a prospective analysis of 810 adults who participated in the PREMIER Study (an 18-month behavioral intervention trial). BP and dietary intake (by two 24-hour recalls) were measured at baseline and at 6 and 18 months. Mixed-effects models were applied to estimate the changes in BP in responding to changes in SSB consumption. At baseline, mean SSB intake was 0.9 ± 1.0 servings per day (10.5 ± 11.9 fl oz/d), and mean systolic BP/diastolic BP was 134.9 ± 9.6/84.8 ± 4.2 mm Hg. After potential confounders were controlled for, a reduction in SSB of 1 serving per day was associated with a 1.8-mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 2.4) reduction in systolic BP and 1.1-mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.4) reduction in diastolic BP over 18 months. After additional adjustment for weight change over the same period, a reduction in SSB intake was still significantly associated with reductions in systolic and diastolic BPs (P < 0.05). Reduced intake of sugars was also significantly associated with reduced BP. No association was found for diet beverage consumption or caffeine intake and BP. These findings suggest that sugars may be the nutrients that contribute to the observed association between SSB and BP.

Conclusions

Reduced consumption of SSB and sugars was significantly associated with reduced BP. Reducing SSB and sugar consumption may be an important dietary strategy to lower BP.

### Alcohol consumption and the risk of stroke among hypertensive and overweight men [^29b2e689]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

High blood pressure and overweight are risk factors for stroke. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between alcohol consumption and the risk of stroke according to the level of blood pressure and body weight. This study is a population-based sample of men with an average follow-up of 14.9 years from eastern Finland. A total of 2,599 men with no history of stroke at baseline participated. During the follow-up period, 224 strokes occurred, of which 181 were ischemic strokes. After adjustment for age, year of examination, socioeconomic status, serum LDL cholesterol, body mass index, smoking and energy expenditure of physical activity (kcal/day), there was a significant trend of an increased risk for any and ischemic stroke among hypertensive men. Hypertensive (blood pressure of over 140/90 mm Hg) men, who did not consume alcohol had a 1.72-fold (95% CI 1.12–2.66; p = 0.014) relative risk (RR) for any stroke and a 1.90-fold (95% CI 1.15–3.13; p = 0.012) RR for ischemic stroke. Among hypertensive men who consumed alcohol RR was 1.86-fold (95% CI 1.20–2.89; p = 0.005) for any stroke and 2.02-fold (95% CI 1.21–3.35; p = 0.007) for ischemic stroke. Men who did not consume alcohol with elevated BMI (≥ 26.4 kg/m²) had a 1.63-fold RR (95% CI 1.11–2.40; p = 0.013) for any stroke and a 1.33-fold RR (95% CI 0.87–2.04; p = 0.199) for ischemic stroke after adjusting for risk factors. Overweight men (≥ 26.4 kg/m²) who consumed alcohol had a 1.73-fold RR (95% CI 1.18–2.54; p = 0.005) for any stroke and a 1.71-fold RR (95% CI 1.14–2.57; p = 0.010) for ischemic stroke after being adjusted for risk factors. In conclusion, this population-based prospective study shows that hypertensive and overweight men who consumed alcohol had an increased risk for stroke.

### Important food sources of fructose-containing sugars and incident hypertension: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^c2fafe03]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

We also identified a U‐shaped dose‐dependent relationship between incident hypertension and 100% fruit juice intake, where intake below 200 mL showed protective associations with hypertension. The maximum protective association appeared to be between doses of 50 and 150 mL (≈0.5–1.0 servings), after which the dose‐response curve suggested increasing RR with increasing dose, and even suggested harmful associations over intakes of 200 mL. This is in line with some national health guidelines, in which a 150‐mL glass of fruit juice contributes toward daily fruit consumption. 73 Other cohort studies have shown that 100% fruit juice, compared with fruit drinks, has neutral 74 or even protective 75 associations with incident cardiometabolic disease. The protective association of 100% fruit juice noted at moderate doses may be the result of the range of nutrients and bioactive compounds within the juice. 76 However, the potential for harmful associations at higher doses may be attributable to the consumption of excess calories outweighing any potentially protective nutrients contained within 100% fruit juice. 77

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^893b38b8]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Effects of energy drinks on 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement

The single, bodyweight-adjusted ED consumption during the morning hours led to a significantly higher SBP, DBP, MAP, cSBP, cDBP, and a significantly higher prevalence of DBP measurements classified as arterial hypertension at daytime compared with the placebo beverage. On average, SBP, DBP, and MAP at daytime were 3.33%, 4.50%, and 3.86% higher after ED consumption.

In addition, DBP and cDBP at nighttime displayed significantly higher values after acute ED consumption. On average, SBP, DBP, and MAP at nighttime were 2.88%, 3.74%, and 3.18% higher after ED consumption.

Within the 24-h period after beverage consumption, a significantly higher SBP, DBP, MAP, cSBP, and cDBP was observed in the ED group. Twenty-four-hour PWV tended to be higher after the acute ED consumption but did not reach statistical significance. On average, 24-h SBP, DBP, and MAP were 3.33%, 4.76%, and 3.92% higher after ED consumption.

Table 2 gives detailed information on 24-h ABPM for daytime, nighttime, and the overall 24-h period after beverage consumption. Moreover, Fig. 1 demonstrates average SBP, DBP, and MAP profile during the 24-h period after ED and placebo beverage consumption.

### Association of alcohol intake with hypertension in type 2 diabetes mellitus: the ACCORD trial [^341c5192]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Background Heavy alcohol consumption has a well-established association with hypertension. However, doubt persists whether moderate alcohol consumption has a similar link. This relationship is not well-studied in patients with diabetes mellitus. We aimed to describe the association of alcohol consumption with prevalent hypertension in participants in the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial. Methods and Results Alcohol consumption was categorized as none, light (1–7 drinks/week), moderate (8–14 drinks/week), and heavy (≥ 15 drinks/week). Blood pressure was categorized using American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines as normal, elevated blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension. Multivariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between alcohol consumption and prevalent hypertension. A total of 10 200 eligible participants were analyzed. Light alcohol consumption was not associated with elevated blood pressure or any stage hypertension. Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with elevated blood pressure, stage 1, and stage 2 hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.04–3.11, P = 0.03; OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.05–2.60, P = 0.03; and OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.03–2.54, P = 0.03, respectively). Heavy alcohol consumption was associated with elevated blood pressure, stage 1, and stage 2 hypertension (OR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.17–3.12, P = 0.01; OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.03–6.17, P = 0.03; and OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.28–7.22, P = 0.01, respectively). Conclusions Despite prior research, our findings show moderate alcohol consumption is associated with hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular risk. We also note a dose-risk relationship with the amount of alcohol consumed and the degree of hypertension.

### Comparison of the effects of energy drink versus caffeine supplementation on indices of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure [^d69d67ef]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular events associated with energy drink consumption have been reported, but few data exist to delineate the hemodynamic effects of energy drinks.

Objective

To compare the effects of an energy drink versus caffeine supplementation on blood pressure (BP) indices as measured by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM).

Methods

Healthy, nonsmoking, normotensive volunteers (aged 18–45 years) taking no medications were enrolled in a single-center, open-label, 2-period crossover pilot study. During each study period, subjects received either an energy drink (Red Bull Energy Drink, each dose containing 80 mg of caffeine and 1000 mg of taurine in an 8.3-oz serving) or a control (compounded caffeine solution, each dose containing 80 mg of caffeine solution in 8 oz of bottled water) at 0800, 1100, 1500, and 1900 hours and underwent 24-hour ABPM. The study periods were separated by a washout period (4–30 days). Mean 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), and mean arterial (MAP) BP; BP load; and percent nocturnal dipping were compared between study periods.

Results

Nine subjects (5 females, mean [SD] age 27.7 [5.0] years) completed the study. Mean 24-hour SBP (123.2 vs 117.4 mm Hg, p = 0.04), DBP (73.6 vs 68.2 mm Hg, p = 0.02), and MAP (90.1 vs 84.8 mm Hg, p = 0.03) were significantly higher during energy drink supplementation versus caffeine supplementation. Daytime DBP (77.0 vs 72.0 mm Hg, p = 0.04) also was significantly higher with the energy drink versus caffeine supplementation. Trends in higher daytime SBP (127.0 vs 121.9 mm Hg, p = 0.05) and MAP (93.6 vs 88.6 mm Hg, p = 0.05) were recorded with energy drink supplementation versus caffeine supplementation. Nighttime SBP and DBP loads were significantly higher with the energy drink, but nocturnal dipping did not differ significantly between study periods.

Conclusions

Single-day energy drink supplementation increased mean 24-hour and daytime BP compared to caffeine control in this pilot study. Additional research is warranted to better understand the hemodynamic effects of energy drink consumption.

### Obesity and hypertension: Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2023 [^f0864be1]. Obesity Pillars (2023). High credibility.

Blood pressure measurement considerations in obesity and hypertension include recognition and management of white-coat and masked hypertension and overstimulation. White-coat hypertension may increase readings and such patients may benefit from home blood pressure (BP) monitoring and/or ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), whereas masked hypertension shows normal office measurements but elevated ambulatory or home readings and patients with masked hypertension are at risk for cardiovascular disease. Overstimulation guidance states patients should avoid caffeine, energy drinks, decongestants, physical exercise, stressful situations, full bladder, and/or smoking for at least 30 minutes prior to BP measurement; if anxiety-producing circumstances precede the visit, the patient should be given the opportunity to calm down in a quiet room for 30 minutes or longer, and patients with full bladder, and/or who feel the need to urinate, may have increased blood pressure and should void prior to having blood pressure taken.

Conclusions

Despite prior research, our findings show moderate alcohol consumption is associated with hypertension in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and elevated cardiovascular risk. We also note a dose‐risk relationship with the amount of alcohol consumed and the degree of hypertension.

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^43f5610c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Caffeine in doses < 400 mg is typically not considered arrhythmogenic, but little is known about the additional ingredients in energy drinks. We evaluated the ECG and blood pressure (BP) effects of high-volume energy drink consumption compared with caffeine alone.

Methods and Results

This was a randomized, double-blind, controlled, crossover study in 18 young, healthy volunteers. Participants consumed either 946 mL (32 ounces) of energy drink or caffeinated control drink, both of which contained 320 mg of caffeine, separated by a 6-day washout period. ECG, peripheral BP, and central BP measurements were obtained at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post study drink consumption. The time-matched, baseline-adjusted changes were compared. The change in corrected QT interval from baseline in the energy drink arm was significantly higher than the caffeine arm at 2 hours (0.44 ± 18.4 ms versus -10.4 ± 14.8 ms, respectively; P = 0.02). The QTc changes were not different at other time points. While both the energy drink and caffeine arms raised systolic BP in a similar fashion initially, the systolic BP was significantly higher at 6 hours when compared with the caffeine arm (4.72 ± 4.67 mm Hg versus 0.83 ± 6.09 mm Hg, respectively; P = 0.01). Heart rate, diastolic BP, central systolic BP, and central diastolic BP showed no evidence of a difference between groups at any time point. Post energy drink, augmentation index was lower at 6 hours.

Conclusions

The corrected QT interval and systolic BP were significantly higher post high-volume energy drink consumption when compared with caffeine alone. Larger clinical trials validating these findings and evaluation of noncaffeine ingredients within energy drinks are warranted.

### Important food sources of fructose-containing sugars and incident hypertension: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies [^fd5cf211]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In our systematic review and meta‐analysis, pooled analyses of 26 reports of 15 prospective cohort studies involving 930 677 participants with 363 459 incident cases of hypertension found that SSBs had a harmful association with incident hypertension whereas fruit and yogurt had protective associations with incident hypertension. One hundred percent fruit juice showed a U‐shaped dose‐response association with hypertension, showing protection at moderate doses (100–250 mL). There was no association of fruit drinks, dairy desserts, or sweet snacks with hypertension.

Findings in the Context of the Literature

Our results are consistent with established research on the harmful association between SSBs and incident hypertension. Our previous systematic review and meta‐analysis found a significant 12% increase in incident hypertension when comparing highest to lowest SSBs intake. 8 This present study included more studies covering a wider range of cohorts and found a comparable 10% increase in incident hypertension with 1‐serving (355‐mL)/d intake using the linear dose response and 11% increase at 1 serving using the nonlinear dose response. We observed evidence for nonlinearity for SSBs, but the 2 curves (linear and nonlinear) visually suggested high similarity; the difference, though statistically significant, is clinically irrelevant. The dose‐response relationship suggested an increase in risk of hypertension with SSBs intake at all higher doses when compared with no consumption. Other, more‐recent systematic reviews and meta‐analyses have identified a similar association between SSBs intake and incident hypertension. 67, 68 Consistent harmful associations have also been shown with other related cardiometabolic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. 69, 70 A possible explanation is that SSBs provide a form of liquid calories that produce less satiety than consumption of solid calories, resulting in overall increased energy intake, weight gain, and downstream hypertension. 71 Another is that the association between SSBs intake and incident hypertension is confounded by an unhealthy lifestyle. 72 Though the cohort studies included in our analyses consistently controlled for variables such as energy intake, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol intake, residual confounding could have contributed to the harmful association between SSBs intake and incident hypertension.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

High blood pressure in adults — alcohol intake and BP: Compared with average alcohol intake of 12 g per day (1 standard drink), relative risks for incident hypertension were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84–0.94) at 0 g/day, 1.11 (95% CI: 1.07–1.15) at 24 g/day, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.14–1.30) at 36 g/day, and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.18–1.49) at 48 g/day, indicating the lowest risk with abstinence. In controlled trials among normotensive drinkers, reducing alcohol intake by at least 50% or to abstinence is associated with BP reduction, especially when baseline intake is ≥ 4 drinks per day. Among those consuming ≥ 6 drinks per day who reduced intake by 50% on average, mean BP decreased by 5.5/4.0 mm Hg; reductions were significant but lower with baseline intake of 3 to 5 drinks per day, and at ≤ 2 drinks per day no significant BP reduction was observed. The text concludes that aiming for abstinence appears to be optimal.

Grading of the Evidence

Overall quality and strength of the evidence at was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. 37 Our certainty in the evidence was graded as "high", "moderate", "low", or "very low". Observational studies receive an initial grade of "low" and then can be down‐ or upgraded based on prespecified criteria. Criteria to downgrade included risk of bias (weight of studies show risk of bias as assessed by NOS < 6), inconsistency (substantial unexplained interstudy heterogeneity, I² > 50%; P < 0.10), indirectness (presence of factors that limit the generalizability of the results), imprecision in the pooled‐risk estimate (the 95% CI for risk estimates are wide or cross a minimally important difference of 10% for protection or harm [RR, 0.9–1.1]), and publication bias (evidence of small‐study effects). 37 In contrast, criteria to upgrade included a large magnitude of effect (RR > 2 or RR < 0.5 in the absence of plausible confounders), dose‐response gradient, and attenuation of the pooled‐effect estimate by plausible confounders. 37

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^23623849]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Statistical Analysis

Based on previous studies, assuming a difference of 6 ms in the QTc interval in the baseline‐adjusted, placebo‐corrected changes between the 2 energy drinks (SD = 11 ms, 80% power, and α = 5%), 29 volunteers would be needed for the study. 25 We planned to enroll 40 participants anticipating ≈25% dropout rate. An intention‐to‐treat analysis was performed using the last‐observation‐carried‐forward methodology to account for missing data.

A repeated‐measures analysis of variance, which assumes a compound symmetry covariance structure, was performed with the main effects of intervention, time, and an interaction of intervention and time (R version 3.5.2). The authors verified that this assumption was a reasonable one for their data. Results of this analyses called for a 2‐way analysis of variance for each end point (baseline‐adjusted) at each time point, with a post hoc Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD), to assess for differences between the 3 interventions (adjusted for subject variability, however, not adjusted for multiple time points) (Table S1). In addition, the maximum value for each end point within each time frame (30–240 minutes) was identified (referred to as the "maximum" time point) to assess the peak effect because of interindividual variability and was analyzed in the same manner as above. The data were also analyzed using the Bonferroni adjustment, which did not change the interpretation of the study (data not included). Finally, the baseline‐adjusted, placebo‐corrected changes between drink A and drink B were also compared using the paired t test. Data analyses were independently performed by a masked statistician. All QTc data are reported using the Bazett's correction formula unless explicitly stated otherwise. Data are reported as mean ± SD except in figures (mean ± SE).

### Acute effects of whey protein, alone and mixed with other macronutrients, on blood pressure and heart rate in older men [^cfb07366]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The hypotensive effect of mixed macronutrient drinks is dependent on overall energy intake rather than macronutrient composition of a drink and may be sustained for at least 3 h. Pure whey protein drinks may, accordingly represent the best approach to maximise protein intake while minimising the potential for deleterious BP falls in older people.

### The potential adverse health effects of energy drinks… [^1f0bf34a]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Because energy drinks are becoming more popular in the United States, family physicians should be familiar with them and their potentially harmful effects. Energy drinks are distinctly different from soft drinks or sports drinks. Soft drinks contain flavorings, sugars or artificial sweeteners, and often caffeine; sports drinks contain sugars and electrolytes. In contrast, energy drinks typically contain more caffeine than soft drinks, as well as sugars and dietary supplements. Energy drinks are marketed aggressively with claims that they will boost performance, attention, and mood, or decrease weight and reaction time. 1 The full list of supplements used in energy drinks is lengthy. Many energy drinks contain herbal products, such as guarana, ginseng, and yohimbine. They may also contain the amino acids taurine and 5-hydroxytryptophan, or large doses of B vitamins.

The growing literature sheds light on acute health problems associated with these products, although they have not been in existence long enough to build a solid, evidence-based appreciation of potential long-term effects. Perhaps the greatest concern about energy drinks is the amount of caffeine they contain, which generally far exceeds that in other beverages. Energy drinks can contain more than 500 mg of caffeine per serving, whereas a cup of coffee has 75 to 150 mg of caffeine and a typical cola has only 35 mg. 1, 5 Some of the additional herbs, such as guarana, also contain caffeine. Therefore, the amount of caffeine listed on the label can be less than what is actually in the drink. The effects of drinking large amounts of caffeine range from anxiety, insomnia, and tachycardia, to acute caffeine intoxication and withdrawal.
5. Additional concerns relate to the effects of other additives and their potential interactions with medications.

Bitter orange can cause cardiovascular adverse effects, ginseng can exacerbate bleeding diatheses and lower blood glucose levels, and guarana can affect sleeping and anxiety disorders. 6 As for interactions, 5-hydroxytryptophan should not be combined with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, yohimbine can interact with tricyclic antidepressants and antihypertensives, and ginseng can alter the effectiveness of warfarin and digoxin. 7.

### Intake of energy drinks before and during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes [^9bc7ceb3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Energy drinks are beverages that are advertised to increase alertness, energy levels, and physical performance, often containing caffeine, guarana, taurine, and/or other substances. Sales of energy drinks have substantially increased by 240% in the US and worldwide since 1987, reaching over $9.7 billion in US sales in 2015. Energy drinks are popular especially among young adults; the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that 5.5% of adults aged 20 to 39 years consume energy drinks. For college students, surveys conducted among hundreds of participants showed that 16% of participants were frequent consumers of energy drinks.

Marketing campaigns of energy drinks have often targeted young people. However, there are concerns about the safety of energy drinks. Acute intake of energy drinks has been shown to be associated with increased systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Cross-sectional studies found that energy drink intake was positively associated with mental health symptoms, such as stress, anxiety, and depression, and caffeine-related health complaints, including insomnia, headache, irritation, tiredness, and fatigue. Case reports showed that energy drinks may be associated with nausea, vomiting, hepatic and kidney damage, and even death. Given that the majority of energy drink consumers are young adults of reproductive age, including individuals who may become pregnant, it is of high importance to examine associations of energy drink intake with adverse pregnancy outcomes (APOs). However, few studies have addressed this issue, which is likely due to the lack of available longitudinal data allowing the prospective assessment of the association between energy drink intake and pregnancy-related outcomes. In this study, we examined the potential association between energy drink intake before and during pregnancy with APOs in 2 ongoing prospective cohort studies actively observing women of reproductive age: the Nurses' Health Study 3 (NHS3) and the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS).

### Randomized controlled trial of high-volume energy drink versus caffeine consumption on ECG and hemodynamic parameters [^51acb7a6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Caffeine in doses < 400 mg is typically not considered arrhythmogenic, but little is known about the additional ingredients in energy drinks. We evaluated the ECG and blood pressure effects of high‐volume energy drink consumption compared with caffeine alone.

Methods and Results

This was a randomized, double‐blind, controlled, crossover study in 18 young, healthy volunteers. Participants consumed either 946 mL (32 ounces) of energy drink or caffeinated control drink, both of which contained 320 mg of caffeine, separated by a 6‐day washout period. peripheral, and centralmeasurements were obtained at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours post study drink consumption. The time‐matched, baseline‐adjusted changes were compared. The change in correctedinterval from baseline in the energy drink arm was significantly higher than the caffeine arm at 2 hours (0.44 ± 18.4 ms versus −10.4 ± 14.8 ms, respectively; P = 0.02). Thec changes were not different at other time points. While both the energy drink and caffeine arms raised systolicin a similar fashion initially, the systolicwas significantly higher at 6 hours when compared with the caffeine arm (4.72 ± 4.67 mm Hg versus 0.83 ± 6.09 mm Hg, respectively; P = 0.01). Heart rate, diastolic, central systolic, and central diastolicshowed no evidence of a difference between groups at any time point. Post energy drink, augmentation index was lower at 6 hours.

Conclusions

The corrected QT interval and systolicwere significantly higher post high‐volume energy drink consumption when compared with caffeine alone. Larger clinical trials validating these findings and evaluation of noncaffeine ingredients within energy drinks are warranted.

### Protein supplementation lowers blood pressure in overweight adults: effect of dietary proteins on blood pressure (PROPRES), a randomized trial [^4299c9fb]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Dietary protein intake may help to manage blood pressure (BP) and prevent complications associated with elevated BP.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine whether 4 wk of increased protein intake (∼25% compared with ∼15% of energy intake that isoenergetically replaces carbohydrate intake) lowers office and daytime BP compared with increased carbohydrate intake.

Design

A randomized, double-blind, parallel study compared consumption of 3 × 20 g protein/d (20% pea, 20% soy, 30% egg, and 30% milk-protein isolate) with 3 × 20 g maltodextrin/d. Protein or maltodextrin were isoenergetically substituted for a sugar-sweetened drink. Primary outcomes were office and daytime BP. A total of 99 men and women [age range: 20–70 y; BMI (in kg/m²): 25–35] with untreated elevated BP (BP ≥ 130/85 and < 160/100 mm Hg) were randomly assigned. Ninety-four completers (51 subjects in the maltodextrin group, 43 subjects in the protein group) were included in the analyses.

Results

Office systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 4.9 ± 1.7 mm Hg (P = 0.005) and 2.7 ± 1.3 mm Hg (P = 0.05) lower, respectively, in the protein group. Daytime SBP was 4.6 ± 1.7 mm Hg lower in the protein group (P = 0.006), whereas daytime DBP did not differ between groups (P = 0.37). Urinary sodium excretion was higher in the maltodextrin group (P = 0.004).

Conclusion

Increased protein intake, at the expense of maltodextrin, lowers BP in overweight adults with upper-range prehypertension and grade 1 hypertension. This trial was registered at www.trialregister.nl as NTR 1362.

### Detrimental effects of energy drink consumption on platelet and endothelial function [^3d081960]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Energy drink consumption has been anecdotally linked with sudden cardiac death and, more recently, myocardial infarction. As myocardial infarction is strongly associated with both platelet and endothelial dysfunction, we tested the hypothesis that energy drink consumption alters platelet and endothelial function.

Methods

Fifty healthy volunteers (34 male, aged 22 ± 2 years) participated in the study. Platelet aggregation and endothelial function were tested before, and 1 hour after, the consumption of 250 mL (1 can) of a sugar-free energy drink. Platelet function was assessed by adenosine diphosphate-induced (1 micromol/L) optical aggregometry in platelet-rich plasma. Endothelial function was assessed via changes in peripheral arterial tonometry and expressed as the reactive hyperemia index (RHI).

Results

Compared with baseline values, there was a significant increase in platelet aggregation following energy drink consumption, while no change was observed with control (13.7 ± 3.7% vs 0.3 ± 0.8% aggregation, respectively, P < .01). Similarly, RHI decreased following energy drink consumption (-0.33 ± 0.13 vs 0.07 ± 0.12 RHI [control], P < .05). Mean arterial pressure significantly increased following energy drink consumption, compared with control (P < .05). Heart rate was unaffected by energy drink consumption.

Conclusion

Energy drink consumption acutely increases platelet aggregation and decreases endothelial function in healthy young adults.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^b7604981]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 blood pressure in chronic kidney disease — other lifestyle interventions and research needs — The Work Group notes that lifestyle measures such as weight loss among those who are overweight or obese, reducing alcohol consumption among those who drink heavily, and adopting a heart-healthy diet 'have been demonstrated in RCTs to lower BP in the general population', and 'may also have BP-lowering benefits in patients with CKD', where 'it may be reasonable to consider them when they can be applied safely and without side effects', but 'insufficient data on the risks or benefits of these interventions on BP in CKD populations per se preclude specific recommendations in this guideline'. Research recommendations include: 'Conduct clinical trials evaluating different dietary sodium reduction strategies for prevention of clinical endpoints of critical importance for CKD populations, including kidney failure, CV disease, and mortality', that 'There are inconsistencies among the studies examining the relationship of dietary sodium intake with health outcomes in persons with and without CKD. Additional research is required to investigate the consistency of effects of dietary sodium changes on health benefits and harms across different causes and severities of CKD', and that 'It is unknown if there is a minimum dietary sodium level in CKD below which health risks are increased'.

### Effects of repeated binge drinking on blood pressure levels and other cardiovascular health metrics in young adults: national health and nutrition examination survey, 2011–2014 [^44b61fa8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

In middle‐aged and older adults, binge drinking is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and hypertension. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Binge drinking is also associated with an increased likelihood of developing prehypertension, previously defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) between 120 and 140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 70 and 90 mm Hg. 6 In nearly all population‐based studies examining the effects of alcohol on blood pressure (BP) and other cardiovascular metrics, young adults (18‐30 years) and those in middle adulthood (31‐45 years) are underrepresented. 1, 7 In the United States high rates of binge drinking are prevalent in both of these age cohorts. 8 Binge drinking is often defined as consuming 5 drinks or more in a row for men (≥ 4 drinks for women) per occasion within the past 30 days. 7

Present‐day young adults consume 6 to 7 drinks per binge‐drinking episode (exceeding the current binge threshold of 4+/5+ drinks per episode) and binge drink several times a week. 9, 10, 11, 12 Compared with previous generations, the intensity (ie, 6‐7 drinks) and regularity (several times per week) of binge drinking may place today's young adults at greater risk for more profound rates of alcohol‐related harm, such as elevated BP and increased prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors. In particular, elevated BP is one of the strongest, most modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 13 Even among normotensive individuals, small reductions in average BP may have a marked impact on the future development of cardiovascular disease. 14 The new High Blood Pressure Clinical Practice Guideline defines "elevated BP" as a systolic BP between 120 and 129 mm Hg and diastolic > 80 mm Hg. 15 In the United States it is estimated that alcohol consumption may account for close to 10% of the population burden of hypertension. 15

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between repeated binge drinking and BP as well as lipid and fasting glucose levels in adults between 18 and 45 years of age. We also sought to determine if there were differences in these associations between men and women. We analyzed data from NHANES (the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) for male and female 18‐ to 45‐year‐olds who were non–binge drinkers, binge drank 1 to 12 times, or binge drank > 12 times in the past year. 16

### The buzz on energy drinks | School nutrition… [^c120263a]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- An energy drink contains large amounts of caffeine.
- Students consume energy drinks for extra energy.
- 30%–50% of adolescents are reported to consume energy drinks.
- Energy drinks can have harmful effects.
- The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that adolescents do not consume energy drinks. Why it's an issue An energy drink typically contains large amounts of caffeine, added sugars, other additives, and legal stimulants. The legal stimulants can increase alertness, attention, energy. They can also increase blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. Energy drinks are often used by students for an energy boost. However, the stimulants in these drinks can have a harmful effect on the nervous system. The potential dangers of energy drinks In 2011, 1, 499 adolescents aged 12–17 years went to the emergency room for an energy-drink–related emergency.

Some of the dangers of energy drinks include:

- Dehydration.
- Heart complications.
- Anxiety.
- Insomnia. How much caffeine is okay. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that caffeine and other stimulants in energy drinks have no place children's and adolescents' diets. What you can do
- Teachers and other school staff can educate students about the danger of consuming too much caffeine, including energy drinks.
- Coaches can educate athletes about the difference between energy drinks and sports drinks — and potential dangers of highly caffeinated beverages.
- School nutrition staff can provide healthy beverages such as fat-free/low-fat milk, water, and 100% juice.
- **Parents, school staff, and community members can**:
- Join the school or district wellness committee that sets the policies for health and wellness.
- Establish or revise nutrition standards to address the sale and marketing of energy drinks in school settings.

### Energy drinks: effects on pediatric 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. A randomized trial [^919086fa]. Pediatric Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Detailed information on the study population and design was given in recent publications conducted by our department and will be shortly summarized in the following.– For this study, healthy children and adolescents aged 10–18 years were prospectively enrolled within the greater Munich (Germany) area via public calls. Before enrollment, study participants were examined for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were as follows: presence of chronic conditions (e.g. congenital heart disease, arterial hypertension, presence of severe dysrhythmia), history of sudden heart death within the family, known allergies against beverage ingredients, regular use of medication as well as the use of pro re nata medication with effects on the cardiovascular function, regular use of drugs including smoking and alcohol consumption, pregnancy. Bodyweight (kg) and height (cm) were assessed. In minor study participants, weight classification was defined according to body mass index (BMI, kg/m²) percentiles (P.) for a German reference population. Weight classification in study participants ≥ 18 years of age was determined as follows: normal weight if BMI < 25 kg/m², overweight if BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² but < 30 kg/m², obese if BMI ≥ 30 kg/m². Caffeine consumption behavior was defined according to Shah et al. For the assessment of ED consumption behavior, similar definitions were applied.–

### Soft drink consumption and risk of developing cardiometabolic risk factors and the metabolic syndrome in middle-aged adults in the community [^fffda10b]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Consumption of soft drinks has been linked to obesity in children and adolescents, but it is unclear whether it increases metabolic risk in middle-aged individuals.

Methods and Results

We related the incidence of metabolic syndrome and its components to soft drink consumption in participants in the Framingham Heart Study (6039 person-observations, 3470 in women; mean age 52.9 years) who were free of baseline metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence of ≥ 3 of the following: waist circumference ≥ 35 inches (women) or ≥ 40 inches (men); fasting blood glucose ≥ 100 mg/dL; serum triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL; blood pressure ≥ 135/85 mm Hg; and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol < 40 mg/dL (men) or < 50 mg/dL (women). Multivariable models included adjustments for age, sex, physical activity, smoking, dietary intake of saturated fat, trans fat, fiber, magnesium, total calories, and glycemic index. Cross-sectionally, individuals consuming ≥ 1 soft drink per day had a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.69) than those consuming < 1 drink per day. On follow-up (mean of 4 years), new-onset metabolic syndrome developed in 717 of 4033 participants (17.8%) consuming < 1 drink/day and in 433 of 2006 persons (21.6%) consuming ≥ 1 soft drink/day Consumption of ≥ 1 soft drink per day was associated with increased odds of developing metabolic syndrome (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.20 to 1.74), obesity (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.68), increased waist circumference (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.56), impaired fasting glucose (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.48), higher blood pressure (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.96 to 1.44), hypertriglyceridemia (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.51), and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR, 1.32; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64).

Conclusions

In middle-aged adults, soft drink consumption is associated with a higher prevalence and incidence of multiple metabolic risk factors.

### The wrong white crystals: not salt but sugar as aetiological in hypertension and cardiometabolic disease [^df49381a]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Current levels of sugar consumption and dietary guidelines

Approximately 300 years ago humans were only consuming a few pounds of sugar per year. More recent estimates suggest intakes in the US population anywhere from 77 to 152 lbs of sugar per year, with 13% consuming at least 25% of their total caloric intake as added sugars. This level of consumption equates to an approximate average intake of added sugars of 24–47 teaspoons (about 100–200 g) per day, with an average daily fructose consumption of 83.1 g. Table 1 suggests how such large intake may be possible, showing some representative foods and the sugar loads associated with their consumption. In a study of over 1000 American adolescents (aged 14–18) the average daily intake of added sugars was 389 g for boys and 276 g for girls, or up to 52% of total caloric intake. The level of added fructose intake implied by these numbers (at least 138 daily grams) is shocking, especially considering there is no physiological requirement for added sugar, particularly fructose, in the diet so potential harms of ingestion clearly outweigh any potential benefits.

Table 1
Amount of sugar in common food items

The American Heart Association (AHA) makes no specific recommendations about fructose, but recommends no more than six teaspoons of sugar per day for women, and no more than nine teaspoons of sugar per day for men. The WHO likewise makes no specific recommendations about fructose, but recommends that added sugars should make up no more than 10% of our entire daily caloric intake, with a proposal to lower that level even further (to 5% or less) for optimal health. By teaspoons, the WHO advises no more than 6–12 teaspoons per day (based on a 2000 calorie per day diet). Even at the higher end, this is only slightly more than the amount of sugar in a single 12 oz. can of Coca-Cola (around 40 g of sugar/10 teaspoonful). Concerning, is that an entire 1 L bottle of Coca-Cola (at 400 calories) might be okay to drink by more liberal Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommendations, which allow an intake of added sugars up to 25% of total daily calories. Such allowance is a problem. Added sugar at this level may increase the risk of death due to CVD by almost threefold.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^cb96ca47]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 — other lifestyle interventions for blood pressure (BP) management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) note that weight loss among those who are overweight or obese, reducing alcohol consumption among those who drink heavily, and adopting a heart-healthy diet pattern have been demonstrated in RCTs to lower BP in the general population; these interventions may also have BP-lowering benefits in CKD and it may be reasonable to consider them when they can be applied safely and without side effects, but insufficient data in CKD precluded specific recommendations. Research recommendations include: Conduct clinical trials evaluating different dietary sodium reduction strategies for prevention of clinical endpoints of critical importance for CKD populations, including kidney failure, CV disease, and mortality; There are inconsistencies among the studies examining the relationship of dietary sodium intake with health outcomes in persons with diabetes; Additional research is required to investigate the consistency of effects of dietary sodium changes on health benefits and harms across different causes and severities of CKD; and It is unknown if there is a minimum dietary sodium level in CKD below which health risks are increased.

### Coffee consumption and risk of hypertension in the Polish arm of the HAPIEE cohort study [^5b596a2a]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2016). Low credibility.

Background/Objectives

Coffee consumption has been hypothesized to be associated with blood pressure (BP), but previous findings are not homogeneous. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between coffee consumption and the risk of developing hypertension.

Subjects/Methods

Data on coffee consumption, BP and use of anti-hypertensive medicament were derived from 2725 participants of the Polish arm of the HAPIEE project (Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe) who were free of hypertension at baseline and followed up for an average of 5 years. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by multivariate logistic regression analyses and stratified for potential confounding factors.

Results

Coffee consumption was related to decreased age, smoking status and total energy intake. Compared with persons who drink < 1 cup coffee per day, systolic BP was significantly associated with coffee consumption and the risk of hypertension was lower for individuals consuming 3–4 cups per day. Despite the analysis stratified by gender showed that the protective effect of coffee consumption on hypertension was significant only in women, the analysis after stratification by smoking status revealed a decreased risk of hypertension in non-smokers drinking 3–4 cups of coffee per day in both sexes (OR 0.41, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.79 for men and OR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.99 for women). Upper category coffee consumption (> 4 cups per day) was not related to significant increased risk of hypertension.

Conclusions

Relation between coffee consumption and incidence of hypertension was related to smoking status. Consumption of 3–4 cups of coffee per day decreased the risk of hypertension in non-smoking men and women only.

### Alcohol intake reduction for controlling hypertension [^5f8801cf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

High blood pressure constitutes one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity all over the world. At the same time, heavy drinking increases the risk for developing cardiovascular diseases, including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, atrial arrhythmias, or stroke. Several studies have already assessed specifically the relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension. However, the potential effect on blood pressure of alcohol intake reduction interventions is largely unknown.

Objectives

To assess the effect of any intervention to reduce alcohol intake in terms of blood pressure decrease in hypertensive people with alcohol consumption compared to a control intervention or no intervention at all. To determine additional effects related to mortality, major cardiovascular events, serious adverse events, or quality of life.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to June 2020: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 5, 2020), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), MEDLINE Ovid Epub Ahead of Print, and MEDLINE Ovid In-Process, Embase Ovid (from 1974), ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. Trial authors were contacted when needed and no language restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with minimum 12 weeks duration and including 50 or more subjects per group with quantitative measurement of alcohol consumption and/or biological measurement of the outcomes of interest. Participants were adults (16 years of age or older) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 90 mmHg, and SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg in participants with diabetes. We included any intervention implemented to reduce their alcohol intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and extracted data using standard methodological procedures adopted by Cochrane.

Main Results

A total of 1210 studies were screened. We included one randomised controlled trial involving a total of 269 participants with a two-year follow-up. Individual patient data for all participants were provided and used in this review. No differences were found between the cognitive-behavioural intervention group and the control group for overall mortality (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.17; low-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (not estimable) and cardiovascular events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.79; very low-certainty evidence). There was no statistical difference in systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction (Mean Difference (MD) -0.92 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.66 to 3.82 mmHg; very low-certainty evidence) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decrease (MD 0.98 mmHg, 95% CI -1.69 to 3.65 mmHg; low-certainty evidence) between the cognitive-behavioural intervention group and the control group. We also did not find any differences in the proportion of subjects with SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg (Risk Ratio (RR) 1.21, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.65; very low-certainty evidence). Concerning secondary outcomes, the alcohol intake was significantly reduced in the cognitive-behavioural intervention compared with the control group (MD 191.33 g, 95% CI 85.36 to 297.30 g). We found no differences between the active and control intervention in the proportion of subjects with lower-risk alcohol intake versus higher-risk and extreme drinkers at the end of the study (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.60). There were no estimable results for the quality of life outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

An intervention for decreasing alcohol intake consumption did not result in differences in systolic and diastolic blood pressure when compared with a control intervention, although there was a reduction in alcohol intake favouring the active intervention. No differences were found either for overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality or cardiovascular events. No data on serious adverse events or quality of life were available to assess. Adequate randomised controlled trials are needed to provide additional evidence on this specific question.

### Impact of high volume energy drink consumption on electrocardiographic and blood pressure parameters: a randomized trial [^42a0720c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

End Point Measurement

The primary end point was QTc interval. Secondary end points included the QT interval (QT), PR interval (PR), QRS duration (QRSd), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), central systolic blood pressure (cSBP), and central diastolic blood pressure (cDBP). Augmentation index (AI) adjusted to an HR of 75 bpm was also measured and will be reported in a separate analysis. All end points were measured at baseline and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, and 240 minutes on each study day. Participants began the study at approximately the same time each study day to account for circadian rhythm changes.

A standard 12‐lead ECG (PageWriter Trim III or TC20, Phillips) was obtained with participants in the supine position. ECGs were performed in triplicate at each time point ≈1 minute apart and averaged. The machine reported HR, PR interval, QRSd, QT interval, and QTc interval (Bazett's formula [QTcB]) end points were used for analysis. QTc was also corrected using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) where QTcF = QT/cube‐root of (RR interval).

Blood pressure measurements were obtained in the seated position after an initial rest period of 8 minutes using an automated blood pressure device (SphygmoCor XCEL PWA, AtCor Medical). SphygmoCor provides automated brachial blood pressure as well as non‐invasive analysis of the central aortic blood pressure waveform and related hemodynamic parameters. Two measurements were taken at each time point ≈2 minutes apart on the right arm and averaged.

### Alcohol and binge drinking frequency and hypertension: a national cross-sectional study in the U.S [^d9bfe464]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The relationship between alcohol consumption and hypertension is multifaceted and a major public health concern. The association becomes even more complicated when hypertension is undiagnosed. This study investigates how alcohol consumption patterns are linked to measured, diagnosed, undiagnosed, and composite hypertension (any indications of hypertension from blood pressure readings, professional diagnosis, or reported medication use) in the United States.

Methods

Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2015–2020, a nationally representative cross-sectional study, were analyzed in 2023–2024. The final analytic sample was 12,950 participants. Complex-survey weighted multivariable linear and logistic regression models estimated the effect of different alcohol consumption levels on hypertension.

Results

Descriptive findings show that those who consumed alcohol more than 3 times weekly exhibited the highest prevalence of measured (52.5%), undiagnosed (27.0%), and composite hypertension (69.4%) compared to other levels of alcohol drinking. Multivariable linear regression analysis indicated a notable elevation in systolic (4.8 unit) and diastolic (2.46 unit) blood pressure among individuals with frequent binge drinking episodes compared to individuals with infrequent drinking. Logistic regression models estimated that drinking over 3 times weekly increases the odds of measured, undiagnosed, and composite hypertension by 64%, 70%, and 54%, respectively, while frequent binge drinking episodes raise these odds by 82%, 65%, and 47%.

Conclusions

Contrary to some studies suggesting moderate alcohol intake has protective cardiovascular effects, the findings did not corroborate a "J-shaped" curve. This underscores the importance of regular blood pressure monitoring among individuals with binge drinking episodes and emphasizes the need for public health interventions to mitigate alcohol consumption and its associated hypertension risks.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Table 12 — Lifestyle and stress-reduction interventions to lower blood pressure — weight loss, heart-healthy diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH]), sodium reduction/salt substitute, potassium intake, and alcohol reduction list evidence-based goals and the Approximate Mean Change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in mm Hg with and without hypertension. For weight loss (body weight or body mass index [BMI]), goals are "Aim for sustained ≥ 5% reduction in body weight or ≥ 3 kg/m² reduction in BMI; expect about 1 mm Hg reduction for every 1-kg reduction in body weight", with hypertension −6 to −8 and without hypertension −3 to −5. For a heart-healthy diet (DASH), the goal is to "Consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, with reduced content of saturated and total fat", with hypertension −5 to −8 and without hypertension −3 to −7. For reduced sodium intake, the target is "Optimal goal is < 2300 mg/d, but aim for an ideal limit of < 1500 mg/d", with hypertension −6 to −8 and without hypertension −1 to −4; using a salt substitute to "Replace cooking/table salt (100% sodium chloride) with salt substitute (25%–30% potassium chloride, 65%–75% sodium chloride, and 0%–10% flavoring agents)" to "Reduce dietary sodium intake as above" yields with hypertension −5 to −7 and without hypertension −5. For enhanced potassium intake, the goal is "Aim for 3500–5000 mg/d, ideally by consumption of a diet rich in potassium; or alternative use of moderate-dose pharmacological potassium supplementation (< 80 mmol)", with hypertension −6 and without hypertension −3 to −6. For reduced alcohol intake, the goal is "Optimal goal is abstinence for all adults for best health outcomes; in patients who consume alcohol, aim for > 50% reduction in daily intake to no more than 2 drinks/d in men or 1 drink/d in women", with hypertension −4 to −6 and without hypertension −3. The table cautions that "these values should not be compared directly to indicate comparative effectiveness".

### Acute effects of red wine on cytochrome P450 eicosanoids and blood pressure in men [^079bfa39]. Journal of Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The vasodilation accompanying acute alcohol ingestion is hard to reconcile with the strong evidence linking chronic alcohol consumption with hypertension. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) eicosanoids derived from arachidonic acid include vasodilator epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and the vasoconstrictor 20-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (20-HETE). This study aimed to examine the relationship between CYP450 eicosanoids and blood pressure (BP), and compared the effect of single session of drinking red wine with de-alcoholized red wine (DRW) or water over 24h.

Methods

Twenty-five normotensive men were randomly assigned to drink either 375ml of red wine (41g of alcohol) or the equivalent volume of DRW or water, with a light meal on 3 separate days. Ambulatory BP and heart rate were measured over 24h. Blood samples were obtained before and 2, 4 and 24h after beverage consumption.

Results

Blood pressure fell in the first 4h after red wine consumption (P = 0.001), but was significantly higher after 20h (P = 0.037). Plasma 20-HETE fell in the 2h after consumption of all beverages, but over the 24-h period was relatively higher after red wine consumption (P = 0.025). The largest difference in 20-HETE was 2h after consuming red wine and coincided with the highest blood alcohol level. There were no significant effects of red wine on plasma EETs.

Conclusion

Acute consumption of alcohol as red wine results in a relative increase in plasma levels of the vasoconstrictor 20-HETE over 24h without affecting EETs, and may contribute to the BP elevation that associates with a binge drinking pattern or be a homeostatic response to the acute fall in BP induced by alcohol.

### The effect of a reduction in alcohol consumption on blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^97c4bfc3]. The Lancet: Public Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Although it is well established that heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypertension, little is known about the effect of a reduction of alcohol intake on blood pressure. We aimed to assess the effect of a reduction in alcohol consumption on change in blood pressure stratified by initial amount of alcohol consumption and sex in adults.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MedLine, Embase, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from database inception up to July 13, 2016, for trials investigating the effect of a change of alcohol consumption on blood pressure in adults using keywords and MeSH terms related to alcohol consumption, blood pressure, and clinical trials, with no language restrictions. We also searched reference lists of identified articles and published meta-analyses and reviews. We included full-text articles with original human trial data for the effect of a change of alcohol consumption on blood pressure in adults, which reported a quantifiable change in average alcohol consumption that lasted at least 7 days and a corresponding change in blood pressure. We extracted data from published reports. We did random-effects meta-analyses stratified by amount of alcohol intake at baseline. All meta-analyses were done with Stata (version 14.1). For the UK, we modelled the effect of a reduction of alcohol consumption for 50% of the population drinking more than two standard drinks per day (ie, 12 g pure alcohol per drink).

Findings

36 trials with 2865 participants (2464 men and 401 women) were included. In people who drank two or fewer drinks per day, a reduction in alcohol was not associated with a significant reduction in blood pressure; however, in people who drank more than two drinks per day, a reduction in alcohol intake was associated with increased blood pressure reduction. Reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean difference -5.50 mm Hg, 95% CI -6.70 to -4.30) and diastolic blood pressure (-3.97, -4.70 to -3.25) was strongest in participants who drank six or more drinks per day if they reduced their intake by about 50%. For the UK, the results would translate into more than 7000 inpatient hospitalisations and 678 cardiovascular deaths prevented every year.

Interpretation

Reducing alcohol intake lowers blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent threshold effect. Implementation of effective alcohol interventions in people who drink more than two drinks per day would reduce the disease burden from both alcohol consumption and hypertension, and should be prioritised in countries with substantial alcohol-attributable risk.

### Guidance for incorporating FDA processes into the ACC / AHA clinical practice guideline methodology: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^d0624d15]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) management — potassium, alcohol, physical activity, and stress reduction. In adults with or without hypertension, potassium-based salt substitutes can be useful to prevent or treat elevated BP and hypertension, particularly for patients in whom salt intake is related mostly to food preparation or flavoring at home, except in the presence of CKD or use of drugs that reduce potassium excretion where monitoring of serum potassium levels is indicated (2a A); these substitutes typically contain 25% to 30% potassium chloride, 65% to 75% sodium chloride, and 0% to 10% flavoring agents. In adults with elevated BP or hypertension, moderate potassium supplementation, ideally from dietary sources, is recommended, with the same exception and monitoring language (1 A); moderate potassium supplementation is ≤ 60 mmol/d (≈60 mEq/d). For alcohol, adults with or without hypertension who currently consume alcohol should be advised to pursue a recommended goal of abstinence, or at least to reduce alcohol intake to ≤ 1 drink/d for women and ≤ 2 drinks/d for men; one standard drink (12 to 14 g alcohol) is equivalent to 12 oz of beer (5% alcohol by volume), 5 oz of wine (12% alcohol by volume), or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits (40% alcohol by volume) (1 A). In adults with or without hypertension, increasing physical activity, through a structured exercise program that includes aerobic exercise and/or resistance training, is recommended (1 A). For stress reduction, transcendental meditation may be reasonable and other forms such as breathing control techniques or yoga may be reasonable, as adjuncts to lifestyle or medication interventions (both 2b B-R).

Alcohol intake and blood pressure — Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) increase over time with any amount of baseline alcohol intake; relative to 12 g per day (1 standard drink), the risk of incident hypertension was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84–0.94) at 0 g/day, 1.11 (95% CI: 1.07–1.15) at 24 g/day, 1.22 (95% CI: 1.14–1.30) at 36 g/day, and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.18–1.49) at 48 g/day; in controlled trials among normotensive drinkers, reducing alcohol by at least 50% or to abstinence is associated with BP reduction, especially for those drinking ≥ 4 drinks per day, with mean BP lowered by 5.5/4.0 mm Hg when individuals consuming ≥ 6 drinks per day reduced intake by 50% on average, no significant BP reduction at ≤ 2 drinks per day, and given other cardiovascular harm with continued alcohol use, aiming for abstinence appears to be optimal.

### Sex-specific associations between alcohol consumption and incidence of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies [^f6d4ded3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Although it is well established that heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypertension, the risk associated with low levels of alcohol intake in men and women is unclear.

Methods and Results

We searched Medline and Embase for original cohort studies on the association between average alcohol consumption and incidence of hypertension in people without hypertension. Random‐effects meta‐analyses and metaregressions were conducted. Data from 20 articles with 361 254 participants (125 907 men and 235 347 women) and 90 160 incident cases of hypertension (32 426 men and 57 734 women) were included. In people drinking 1 to 2 drinks/day (12 g of pure ethanol per drink), incidence of hypertension differed between men and women (relative risk women vs men = 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.67–0.93). In men, the risk for hypertension in comparison with abstainers was relative risk = 1.19 (1.07–1.31; I² = 59%), 1.51 (1.30–1.76), and 1.74 (1.35–2.24) for consumption of 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 or more standard drinks per day, respectively. In women, there was no increased risk for 1 to 2 drinks/day (relative risk = 0.94; 0.88–1.01; I² = 73%), and an increased risk for consumption beyond this level (relative risk = 1.42; 1.22–1.66).

Conclusions

Any alcohol consumption was associated with an increase in the risk for hypertension in men. In women, there was no risk increase for consumption of 1 to 2 drinks/day and an increased risk for higher consumption levels. We did not find evidence for a protective effect of alcohol consumption in women, contrary to earlier meta‐analyses.

### Caffeine consumption and cardiovascular risks: little cause for concern [^cd31bbb3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Blood Pressure and Lipids

In a mechanistic study published in the late 1970s, it was reported that 250 mg of caffeine, administered orally in a clinical research unit to adults not regularly ingesting caffeine products, raised plasma renin 57%, plasma norepinephrine 75%, plasma normetanephrine 207%, and blood pressure 14/10 mm Hg. 3 A single dose of caffeine was given, the amount typically present in 12 ounces of filtered coffee. Maximal plasma caffeine levels were observed 1 hour after consumption, and habituation was not investigated. 4 Other pharmacologic research has corroborated these findings, shown that caffeine has diuretic effects, and demonstrated that the highest blood caffeine concentrations are typically observed in the afternoon. 5

Clinical studies have reported the chronic effects of caffeine products on blood pressure and results have generally been null. It is believed that genetics, smoking, and other aspects of the diet may modify effects. 6 A meta‐analysis by Zhang in 2011 that included > 170 000 adults and > 32 000 new cases of hypertension reported no association between caffeine intake and the development of hypertension. 7 An ambulatory blood pressure study that investigated 24‐hour urinary caffeine and caffeine metabolites levels in > 800 adults reported that each doubling of caffeine excretion was associated with ≈0.6 mm Hg lower blood pressure. The caffeine effects were significant even after statistical adjustment for blood pressure medication use. 8

Research has suggested that both plasma total cholesterol and low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol may increase if the coffee is boiled during the brewing process. 5, 9 A meta‐analysis based on 12 randomized controlled trials of coffee consumed daily for 45 days showed that caffeine intake led to statistically significant increases for total serum cholesterol (mean increase 8.1 mg/dL), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean increase 5.4 mg/dL), and triglycerides (mean increase 12.6 mg/dL). The greater increases in lipid levels were observed for boiled coffee compared to filtered coffee, and decaffeinated coffee had little effect on blood lipid levels. 10

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^cd91c99e]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Alcohol intake and blood pressure — risk gradients, thresholds, and effects of reduction: SBP and DBP increase over time with any amount of baseline alcohol intake, and compared with average alcohol intake of 12 g per day (1 standard drink), relative risks for hypertension incidence among individuals drinking 0, 24, 36, and 48 g per day were 0.89 (95% CI: 0.84–0.94), 1.11 (95% CI: 1.07–1.15), 1.22 (95% CI: 1.14–1.30), and 1.33 (95% CI: 1.18–1.49), respectively, indicating lowest risk with abstinence. Among normotensive individuals, reduction of alcohol intake by at least 50% or to abstinence is associated with BP reduction, especially for those drinking ≥ 4 drinks per day; in those with alcohol intake ≥ 6 drinks per day who reduced intake by 50% on average, mean BP was lowered by 5.5/4.0 mm Hg, whereas at ≤ 2 drinks per day no significant BP reduction was observed with intake reduction.

### Sugar-sweetened beverage, sugar intake of individuals, and their blood pressure: international study of macro / micronutrients and blood pressure [^999dfbc1]. Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

The obesity epidemic has focused attention on relationships of sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) to cardiovascular risk factors. Here we report cross-sectional associations of SSBs, diet beverages, and sugars with blood pressure (BP) for United Kingdom and US participants of the International Study of Macro/Micronutrients and Blood Pressure. Data collected include four 24-hour dietary recalls, two 24-hour urine collections, 8 BP readings, and questionnaire data for 2696 people ages 40 to 59 years of age from 10 US/United Kingdom population samples. Associations of SSBs, diet beverages, and sugars (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) with BP were assessed by multiple linear regression. SSB intake related directly to BP, with P values of 0.005 to < 0.001 (systolic BP) and 0.14 to < 0.001 (diastolic BP). SSB intake higher by 1 serving per day (355 mL/24 hours) was associated with systolic/diastolic BP differences of +1.6/+0.8 mm Hg (both P < 0.001) and +1.1/+0.4 mm Hg (P < 0.001/ < 0.05) with adjustment for weight and height. Diet beverage intake was inversely associated with BP (P 0.41 to 0.003). Fructose- and glucose-BP associations were direct, with significant sugar-sodium interactions: for individuals with above-median 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, fructose intake higher by 2 SD (5.6% kcal) was associated with systolic/diastolic BP differences of +3.4/+2.2 mm Hg (both P < 0.001) and +2.5/+1.7 mm Hg (both P = 0.002) with adjustment for weight and height. Observed independent, direct associations of SSB intake and BP are consistent with recent trial data. These findings, plus adverse nutrient intakes among SSB consumers, and greater sugar-BP differences for persons with higher sodium excretion lend support to recommendations that intake of SSBs, sugars, and salt be substantially reduced.

### Alcohol intake and risk of hypertension: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of nonexperimental cohort studies [^28da4f32]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

The association between alcohol consumption and hypertension is especially important because of the high prevalence of alcohol consumption above a light intake in many countries and the well-demonstrated association between hypertension and adverse effects, including risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and kidney damage. – Our findings have implications for public health and recommendations related to the safety of alcohol consumption, both for men (in whom, any consumption may be detrimental, but particularly a high consumption) and women (in whom 1–1.5 drinks a day may not to be related to an excess risk of hypertension). In a previous meta-analysis, a similar alcohol intake threshold for risk of hypertension was identified in women while no inflection point and therefore no safe range of intake was identified in men.

Our findings are in contrast with previous reports suggesting that light to moderate alcohol consumption does not adversely affect the risk of hypertension, and may even decrease it depending on sex and ethnicity, since the RR pattern we computed did not suggest any beneficial effect of low levels of alcohol consumption compared with no consumption and especially with a high consumption for risk of hypertension. In a previous meta-analysis, based on a smaller number of studies, there was a slight indication of an inverse association with the risk of hypertension in women consuming small amounts of alcohol, that is, 1 to 2 drinks/day (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.89–1.02]).

### Alcohol consumption and the risk of hypertension in women and men [^3c71e812]. Hypertension (2008). Low credibility.

Heavy alcohol intake increases the risk of hypertension, but the relationship between light-to-moderate alcohol consumption and incident hypertension remains controversial. We prospectively followed 28 848 women from the Women's Health Study and 13 455 men from the Physicians' Health Study free of baseline hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Self-reported lifestyle and clinical risk factors were collected. In women, total alcohol intake was summed from liquor, red wine, white wine, and beer; men reported total alcohol intake from a single combined question. During 10.9 and 21.8 years of follow-up, 8680 women and 6012 men developed hypertension (defined as new physician diagnosis, antihypertensive treatment, reported systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg, or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg). In women, we found a J-shaped association between alcohol intake and hypertension in age- and lifestyle-adjusted models. Adding potential intermediates (body mass index, diabetes, and high cholesterol) attenuated the benefits of alcohol in the light-to-moderate range and strengthened the adverse effects of heavy alcohol intake. Beverage-specific relative risks paralleled those for total alcohol intake. In men, alcohol intake was positively and significantly associated with the risk of hypertension and persisted after multivariate adjustment. Models stratified by baseline systolic blood pressure (< 120 versus ≥ 120 mm Hg) or diastolic blood pressure (< 75 versus ≥ 75 mm Hg) did not alter the relative risks in women and men. In conclusion, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption decreased hypertension risk in women and increased risk in men. The threshold above which alcohol became deleterious for hypertension risk emerged at ≥ 4 drinks per day in women versus a moderate level of ≥ 1 drink per day in men.

### Cardiovascular effects of energy drinks in the pediatric population [^ffcce21a]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Consumption of energy drinks in the pediatric population is correlated with more emergency department visits and causes adverse reactions, such as neurological, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, renal, and cardiovascular effects. These cardiovascular complications include increased cardiometabolic risk with high intake of sugar, short-term blood pressure increases and a decrease in cerebral blood flow due to the caffeine content, increased or decreased blood pressure from taurine, unmasked cardiac conditions, such as channelopathies, and atrial and ventral fibrillations. Cardiovascular complications can also arise when energy drinks are mixed with pharmaceutical drugs, such as amiodarone, potent CYP1A2 inhibitors, warfarin, digoxin, or corticosteroids. Combining energy drinks with alcohol also precipitates adverse cardiovascular events, posing a risk to the health of children and adolescents. This review further explores the ingredients in energy drinks and their mechanism of action in causing these cardiovascular complications.

### Alcohol consumption and the incidence of hypertension: the atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^2ae27141]. Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

A close relationship between alcohol consumption and hypertension has been established, but it is unclear whether there is a threshold level for this association. In addition, it has infrequently been studied in longitudinal studies and in black people. In a cohort study, 8334 of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study participants, aged 45 to 64 years at baseline, who were free of hypertension and coronary heart disease had their blood pressures ascertained after 6 years of follow-up. Alcohol consumption was assessed by dietary interview. The type of alcoholic beverage predominantly consumed was defined by the source of the largest amount of ethanol consumed. Incident hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg or use of antihypertensive medication. There was an increased risk of hypertension in those who consumed large amounts of ethanol (≥ 210 g per week) compared with those who did not consume alcohol over the 6 years of follow-up. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.2 (0.85 to 1.67) for white men, 2.02 (1.08 to 3.79) for white women, and 2.31 (1.11 to 4.86) for black men. Only 4 black women reported drinking > 210 g ethanol per week. At low to moderate levels of alcohol consumption (1 to 209 g per week), the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 0.88 (0.71 to 1.08) in white men, 0.89 (0.73 to 1.09) in white women, 1.71 (1.11 to 2.64) in black men, and 0.88 (0.59 to 1.33) in black women. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were higher in black men who consumed low to moderate amounts of alcohol compared with the nonconsumers but not in the 3 other race-gender strata. Models with polynomial terms of alcohol exposure suggested a nonlinear association in white and black men. Higher levels of consumption of all types of alcoholic beverages were associated with a higher risk of hypertension for all race-gender strata. The consumption of alcohol in amounts ≥ 210 g per week is an independent risk factor for hypertension in free-living North American populations. The consumption of low to moderate amounts of alcohol also appears to be associated with a higher risk of hypertension in black men.

### Energy drinks: a contemporary issues paper [^27fe4d87]. Current Sports Medicine Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Energy drinks — regulatory classification, composition, and risk populations include the following points: the amount of caffeine in over-the-counter products is limited to a maximum of 200 mg per dose, whereas there is no limit for energy drinks; within the FDA, energy drinks are classified as either dietary supplements (require adverse events reporting, but contents not as strictly controlled) or foods/beverages (do not require adverse events reporting, contents strictly controlled); energy drinks usually have herbal blends, taurine, glucuronolactone, and vitamins in high concentrations, whereas traditional beverages do not; reported adverse events include trouble sleeping, anxiety, cardiovascular events, seizures, and even death, with safety concerns especially important in vulnerable populations including those younger than 18 yr, pregnant or breastfeeding women, caffeine naive or sensitive individuals, individuals taking stimulant or other caffeine-based medications, those with certain cardiovascular or medical conditions, and/or heavy consumption patterns — defined as two or more energy drinks in one session; the majority of energy drink-related health concerns appear to be linked to caffeine, caffeine-like additives, and/or other energy drink substances such as taurine that may interact with caffeine, and multiple ingredients with heavy consumption appear to be more problematic than coffee or caffeine alone, particularly in individuals with long QT syndrome.

### Effect of alcohol on blood pressure [^e5d1649a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol is consumed by over 2 billion people worldwide. It is a common substance of abuse and its use can lead to more than 200 disorders including hypertension. Alcohol has both acute and chronic effects on blood pressure. This review aimed to quantify the acute effects of different doses of alcohol over time on blood pressure and heart rate in an adult population.

Objectives

Primary objective To determine short-term dose-related effects of alcohol versus placebo on systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure in healthy and hypertensive adults over 18 years of age. Secondary objective To determine short-term dose-related effects of alcohol versus placebo on heart rate in healthy and hypertensive adults over 18 years of age.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to March 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 2), in the Cochrane Library; MEDLINE (from 1946); Embase (from 1974); the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform; and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant articles regarding further published and unpublished work. These searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing effects of a single dose of alcohol versus placebo on blood pressure (BP) or heart rate (HR) in adults (≥ 18 years of age).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (ST and CT) independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. We also contacted trial authors for missing or unclear information. Mean difference (MD) from placebo with 95% confidence interval (CI) was the outcome measure, and a fixed-effect model was used to combine effect sizes across studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 32 RCTs involving 767 participants. Most of the study participants were male (N = 642) and were healthy. The mean age of participants was 33 years, and mean body weight was 78 kilograms. Low-dose alcohol (< 14 g) within six hours (2 RCTs, N = 28) did not affect BP but did increase HR by 5.1 bpm (95% CI 1.9 to 8.2) (moderate-certainty evidence). Medium-dose alcohol (14 to 28 g) within six hours (10 RCTs, N = 149) decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5.6 mmHg (95% CI -8.3 to -3.0) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 4.0 mmHg (95% CI -6.0 to -2.0) and increased HR by 4.6 bpm (95% CI 3.1 to 6.1) (moderate-certainty evidence for all). Medium-dose alcohol within 7 to 12 hours (4 RCTs, N = 54) did not affect BP or HR. Medium-dose alcohol > 13 hours after consumption (4 RCTs, N = 66) did not affect BP or HR. High-dose alcohol (> 30 g) within six hours (16 RCTs, N = 418) decreased SBP by 3.5 mmHg (95% CI -6.0 to -1.0), decreased DBP by 1.9 mmHg (95% CI-3.9 to 0.04), and increased HR by 5.8 bpm (95% CI 4.0 to 7.5). The certainty of evidence was moderate for SBP and HR, and was low for DBP. High-dose alcohol within 7 to 12 hours of consumption (3 RCTs, N = 54) decreased SBP by 3.7 mmHg (95% CI -7.0 to -0.5) and DBP by 1.7 mmHg (95% CI -4.6 to 1.8) and increased HR by 6.2 bpm (95% CI 3.0 to 9.3). The certainty of evidence was moderate for SBP and HR, and low for DBP. High-dose alcohol ≥ 13 hours after consumption (4 RCTs, N = 154) increased SBP by 3.7 mmHg (95% CI 2.3 to 5.1), DBP by 2.4 mmHg (95% CI 0.2 to 4.5), and HR by 2.7 bpm (95% CI 0.8 to 4.6) (moderate-certainty evidence for all). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: High-dose alcohol has a biphasic effect on BP; it decreases BP up to 12 hours after consumption and increases BP > 13 hours after consumption. High-dose alcohol increases HR at all times up to 24 hours. Findings of this review are relevant mainly to healthy males, as only small numbers of women were included in the included trials.
