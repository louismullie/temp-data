## Question

What will iron labs show in iron deficiency anemia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what iron labs will show in iron deficiency anemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and pathophysiology to anchor expected lab patterns. Then, I should verify the best initial test and its optimal cutoff in patients with anemia. Next, I will examine the classic iron study panel and how to interpret discordant ferritin. After that, I need to consider red cell indices and advanced markers like reticulocyte hemoglobin. Finally, I should review special populations where inflammation alters interpretation and synthesize a concise, clinically actionable pattern summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and its mechanism, because the lab pattern flows directly from pathophysiology. Iron deficiency anemia is defined by hemoglobin two standard deviations below normal with evidence of depleted iron stores, reflecting inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, which produces microcytic, hypochromic anemia as severity progresses [^21e45e1c] [^a97d6fd3].

> I need to check the best initial diagnostic test and the most defensible cutoff. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of iron deficiency, but I should confirm the threshold. In patients with anemia, a ferritin less than 45 ng/mL provides about 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity and is preferred over 15 ng/mL to minimize missed diagnoses, whereas in the absence of inflammation, ferritin less than 30 ng/mL generally indicates depleted stores; I should double-check that these figures align with high-quality guidance, which they do in AGA and BSG documents and contemporary reviews [^e89b763a] [^d293ab36] [^b39cea74] [^2455baf2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about ferritin alone, because inflammation can mask deficiency. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, so in chronic inflammatory states or CKD, ferritin may be normal or elevated despite iron deficiency; in those contexts, transferrin saturation less than 20% becomes more informative, and some guidelines accept ferritin up to 100 ng/mL as compatible with iron deficiency when TSAT is low, while others propose ferritin less than 100 ng/mL with TSAT less than 20% as diagnostic in inflammatory conditions; I should confirm that these ranges are supported, which they are in ECCO and expert consensus statements [^c45a97eb] [^3409d4af] [^2be6fbfb].

> Next, I should review the classic iron study panel and the expected pattern. In uncomplicated iron deficiency anemia, serum iron is low, total iron-binding capacity is high, transferrin saturation is low, and ferritin is low; wait, let me verify the TIBC point, because I initially thought TIBC might be low in inflammation, but that would conflate with anemia of chronic disease. In fact, TIBC is typically elevated in iron deficiency and normal or low in anemia of chronic disease, so the pattern of low iron, high TIBC, low TSAT, and low ferritin supports IDA, whereas low iron with low TIBC and low TSAT points toward anemia of chronic disease; I should confirm this distinction, which is consistent with primary care and hematology guidance [^c548bf3f] [^d0f33d72].

> I will now examine red cell indices, because they add supportive but nonspecific clues. Mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin are reduced in iron deficiency, reflecting microcytosis and hypochromia, and red cell distribution width tends to be elevated due to anisocytosis; but wait, I should verify sensitivity, because early or mild iron deficiency may show normal MCV, and macrocytosis from B12/folate deficiency or liver disease can obscure the picture, so normal MCV does not exclude iron deficiency, particularly in older adults or those with mixed etiologies [^d0f33d72] [^eb8035db].

> Let me consider advanced markers that can help when ferritin is equivocal or inflammation is present. Reticulocyte hemoglobin content less than about 26–29 pg indicates iron-restricted erythropoiesis and performs well for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia in meta-analyses, while soluble transferrin receptor is less affected by inflammation and can be used with ferritin to improve diagnostic confidence; I should confirm that these tools are validated, which they are in recent systematic reviews and hematology practice discussions [^48ae8d8f] [^a97d6fd3].

> But wait, what if the patient is pregnant, has IBD, or is preoperative? I need to ensure context-specific thresholds are applied. In pregnancy, iron deficiency is common and ferritin less than 30 ng/mL is generally used to indicate deficiency, with many programs using a trial of oral iron and checking for a hemoglobin rise to confirm; in IBD, ferritin less than 100 ng/mL with TSAT less than 20% supports iron deficiency given inflammation, and reticulocyte hemoglobin or CRP can refine interpretation; in surgical or CKD populations, ferritin 30–100 ng/mL with TSAT less than 20% suggests iron deficiency that may benefit from supplementation; I should double-check that these ranges align with ECCO, BSG, and nephrology guidance, which they do [^2455baf2] [^c45a97eb] [^97b23988].

> I should confirm how to handle discordant ferritin in the 30–100 ng/mL range when inflammation is suspected. The prudent approach is to pair ferritin with TSAT, CRP, and consider reticulocyte hemoglobin or soluble transferrin receptor; a low TSAT supports iron deficiency even with ferritin in the 30–100 ng/mL window, and a good hemoglobin response to iron therapy can serve as a functional confirmation when labs are equivocal; I need to ensure this aligns with guidelines, which it does in BSG and AGA statements [^b39cea74] [^80df5a00].

> Let me synthesize the canonical lab pattern in straightforward, noninflammatory iron deficiency anemia, and I will double-check each element against the sources. Hemoglobin is low for age and sex, MCV and MCH are low, RDW is high, ferritin is less than 30 ng/mL, serum iron is low, TIBC is high, transferrin saturation is less than 20%, and reticulocyte hemoglobin is low if measured; this constellation reflects depleted stores, impaired iron delivery, and iron-restricted erythropoiesis, and it matches the core teaching and guideline summaries [^21e45e1c] [^d0f33d72] [^279cff9f].

> Finally, I should review key caveats so we do not overgeneralize. Ferritin is less reliable in inflammation, CKD, liver disease, and malignancy, where TSAT, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and clinical response to iron may be decisive; mixed deficiencies can blunt expected microcytosis; and a therapeutic trial of iron with hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within about 2 weeks is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency even when studies are equivocal; I need to ensure these cautions are explicit, which they are in major guidelines and reviews [^b39cea74] [^80df5a00] [^2455baf2].

In iron deficiency anemia, iron studies typically show **low ferritin** (≤ 30 ng/mL in the absence of inflammation) [^2455baf2], **low serum iron**, **low transferrin saturation** (< 20%) [^279cff9f], and **high TIBC** due to increased transferrin production [^d0f33d72]. Ferritin is the most specific marker of iron stores [^d0f33d72], but may be normal or elevated with inflammation [^d293ab36]; in that case, **transferrin saturation < 20%** or a low reticulocyte hemoglobin (< 26 pg) [^48ae8d8f] helps confirm iron deficiency. The CBC shows **microcytic, hypochromic anemia** with low MCV/MCH and elevated RDW [^d0f33d72]; a therapeutic iron trial that raises hemoglobin by ≥ 10 g/L in 2 weeks strongly supports the diagnosis [^80df5a00].

---

## Complete blood count (CBC)

- **Hemoglobin (Hb)**: Low, typically < 12.0 g/dL in non-pregnant women, < 13.0 g/dL in men, and < 11.0 g/dL in pregnant women [^24e4811e].
- **Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)**: Low (< 80 fL), indicating microcytosis [^24d2dc9e].
- **Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH)**: Low, indicating hypochromia [^d0f33d72].
- **Red cell distribution width (RDW)**: Elevated (> 14.5%), reflecting anisocytosis [^notfound].
- **Reticulocyte count**: Normal or slightly elevated, but inadequate for the degree of anemia [^notfound].

## Iron studies

| **Test** | **Typical findings in ida** |
|-|-|
| Serum ferritin | Low (≤ 30 ng/mL in the absence of inflammation) [^2455baf2] |
| Serum iron | Low [^279cff9f] |
| Transferrin saturation (TSAT) | Low (< 20%) [^279cff9f] |
| Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) | High (due to increased transferrin) [^d0f33d72] |
| Soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR) | Elevated [^notfound] |
| Reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-He) | Low (< 26 pg) [^48ae8d8f] |

---

## Interpretation of iron studies

- **Ferritin**: Most specific marker of iron stores [^d0f33d72]; low in absolute iron deficiency, but may be normal or elevated in inflammatory states [^d293ab36].
- **Transferrin saturation**: Reflects iron availability; < 20% strongly suggests iron deficiency [^279cff9f].
- **TIBC**: Elevated due to increased transferrin production in iron deficiency [^d0f33d72].
- **sTfR**: Elevated in iron deficiency, less affected by inflammation than ferritin [^notfound].
- **Ret-He**: Early marker of iron-restricted erythropoiesis; low values indicate iron deficiency [^48ae8d8f].

---

## Special considerations

In **inflammation**, ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and may be normal or elevated despite iron deficiency; interpret with CRP and use TSAT or sTfR to confirm [^d293ab36]. In **chronic kidney disease**, ferritin up to 100–300 ng/mL with TSAT < 20% can indicate iron deficiency due to impaired iron utilization [^f81feaf0]. In **pregnancy**, ferritin < 30 ng/mL or TSAT < 20% supports iron deficiency; reticulocyte hemoglobin may help detect early deficiency [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key findings

- **CBC**: Microcytic, hypochromic anemia with elevated RDW [^d0f33d72].
- **Iron studies**: Low ferritin, low serum iron, low TSAT, high TIBC [^279cff9f].
- **Advanced markers**: Elevated sTfR, low Ret-He [^48ae8d8f].
- **Therapeutic trial**: Hemoglobin rise ≥ 10 g/L in 2 weeks supports IDA [^80df5a00].

---

Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by **microcytic, hypochromic anemia** with low ferritin, low serum iron, low TSAT, and high TIBC; **ferritin is most specific** but may be misleading in inflammation, so TSAT, sTfR, or reticulocyte hemoglobin can help confirm the diagnosis [^a97d6fd3].

Iron deficiency anemia is the leading cause of anemia worldwide and affects many young children and adolescent girls in the United States. Its signs and symptoms are subtle despite significant clinical effects. Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed clinically by the presence of risk factors and microcytic anemia. Improvement following a trial of oral iron therapy is confirmative. An array of iron laboratory tests is available with variable indications. Clinical trial and iron absorption data support a shift to lower-dose oral iron therapy. Intravenous iron should be considered in children who fail oral iron or who have more complex disorders.

### Abstract… [^c548bf3f]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Strategy Figure 1 is a suggested algorithm for diagnosing the cause of microcytosis in adults. 1, 2, 5, 17, 18, 20, 21 After confirmation of microcytosis on CBC, physicians should first order a serum ferritin level. 18–20 If the ferritin level is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, identifying the underlying cause of the anemia is the priority. If the serum ferritin level is not consistent with iron deficiency anemia, the next stage of the evaluation should include measurement of serum iron level, TIBC, and transferrin saturation. Iron deficiency anemia is still probable if the serum iron level and transferrin saturation are decreased and TIBC is increased. On the other hand, if the serum iron level is decreased and the TIBC and transferrin saturation are decreased or normal, anemia of chronic disease is most likely. 2, 8, 14 A bone marrow biopsy can help identify sideroblastic anemia.

A serum lead test can detect lead toxicity, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide guidelines on which high-risk groups of children to screen. 26, 27 Even in the presence of lead toxicity, microcytic anemia can be caused by coexisting iron deficiency anemia.
28. 16 Complications include developmental delays and behavior disturbances in children and preterm delivery in pregnant women. 29 Heavy menstrual losses leading to significant anemia warrant additional evaluation for clotting disorders. 30 Most patients with beta-thalassemia trait have mild anemia. In addition, the mean corpuscular volume can sometimes reach much lower levels than with iron deficiency anemia alone. Ultimately, the diagnosis of beta-thalassemia trait is made when hemoglobin electrophoresis shows a slight increase in hemoglobin A2.

1 Coexisting iron deficiency anemia can lower hemoglobin A2 levels; therefore, iron deficiency anemia must be corrected before hemoglobin electrophoresis results can be appropriately evaluated.
31. 25 Although anemia of chronic disease is usually normocytic, about one fourth to one third of cases are mildly microcytic. The anemia is usually mild and not progressive. Additionally, although serum iron levels are decreased in anemia of chronic disease, ferritin levels are increased because ferritin is an acute phase reactant. 1.

Executive summary of recommendations and practice statements

Background

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is common, and a major cause of morbidity worldwide (evidence quality — high, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
IDA can be caused by a range of GI pathologies including cancer, and so GI investigation on an urgent basis should be considered in adults with a new diagnosis of IDA without obvious explanation (evidence quality — high, consensus — 85%, statement strength — strong).

Definitions

We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).
We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions (CIC): is too little iron making your patient sick? [^3a9c6eef]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

While iron deficiency remains the most common cause of anemia worldwide, low iron stores are associated with symptoms regardless of the presence of typical microcytic, hypochromic anemia and may be hard to recognize in patients with concurrent inflammation. Diagnosing and treating iron deficiency become more of a challenge because markers of iron status are influenced by low-grade inflammation present in common conditions, such as chronic kidney disease, cirrhosis, or heart failure. Here I present a pragmatic way of interpreting diagnostic lab tests to help clinicians recognize patients who are most likely to benefit from iron supplementation, choose between oral and parenteral administration, and make personalized decisions when patients do not fit usual guidelines.

### Iron deficiency anemia: diagnosis and management [^caa14b92]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) still remains universally problematic worldwide. The primary focus of this review is to critique articles published over the past 18 months that describe strategies for the diagnosis and management of this prevalent condition.

Recent Findings

The medical community continues to lack consensus when identifying the optimal approach for the diagnosis and management of IDA. Current diagnostic recommendations revolve around the validity and practicality of current biomarkers such as soluble transferrin-receptor concentrations and others, and cause-based diagnostics that potentially include endoscopy. Management of IDA is based on supplementation combined with effective etiological treatment. Advances in oral and parenteral low-molecular-weight iron preparations has expanded and improved treatment modalities for IDA. Since the introduction of low versus high-molecular-weight intravenous iron administration, there have been fewer serious adverse events associated with parenteral iron preparations.

Summary

Best practice guidelines for diagnosing and managing IDA should include the design of an algorithm that is inclusive of multiple biomarkers and cause-based diagnostics, which will provide direction in managing IDA, and distinguish between IDA from the anemia of chronic disease.

Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common hematologic condition, affecting a substantial proportion of the world's women and young children. Optimal management of IDA requires an accurate diagnosis, identification and correction of the underlying cause, provision of medicinal iron therapy, and confirmation of treatment success. There are limited data to support current treatment approaches regarding oral iron preparation, dosing, monitoring, and duration of therapy. New intravenous iron agents have improved safety profiles, which may foster their increased utilization in the treatment of patients with IDA. Clinical trials focused on improving current treatment standards for IDA are sorely needed.

### Iron deficiency anaemia revisited [^82eb6e84]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is a global health concern affecting children, women and the elderly, whilst also being a common comorbidity in multiple medical conditions. The aetiology is variable and attributed to several risk factors decreasing iron intake and absorption or increasing demand and loss, with multiple aetiologies often coexisting in an individual patient. Although presenting symptoms may be nonspecific, there is emerging evidence on the detrimental effects of iron deficiency anaemia on clinical outcomes across several medical conditions. Increased awareness about the consequences and prevalence of iron deficiency anaemia can aid early detection and management. Diagnosis can be easily made by measurement of haemoglobin and serum ferritin levels, whilst in chronic inflammatory conditions, diagnosis may be more challenging and necessitates consideration of higher serum ferritin thresholds and evaluation of transferrin saturation. Oral and intravenous formulations of iron supplementation are available, and several patient and disease-related factors need to be considered before management decisions are made. This review provides recent updates and guidance on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anaemia in multiple clinical settings.

Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional disorder worldwide and accounts for approximately one-half of anemia cases. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia is confirmed by the findings of low iron stores and a hemoglobin level two standard deviations below normal. Women should be screened during pregnancy, and children screened at one year of age. Supplemental iron may be given initially, followed by further workup if the patient is not responsive to therapy. Men and postmenopausal women should not be screened, but should be evaluated with gastrointestinal endoscopy if diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia. The underlying cause should be treated, and oral iron therapy can be initiated to replenish iron stores. Parenteral therapy may be used in patients who cannot tolerate or absorb oral preparations.

### Iron deficiency anaemia [^a97d6fd3]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Anaemia affects roughly a third of the world's population; half the cases are due to iron deficiency. It is a major and global public health problem that affects maternal and child mortality, physical performance, and referral to health-care professionals. Children aged 0–5 years, women of childbearing age, and pregnant women are particularly at risk. Several chronic diseases are frequently associated with iron deficiency anaemia — notably chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease. Measurement of serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, serum soluble transferrin receptors, and the serum soluble transferrin receptors-ferritin index are more accurate than classic red cell indices in the diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia. In addition to the search for and treatment of the cause of iron deficiency, treatment strategies encompass prevention, including food fortification and iron supplementation. Oral iron is usually recommended as first-line therapy, but the most recent intravenous iron formulations, which have been available for nearly a decade, seem to replenish iron stores safely and effectively. Hepcidin has a key role in iron homoeostasis and could be a future diagnostic and therapeutic target. In this Seminar, we discuss the clinical presentation, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and acute management of iron deficiency anaemia, and outstanding research questions for treatment.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^24e4811e]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Guidelines — anemia definition and ferritin threshold context note that in adults with anemia, defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in nonpregnant women, determining iron deficiency is an important step, and diagnosing iron deficiency has proposed ferritin cutoff values ranging from 15 to 100 ng/mL; studies that use bone marrow biopsy as the gold standard have defined the sensitivity and specificity of ferritin levels at different cutoff values.

### Anemia in older adults [^f4ad26bf]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in older adults. Diagnostic cutoff values for defining anemia vary with age, sex, and possibly race. Anemia is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on laboratory testing. Patients may present with symptoms related to associated conditions, such as blood loss, or related to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, such as weakness, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Causes of anemia in older adults include nutritional deficiency, chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammation, and occult blood loss from gastrointestinal malignancy, although in many patients the etiology is unknown. The evaluation includes a detailed history and physical examination, assessment of risk factors for underlying conditions, and assessment of mean corpuscular volume. A serum ferritin level should be obtained for patients with normocytic or microcytic anemia. A low serum ferritin level in a patient with normocytic or microcytic anemia is associated with iron deficiency anemia. In older patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia, endoscopy is warranted to evaluate for gastrointestinal malignancy. Patients with an elevated serum ferritin level or macrocytic anemia should be evaluated for underlying conditions, including vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, myelodysplastic syndrome, and malignancy. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Symptomatic patients with serum hemoglobin levels of 8 g per dL or less may require blood transfusion. Patients with suspected iron deficiency anemia should be given a trial of oral iron replacement. Lower-dose formulations may be as effective and have a lower risk of adverse effects. Normalization of hemoglobin typically occurs by eight weeks after treatment in most patients. Parenteral iron infusion is reserved for patients who have not responded to or cannot tolerate oral iron therapy.

### Noninvasive testing… [^b091a7ae]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In anemia, iron deficiency is best diagnosed using a ferritin threshold of less than 45 ng per mL.
- Patients with IDA should receive noninvasive testing for H. pylori and celiac disease.
- Bidirectional endoscopy is recommended in all adults with IDA. Diagnosing Iron Deficiency The AGA defines anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 13 g per dL in men and less than 12 g per dL in patients who are not pregnant. Serum ferritin testing is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with anemia. Based on a systematic review, the AGA recommends using a ferritin threshold value of less than 45 ng per mL for diagnosing iron deficiency in patients with anemia. This threshold has 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for iron deficiency. Without anemia, the ferritin threshold for iron deficiency is uncertain.

Ferritin testing is less accurate in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, and additional tests including serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, and C-reactive protein can help diagnose iron deficiency. Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with iron deficiency caused by atrophic gastritis and hypochlorhydria, which reduce iron absorption. Treating H. pylori infection improves the benefit of iron supplementation in anemia. After negative bidirectional endoscopy results, the AGA suggests noninvasive testing and treatment for H. pylori in IDA by urea breath testing, although stool antigen testing and serology can also be used. Celiac disease is another common cause of iron deficiency. The AGA suggests serologic testing for celiac disease in patients with iron deficiency, especially those with a family history of the disease, a personal history of autoimmune diseases, or gastrointestinal symptoms.

Small bowel biopsy during endoscopy is recommended only if celiac serology is positive. The AGA also suggests endoscopy in premenopausal women with IDA because malignancy is diagnosed in 1% of this population. In younger patients who might have a plausible nonmalignant cause of anemia, iron replacement can be offered without further exploration. During esophagogastroduodenoscopy, routine gastric biopsies are not recommended. Although autoimmune atrophic gastritis can be diagnosed by gastric biopsy, it has not been shown to improve long-term outcomes.

### Iron deficiency anemia [^a06e018d]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is 2 percent in adult men, 9 to 12 percent in non-Hispanic white women, and nearly 20 percent in black and Mexican-American women. Nine percent of patients older than 65 years with iron deficiency anemia have a gastrointestinal cancer when evaluated. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends screening for iron deficiency anemia in pregnant women but not in other groups. Routine iron supplementation is recommended for high-risk infants six to 12 months of age. Iron deficiency anemia is classically described as a microcytic anemia. The differential diagnosis includes thalassemia, sideroblastic anemias, some types of anemia of chronic disease, and lead poisoning. Serum ferritin is the preferred initial diagnostic test. Total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation, serum iron, and serum transferrin receptor levels may be helpful if the ferritin level is between 46 and 99 ng per mL (46 and 99 mcg per L); bone marrow biopsy may be necessary in these patients for a definitive diagnosis. In children, adolescents, and women of reproductive age, a trial of iron is a reasonable approach if the review of symptoms, history, and physical examination are negative; however, the hemoglobin should be checked at one month. If there is not a 1 to 2 g per dL (10 to 20 g per L) increase in the hemoglobin level in that time, possibilities include malabsorption of oral iron, continued bleeding, or unknown lesion. For other patients, an endoscopic evaluation is recommended beginning with colonoscopy if the patient is older than 50.

### Iron-deficiency anemia [^21e45e1c]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on iron deficiency anemia:

- **Definition**: IDA is a form of anemia that results from inadequate iron supply for erythropoiesis, and is defined as a hemoglobin two SDs below normal with evidence of low body iron stores.
- **Pathophysiology**: IDA can be caused by increased iron demand (pregnancy, infancy), insufficient iron intake, decreased iron absorption (IBD, gastrectomy), chronic blood loss (menorrhagia, systemic bleeding, hookworm infection), drugs (NSAIDs, corticosteroids), genetics (iron-refractory IDA), and iron-restricted erythropoiesis (CKD).
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of iron deficiency ranges from 4.5–18.0%., while the prevalence of IDA is estimated at 2.9%.
- **Disease course**: IDA typically presents with hypochromic, microcytic erythrocytes. Clinical manifestations are related to the severity of the anemia, and may additionally include restless leg syndrome, decreased QoL, and increased maternal and newborn mortality.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Iron deficiency is an independent predictor of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. Iron deficiency is a risk factor for all-cause mortality in patients with CKD. IDA is also associated with morbidity and mortality in pregnant women.

### Individualized treatment for iron-deficiency anemia in adults [^a244ba44]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is one of the most common disorders affecting humans, and iron-deficiency anemia continues to represent a major public health problem worldwide. It is especially common among women of childbearing age because of pregnancy and menstrual blood loss. Additional patient groups include those with other sources of blood loss, malnutrition, or gut malabsorption. Iron-deficiency anemia remains prevalent despite the widespread ability to diagnose the disease and availability of medicinal iron preparations. Therefore, new approaches are needed to effectively manage these patient populations. In this review, the diagnosis and treatment of iron-deficiency anemia are discussed with emphasis placed on consideration of patient-specific features. It is proposed that all patients participate in their own care by helping their physician to identify a tolerable daily iron dose, formulation, and schedule. Dosing cycles are recommended for iron replacement based on the tolerated daily dose and the total iron deficit. Each cycle consists of 5000 mg of oral elemental iron ingested over at least 1 month with appropriate follow-up. This approach should assist physicians and their patients with the implementation of individualized treatment strategies for patients with iron-deficiency anemia.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: a review of diagnosis, investigation and management [^6ed77a2e]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common form of anaemia worldwide. In men and postmenopausal women the commonest cause of IDA is blood loss from lesions in the gastrointestinal tract, making it a common cause of referral to gastroenterologists. Causes of IDA relate either to blood loss or iron malabsorption. After confirmation with laboratory tests, gastrointestinal evaluation is almost always indicated to exclude gastrointestinal malignancy. Specific patient groups such as premenopausal women, patients with low-normal ferritin and iron-deficient patients without anaemia may need an individualized approach. A small proportion of patients have recurrent or persistent IDA despite negative standard endoscopies. These patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding usually require evaluation of the small bowel with capsule endoscopy or double balloon enteroscopy. Treatment should involve prompt iron replacement plus diagnostic steps directed towards correcting the underlying cause of IDA. Oral iron replacement is cheap and effective, but parenteral (intravenous) therapy may be required due to intolerance, noncompliance or treatment failure with oral therapy.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^279cff9f]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Assessment and diagnosis

The WHO defines anaemia as blood Hb level below 130 g/L in men and 120 g/L in women. In isolated iron deficiency, serum ferritin (the storage molecule for iron) should be less than 30 ug/L. However, ferritin is an acute phase protein and can be increased in the presence of inflammation. Thus, if there is evidence of concomitant inflammation, such as elevated C reactive protein, ferritin less than 100 ug/L is indicative of IDA. Transferrin, the iron transporter, is generally elevated; however, it is a negative acute phase protein and, therefore, can be normal or reduced in chronic inflammatory states. Serum iron and transferrin saturations (TSAT) will be reduced with TSAT less than 20% required for the diagnosis of IDA. See table 1 for the breakdown of diagnostic criteria for IDA. It is crucial to note that iron deficiency should not be excluded in the presence of a normal Hb as a significant amount of iron must be lost before the Hb levels begin to decline. Thus, a low mean corpuscular Hb with a normal Hb or an increase in red cell distribution width signifies mild iron deficiency without anaemia.

Table 1
Diagnostic criteria for iron deficiency anaemia

Management

Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the Hb to a normal level. This has been shown to improve QoL, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron replenishment can occur via three routes: oral iron, parenteral oral and transfusion of packed red cells. Each route has its benefits and limitations, which will be discussed below in greater detail.

### AGA clinical practice guidelines on the gastrointestinal evaluation of iron deficiency anemia [^d293ab36]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency anemia — ferritin thresholds and adjunctive testing: Based on a systematic review of 55 studies, a ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL has a sensitivity for iron deficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval [CI] 82%–87%) with a specificity of 92% (95% CI, 91%–94%), whereas a ferritin value of < 15 ng/mL has a sensitivity of 59% (95% CI, 55%–62%) and specificity of 99% (95% CI, 98%–99%). A ferritin threshold value of < 45 ng/mL was believed to maximize sensitivity for the diagnosis of IDA with an acceptable number of false-positive diagnoses, and the tradeoff between higher sensitivity and lower specificity using a threshold of 45 ng/mL instead of 15 ng/mL was believed to provide an acceptable balance of benefits of fewer missed diagnoses compared with potential harms of additional diagnostic evaluations. In some patients, such as those with chronic inflammatory conditions or chronic kidney disease, ferritin levels may not accurately reflect body iron stores and other clinical tests, such as the serum iron, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, or C-reactive protein, may be useful adjunctive tests to assist in the diagnosis of iron deficiency.

Definitions

3. We recommend that anaemia is defined as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below the lower limit of normal for the relevant population and laboratory performing the test (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

4. We recommend that iron deficiency should be confirmed by iron studies prior to investigation. Serum ferritin is the single most useful marker of IDA, but other blood tests (eg, transferrin saturation) can be helpful if a false-normal ferritin is suspected (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 92%, statement strength — strong).

5. We recommend that a good response to iron therapy (Hb rise ≥ 10 g/L within a 2-week timeframe) in anaemic patients is highly suggestive of absolute iron deficiency, even if the results of iron studies are equivocal (evidence quality — medium, consensus — 100%, statement strength — strong).

Anaemia

The WHO defines anaemia as a haemoglobin (Hb) concentration below 130 g/L in men over 15 years of age, below 120 g/L in non-pregnant women over 15 years of age and below 110 g/L in pregnant women in the second and third trimester. The diagnostic criteria for anaemia in IDA vary between published studies. The normal range for Hb also varies between different populations in the UK. It is reasonable to use the lower limit of the normal range for the laboratory performing the test to define anaemia, but these should be aligned with the WHO defined lower limits.

There is little consensus as to the level of anaemia that requires investigation. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) referral guidelines in the UK for suspected lower GI cancer suggest that IDA with an Hb concentration < 110 g/L in men or < 100 g/L in non-menstruating women warrants fast-track referral. These cut-off values will however miss some cases of colorectal cancer, especially in men. It is therefore advised that investigation should be considered at any level of anaemia in the presence of iron deficiency, though the case is stronger in those with more severe degrees of anaemia, as they are more likely to have serious underlying GI pathology.

### Management of iron deficiency [^ef4bc942]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency (ID) affects billions of people worldwide and remains the leading cause of anemia with significant negative impacts on health. Our approach to ID and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) involves three steps (I3): (1) identification of ID/IDA, (2) investigation of and management of the underlying etiology of ID, and (3) iron repletion. Iron repletion options include oral and intravenous (IV) iron formulations. Oral iron remains a therapeutic option for the treatment of ID in stable patients, but there are many populations for whom IV iron is more effective. Therefore, IV iron should be considered when there are no contraindications, when poor response to oral iron is anticipated, when rapid hematologic responses are desired, and/or when there is availability of and accessibility to the product. Judicious use of red cell blood transfusion is recommended and should be considered only for severe, symptomatic IDA with hemodynamic instability. Identification and management of ID and IDA is a central pillar in patient blood management.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^eb8035db]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

MCV showed good specificity but low sensitivity in diagnosing reduced iron stores. Thus, MCV is a useful tool for clinicians to strengthen suspicion of iron deficiency, but a normal or high MCV does not rule out iron deficiency. In our patient population, underlying bone marrow diseases can increase the MCV and thus reduce its utility. In the general population, MCV is more accurate. However, the low sensitivity of MCV is an issue even in more general populations: in the older age, most patients with IDA can have normal MCVs.

The diagnostic efficacy of a test is often measured by its sensitivity, specificity, ROC curve, and AUC. However, in clinical practice, the PPV and NPV are the most relevant markers. PPV and NPV can be calculated for a cutoff with known sensitivity and specificity if the preprobability is known. In a clinical setting, the preprobability is estimated from the patient's background information (eg, age, sex, medication, chronic medical conditions), symptoms, clinical tests, and other diagnostic tests. For example, an 18-year-old female in the United States has ∼35%preprobability of iron deficiency, and if she is known to have heavy menstrual bleeding and fatigue, the preprobability is even higher. To illustrate the preprobability's significance, we presented PPV and NPV in a novel way in a figure as a continuous function of different preprobabilities (Figure 5; shown in linear scale in supplemental Figure 2; supplemental Table 9). We show that ruling in iron deficiency with 95% PPV is feasible at least for ferritin. However, ruling out iron deficiency with 95% NPV is more difficult using any of the studied laboratory parameters: typically, a result way beyond the reference limits would be required, and thus, these cutoffs are not useful for clinical practice. The diagnostic gray area even for the best-performing biomarker, ferritin, is markedly wide (Figure 5), and the same outcome is clearer in other biomarkers (supplemental Figures 3–7; supplemental Table 9).

1.8 Diagnosis of iron deficiency in chronic inflammatory conditions

Our review of international guidelines available for CHF, CKD and IBD reveals no consensus practical guidance for diagnosing iron deficiency independent of anemia (Table 1). However, only some guidelines recognize iron deficiency as a standalone condition — whether this is through lack of awareness of iron deficiency or an intentional omission is difficult to establish (Table 1). Iron deficiency can be simply diagnosed with routinely available blood tests measuring serum ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT). 86 yet guidelines often lack agreement on test cut‐off values for these parameters. 4 Serum ferritin levels are sensitive to inflammation and some guidelines recommend assessment of chronic inflammation (according to inflammatory markers such as C‐reactive protein [CRP] and erythrocyte sedimentation rate); however, there is little consensus for many conditions on when this should be measured, should it be standard practice for all patients or measured only when serum ferritin is > 30 µg L −1 or if patients are symptomatic 68, 87? Moreover, no standard CRP cut‐off values are provided; although a CRP level of 5 mg L −1 is the most common threshold, 64 this is not recognized in most guidelines 68

Background

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in the United States and worldwide. Yet, clinical guidelines for the identification and management of this disorder in the emergency department are lacking.

Objective Of Review

This clinical review examines strategies for identifying and treating iron deficiency anemia in the emergency department, with a focus on the role of oral iron therapy, intravenous iron therapy, as well as red blood cell transfusion. The article highlights both the available evidence on this topic and the need for future research.

Discussion

The diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has important clinical implications and, although testing is generally straightforward, it may be under-recognized. The scant literature available describing emergency department practice patterns for iron deficiency anemia suggests there is room for improvement. In particular, intravenous iron may be underutilized and red blood cell transfusions administered too liberally.

Conclusions

Iron deficiency anemia is common and many patients can be treated effectively with oral iron. For selected patients with moderate-to-severe iron deficiency anemia, intravenous iron is safe and more effective than oral iron. Red blood cell transfusions should be used rarely for hemodynamically stable patients with iron deficiency irrespective of hemoglobin levels.

### How I manage patients with atypical microcytic anaemia [^195e6fb7]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). Low credibility.

Microcytic hypochromic anaemias are a result of defective iron handling by erythroblasts that decrease the haemoglobin content per red cell. Recent advances in our knowledge of iron metabolism and its homeostasis have led to the discovery of novel inherited anaemias that need to be distinguished from common iron deficiency or other causes of microcytosis. These atypical microcytic anaemias can be classified as: (i) defects of intestinal iron absorption (ii) disorders of the transferrin receptor cycle that impair erythroblast iron uptake (iii) defects of mitochondrial iron utilization for haem or iron sulphur cluster synthesis and (iv) defects of iron recycling. A careful patient history and evaluation of laboratory tests may enable these rare conditions to be distinguished from the more common iron deficiency anaemia. Molecular studies allow distinction of the different types, a prerequisite for differentiated therapy.

### Sex, lies, and iron deficiency: a call to change ferritin reference ranges [^ab7f58a9]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Iron deficiency is a very common and treatable disorder. Of all the tests available to diagnose iron deficiency, the serum ferritin is the most able to discriminate iron deficiency from other disorders. However, the reference range for ferritin in many laboratories will lead to underdiagnosis of iron deficiency in women. Studies have shown that 30%-50% of healthy women will have no marrow iron stores, so basing ferritin cutoffs on the lowest 2.5% of sampled ferritins is not appropriate. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest the body physiologic ferritin "cutoff" is 50ng/mL. Work is needed to establish more realistic ferritin ranges to avoid underdiagnosing a readily treatable disorder.

### Data-driven physiologic thresholds for iron deficiency associated with hematologic decline [^23eb1592]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Medium credibility.

Iron-deficiency contributes to a ∼50% of anemia prevalence worldwide, but reference intervals for iron status tests are not optimized for anemia diagnosis. To address this limitation, we identified the serum ferritin (SF) thresholds associated with hematologic decline in iron-deficient patients, and the SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated with hematologic improvement. Paired red blood cell and SF measurements were analysed from two adult cohorts at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), from 2008–2011 (N = 48409), and 2016–2018 (N = 10042). Inter-patient measurements in the first cohort were used to define optimal SF thresholds based on the physiologic relationship between SF and red cell measurements. Intra-patient measurements (1-26weeks apart) in the second cohort were used to identify SF thresholds from which an SF increase was associated, with an increase in red cell measurements. The identified optimal SF thresholds varied with age, sex and red cell measure. Thresholds associated with a ∼5% decline in red cell index were typically in the range 10-25ng/mL. Thresholds for younger women (18-45year) were ∼5ng/mL lower than for older women (60-95years), and ∼10ng/mL lower than for men. Thresholds from which a subsequent increase in SF was associated with a concomitant increase in red cell measure showed similar patterns: younger women had lower thresholds (∼15ng/mL) than older women (∼25ng/mL), or men (∼35ng/mL). These results suggest that diagnostic accuracy may be improved by setting different SF thresholds for younger women, older women, and men. This study illustrates how clinical databases may provide physiologic evidence for improved diagnostic thresholds.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^515fb3a1]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

In this nationally representative survey study of internal medicine PCPs, we found substantial variation in the management of anemia. Specifically, we found self-reported evidence of both overuse of screening CBCs (76.9% of respondents) and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy in patients with IDA. Certain knowledge gaps also existed in the interpretation of discordant laboratory test results, which may contribute to diagnostic errors. Specifically, 26.5% of respondents misdiagnosed a scenario of IDA as anemia with an alternate cause despite a low transferrin saturation (2%) and a borderline low ferritin level (40 ng/mL). Several subtle but important nuances in interpretation of these studies may contribute to errors, including the high specificity of a low ferritin level (98% specific for iron deficiency with a ferritin level ≤ 12 ng/mL), the potential for the ferritin level to be normal or elevated in inflammatory states when a patient is iron deficient, and the importance of measuring serum iron level in a fasting state to avoid potential confounders of dietary or supplemental iron. Given the relatively high baseline prevalence of anemia of 5.6% in the US, incorrect interpretation of these laboratory results may lead to a substantial number of missed or delayed diagnoses of IDA and, by extension, potential delays in diagnosis of GI tract malignant neoplasm.

### Ferritin outperforms other biomarkers in predicting bone marrow iron stores in patients with hematologic disorders [^7f35d44d]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, we show in the largest data set to date that ferritin is the best predictor for bone marrow iron stores in a real-life patient population. We studied the most common laboratory variables used for detecting IDA, that is, ferritin, TSAT, sTfR, transferrin, hemoglobin, and MCV, and compared those with bone marrow iron staining in > 6600 patients with hematologic disorders. In ROC analysis, ferritin had the highest AUC in all patient groups, which is congruent with previous studies. Previously, lower cutoffs of 12 to 15 μg/L have been used, but in patients with anemia, the 30 μg/L cutoff has been shown to have higher sensitivity but retain excellent specificity for iron deficiency. Our study has similar excellent specificities with the ferritin cutoff of 30 μg/L as previous studies, but the sensitivities in our study were significantly lower. A possible reason for this difference is that hematologic cancers and myeloproliferative disorders and their treatments can affect the diagnostic performance of ferritin. Nevertheless, we show that, even in this patient population, commonly used decision-making thresholds for ferritin in diagnosing iron deficiency are specific. Thus, a low ferritin predicts reliably reduced iron stores, regardless of the patient's diagnoses and older age. However, the clinician cannot rule out iron deficiency with reasonable certainty if ferritin levels are normal.

### Screening for iron deficiency anemia in young children: USPSTF recommendation statement [^8bd648aa]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Screening tests for iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children — test performance and limitations indicate that serum hemoglobin or hematocrit is the primary screening test for iron deficiency anemia, but hemoglobin is not sensitive for detecting iron deficiency and is also nonspecific, as ~60% of cases of anemia result from causes other than iron deficiency. The positive predictive value of low hemoglobin for iron deficiency in children age 12 months ranges from 10% to 40%, and in infants, particularly before age 12 months, spontaneous resolution of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia reduces the positive predictive value of any screening test. Other single tests as primary screening tools have not been well studied, and serum ferritin acts as an acute-phase reactant and should ideally be measured in the absence of infection or inflammation.

### Evaluation of anemia [^bfa5fd37]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Anemia is a common problem in primary care. Classification based on mean cell volume narrows the differential diagnosis and directs testing. A marked macrocytosis is characteristic of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, certain medications, and primary bone marrow disorders. The three most common causes of microcytic anemia are iron deficiency, thalassemia trait, and anemia of inflammation. Additional laboratory testing is required for diagnosis. Determination of the rate of development of anemia and examination of a blood smear may provide diagnostic clues to guide more specialized testing. Diagnosis of iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency mandates determination of the underlying cause.

ASH-ASPHO Choosing Wisely — packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion in pediatric iron deficiency anemia (IDA) — states to avoid pRBCs in asymptomatic, nonbleeding children and to base transfusion on hemodynamic status and blood loss rather than laboratory values. The page notes that transfusion does not correct iron deficiency, exposes patients to transfusion risks, and that effective therapy is iron repletion, with the avoidance recommendation supported by practice guidelines. Specifically, it says: "Avoid packed red blood cell transfusion for asymptomatic children with IDA and no active bleeding", and that "the decision to transfuse pRBCs is typically guided by assessment of hemodynamic stability and ongoing blood loss rather than hemoglobin or iron levels". It adds that "Transfusion with pRBCs does not ensure complete treatment of IDA because the iron from transfused pRBCs is not immediately bioavailable for erythropoiesis and does not replenish iron stores", that unnecessary transfusions "expose patients to risks of transfusion reactions, blood-borne infections, RBC alloimmunization, and volume overload", and that "The judicious use of pRBC transfusions has been associated with cost savings for health care systems". The page states, "Effective treatment of severe IDA consists of replenishing iron stores using oral or intravenous iron supplementation while addressing the underlying causes", and that avoidance in asymptomatic, hemodynamically stable children "is supported by recently published practice guidelines in Canada".

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^2be6fbfb]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1.9 Expert recommendation

There is little focus in the guidelines on how iron deficiency in the absence of anemia should be diagnosed in relation to the underlying chronic disease. Thus, it is of little surprise that physicians may not prioritize iron deficiency treatment. We wish to propose, based on the literature available, the following consensus laboratory test cut‐off values in patients with CHF, CKD or IBD:

Serum ferritin < 100 µg L −1 or TSAT < 20%

If serum ferritin is between 100 and 300 µg L −1, a TSAT test will be required to confirm iron deficiency

Furthermore, we also propose the following algorithms for the diagnostic workup of iron deficiency in patients with CHF, CKD, and IBD (Figures 2, 3, 4). In all conditions, initial workup should incorporate assessment of serum ferritin and TSAT, as well as Hb levels, in order to distinguish between those with normal hematological parameters, those with some form of iron deficiency (iron deficiency: normal Hb and low iron; or iron deficiency anemia: low Hb and low iron), and those with some other form of anemia (where iron levels are normal but Hb is low). In CKD, we must also consider whether the patient is receiving dialysis (Figure 3 A, B). Finally, in IBD, we must further consider whether the underlying condition is in remission or active. For IBD, we therefore also recommend measuring CRP levels or stool markers such as calprotectin or lactoferrin at the time of iron markers and hematological workup, in order to appropriately manage iron deficiency in relation to these results. We recommend a CRP threshold of 5 mg L −1 to determine the IBD disease activity. Although laboratory markers are usually sufficient with clinical disease activity markers, other indicators of intestinal inflammation, such as transabdominal ultrasound or endoscopy, may also be used to supplement these assessments.

### Testing practices, interpretation, and diagnostic evaluation of iron deficiency anemia by US primary care physicians [^78d4aa6e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

In this survey study, PCPs' self-reported testing practices for anemia suggest overuse of screening laboratory tests, misinterpretation of iron studies, and underuse of bidirectional endoscopy in evaluation of new-onset IDA. These findings suggest that IDA, a common clinical condition and early sign of GI malignant neoplasm, is not uniformly understood, approached, and managed by practicing physicians in the US. Given the potential association with GI cancers and the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger adults, thorough evaluation of IDA is important for preventing delays in diagnosis. Further work should inform the design and implementation of tools to improve diagnostic evaluation of IDA and reduce the risk of potential diagnostic errors.

### Ferritin cutoffs and diagnosis of iron deficiency in primary care [^048df49a]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency is a common condition and a leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, mainly due to subsequent anemia. A depletion of iron stores that does not yet result in anemia, simply referred to as nonanemic iron deficiency, has recently gained attention as a distinct clinical entity. Associated with various symptoms, including fatigue, restless legs syndrome, and hair loss, nonanemic iron deficiency has been estimated to be more common than anemic iron deficiency.

Measurement of (serum) ferritin is considered the mainstay of iron deficiency diagnosis, and ferritin is a commonly requested laboratory test in various high-resource primary care settings. In particular, a Swiss study revealed that 27% of the population received serum ferritin testing in 2018, and ferritin ranked among the most frequently ordered laboratory tests in Swiss primary care between 2009 and 2018. At the same time, iron deficiency guidelines are conflicting as to which populations benefit most from ferritin testing. For example, the US Preventive Services Task Force specifically mentions children and pregnant womenbut makes no recommendation for the general population. A prominent Swiss primary care guideline discourages iron deficiency screening in the general population, with exceptions for conditions that require special consideration due to increased risk, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or when evidence suggests a benefit from replete iron stores, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD).

### Iron deficiency: new insights into diagnosis and treatment [^48f70d93]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia are common conditions worldwide affecting especially children and young women. In developing countries, iron deficiency is caused by poor iron intake and/or parasitic infection, whereas vegetarian dietary choices, poor iron absorption, and chronic blood loss are common causes in high-income countries. Erythropoiesis stimulating agents can result in functional iron deficiency for erythropoiesis even when stores are iron-replete. Diagnosis of iron deficiency is straightforward, except when it occurs in the context of inflammatory disorders. Oral iron salts correct absolute iron deficiency in most patients, because low hepcidin levels facilitate iron absorption. Unfortunately frequent side effects limit oral iron efficacy. Intravenous iron is increasingly utilized, because currently available preparations allow rapid normalization of total body iron even with a single infusion and are effective also in functional iron deficiency and in iron deficiency associated with inflammatory disorders. The evidence is accumulating that these preparations are safe and effective. However, long-term safety issues of high doses of iron need to be further explored.

### Iron deficiency anaemia: pathophysiology, assessment, practical management [^09bc7871]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The WHO has recognised iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) as the most common nutritional deficiency in the world, with 30% of the population being affected with this condition. Although the most common causes of IDA are gastrointestinal bleeding and menstruation in women, decreased dietary iron and decreased iron absorption are also culpable causes. Patients with IDA should be treated with the aim of replenishing iron stores and returning the haemoglobin to a normal level. This has shown to improve quality of life, morbidity, prognosis in chronic disease and outcomes in pregnancy. Iron deficiency occurs in many chronic inflammatory conditions, including congestive cardiac failure, chronic kidney disease and inflammatory bowel disease. This article will provide an updated overview on diagnosis and management of IDA in patients with chronic conditions, preoperative and in pregnancy. We will discuss the benefits and limitations of oral versus intravenous iron replacement in each cohort, with an overview on cost analysis between the different iron formulations currently on the market.

### Evaluation of microcytosis [^24d2dc9e]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Microcytosis is typically an incidental finding in asymptomatic patients who received a complete blood count for other reasons. The condition is defined as a mean corpuscular volume of less than 80 µm3 (80 fL) in adults. The most common causes of microcytosis are iron deficiency anemia and thalassemia trait. Other diagnoses to consider include anemia of chronic disease, lead toxicity, and sideroblastic anemia. Serum ferritin measurement is the first laboratory test recommended in the evaluation of microcytosis. Low ferritin levels suggest iron deficiency. Once a presumptive diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia has been made, an underlying source for the deficiency should be determined. Iron deficiency anemia in adults is presumed to be caused by blood loss; the most common source of bleeding is the gastrointestinal tract. The possibility of gastrointestinal malignancy must be considered. If the serum ferritin level is not initially low, further evaluation should include total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation level, serum iron level, and possibly hemoglobin electrophoresis. Anemia of chronic disease is suggested with low iron levels and decreased total iron-binding capacity. Patients with beta-thalassemia trait usually have elevated levels of hemoglobin A2.

### Iron deficiency in adults: a review [^2455baf2]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Absolute iron deficiency, defined as low iron stores with or without anemia, affects approximately 2 billion people worldwide and 14% of adults in the US. Iron-deficiency anemia, defined as low hemoglobin due to low iron stores, affects approximately 1.2 billion people worldwide, including 10 million in the US.

Observations

Absolute iron deficiency progresses from low iron stores to iron-deficiency anemia. Individuals with nonanemic iron deficiency or iron-deficiency anemia may be asymptomatic or experience fatigue, irritability, depression, difficulty concentrating, restless legs syndrome (32%-40%), pica (40%-50%), dyspnea, lightheadedness, exercise intolerance, and worsening heart failure (HF). Symptom prevalences vary depending on age, comorbidities (eg, chronic kidney disease [CKD], HF), and severity and rate of development of iron deficiency. The most common causes of iron deficiency are bleeding (menstrual, gastrointestinal), impaired iron absorption (atrophic gastritis, celiac disease, bariatric surgical procedures), inadequate dietary iron intake, and pregnancy. In high-income countries, approximately 38% of nonpregnant, reproductive-age women have iron deficiency without anemia and about 13% have iron-deficiency anemia. During the third trimester of pregnancy, iron deficiency affects up to 84% of pregnant women, based on data from high-income countries. Additional risk factors include use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD [13%-90%]), and other chronic inflammatory conditions, such as CKD (24%-85%), HF (37%-61%), and cancer (18%-82%). Testing for iron deficiency is indicated for patients with anemia and/or symptoms of iron deficiency (fatigue, pica, or restless legs syndrome) and should be considered for those with risk factors such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pregnancy, or IBD. Iron deficiency is diagnosed by low serum ferritin (typically < 30 ng/mL) in individuals without inflammatory conditions or by transferrin saturation (iron/total iron binding capacity×100) less than 20%. Causes of iron deficiency should be identified and treated. Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg/d or on alternate days) is typically first-line therapy. Intravenous iron is indicated for patients with oral iron intolerance, poor absorption (celiac disease, post-bariatric surgical procedure), chronic inflammatory conditions (CKD, HF, IBD, cancer), ongoing blood loss, and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

Conclusions and Relevance

Iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia are common conditions that may cause symptoms such as fatigue, exercise intolerance, and difficulty concentrating. Ferritin and/or transferrin saturation are required for diagnosis and screening. Oral iron is first-line therapy for most patients. Intravenous iron is used for individuals who do not tolerate or have impaired absorption of oral iron, those with ongoing blood loss, certain chronic inflammatory conditions (IBD, CKD, HF, cancer), and during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^12f4ce03]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There is little information in literature to guide the approach to CKD patients who show laboratory evidence of iron deficiency. Nevertheless, given the high prevalence of GI blood loss due to variety of causes in this patient population, deciding on a subsequent management plan, including endoscopy, depends on the clinical presentation. This supports the recommendation that CKD patients who present with anaemia and iron deficiency should undergo careful clinical assessment prior to the initiation of anaemia therapy.

Reduced iron availability for erythropoiesis can manifest as low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), but given the relatively long lifespan of circulating erythrocyte, this test will not reflect the existing availability of iron at the time of testing. Testing the reticulocytes for their Hb content (CHr or Ret-He) may allow more accurate estimation of iron availability, because reticulocytes are present in the circulation for 4–5 days, so give a discrete population to study. Reduced red cell Hb can be reflective of reduced haem availability or globin. Therefore, the red cell analyte values (%HRC, CHr, Ret-He) may be affected by the presence of haemoglobinopathies.

### Anemia in infants and children: evaluation and treatment [^6ff026bf]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Anemia affects more than 269 million children globally, including 1.2 million children in the United States. Although anemia can present with numerous symptoms, children are most often asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Anemia in infants and children most often arises from nutritional iron deficiency but can also be a result of genetic hemoglobin disorders, blood loss, infections, and other diseases. In the United States, newborn screening programs assess for various genetic causes of anemia at birth. The US Preventive Services Task Force notes insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening of asymptomatic children in the first year of life; however, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening all children before 1 year of age. Initial laboratory evaluation consists of a complete blood cell count, with further testing dependent on mean corpuscular volume. Microcytic anemia is the most common hematologic disorder in children, with iron deficiency as the most common cause. A recommended dosage of 2 to 6 mg/kg per day of ferrous sulfate is the most effective oral iron supplementation for patients with iron deficiency anemia. Delayed cord clamping at birth might prevent early iron deficiency, but no clinically relevant outcomes are certain. Normocytic anemia is classified by reticulocyte count and can reflect hemolysis (high reticulocyte count) or bone marrow suppression (low reticulocyte count). Macrocytic anemia is less common in children and is typically a result of nutritional deficiencies or poor absorption of cobalamin (vitamin B12) or folate. Pediatric hematology referral might be beneficial for patients who do not respond to treatment, and referrals are critical for any bone marrow suppression that is diagnosed.

### Implementing reticulocyte hemoglobin into current hematology algorithms [^48ae8d8f]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

This systematic review investigates reticulocyte hemoglobin's capabilities in screening iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia with and without comorbidities.

Methods

Participant background and laboratory characteristics were extracted from 14 unique studies between 2015 and 2022. Hemoglobin, reticulocyte hemoglobin, and mean cell volume (MCV) values were used in a meta-analysis for iron-deficiency anemia with no secondary conditions. Mean laboratory values for each patient population were calculated and then used to determine sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia. The ferritin and reticulocyte hemoglobin ranges were calculated using the mean values.

Results

The meta-analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin and MCV values do not significantly differ between studies, unlike reticulocyte hemoglobin values. The reticulocyte hemoglobin range is smaller than ferritin for the controls, iron deficiency, and iron-deficiency anemia. Reticulocyte hemoglobin values less than 26 pg can distinguish iron-deficiency anemia, while 26 to 31.5 pg can distinguish iron deficiency, with an AUC of 0.889. The sensitivity and specificity are 92.3% and 100% for iron-deficiency anemia, 100% and 81.5% for iron deficiency, and 94.4% and 71.4% for both, respectively (reference range, < 31.5 pg).

Conclusions

Reticulocyte hemoglobin is potentially a quick screening test for iron deficiency and iron-deficiency anemia.

### Diagnosis and management of iron deficiency anemia in the 21st century [^4676ac6f]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency is the single most prevalent nutritional deficiency worldwide. It accounts for anemia in 5% of American women and 2% of American men. The goal of this review article is to assist practitioners in understanding the physiology of iron metabolism and to aid in accurately diagnosing iron deficiency anemia. The current first line of therapy for patients with iron deficiency anemia is oral iron supplementation. Oral supplementation is cheap, safe, and effective at correcting iron deficiency anemia; however, it is not tolerated by some patients and in a subset of patients it is insufficient. Patients in whom the gastrointestinal blood loss exceeds the intestinal ability to absorb iron (e.g. intestinal angiodysplasia) may develop iron deficiency anemia refractory to oral iron supplementation. This population of patients proves to be the most challenging to manage. Historically, these patients have required numerous and frequent blood transfusions and suffer end-organ damage resultant from their refractory anemia. Intravenous iron supplementation fell out of favor secondary to the presence of infrequent but serious side effects. Newer and safer intravenous iron preparations are now available and are likely currently underutilized. This article discusses the possible use of intravenous iron supplementation in the management of patients with severe iron deficiency anemia and those who have failed oral iron supplementation.

1.2 Defining iron deficiency

Based on our literature review, it is evident that iron deficiency is not fully recognized as a disorder distinct from iron deficiency anemia, or as one that may have its own clinical consequences. Indeed, the terms "iron deficiency" and "iron deficiency anemia" are often used interchangeably. 31 Where iron deficiency is discussed, it is frequently perceived as the most common nutritional disorder worldwide, 31, 32, 33 but not as a medical condition in and of itself. 34

It is clear that the heterogeneity in how iron deficiency is defined is a knowledge gap that is compounding physicians' lack of confidence in recognizing and diagnosing this condition. The lack of a standard simple definition for iron deficiency hinders its uncoupling from iron deficiency anemia and its acceptance as a standalone medical condition with distinct clinical implications.

1.3 Expert recommendation

We propose the following wording as an overarching definition of iron deficiency:

Iron deficiency is a health‐related condition in which iron availability is insufficient to meet the body's needs and which can be present with or without anemia

1.4 Clinical impact of iron deficiency

Iron deficiency may contribute to several symptoms that can manifest even in the absence of progression to anemia. Although there are symptoms that are likely to be caused by iron deficiency (eg, pagophagia, and RLS), many symptoms are nonspecific, such as fatigue, and exhaustion. 35, 36, 37, 38 This means that physicians and patients do not always recognize that iron deficiency is present and, as a consequence, diagnosis is not pursued and the condition is left untreated.

Physicians may need to actively ask their patients about such symptoms, especially for those patient populations where iron deficiency is highly prevalent, so that appropriate diagnostic tests can be performed and, if necessary, treatment can be given. 35 In this section, we outline the iron deficiency symptoms that have been commonly reported in patients with CHF, CKD and IBD, as well as its associated clinical outcomes that further call for its prompt diagnosis and management.

### Iron deficiency anemia in chronic liver disease: etiopathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment [^e2f5bc57]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Diagnosis of IDA in CLD

When evaluating a patient with CLD IDA everyone should have in mind that the tests commonly used in the general population show a wide variation in these patients, because they are affected directly or indirectly by the hepatic cell damage.

The laboratory methods used in the diagnosis of IDA can be divided into two categories. There are screening measurements (Hb, Tsat, mean corpuscular volume [MCV], mean corpuscular Hb [MCH], red blood cell distribution width [RDW], and reticulocytes) that detect iron-deficient erythropoiesis, and measurements that indicate tissue iron status, either by measuring storage proteins or by direct examination of bone marrow aspiration for ID. The only definitive method still remains bone marrow aspiration, stained with Prussian blue for iron. However, the fact that the procedure is invasive, painful and expensive makes biopsy a tool that is not frequently used, and there is need for less- or even noninvasive tests with a good diagnostic accuracy.

Iron deficiency

Automated cell counters provide measurements of the changes in red cells that accompany iron deficiency including reduced mean cell Hb (MCH) — hypochromia; and reduced mean cell volume (MCV) — microcytosis.MCH is probably a more reliable marker of iron deficiency as it is less dependent on storage and the counting machine used, and a reduction is seen in both absolute and functional iron deficiency (FID). MCH may also be more sensitive for iron deficiency than MCV. Both microcytosis and hypochromia lose sensitivity for iron deficiency in the presence of chronic disease, thalassaemia or vitamin B12/folate deficiency.

The specificity of MCV and MCH for iron deficiency is limited, as microcytosis and hypochromia also occur in many haemoglobinopathies (such as thalassaemia, when the MCV is typically reduced out of proportion to the level of anaemia), in sideroblastic anaemia and in some cases of anaemia of chronic disease. To prevent unnecessary GI investigation, Hb electrophoresis is recommended in those with microcytosis and normal iron studies, particularly if there is an appropriate ethnic background.

The serum markers of iron deficiency include low ferritin, low transferrin saturation, low iron, raised total iron-binding capacity, raised red cell zinc protoporphyrin, increased serum transferrin receptor (sTfR), low reticulocyte Hb (Retic-Hb) and raised percentage hypochromic red cells. Serum ferritin (SF) is the most specific test for iron deficiency in the absence of inflammation. An SF level of < 15 µg/L is indicative of absent iron stores, while SF levels of less than 30 µg/L are generally indicative of low body iron stores. The lower limit of normal for most laboratories, therefore, lies in the range 15–30 µg/L.

As SF is an acute phase protein, however, apparently normal levels may occur with iron deficiency in the context of an inflammatory disease process. An SF cut-off of 45 µg/L has been suggested as providing the optimal trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for iron deficiency in practice. An SF value above 150 µg/L is unlikely to occur with absolute iron deficiency, even in the presence of inflammation.

### Reticulocyte hemoglobin content: a new frontier in iron deficiency diagnostics for major surgical patients [^f81feaf0]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common nutritional deficiency in the population and the leading cause of anemia with a prevalence of 23 to 33%. In clinical setting, preoperative anemia is associated with an increased risk for perioperative complications and mortality. Triphaus et al. showed that every second major surgical patients with a hemoglobin (Hb) level below 10 g/dl had ID. Both oral and intravenous administration of iron are effective and low-cost measures to treat anemia. However, it is important to recognize that treatment requires time to show its full effect. Oral iron typically takes three to six months, while intravenous iron can take at least seven days to improve iron levels and erythrpoiesis. Therefore, early detection of ID is crucial to ensure timely and effective management.

The diagnosis of ID is challenging. The cutoff values and measurements to diagnose ID have been rigorously debated in the last decades. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a ferritin cutoff value of < 15 μg/l in healthy individuals and < 70 µg/l in individuals with infection or inflammation for the diagnosis of ID. In the patients with chronic kidney disease or heart failure, ferritin values of up to 300 ng/ml and transferrin saturation below 20% are also considered indicative for ID. However, ferritin is an acute phase protein and often elevated if inflammation is present. Therefore, Muñoz and colleagues recommend a simultaneous measurement of ferritin, transferrin saturation and C-reactive protein (CRP) in surgical patients.

The detrimental impact of preoperative anemia has been consistently demonstrated. However, implementing a comprehensive anemia management strategy within clinical routines is complex. The limited time available between preoperative assessment and surgery necessitates a straightforward screening and treatment process to ensure accurate diagnosis and management of ID. Diagnostic accuracy is often challenged by factors such as inflammation or chronic disease, which can obscure true ID. Additionally, the lack of standardized protocols can lead to variability in how ID is screened and managed across different clinical settings. Since performing laboratory analysis for ID is costly, a pre-selection of potentially iron-deficient patients would be beneficial. Resource constraints in some healthcare environments further complicate access to full diagnostic panels, and integrating new diagnostic processes into established clinical workflows can be difficult. Furthermore, patient-specific factors, including comorbidities and nutritional status, add another layer of complexity to the diagnosis and management of ID.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: international expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^d5ba5e68]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Managing patients with chronic diseases, particularly those with complex inflammatory disorders, can be challenging. In these patients, a considered multidisciplinary approach needs to be adopted to maintain quality of life (QoL) and improve outcomes. 2, 3 One condition that is frequently associated with chronic disease, but often overlooked, is iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is estimated to affect 37–61% of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), 24–85% of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 13–90% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Iron is essential to every cell and, while its fundamental role in oxygen transport through erythropoiesis is well recognized, it is equally critical for energy production and efficient functioning of all of the body's organs. 10, 11 In patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, its impact can be particularly severe and may exacerbate the underlying disease state, leading to accelerated clinical deterioration. 5, 12

Anemia is the ultimate consequence of iron deficiency in many patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. 2, 3, 13, 14 However, the medical field should recognize iron deficiency as a clinical condition distinct from anemia. Recognition is improving owing to our better understanding of the pathophysiological role of iron deficiency (independent of chronic anemia) in symptomatology and clinical outcomes. 10, 15, 16 This is further supported by recent clinical observations of an association between the alleviation of morbidity or mortality and the treatment of iron deficiency, even outside the context of anemia. 6, 17, 18 However, there is uncertainty among physicians on how to diagnose iron deficiency in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. This is partially because of symptom overlap with the underlying disease and unclear laboratory diagnostic thresholds. Several publications have also highlighted the problems of recognizing iron deficiency in the context of anemia of inflammation. 13, 19, 20, 21 This has led to under‐diagnosis of an easily treatable condition, leading to anemia, at which point physicians feel more confident about using iron therapy. 22
