## Question

55-year-old man found unresponsive in his garage with empty vodka bottles and a half-empty antifreeze container; on arrival he is tachycardic with slurred speech, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and elevated BUN/creatinine; asked for expected urine finding.

An unconscious 55-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by ambulance. He had recently lost his job and his house was about to begin foreclosure. His adult children were concerned for his well being and called the police requesting a welfare check. He was found unresponsive in his gurague. There were several empty bottles of vodka around him and one half empty container of antifreeze. A review of his medical records reveals that he was previously in good health. Upon arrival to the ED he regains consciousness. His blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical exam his speech is slurred and he has difficulty following commands. His abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL. Which of the following findings would be expected in this patient's urine?

Answer Choices:
A. Calcium oxalate crystals
B. Hyaline casts
C. Urine ketones
D. Urate crystals

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which urinalysis finding is expected in a 55-year-old man with suspected ethylene glycol (antifreeze) ingestion, altered mental status, tachycardia, and early renal injury. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of ethylene glycol toxicity and its renal mechanism. Then, I should verify the expected timeline for urinary crystal formation. Next, I will review the differential of urine crystals and casts to ensure I'm not missing confounders. Finally, I will match the most likely finding to the clinical scenario and confirm the answer with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and mechanism. Ethylene glycol itself is minimally toxic; injury comes from metabolism to glycolic acid (causing high anion gap metabolic acidosis) and oxalic acid, which complexes with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals that deposit in renal tubules, causing acute kidney injury and supporting the diagnosis when seen on urinalysis [^98cb7fee] [^6829f9bc].

> Wait, let me verify the timing of crystal appearance. I initially thought crystals might appear immediately, but hold on, I should verify the latent period. Calcium oxalate crystals typically appear in the urine within roughly 8–24 hours after ingestion as metabolism proceeds, which fits this presentation several hours after exposure with rising creatinine and BUN indicating early AKI, making calcium oxalate crystals the expected finding on microscopy [^6325048e] [^98cb7fee].

> I need to check the alternatives to avoid premature closure. Hyaline casts are nonspecific and can be seen with dehydration or proteinuria, but they are not a hallmark of ethylene glycol toxicity; urine ketones would suggest alcoholic or diabetic ketoacidosis rather than oxalate nephropathy; urate crystals point toward gout or tumor lysis, not ethylene glycol. None of these align with the pathophysiology here as well as calcium oxalate crystals do [^ff676142] [^b491622f].

> Let me consider confounders and edge cases. Fluorescent urine has been proposed as a clue, but wait, I should double-check that. Fluorescence is unreliable and not specific for ethylene glycol ingestion, so I should not rely on it; likewise, a negative urine drug screen does not exclude toxic ingestion, reinforcing that microscopy for crystals is the key bedside test in this context [^49591e21] [^a4f4307c].

> I should confirm with real-world examples. Multiple case reports and reviews document that calcium oxalate crystals in the urine sediment are a classic and expected finding in ethylene glycol poisoning, often coinciding with high anion gap metabolic acidosis and rising creatinine, which matches this patient's trajectory and makes calcium oxalate crystals the most likely and specific urinalysis finding here [^cd6367e2] [^06ced9f9] [^98cb7fee].

> Putting this together, the expected urinalysis finding is calcium oxalate crystals reflecting oxalate nephropathy from ethylene glycol metabolism, with timing consistent with several hours post-ingestion and early AKI. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Calcium oxalate crystals [^98cb7fee] [^6325048e].

---

The expected urine finding in ethylene glycol poisoning is **calcium oxalate crystals** [^98cb7fee], which appear 4–8 hours after ingestion and indicate renal tubular injury from oxalate deposition [^6325048e]. These crystals are a hallmark of ethylene glycol toxicity and are most often seen as monohydrate (needle-shaped) or dihydrate (envelope-shaped) forms on microscopy [^notfound]. Hyaline casts are nonspecific and not characteristic of ethylene glycol poisoning, while ketones and urate crystals are unrelated to this ingestion.

---

## Pathophysiology of ethylene glycol poisoning

Ethylene glycol itself is minimally toxic; toxicity results from **hepatic metabolism** to glycolic and oxalic acids [^98cb7fee]. Glycolic acid causes a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, while oxalic acid complexes with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals that deposit in renal tubules, causing acute kidney injury (AKI) [^98cb7fee].

---

## Clinical timeline of ethylene glycol poisoning

| **Phase** | **Timeframe** | **Clinical features** | **Laboratory findings** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Phase 1 | 0–12 hours | - CNS depression <br/> - Ataxia <br/> - Slurred speech <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting | - Elevated osmolal gap <br/> - Minimal acidosis |
| Phase 2 | 12–24 hours | - Tachycardia <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Tachypnea <br/> - Metabolic acidosis | - High anion gap metabolic acidosis <br/> - Rising lactate |
| Phase 3 | 24–72 hours | - Acute kidney injury <br/> - Oliguria <br/> - Flank pain | - Elevated BUN/creatinine <br/> - Calcium oxalate crystals in urine |

---

## Expected urine findings

Calcium oxalate crystals are the **expected urine finding** in ethylene glycol poisoning, typically appearing 4–8 hours after ingestion [^6325048e]. These crystals are categorized as monohydrate (needle-shaped) or dihydrate (envelope-shaped) forms and are a direct result of oxalic acid complexing with calcium in the renal tubules [^98cb7fee].

---

## Clinical significance of calcium oxalate crystals

The presence of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine is **highly suggestive of ethylene glycol poisoning** and indicates significant renal tubular injury [^98cb7fee]. These crystals can cause tubular obstruction, interstitial inflammation, and acute kidney injury, which may progress to renal failure if untreated [^6325048e].

---

## Other urine findings in ethylene glycol poisoning

While calcium oxalate crystals are the most specific finding, other urinalysis abnormalities may occur, including:

- **Proteinuria**: Due to tubular injury.
- **Hematuria**: From renal tubular damage.
- **Leukocyturia**: From interstitial inflammation.

However, these findings are **nonspecific** and can occur in various renal conditions [^ff676142].

---

## Differential diagnosis of urine crystals

It is essential to differentiate calcium oxalate crystals from other urine crystals:

- **Uric acid crystals**: Diamond or barrel-shaped, associated with gout or uric acid nephrolithiasis.
- **Cystine crystals**: Hexagonal, associated with cystinuria.
- **Struvite crystals**: Coffin-lid shaped, associated with urinary tract infections caused by urease-producing bacteria.

Calcium oxalate crystals are **unique in their association with ethylene glycol poisoning** and should prompt immediate consideration of this diagnosis [^98cb7fee].

---

## Clinical management implications

Recognizing calcium oxalate crystals in the urine of a patient with suspected ethylene glycol poisoning has **critical management implications**:

- **Immediate antidotal therapy**: Fomepizole or ethanol to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase and prevent further metabolism of ethylene glycol to toxic metabolites [^21e03be7].
- **Hemodialysis**: Indicated in severe cases to remove ethylene glycol and its metabolites, correct metabolic acidosis, and prevent further renal damage [^98cb7fee].
- **Supportive care**: Fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and monitoring of renal function [^7664a59d].

---

## Conclusion

The expected urine finding in a patient with suspected ethylene glycol poisoning is **calcium oxalate crystals** [^98cb7fee], reflecting renal tubular injury from oxalate deposition. This finding, along with clinical context and laboratory abnormalities, supports the diagnosis and guides urgent management to prevent progression to acute kidney injury and multi-organ failure [^6325048e].

A 13-year-old girl presents to the emergency department for the second time with an unresponsive episode. She has a GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) score of 11 on arrival and all other observations are normal. The story is unclear, but there are ongoing safeguarding concerns and the family are known to social services. All investigations are normal. After a period of observation on the ward, her GCS returns to normal and she appears well. Both on the first presentation and this presentation ingestion of a toxin was suspected. However, this was denied by the patient and urine toxicology screen was negative. Does this rule out toxin ingestion? Will this change your management?

Review of ethylene glycol toxicity

EG is the main component of commercial antifreeze and is present in many industrial products including coolants and de-icers. EG itself has minimal toxicity, but its metabolites are responsible for most of the clinical effects; glycolate contributes to the acidemia, while deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in tissues causes AKI and neurological complications.

The initial clinical manifestations of EG poisoning mimic those of ethanol ingestion, namely inebriation and ataxia. As EG is metabolized, metabolic acidemia appears after a latent period of approximately 3–6 h after ingestion. Thereafter, progressive neurotoxicity (coma, cerebral edema, cranial nerve palsies, and seizures), cardiotoxicity (tachycardia with hypertension or hypotension), respiratory distress, and AKI occur. The incidence of AKI varies between 30 and 70%. Multiorgan failure and death can occur at this stage. Cranial nerve palsies, radiculopathy, and other neuropathies may appear several days after ingestion, despite treatment. Rarely, brainstem and basal ganglia injuries are reported.

### Two gaps too many, three clues too few? Do elevated osmolal and anion gaps with crystalluria always mean ethylene glycol poisoning? [^cd6367e2]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

A 60-year-old African-American man with a medical history significant for heavy alcohol abuse, hypertension, delirium tremens, nephrolithiasis and seizure disorder was brought to the hospital with altered mental status. He was found to have high anion gap metabolic acidosis with significantly elevated lactate along with an elevated osmolal gap and calcium oxalate crystals in his urine. With this combination of findings, ethylene glycol poisoning was high in the differential. This case report describes why ethylene glycol poisoning was not the diagnosis in this patient despite the presence of these three classic laboratory findings, therefore emphasising the fact that these findings should not be taken at face value because they can be seen collectively in a patient yet each have a different cause.

### A case of strychnine poisoning from a southeast Asian herbal remedy [^d8193bfb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Strychnine is a highly toxic alkaloid found in both naturally occurring compounds and commercial products. Extracts of fruits from the strychnine plant have been used in Southeast Asia as remedies for various illnesses. We describe strychnine poisoning from ingestion of a Southeast Asian herbal supplement quantitatively confirmed by serum and urine analysis.

Case Report

A 40-year-old Cambodian woman presented to the emergency department with a complaint of jaw pain and spasms. The patient was staying with a relative and drank 2 oz from an unmarked bottle that she thought contained vodka. She then developed trismus and abdominal cramping, after which a family member said the bottle contained a compound called "slang nut". Her vital signs were as follows: heart rate 102 beats/min, blood pressure 142/72 mm Hg, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and oxygen level 100%. The physical examination revealed no significant abnormalities. Serum toxicologic screens were negative except for strychnine levels that revealed a serum concentration of 350 ng/mL and a urine concentration > 200 ng/mL. The patient was observed for 2.5 h and discharged with no long-term complications. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Strychnine is a well-known compound that has been used in poisons, rodenticides, and performance enhancing drugs for years. In the Western world, strychnine is a much less common poisoning given that its use has been restricted because of the potential for severe toxicity; however, given its potentially high mortality, it is important to be aware of other sources of exposure, including those from herbal and homeopathic remedies.

### Severe metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate and multi-organ dysfunction secondary to ethylene glycol toxicity [^58793166]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

This case report describes a male in his early 40s presenting with severe ethylene glycol (EG) poisoning from antifreeze ingestion, marked by profound metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia and multi-organ failure. The patient was found unconscious in the garage with shallow breathing and hypothermia, progressing to critical illness despite aggressive resuscitative measures. Diagnostic evaluations revealed high anion gap metabolic acidosis, elevated lactate, hyperkalaemia and a high osmolal gap, confirmed to be due to EG toxicity. Immediate interventions included continuous renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation and supportive care, alongside bicarbonate therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics. However, the patient deteriorated rapidly, developing fixed dilated pupils, cerebral oedema and eventual death on the third day of admission. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of managing severe toxic EG poisoning in critically ill patients and underscores the importance of early recognition and intervention to improve outcomes.

### Acute chloroform ingestion successfully treated with intravenously administered N-acetylcysteine [^771361cc]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Case Report

A 19-year-old African-American man was found unconscious in his car with a suicide note and a half-empty bottle of chloroform he had ordered on the internet from overseas (Fig. 1). He was brought to the emergency department obtunded and required immediate endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. It was later determined that he had drank about 75 mL of the chloroform prior to his being discovered. His initial vital signs included a heart rate of 75 beats/min and a blood pressure of 113/60 mm Hg; he was mechanically ventilated at a rate of 16 breaths/min with an oxygen saturation of 100% on 100% FIO 2. His physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. The patient had an ECG performed, which did not reveal any signs of ischemia with a QRS of 86 ms and QT of 408 ms. Cardiac monitoring did not reveal ectopy. Blood drawn on arrival revealed a glucose of 135 mg/dL, AST of 18 IU/L, ALT of 10 IU/L, total bilirubin of 1.3 mg/dL, and direct bilirubin of 0.1 mg/dL; PT was 13.6 s (INR 1.16) and had normal serum electrolytes, BUN, and creatinine. His admission serum ethanol concentration was 15 mg/dL, and serum salicylate and acetaminophen concentrations were undetectable. His admission urine drug screen was only positive for opiates.

### Ethylene glycol ingestion treated only with fomepizole [^b92b3ca5]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ethylene glycol is a widely used chemical that is capable of causing significant injury if ingested. Treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning typically includes basic supportive care, alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition, and hemodialysis. Recent data have suggested that hemodialysis may not be necessary for cases of ethylene glycol poisoning that can be treated with fomepizole as blocking therapy before acidosis or renal dysfunction develops.

Case Report

A 33-year-old man presented to the emergency department 1 hour after drinking approximately 1/2 gallon of ethylene glycol antifreeze and an unknown quantity of beer. On arrival he was mildly inebriated but otherwise displayed no other features of ethylene glycol poisoning. Fomepizole therapy was initiated and initial laboratory studies later revealed an osmol gap of 157 mOsm and an ethylene glycol concentration of 706 mg/dL. Nephrology and toxicology services were consulted. Over the next 3 days, fomepizole therapy was continued while the patient's acid-base status and renal function were closely monitored. No evidence of acid-base abnormalities or renal impairment was ever observed and the patient was discharged to psychiatric care on the fourth hospital day.

Discussion

This report describes the case of a patient who presented soon after a massive ingestion of ethylene glycol with very high serum concentrations. He was successfully treated using fomepizole and basic supportive care. Our patient developed neither renal insufficiency nor metabolic acidosis. His concomitant ethanol consumption, early presentation, and treatment likely contributed to his favorable outcome. This case report underscores the effectiveness of supportive care and fomepizole in the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning.

### Oliguria: an earlier and accurate biomarker of acute kidney injury? [^b2074254]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

In the context of the critically ill patient, the onset of consistent oliguria is an ominous sign that requires immediate attention. Without intervention, intermittent oliguria may turn into persistent oliguria or evolve to acute kidney injury (AKI), with severe associated morbidity and mortality. Whether the addition of urine output to the serum creatinine criteria permits earlier and more specific detection of AKI is controversial, but current evidence supports its importance in early diagnosis and management.

### A neonate with metabolic acidosis: intentional ethylene glycol poisoning [^06ced9f9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We present a rare case of the intentional poisoning of a neonate. An 8-day old child presented to an academic pediatric emergency department (ED) with respiratory distress and decreased intake. In the ED the patient was stabilized, and workup uncovered an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Blood, urine, and CSF cultures were negative at 48 h and a metabolic screen revealed elevated glycine. Calcium oxalate crystals were later found in the urinalysis, raising concern for ethylene glycol poisoning. The patient's father admitted to mixing antifreeze with the child's formula. The workup of an ill or distressed neonate should be methodical, ruling out sepsis, inborn errors of metabolism, cardiac disease, trauma, and less common etiologies such as intestinal catastrophes, renal or hepatic disease, neurologic disease, drug withdrawal, non-accidental trauma, formula mixing errors, and poisoning.

### Lessons learned from the outbreak: the use of fomepizole in children with acute kidney injury due to ethylene glycol / diethylene glycol poisoning [^78724304]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ethylene glycol (EG) and diethylene glycol (DEG) intoxication are defined as > 20 mg/dL EG/DEG in plasma, which may cause severe morbidity and mortality. The intoxication of both alcohols results from the metabolism of EG/DEG via alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) enzymes and their conversion to their active toxic metabolites. Treatment modalities include blocking the formation and removal of toxic metabolites, which can be achieved through antidote administration and renal replacement therapy. Individuals at risk of EG and DEG intoxication include patients with alcohol abuse, suicidal tendencies, and children who accidentally ingest antifreeze. In August 2022, Indonesia experienced a sudden increase in acute kidney injury cases in children, initially attributed to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), which has been widely reported in post-COVID-19 children. All admitted patients fulfilled WHO criteria for MIS-C and consequently received intravenous immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone, and anticoagulants, with three patients (18.7%) also undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange due to unresponsiveness to standard care.

It was not until mid-October, after the World Health Organization noted EG/DEG intoxication in Gambia, that we began to suspect intoxication of EG/DEG from syrup-based medications. This WHO alert played a crucial role in guiding our investigation, as it highlighted the global nature of healthcare and the importance of sharing information and experiences. The resemblance of reports in history and patients' clinical information further strengthened our suspicion. Toxicology screening was subsequently performed on 19 patients, in which EG/DEG levels were measured in either blood or urine samples. Notably, EG/DEG has a sweet taste and was used as a dilutive agent to increase drug solubility, and only up to 0.2% of the sum of EG and DEG in polyethylene glycols was allowed by the United States Pharmacopoeia. However, the EG/DEG of these medications exceeds the accepted limits.

Rhabdomyolysis and renal disease screening among stimulant users — There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine screening for rhabdomyolysis or renal disease among patients who use stimulants; however, clinicians should have an elevated degree of suspicion for these conditions when evaluating patients with long-term or heavy stimulant use and consider ordering relevant tests — such as creatine kinase [CK] for rhabdomyolysis, blood urea nitrogen [BUN]/creatinine ratio [BCR], urine albumin (ie, proteinuria) for renal disease — at a lower threshold of suspicion based on patient history and physical exam findings.

### Does fluorescent urine indicate antifreeze ingestion by children? [^49591e21]. Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Fluorescent urine has been reported to indicate antifreeze ingestion. Recently, we evaluated a child who was suspected of ethylene glycol ingestion. Although she had fluorescent urine, subsequent studies showed that she had not ingested antifreeze. We tested whether fluorescent urine indicates antifreeze ingestion by children.

Methods

A convenience sample of urine specimens from 30 hospitalized children was obtained. All of the patients had been hospitalized for reasons unrelated to poisoning. The specimens were viewed with a Wood's lamp, and the samples were identified as fluorescent or not fluorescent. A second convenience sample of urine specimens from a group of 16 healthy children was obtained, and these specimens were identified as fluorescent or not fluorescent in a similar manner.

Results

The majority of urine specimens obtained from children are fluorescent. There is variation in the interpretation of urine fluorescence among observers. The type of container used may influence the finding of fluorescence.

Conclusions

Fluorescent urine is not an indicator of ethylene glycol antifreeze ingestion by children.

### Spurious point-of-care lactate elevation in ethylene glycol intoxication: rediscovering a clinical pearl [^5f5b9c56]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 76-year-old man was found unresponsive and brought to the emergency department. Initial workup showed profound lactic acidosis on a point-of-care arterial blood gas, without clinical signs of hypoperfusion. Investigations for types A and B lactic acidosis revealed no unifying diagnosis to explain both his altered mental status and profound lactic acidosis. A toxicology workup revealed an increased osmolar gap and an elevated ethylene glycol level. The lactic acidosis and his mental status completely normalised within 8hours of renal replacement therapy initiation and fomepizole administration. Ethylene glycol metabolites have similar molecular structure with L-lactate. Some blood gas analysers are unable to differentiate them, resulting in an artefactual lactate elevation. Our case highlights the importance of recognising a falsely elevated lactate, which should raise clinical suspicion of ethylene glycol poisoning, as the treatment is time-sensitive to prevent complications and mortality.

### The approach to the patient with an unknown overdose [^fb969d21]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic overdose can present with various clinical signs and symptoms. These may be the only clues to diagnosis when the cause of toxicity is unknown at the time of initial assessment. The prognosis and clinical course of recovery of a patient poisoned by a specific agent depends largely on the quality of care delivered within the first few hours in the emergency setting. Usually the drug or toxin can be quickly identified by a careful history, a directed physical examination, and commonly available laboratory tests. Once the patient has been stabilized, the physician must consider how to minimize the bioavailability of toxin not yet absorbed, which antidotes (if any) to administer, and if other measures to enhance elimination are necessary.

Urinary chemistries vary widely in both health and disease and are affected by diet, volume status, medications, and disease states. When properly examined, these tests provide important insight into the mechanism and therapy of various clinical disorders that are first detected by abnormalities in plasma chemistries. These tests cannot be interpreted in isolation, but instead require knowledge of key clinical information, such as medications, physical examination, and plasma chemistries, to include kidney function. When used appropriately and with knowledge of limitations, urine chemistries can provide important insight into the pathophysiology and treatment of a wide variety of disorders.

### Utilizing the toxicology laboratory in the poisoned patient [^e60f8fa7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

When evaluating a potentially poisoned patient, there is no substitute for a thorough history and physical examination. Clues from the examination are generally more likely to be helpful than a "shotgun" laboratory approach that involves indiscriminate testing of blood or urine for multiple agents. When used appropriately, diagnostic tests may be of help in the management of the intoxicated patient. When a specific toxin or even class of toxins is suspected, requesting qualitative or quantitative levels may be appropriate. The purpose of this review is to examine the role of common diagnostic tests in the evaluation of the poisoned patient.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^d1a03fc1]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Urine sample inspection and behavior — identifying tampering and invalid results: All urine samples should be inspected for unusual characteristics including unexpected temperature, unusual color, unusual smell, and soapy appearance, cloudiness or particles floating in the liquid, and a recently provided sample should be within expected body temperature range, approximately 90 to 100 degrees within 4 minutes of production. A visual inspection can indicate that a sample may be dilute or adulterated, and dilute urine is lighter in color than normal urine, which ranges from light/pale yellow to dark/deep amber. If the sample exhibits unusual specimen characteristics, specimen validity testing should be considered but should not be relied upon solely as evidence of sample tampering, but as an indication of the need for further testing; abnormal urine appearance can also be the result of a urinary tract infection, kidney stones, yeast infection, diet (eg, beets, asparagus) and the use of over-the-counter vitamins and medications (eg, ex-lax, Vitamin B), and requiring a minimum volume sample can help to increase the reliability of temperature readings and visual inspection as well as ensure there will be enough specimen available for testing. The expert panel advised broad use of clinical judgment in identifying behavioral signs that a patient may have tampered with a urine sample; if a patient's behavior suggests that he or she has recently used an illicit substance, but continues to produce negative urine test results, sample collection should be observed and specimen validity testing conducted, and the provider could adjust the test panel or order a more sensitive test. Some samples are considered substituted or invalid if they fail some aspect of specimen validity testing, and if a specimen is invalid, most labs will stop the testing process on the assumption that the concentration of a drug or metabolite as measured in the sample will be uninterpretable.

### Treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning [^6829f9bc]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Ingestion of ethylene glycol may be an important contributor in patients with metabolic acidosis of unknown cause and subsequent renal failure. Expeditious diagnosis and treatment will limit metabolic toxicity and decrease morbidity and mortality. Ethylene glycol poisoning should be suspected in an intoxicated patient with anion gap acidosis, hypocalcemia, urinary crystals, and nontoxic blood alcohol concentration. Fomepizole is a newer agent with a specific indication for the treatment of ethylene glycol poisoning. Metabolic acidosis is resolved within three hours of initiating therapy. Initiation of fomepizole therapy before the serum creatinine concentration rises can minimize renal impairment. Compared with traditional ethanol treatment, advantages of fomepizole include lack of depression of the central nervous system and hypoglycemia, and easier maintenance of effective plasma levels.

### A fatal case of thallium toxicity: challenges in management [^e1ccc9ba]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Thallium is a highly toxic compound and is occasionally involved in intentional overdoses or criminal poisonings. Accidental poisonings also occur, but are increasingly rare owing to restricted use and availability of thallium. We report a fatal suicidal ingestion of thallium sulfate rodenticide in which multi-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) and Prussian Blue (PB) were both used without changing the outcome.

Case Report

A 36 year old man ingested an unknown amount of thallium sulfate grains from an old rodenticide bottle. He presented to an emergency department (ED) 45 minutes later with abdominal pain and vomiting. On examination he was agitated with a blood pressure of 141/60 mmHg and a heart rate of 146 beats per minute (bpm). He received MDAC during his initial ED management and was started on PB 18 hours post arrival; he was intubated on the following day for airway protection. The patient continued to be tachycardic and hypertensive and subsequently developed renal failure. On hospital day three, the patient developed hypotension that did not respond to fluids. The patient required vasopressors and was transferred to a tertiary care center to undergo continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The patient died shortly after his transfer. His last blood thallium concentration was 5369 mcg/L, a spot urine thallium > 2000 mcg/L, and a 24- hour urine thallium was > 2000 mcg/L.

Conclusion

Though extremely rare, thallium intoxication can be lethal despite early administration of MDAC and use of Prussian blue therapy. Rapid initiation of hemodialysis can be considered in cases of severe thallium poisoning, to remove additional thallium, to correct acid-base disturbance, or to improve renal function.

### Lessons learned from the outbreak: the use of fomepizole in children with acute kidney injury due to ethylene glycol / diethylene glycol poisoning [^6325048e]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Ethylene and diethylene glycol poisoning is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt and accurate diagnosis. Early detection is crucial, given its high morbidity and mortality rates when left untreated. Ethylene glycol is a common antifreeze component, and accidental ingestion or intentional self-harm can lead to poisoning. The mortality rate varies between 1% and 22% and is highest in patients with severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.1), high blood ethylene glycol levels, and delayed initiation of treatment (> 10 h). The presence of a serum osmolar gap can aid in diagnosis. However, over time, serum osmolality decreases as ethylene glycol is metabolized, while the serum anion gap increases, leading to anion gap acidosis and hyperosmolality, which can occur singly or in combination. – Therefore, a thorough understanding of the clinical presentation and timely laboratory tests are essential in managing this medical emergency. However, diagnosing EG/DEG poisoning can be difficult, leading to underdiagnosis and highlighting the need for increased awareness and vigilance. Metabolic acidosis is present in 86% of patients, making it challenging to obtain a medication history because of their decreased consciousness at admission. Measurements of EG/DEG levels may prove helpful, but it is not a viable option in emergency situations, as it takes several days to analyse. Within 8 to 24 h of consuming a lethal dose, the occurrence of oxalic acid and calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals can lead to cerebral edema and kidney failure due to blockage and injury to the tubular system. If left untreated, the ingestion of glycol can lead to multiorgan failure and death within 24–36 h. The recommended course of treatment for pediatric patients with EG/DEG-associated acute kidney injury involves the simultaneous administration of renal replacement therapy and fomepizole. Our study described the clinical and laboratory features of 19 patients who suffered from AKI caused by EG/DEG intoxication and were treated with fomepizole as the preferred antidote by AACT.

A 73-year-old man was transferred to the emergency department (ED). He was found unconscious in his house along with an empty 200-mL bottle of Basta(™), a herbicide containing 18% glufosinate. He was comatose with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. As his blood pressure dropped to 60/30 mmHg despite fluids and norepinephrine, 20% intravenous fat emulsion product was injected. He experienced repeated cardiopulmonary arrests during his first 4 h in the ED. When the arrests occurred, standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed, and boluses of fat emulsion were given. He was given a total of 1500 mL of 20% fat emulsion. In an attempt to correct the acidosis, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) was started. Within 5 min of starting CRRT, the transmembrane pressure increased sharply and the machine stopped.

He had no chronic diarrhoea or intestinal surgery. He was a health-minded individual who had read extensively about benefit of antioxidants. Initial work-up was unrevealing. Within a few weeks after first visit, he developed acute symptomatic worsening kidney injury with nausea, vomiting and creatinine up to 6.8mg/dL. Repeat examination of the urine sediment revealed casts containing calcium oxalate crystals. A deeper dietary history revealed widespread oxalate precursor consumption. A kidney biopsy confirmed oxalate nephropathy. Restriction of oxalate consumption combined with adequate hydration, oral calcium acetate resulted in partial renal recovery without need for haemodialysis.

### The urine output definition of acute kidney injury is too liberal [^e5ef96b9]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- A urine output threshold for defining AKI of < 0.5 ml/kg/hour over 6 hours is too liberal.

- A threshold of < 0.3 ml/kg/hour over 6 hours better fits with the plasma creatinine definition of AKI by having a similar sensitivity for a clinically relevant outcome.

- AKI may be diagnosed from urine output in as little as 2 to 3 hours.

- The urine output threshold for AKI should be adjusted for duration of urine collection.

- **AKI may be defined as**: Urine output (ml/kg/hour) < 0.03 × duration of collection (hours) + 0.11, where the duration is between 3 and 9 hours.

### Massive ethylene glycol ingestion treated with fomepizole alone-a viable therapeutic option [^7faab885]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Fomepizole is used to treat and prevent toxicity from ethylene glycol poisoning. Treatment with fomepizole without hemodialysis in massive ethylene glycol ingestion has been rarely reported in the literature; however, published literature and practice guidelines recommend considering dialysis for ethylene glycol levels > 50 mg/dL. We report a case of massive ethylene glycol ingestion resulting in the highest serum ethylene glycol concentration in a patient without ethanol co-ingestion who was treated with fomepizole and was not hemodialyzed. A 48-year-old male presented to the emergency department after reportedly ingesting > 1 liter of antifreeze in an attempt at self-harm. He denied concomitant ethanol consumption. His initial presenting serum ethylene glycol level was 700 mg/dL, with normal renal function, and a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap. One hour after presentation, he was started on intravenous fomepizole. Treatment with fomepizole continued until the patient's plasma ethylene glycol concentration was 16 mg/dL. His metabolic acidosis quickly resolved, he had no adverse reactions to the treatment, and his renal function remained normal. Ultimately, he was discharged to a psychiatric unit without sequelae. Published literature and practice guidelines suggests considering hemodialysis initiation in patients with an ethylene glycol level > 50 mg/dL. This recommendation is anecdotally, rather than evidence, based. With the potential risks inherent in hemodialysis, our case provides evidence that treatment with fomepizole without hemodialysis appears to be a viable alternative option in patients with even extremely high plasma ethylene glycol concentrations as long as their renal function is intact.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^ef98780c]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

The decision to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) and the optimal timing for commencement is a difficult decision faced by clinicians when treating acute kidney injury (AKI) in the intensive care setting. Without clinically significant ureamic symptoms or emergent indications (electrolyte abnormalities, volume overload) the timing of RRT initiation remains contentious and inconsistent across health providers. Current trends of initiating RRT in the ICU are often based on isolated blood urea levels without clear guidelines demonstrating an upper limit for treatment. Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

Studies using both measures show increased incidence, suggesting SCr alone may miss patients, and using urine output criteria (criterion 3) reduces discordance between criterion 1 and criterion 2, capturing cases such as B, C, D, and F.

### Enteric fever [^702eb17d]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

How is it diagnosed?

Enteric fever is mainly a clinical diagnosis based on history and examination. A gradual onset of fever, particularly with one or more abdominal symptoms, should raise suspicion of enteric fever in endemic areas. Ask about travel to endemic regions.

Physical findings are often non-specific. Soft tender hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal distension, mild ascites, and a diffuse or localised tenderness may be noticed on abdominal examination. Hepatitis and hepatomegaly are more common in children under 5 years old and are seen in 30–50% of children with enteric fever. Scattered wheezes or crepitations in the chest might suggest bronchitis. A bradycardia relative to the height of the fever may be noted. Rose spots, blanching erythematous maculopapular lesions on the trunk, were considered characteristic of typhoid fever, but are now rarely reported (fig 1). If the disease progresses beyond the first week the patient often becomes impassive and unresponsive.

Fig 1
Example of erythematous maculopapular lesions on the trunk characteristic of typhoid fever

What are the investigations?

Request a complete blood count and blood culture. The total white cell count is usually within, or just below, the normal range in enteric fever. Leucocytosis (raised white cell count) may suggest intestinal perforation or another diagnosis such as a pyogenic infection or leptospirosis. A mild normochromic or hypochromic anaemia, mild thrombocytopenia, and mild elevation of liver transaminases with a normal bilirubin are common. The C reactive protein (CRP) is usually elevated in enteric fever.

Blood culture is the optimum method to confirm the diagnosis by isolating the organism and testing antimicrobial sensitivity. It takes two to three days for a result, and empirical antimicrobial treatment is required in the interim. It has a sensitivity of 61% (95% CI 52 to 70) (see supplementary table 2 on bmj.com). A negative blood culture does not exclude enteric fever. Antibiotic pre-treatment, low sample volume, and low circulating bacterial load in the blood result in this low sensitivity. Bone marrow culture gives a higher yield, but it is rarely performed. Faeces, urine, or bile aspirate may be cultured, but a positive result may indicate chronic faecal carriage rather than acute infection.

Case 1:

A 47-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with altered mental state after being found unresponsive at home by his neighbors. Little is known about his medical history except for a few medications found in his home, including over-the-counter antacids and ibuprofen. His neighbors indicated the patient had a history of heavy smoking and noticed some weight loss over the last 6 months. On arrival, his blood pressure was 95/57 mm Hg, pulse rate was 96 beats/min, and he was afebrile. The oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 92%. Basic chemistry laboratory testing showed Na +, 142 mEq/L; K +, 2.9 mEq/L; Cl −, 90 mEq/L; HCO 3 −, 45 mEq/L; total calcium, 9.1 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen (SUN), 38 mg/dL; and serum creatinine (Scr), 1.7 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas (ABG) revealed pH, 7.48; Pa 2, 52 mm Hg; and PaO 2, 70 mm Hg. The nephrology service was consulted for the workup and management of the acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities.

Question 1:
The differential diagnosis of metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia in this patient should include (select the best answer):

Excessive use of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide
Ectopic corticotropin production due to possible lung malignancy
Intake of HCO 3 − -containing antacid for heartburn in the setting of pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD)
Gastric outlet obstruction with vomiting

For the answer to the question, see the following text.

Box 1 displays the major causes of metabolic alkalosis, which are divided into 2 distinct categories based on intravascular volume status. The following sections will review the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis in gastric acid loss and diuretic overuse as the 2 prototypes of GI and kidney acid loss with volume depletion. We will then discuss the role of mineralocorticoid excess in the generation and maintenance of metabolic alkalosis in both volume-depleted and volume-expanded states.

### Urinalysis findings and urinary kidney injury biomarker concentrations [^4a488d82]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Urine dipsticks are a cheap, readily available, "point of care" test. We found significant interference from factors in urine measured by dipstick and the novel AKI biomarkers investigated here. Future studies should assess the interference of common urine elements on levels of biomarkers of interest and explore the impact of accounting for these elements on their prognostic/diagnostic performance.

### Minding the osmol gap: a sentinel event and subsequent laboratory investigation [^3c873b9b]. Clinical Toxicology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Many hospitals are unable to determine toxic alcohol concentrations in a clinically meaningful time frame. Thus, clinicians use surrogate markers when evaluating potentially poisoned patients.

Index Case

A patient presented after an intentional antifreeze (ethylene glycol) ingestion with an osmol gap of -10.6 that remained stable one hour later. Further investigation revealed that the serum osmolality was calculated and not measured. The true osmol gap was 16.4, which correlated to a measured ethylene glycol concentration of 808mg/L (80.8mg/dL, 13.0mmol/L).

Survey

A telephone survey of hospital laboratories in our catchment area was performed to investigate the potential for similar events.

Results

Thirty-eight (47 percent) hospitals responded. No laboratories were able to test for toxic alcohols. One hospital (2.6 percent) reported routinely calculating osmolality based on chemistries, while two hospitals (5.3 percent) reported scenarios in which this might occur. Thirty-five (92.1 percent) hospitals could directly measure osmolality. Two hospitals (5.3 percent) were reliant on outside laboratories for osmolality measurement.

Limitations

The 47 percent response rate and one geographic area are significant limitations.

Discussion

Over 10 percent of hospitals that responded could have significant difficulty assessing patients with toxic alcohol ingestion.

Conclusions

Until the standard of rapidly obtaining toxic alcohol concentrations is broadly implemented, we recommend that policies and procedures be put in place to minimize errors associated with the determination of the osmol gap.

### Urinalysis: a comprehensive review [^ff676142]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A complete urinalysis includes physical, chemical, and microscopic examinations. Midstream clean collection is acceptable in most situations, but the specimen should be examined within two hours of collection. Cloudy urine often is a result of precipitated phosphate crystals in alkaline urine, but pyuria also can be the cause. A strong odor may be the result of a concentrated specimen rather than a urinary tract infection. Dipstick urinalysis is convenient, but false-positive and false-negative results can occur. Specific gravity provides a reliable assessment of the patient's hydration status. Microhematuria has a range of causes, from benign to life threatening. Glomerular, renal, and urologic causes of microhematuria often can be differentiated by other elements of the urinalysis. Although transient proteinuria typically is a benign condition, persistent proteinuria requires further work-up. Uncomplicated urinary tract infections diagnosed by positive leukocyte esterase and nitrite tests can be treated without culture.

### A doctor who is blamed for a patient's condition… [^9da710d0]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Case Scenario A 55-year-old patient who is the mother of six grown children uses alcohol to soothe herself and seems generally annoyed. She has been my patient for 15 years but has never expressed any warmth toward me. She only allows minimal care, has told me little about herself and has refused all tests except blood work. Her primary symptom has been fatigue. She smokes two packs of cigarettes a day and eats only one small meal. She has looked cachectic all the time I have known her. About two years ago, she came into my office with myalgias, fever and nausea. The only abnormalities I found were elevated white blood cell count and liver enzymes. A hepatitis panel showed old hepatitis A infection. I insisted she have a chest radiograph, ultrasound examination of the abdomen and mammography. She reluctantly agreed to these tests. An abdominal lesion was seen on the ultrasound scan; she then underwent computed tomographic scanning.

The reading was "probable hemangioma, " but the patient refused a follow-up magnetic resonance image. By this time, she felt better and the liver enzymes had returned to almost normal. Last year, she came in for a routine Papanicolaou smear, at which time she reported dry, itchy skin without a rash. On examination she was found to be icteric. Her bilirubin level was 5. 9 mg per dL. An MRI led to the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, and at laparoscopy the entire peritoneum was found to be seeded. Now the patient and most of her family blame me for her condition and will not talk to me. Her husband is the only family member who maintains contact, and the rest of the family criticize him for being "nice" to me. He tells them this is not a good time to change physicians because his wife needs referrals. I know the patient is suffering and angry. I sincerely want to help her through this, but she will not talk to anyone and will not consider hospice care.

Commentary Our colleague faces the situation of having evaluated a patient with diffuse myalgias, fever and nausea. After finding evidence of liver damage and an abnormal CT scan, the patient refused an appropriately recommended MRI, resulting in a delay of the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma. The physician is blamed by the patient who, along with most family members, refuses to see him. The patient's husband continues to see the physician to obtain sub-specialty referrals for his wife. My suggestion for the best way to help the patient and her family is to identify and explore the complex emotions and interpersonal dynamics as they affect the physician, the patient and her husband, and to base future interventions on that assessment. The family physician fears a lawsuit and is also concerned about the patient and her husband. Fortunately, a lawsuit appears to be unlikely as long as the physician maintains a supportive relationship with the patient's husband.

Furthermore, the probability of a successful lawsuit, in any event, is low as long as the patient's chart documents her decision not to undergo the recommended MRI at the time of the initial presentation. This case reminds us all of the importance of documenting prospectively the complexities of our decision-making process with regard to our patients. This physician must feel anger and hurt at being attacked and rejected by a patient of 15 years. Either or both of these emotions may rekindle similar feelings remaining from childhood, or from other professional or interpersonal experiences Our emotional responses, like those of our patients, are frequently multiple and, at times, conflicting. If we do not explore the full range of our feelings, our ambivalence may adversely influence our verbal or nonverbal interactions with our patients. However, in this case, I would not recommend expressing these feelings directly to the patient or her family.

### Meclofenamate sodium [^dfce945a]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

OVERDOSAGE

The following is based on the little information available concerning overdosage with meclofenamate sodium and related compounds. After a massive overdose, CNS stimulation may be manifested by irrational behavior, marked agitation and generalized seizures. Following this phase, renal toxicity (falling urine output, rising creatinine, abnormal urinary cellular elements) may be noted with possible oliguria or anuria and azotemia. A 24 year-old male was anuric for approximately one week after ingesting an overdose of 6 to 7 grams of meclofenamate sodium. Spontaneous diuresis and recovery subsequently occurred.

Management consists of emptying the stomach by emesis or lavage and instilling an ample dose of activated charcoal into the stomach. There is some evidence that charcoal will actively absorb meclofenamate sodium, but dialysis or hemoperfusion may be less effective because of plasma protein binding. The seizures should be controlled by an appropriate anticonvulsant regimen. Attention should be directed throughout, by careful monitoring, to the preservation of vital functions and fluid-electrolyte balance. Dialysis may be required to correct serious azotemia or electrolyte imbalance.

### Acute kidney injury among children likely associated with diethylene glycol-contaminated medications-the Gambia, June-September 2022 [^e69aa05f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This investigation strongly suggests that medications contaminated with DEG or EG imported into The Gambia led to this AKI cluster among children. AKI outbreaks associated with DEG-contaminated pharmaceutical products have been documented in Panama, Nigeria, India, and Haiti. Patients with DEG poisoning can experience a range of signs and symptoms, including altered mental status, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms; however, the most consistent manifestation is AKI, characterized by oliguria (low urine output) or anuria, progressing over 1–3 days to renal failure (indicated by elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen). In past DEG outbreaks, manufacturers have been suspected of substituting DEG in the place of more expensive, pharmaceutical-grade solvents. Medication testing supported contaminated medical syrups as the etiology of this cluster of AKI cases.

### An isolated elevation in blood urea level is not' uraemia' and not an indication for renal replacement therapy in the ICU [^71ce38d4]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Currently there is no well-established upper-limit of serum urea that serves as an indication for initiation of RRT in AKI. Using urea in isolation is difficult and potentially flawed given the variation in base level and production rates amongst different populations as well as it's negligibility as an accurate measure of metabolite toxicity. Furthermore, AKI is a multifactorial condition and it is likely to present earlier with other concerning metabolic or fluid overload abnormalities requiring dialysis rather than isolated elevated blood urea levels. Studies have considered the appropriate timing of initial RRT including early and delayed/late commencement of therapy, with a recent meta-analysis concluding there is no added benefit. Most studies initiated RRT once blood urea level exceeded 40 mmol/L, which is reflected in clinical practice despite evidence to suggest it does not correlate well with onset of uraemic symptoms.

Although the appropriate upper limit remains unclear, it is reasonable to conclude that a blood urea level less than 40 mmol/L is not in itself an indication for RRT therapy, especially in the absence of supporting evidence of kidney impairment (anuria, elevated serum creatinine), presenting a welcome reminder to treat the patient and not a number.

Case Presentation

A 43-year-old south-Asian female presented to the emergency department with a reduced level of consciousness, as reported by her roommates. According to them, she had been well throughout the day but suddenly became unresponsive and non-communicative around midnight without any jerky movements or episodes of incontinence.

Upon arrival, the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 10 and vitally stable. Blood tests revealed severely abnormal renal function, with a markedly elevated creatinine level (~ 2000 µmol/L), and elevated inflammatory markers (Table 1). Emergency dialysis was initiated via a central venous line, after which the patient regained consciousness. She denied any significant past medical history and had no fever, cough or abdominal pain. She reported frequent vomiting and urination earlier that day, which were later attributed to underlying obstructive uropathy and worsening renal function. She had no history of sick contacts and had returned from Indonesia approximately 8 months prior.

### Adolescent presents with altered mental status and elevated anion gap after suicide attempt by ethylene glycol ingestion [^9e0681fd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2016). Low credibility.

We report the case of a 16-year-old healthy adolescent male who presented to the local emergency department with altered mental status. En route to a tertiary care facility, he began to decompensate and was found to be markedly acidotic. Further investigation revealed an elevated anion gap, and physical examination showed only abdominal pain and decreased level of consciousness. A broad differential diagnosis was considered at the time of the patient's presentation at the tertiary care center including ingestion of a volatile alcohol, sepsis, and an abdominal catastrophe. Although fomepizole and emergent dialysis were being initiated, laboratory tests confirmed ethylene glycol poisoning. This case demonstrates the importance of early recognition of potential ingestions in patients with altered mental status and supportive laboratory findings.

### Appropriate use of drug testing in clinical addiction medicine [^f7241f63]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Unclear test results — laboratory communication and tampering management specify that when test results are unclear, providers should communicate with the testing laboratory to properly interpret them, and the provider should consider consulting with a medical toxicologist or MRO for assistance in interpreting unclear test results. If tampering is suspected, a provider may have the option to retain the sample for additional testing (including specimen validity testing), use a different matrix, or change/add to the test panel, and the original sample should not be discarded; instead, it should be retained to help investigate whether and how tampering occurred. Note that urine is the matrix most prone to sample tampering.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^4ef26db6]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

HRS-AKI — diagnostic investigations emphasize bland urine, daily creatinine monitoring, infection workup, and limited need for pelvic ultrasound. "Patients with HRS-AKI have bland urine microscopic examination but do not respond with return of serum creatinine to ≤ 0.3 mg/dL of baseline to fluid challenge alone". Infection evaluation is advised: "Infection should be ruled out by careful physical examination for evidence of cellulitis and pneumonia and by investigations including chest radiography, urine and blood cultures, and diagnostic paracentesis for exclusion of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, the most common cause of HRS-AKI". For monitoring, "Serum creatinine is measured daily to assess AKI stage". Imaging notes that "Small echogenic kidneys on ultrasonography indicate structural renal disease, but a pelvic ultrasound is usually not needed, as postrenal obstruction is an uncommon cause of AKI in patients with cirrhosis".

### Fomepizole alone for severe infant ethylene glycol poisoning [^bf69ffba]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of a massive ingestion of ethylene glycol in an infant successfully treated by fomepizole without hemodialysis.

Design

Descriptive case report.

Setting

Pediatric intensive care unit.

Patient

A 5-mo-old boy who ingested 200 mL of an antifreeze solution.

Interventions

Antidotal therapy with a total of seven doses of fomepizole administered intravenously with an interval of 12 hrs (15 mg/kg as loading dose, then 10 mg/kg). Hemodialysis was not performed.

Measurements and Main Results

Iterative determination of ethylene glycol concentration was obtained in blood and urine. Kinetics were calculated for ethylene glycol and fomepizole elimination. The infant made a complete recovery with no change in renal function.

Conclusions

Although not yet approved for this indication in the child, fomepizole seemed safe and effective in a case of severe ethylene glycol poisoning, without the need for hemodialysis.

### Antifreeze on a freezing morning: ethylene glycol poisoning in a 2-year-old [^df90aa7a]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

This case report describes the presentation and management of a 2-year-old child who ingested a potentially fatal amount of ethylene glycol (EG). There are few published cases worldwide of EG poisoning in children managed with fomepizole. All cases described in the literature were managed in a paediatric intensive care unit. In this case, the child presented irritable, pale and confused with high anion gap metabolic acidosis. As there were no paediatric intensive care beds available in the region, the child was successfully managed in a high dependency area in our district general hospital. The child fully recovered and was discharged home in 7 days. The authors believe that multi-disciplinary team management and the use of fomepizole contributed to the positive outcome and this case raised many useful learning points.

### Skin manifestations of primarySepticemia [^a2572ce0]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

A 55-year-old man from the southwest United States (Tucson, AZ) presented with altered sensorium. He has a history of alcohol-induced liver cirrhosis. Family members reported the patient had complained of abdominal discomfort, watery nonbloody diarrhea, malaise, and leg discoloration earlier that day. He had not traveled outside of the United States for more than 20 years. Vitals were significant for hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypothermia (35.4°C). Pertinent physical examination findings revealed scleral icterus, abdominal distension, and cutaneous ecchymosis with scattered hemorrhagic appearing bullae located on both lower extremities (Figure 1A and 1B). Laboratory investigations uncovered a white blood cell count 1.2 × 10 9 cells/µL, platelet count 31 × 10 9 cells/µL, international normalized ratio 2.1, total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dL, serum bicarbonate 7 mMol/L, blood urea nitrogen 66 mg/dL, creatinine 6.6 mg/dL, and lactic acid 13.0 mMol/L. The Gram stain of the bullae aspirate (Figure 1C) and blood (Figure 1D) revealed Gram-negative bacilli with a curved appearance. Growth from all sampled sources identified the culprit microorganism as Vibrio vulnificus. Despite aggressive supportive care in the medical intensive care unit and broad-spectrum antibiotics, the patient unfortunately died from multiorgan failure.

### Cases from the Osler medical service at johns hopkins university. antiglomerular basement membrane disease [^7d12741e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old Taiwanese man with no notable medical history was admitted with low-grade fevers and night sweats that had persisted for 5 to 6 weeks. An extensive investigation at another hospital could not determine the cause of the fevers, but documented acute renal failure with a blood urea nitrogen level of 60 mg/dL and a serum creatinine level of 5.6 mg/dL. He was admitted to the Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation. The patient, who had been living in the United States for the past 20 years, reported no recent travel and no behaviors that are associated with transmission of human immunodeficiency virus. He was not taking any medications, and he denied using herbal or nutritional supplements. He had no recent weight loss. There were no specific complaints on review of systems. On physical examination, he was a thin, middle-aged man in no distress. Vital signs included a temperature of 37.5 degrees C, a blood pressure of 166/86 mm Hg, a pulse of 70 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and 99% oxygen saturation on room air. Sclera were anicteric, and he had no palpable adenopathy. His lungs were clear, and his heart rate was regular without extra sounds. His abdomen was thin, nontender, and without masses or organomegaly. There was no edema or signs of embolism in the extremities. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 14,200/mL(3), a hematocrit of 23.1%, and a platelet count of 456,000/mL(3). Blood chemistries were notable for a blood urea nitrogen level of 61 mg/dL and a serum creatinine level of 7.6 mg/dL. Levels of aminotransferases, total bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. Urinalysis revealed large hemoglobin, 1+ protein, numerous red blood cells, and 3 to 5 white blood cells. Numerous red blood cell casts were seen on microscopic examination of the urine sediment. The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate was > 130 mm/h, and his C-reactive protein level was elevated at 12.6 mg/dL. Serologies were negative for antinuclear antibodies and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies; serum complement levels were normal. What is the diagnosis?

Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) diagnostic algorithm — spot urine testing and actions: Patients with symptoms suggestive of AHP undergo spot urine testing for aminolevulinic acid (ALA), porphobilinogen (PBG), and creatinine; if the branch shows "Urine ALA/PBG > 10 mg/g creatinine", the pathway proceeds to genetic testing to determine the specific AHP, whereas if "Urine ALA/PBG normal", AHP is excluded as a cause of symptoms. Urine total porphyrins are not recommended as a screening test and testing is most informative during symptoms, and if only ALA is elevated, lead level and urine organic acids should be checked to rule out lead poisoning and hereditary tyrosinemia.

### Acute kidney injury [^7664a59d]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Acute kidney injury (formerly known as acute renal failure) is a syndrome characterised by the rapid loss of the kidney's excretory function and is typically diagnosed by the accumulation of end products of nitrogen metabolism (urea and creatinine) or decreased urine output, or both. It is the clinical manifestation of several disorders that affect the kidney acutely. Acute kidney injury is common in hospital patients and very common in critically ill patients. In these patients, it is most often secondary to extrarenal events. How such events cause acute kidney injury is controversial. No specific therapies have emerged that can attenuate acute kidney injury or expedite recovery; thus, treatment is supportive. New diagnostic techniques (eg, renal biomarkers) might help with early diagnosis. Patients are given renal replacement therapy if acute kidney injury is severe and biochemical or volume-related, or if uraemic-toxaemia-related complications are of concern. If patients survive their illness and do not have premorbid chronic kidney disease, they typically recover to dialysis independence. However, evidence suggests that patients who have had acute kidney injury are at increased risk of subsequent chronic kidney disease.

### Diagnostic value of urinary sodium, chloride, urea, and flow [^4fca00f1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Up to 30% of hospitalized critically ill patients may have a rise in serum creatinine concentration. In addition to history and physical examination, there is diagnostic value in assessing urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in these patients. The correct interpretation of these urinary parameters can avoid unnecessary volume overload and mechanical ventilation, risk factors for increased mortality in patients with rising serum creatinine. The present article also discusses the role of arterial underfilling in causing prerenal azotemia in the presence of an increase in total body sodium and extracellular fluid expansion. As with extracellular fluid volume depletion, arterial underfilling secondary to impaired cardiac function or primary arterial vasodilation can delay or prevent recovery from ischemic or toxic acute tubular necrosis. The present brief review discusses the various aspects of the correct interpretation of urinary electrolytes, solute excretion, and urine flow in the setting of a rising serum creatinine concentration.

### The poison pen: bedside diagnosis of urinary diquat [^52846e1d]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

It should be noted that, in the clinical setting, very low concentrations of urinary diquat would limit the sensitivity of this diagnostic test method. For example, one in vivo study in which rats were given oral doses of diquat dibromide (5 or 10 mg/kg) demonstrated that only 4% to 11% of the total diquat dose is actually excreted in the urine and that this excretion occurred within 24 to 48 h. Thus, the colorimetric detection test is likely to be useful only if done within the first few hours of a large-dose ingestion and preferably with the first urine voided after exposure to diquat.

Limitations to the present study include the in vitro design, subjective visual evaluation of the assay results, small sample size, and urinary concentrations of herbicide beyond the range expected clinically. Additional investigations, using samples from diquat-poisoned patients, would confirm or clarify the clinical utility of this colorimetric test, especially at the low concentrations typically found in urine after exposure.
