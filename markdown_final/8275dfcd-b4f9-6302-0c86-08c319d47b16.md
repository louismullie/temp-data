## Question

Tretinoin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tretinoin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug identity and classification. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action. Next, I will review labeled indications and key off-label uses. After that, I need to examine efficacy data by indication, including acne, photoaging, and other dermatologic conditions. I will then assess safety, tolerability, and pregnancy considerations. Finally, I should integrate guideline positions, formulation nuances, and practical prescribing pearls, and close with a balanced conclusion and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and classification. Tretinoin is all-trans-retinoic acid, a first-generation topical retinoid and a metabolite of vitamin A, with molecular weight 300.44, and it has been in clinical use for decades for dermatologic indications, which anchors its foundational role in topical therapy [^114BDqLL] [^111fPge2].

> I need to check the mechanism of action carefully. The exact mechanism remains incompletely defined, but current evidence supports decreased cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with reduced microcomedo formation, stimulation of mitotic activity, and increased turnover with extrusion of comedones; receptor-level effects include binding to RARα, RARβ, and RARγ with downstream modulation of gene expression and keratinocyte differentiation, though clinical effects may involve additional pathways as well [^115o4VZn] [^112iLtB4] [^115xi9jG].

> Next, I should review labeled indications. Topical tretinoin is FDA-approved for acne vulgaris in adults and adolescents, with some formulations specifying age 12 years and older, while Altreno (0.05% lotion) is approved down to age 9 years; additionally, certain emollient creams are indicated as adjuncts for mitigation of fine facial wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness in adults who do not achieve improvement with comprehensive skincare and sun avoidance alone [^112Jrsww] [^112kNCQV] [^116Z6v9v] [^115o4VZn].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about off-label uses. I should verify which conditions have credible evidence. Off-label dermatologic applications include treatment of acanthosis nigricans, and there is historical and emerging interest in other conditions such as psoriasis, keratosis pilaris, and certain pigmentary disorders, though the strength of evidence varies and many remain investigational; importantly, topical tretinoin has not shown benefit for keratinocyte carcinoma chemoprevention in a large VA trial, so that should not be extrapolated clinically [^116kLZDB] [^111fPge2] [^1178ZDnM].

> I will now examine acne efficacy. In controlled trials, topical tretinoin achieves approximately 21–23% treatment success using a 6-point global severity scale, with meaningful reductions in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions; newer lotion formulations show larger mean percent reductions in lesion counts and higher treatment success versus vehicle in phase 3 studies, and fixed-dose clindamycin 1.2% plus tretinoin 0.025% gel demonstrates 21–41% success in trials, aligning with guideline endorsements of retinoids as core therapy and fixed combinations as first-line in mild-to-moderate acne [^115bdPqf] [^116G1XC3] [^112MY6x1] [^115qGETQ] [^113Dgat7].

> Wait, let me verify onset of action and tolerability trade-offs. Systematic reviews suggest adapalene may have a faster onset than tretinoin for inflammatory lesions, while tretinoin's efficacy accrues over weeks; irritation remains a key barrier to adherence, prompting strategies such as short-contact application, gradual titration, and selection of lower-irritancy vehicles or formulations like microsphere gels or lotion, which can mitigate dryness and peeling without sacrificing efficacy [^115PStoa] [^115qGETQ] [^117JshKL].

> Next, I should review photoaging efficacy. Multiple studies and reviews support tretinoin as a gold standard for improving fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness, with histologic evidence of epidermal thickening and collagen remodeling; comparative reviews indicate that while some alternatives may be less irritating, high-quality head-to-head superiority data are limited, reinforcing tretinoin's primacy when patients can tolerate it [^11654V4T] [^1179KmL8] [^112ra3ky].

> I need to ensure safety and tolerability are framed accurately. Common local adverse effects include erythema, scaling, dryness, burning, pruritus, and transient hyper- or hypopigmentation; these are usually mild and modifiable by frequency adjustment, vehicle selection, and concomitant moisturizers; predictors of irritation include concomitant topical medications and lack of prior retinoid exposure, whereas prior acne or photodamage may correlate with better tolerability, and systemic absorption is low with typical topical use, though it can be higher with inflamed or damaged skin [^115bdPqf] [^1169iKYe] [^116pTxH9].

> But wait, what if the user is pregnant or planning pregnancy. I should double-check the teratogenic risk. Topical tretinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential fetal harm; although systemic absorption is low, the risk is not zero, so pregnancy testing and reliable contraception are advised in women of reproductive potential, and tretinoin should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding when possible; this is consistent with FDA labeling and dermatology guidelines [^113gfpW5] [^115qGETQ].

> Let me consider special populations and formulations. Altreno 0.05% lotion is approved down to age 9 and has supportive pediatric data, while traditional creams and gels are generally labeled for age 12 and older; geriatric use is acceptable with attention to tolerability, and newer vehicles such as microsphere gels and lotion can improve adherence via reduced irritation, which is clinically meaningful given adherence challenges with retinoids [^116Z6v9v] [^112kNCQV] [^116xBjLQ] [^117JshKL].

> I should confirm drug interactions and practical pearls. Tretinoin is inactivated by benzoyl peroxide, so if combined, they should be applied at different times; keratolytics and harsh cleansers can exacerbate irritation, so gentle skincare and sunscreen are essential; patients should be counseled on expected irritation, titration, and sun protection to optimize outcomes and minimize discontinuation [^115qGETQ] [^113853j8].

> Hold on, I should verify where guidelines land relative to adapalene. Contemporary guidelines often prefer adapalene over tretinoin for topical retinoid monotherapy due to better tolerability and photostability, yet tretinoin remains a core option and is frequently paired with antimicrobials in fixed combinations; shared decision-making should incorporate patient preference, access, cost, and prior retinoid experience [^114txgPM] [^115qGETQ] [^113Dgat7].

> In summary, tretinoin remains a cornerstone topical retinoid with robust evidence for acne and photoaging, supported by decades of clinical experience and evolving formulations that enhance tolerability; careful patient selection, counseling, and formulation choice can mitigate irritation and maximize benefit, while pregnancy avoidance and interaction management are non-negotiables in safe prescribing [^111fPge2] [^115bdPqf] [^11654V4T].

Tretinoin is a **topical retinoid** for acne vulgaris and photoaging, with **comedolytic and anti-inflammatory effects** [^115o4VZn] [^115qGETQ]. It is available as creams, gels, and lotions (0.01–0.1%) [^notfound] and should be applied once nightly to clean, dry skin [^115bdPqf]. Common adverse effects include irritation, dryness, peeling, and photosensitivity [^115bdPqf]; use sunscreen and start slowly to improve tolerability [^115qGETQ]. Tretinoin is **contraindicated in pregnancy** due to teratogenic risk [^113gfpW5]; use effective contraception in women of childbearing potential [^113gfpW5]. It is less irritating than older formulations but more irritating than adapalene; fixed-dose combinations with clindamycin or benzoyl peroxide enhance efficacy and reduce resistance [^115qGETQ] [^113Dgat7].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Tretinoin normalizes keratinization, reduces microcomedones, and has anti-inflammatory effects via retinoic acid receptors [^114CrcLM] [^112iLtB4].
- **Pharmacokinetics**: Low percutaneous absorption (~1–2%); systemic exposure is minimal with topical use [^116pTxH9] [^116iD5d8].

---

---

## Contraindications and precautions

Contraindications include **pregnancy** [^113gfpW5] and hypersensitivity to tretinoin or formulation components [^116MMgSU]. Precautions include use in **eczema**, **sunburn**, or with other irritating topicals; minimize sun exposure and use sunscreen [^113853j8].

---

## Special populations

In pediatrics, **Altreno is approved for patients ≥ 9 years** [^116Z6v9v]; other formulations are approved for patients ≥ 12 years [^112kNCQV]. In pregnancy, tretinoin is **contraindicated**; use effective contraception [^113gfpW5].

---

## Drug interactions

Avoid **benzoyl peroxide** at the same time due to inactivation; separate applications [^115qGETQ]. Also avoid **harsh cleansers**, alcohol, astringents, and other irritants [^113853j8].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend topical retinoids as **first-line therapy** for acne, with adapalene preferred for tolerability; consider fixed combinations for enhanced efficacy [^115qGETQ] [^113Dgat7]. For photoaging, tretinoin remains the **gold standard** [^11654V4T].

---

## Patient counseling and adherence

Counsel on expected irritation, sun protection, and gradual titration to improve adherence [^115qGETQ]. Emphasize **consistent nightly use** and moisturizer to reduce irritation [^notfound].

---

Tretinoin is effective for acne and photoaging, with manageable irritation; **pregnancy avoidance is essential**, and newer formulations improve tolerability.

### 40 years of topical tretinoin use in review [^111fPge2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Topical tretinoin has been approved for use in dermatology for 40 years and is currently approved for the treatment of acne vulgaris and photodamage. During this time, topical tretinoin has accumulated significant efficacy and safety data in the treatment of acne and photodamaged skin and demonstrated clinical potential for treating a range of other dermatologic conditions. The diverse effects may be due to complex underlying mechanisms of action associated with tretinoin, including keratolytic activity, collagenesis, and other mechanisms associated with the activation of nuclear retinoic acid receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ). In this article, we review the history of topical tretinoin use to date and outline emerging research suggesting that topical tretinoin may have potential clinical use for treating a multitude of other dermatological conditions when used either as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. We also describe newer formulations of topical tretinoin that have been designed to reduce irritation potential. In light of the substantial history of safety and efficacy of topical tretinoin in acne and photodamage, we speculate that it holds promise in treating many additional dermatological conditions, which may be explored in future research.

Read Directions Carefully Before Using

THIS LEAFLET TELLS YOU ABOUT TRETINOIN ACNE TREATMENT AS PRESCRIBED BY YOUR PHYSICIAN. THIS PRODUCT IS TO BE USED ONLY ACCORDING TO YOUR DOCTOR'S INSTRUCTIONS, AND IT SHOULD NOT BE APPLIED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE BODY OR TO OTHER GROWTHS OR LESIONS. THE LONG-TERM SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PRODUCT IN OTHER DISORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN EVALUATED. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, BE SURE TO ASK YOUR DOCTOR.

PRECAUTIONS

The effects of the sun on your skin. As you know, overexposure to natural sunlight or the artificial sunlight of a sunlamp can cause sunburn. Overexposure to the sun over many years may cause premature aging of the skin and even skin cancer. The chance of these effects occurring will vary depending on skin type, the climate and the care taken to avoid overexposure to the sun. Therapy with Tretinoin Cream may make your skin more susceptible to sunburn and other adverse effects of the sun, so unprotected exposure to natural or artificial sunlight should be minimized.

Laboratory findings. When laboratory mice are exposed to artificial sunlight, they often develop skin tumors. These sunlight-induced tumors may appear more quickly and in greater number if the mouse is also topically treated with the active ingredient in Tretinoin Cream, tretinoin. In some studies, under different conditions, however, when mice treated with tretinoin were exposed to artificial sunlight, the incidence and rate of development of skin tumors was reduced. There is no evidence to date that tretinoin alone will cause the development of skin tumors in either laboratory animals or humans. However, investigations in this area are continuing.

### Tretinoin [^112tqVVH]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of tretinoin PO (also known as Retin-A, Retin – A Micro, Altreno, Renova):
- **Increased WBC count**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tretinoin has been associated with an increased risk of rapidly evolving lekocytosis, especially in patients presenting with high WBC count at diagnosis. Consider initiating full-dose chemotherapy (including an anthracycline if not contraindicated) on day 1 or 2 in patients presenting with a WBC count of > 5×10⁹/L, or immediately, in patients presenting with a WBC count of < 5×10⁹/L, if the WBC count reaches ≥ 6×10⁹/L by day 5, or ≥ 10×10⁹/L by day 10, or ≥ 15×10⁹/L by day 28.
- **Retinoic acid syndrome**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as tretinoin can cause retinoic acid syndrome, characterized by fever, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, weight gain, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural and pericardial effusion, edema, and hepatic, renal, and multiorgan failure, occasional impaired myocardial contractility, and episodic hypotension, generally occurring during the first month of treatment. Administer high-dose cortcosteroids immediately after the first signs of the syndrome are observed, regardless of WBC count. Consider temporarily interrupting tretinoin in cases of moderate and severe retinoic acid syndrome.
- **Severe adverse reactions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia are at high risk in general and can have severe adverse reactions to oral tretinoin. Administer oral tretinoin under the strict supervision of a physician experienced in the management of acute leukemia and in a facility with laboratory and supportive services sufficient to monitor drug tolerance and manage drug toxicity, including respiratory compromise.
- **Teratogenesis**: do not use in pregnant patients. Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential 1 week before initiating treatment. Advise using two reliable forms of contraception during treatment and for 1 month after the last dose.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones.

### Use of topical tretinoin and the development of noncutaneous adverse events: evidence from a systematic review of the literature [^114cCnHD]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Topical retinoids have been in clinical use for the treatment of chronic skin conditions, including acne, photodamage, and psoriasis, for 30 years.

Objective

A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the incidence of noncutaneous adverse events (AE) among patients treated with topical retinoids with a focus on topical tretinoin studies reported before the Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention trial.

Methods

Electronic literature searches were conducted in Embase and MEDLINE for literature reporting development of nonteratogenic, noncutaneous AE among patients treated with topical retinoids published through September 2008.

Results

The search yielded 2778 citations, of which 20 studies met inclusion criteria. Tretinoin was used in 14 of the studies. Other retinoids assessed included isotretinoin, adapalene, alitretinoin, and tazarotene. Within patients receiving topical tretinoin, 27.9% reported the occurrence of at least one noncutaneous AE. The majority of noncutaneous AE were transient and judged not to be related to tretinoin treatment.

Limitations

The conclusions of this study apply largely to tretinoin compared with other topical retinoids. Many of the included trials were designed to evaluate the efficacy of topical treatment and reporting of safety events concentrated on incidence of localized AE, rather than systemic or noncutaneous events.

Conclusion

We found no clear evidence of a relationship between the use of topical tretinoin and the development of noncutaneous AE before a recent report of excess mortality in a clinical trial. The majority of noncutaneous AE reported by patients receiving topical retinoids consisted of nonsevere, nonspecific symptoms that were judged not to be related to treatment.

The intent‐to‐treat (ITT) population comprised all subjects randomized and provided with study drug and vehicle. The safety population comprised all randomized subjects who were presumed to have used the study medication or vehicle at least once and who provided at least one postbaseline evaluation. The primary method of handling missing efficacy data in the ITT analysis set was based on estimation using the Markov chain Monte Carlo multiple imputation methods. No imputations were made for missing safety data.

Treatment comparisons of percent reductions in lesions counts utilized a ranked analysis of covariance with factor of treatment and the respective baseline lesion count as covariate. Significance of EGSS reductions was obtained from logistic regression (using Firth's Penalized Likelihood) with factors of treatment group. There was no imputation of missing data for quality of life analyses. Mean Acne‐QoL scores at Week 12 were compared using an analysis of covariance with factors of treatment and the respective baseline lesion count as covariate. Shininess/oiliness and PSS scores were compared between treatment groups using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS ® version 9.3 or later. Statistical significance was based on 2‐tailed tests of the null hypothesis resulting in P values of 0.05 or less.

All AEs occurring during the studies were recorded and classified on the basis of medical dictionary for drug regulatory activities terminology (MedDRA) for the safety population. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as any AE with an onset on or after the date of first drug application, were summarized by treatment group and relationship with study drug. Each subject was counted only once within a system organ class or a preferred term using the event with the greatest severity or causality, respectively.

### Cost-effectiveness of a fixed combination of hydroquinone / tretinoin / fluocinolone cream compared with hydroquinone alone in the treatment of melasma [^1166Wgnw]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A once-daily fixed combination of hydroquinone, tretinoin, and fluocinolone acetonide (Tri-luma) is a newly available treatment for melasma.

Objective

To assess cost-effectiveness of triple combination therapy (TCT) applied once daily and hydroquinone alone applied twice daily in the U.S. Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia from a payer's perspective.

Methods

Clinical data and utilization of key health resources (medication only) were assessed within an 8-week clinical trial conducted in Brazil. Total cost per primary success (complete clearing) was used to compare each treatment with not treating and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were used to compare between treatments.

Results and Conclusion

TCT had a 30% better rate of complete clearing than hydroquinone with a lower cost in the U.S. and an incremental cost in other countries. In every country, cost per primary success was lower for TCT than for hydroquinone. Results were robust to varying assumptions of success rates and quantity used.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^112MY6x1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Supplemental Table VIII — prescribing information for combination clindamycin and tretinoin indicates topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients ≥ 12 years of age, with dosing to apply a pea-sized amount to the entire face once daily at bedtime. Contraindications include patients with regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, or history of antibiotic-associated colitis. In clinical trials, 21–41% of patients using combined clindamycin and tretinoin topically demonstrated successful treatment (using Evaluator's Global Severity score). Adverse effects/toxicities include erythema, scaling, itching, burning, stinging, nasopharyngitis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, dry skin, cough, and sinusitis. Interactions state that concomitant use of topical medications with a strong drying effect can increase skin irritation. Should not be used in combination with erythromycin-containing products. Should not be used in combination with neuromuscular blocking agents. Other issues advise to avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps, and that weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating. Pregnancy category is C; it is not known whether clindamycin or tretinoin is excreted in human milk; and safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients < 12 years of age.

### Tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate and severe acne vulgaris in females: effect of age on efficacy and tolerability [^112u2JKU]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: While it is generally considered to be a disease of adolescence, acne affects an increasing number of adults, especially women. Although data exist on the use of retinoids in adult females, there is no universal agreement as to the age of onset of adult female acne, or data on the efficacy and tolerability dependent on age. A novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion formulation has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in acne patients with moderate or severe disease.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily tretinoin 0.05% lotion in women with moderate or severe acne categorized into different age groups (13–19, 20–29, and 30+ years).

METHODS: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Women (aged 13–19 years, N = 357; 20–29 years, N = 352; 30+ years, N = 156) with moderate or severe acne were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory/noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and 'clear'/'almost clear') and Quality of Life (QoL) using the validated Acne-QoL questionnaire. Safety and adverse events (AEs) where evaluated throughout; cutaneous tolerability assessed at each study visit using a 4-point scale (where 0 = none and 3 = severe).

RESULTS: At baseline, 91.9% (N = 794) of women in the post hoc analysis had moderate (EGSS = 3) and 8.1% (N = 70) severe (EGSS = 4) acne, with the highest proportion of women (11.1%, N = 39) having severe acne being aged 20–29 years. Baseline inflammatory lesion counts were similar across the three age ranges, with more comedonal lesions (44.5) in adolescent females (aged 13–19 years). Quality of life at baseline was much better in adolescent females and may be age-related for some domains (self-perception and role-social). At week 12, there appeared to be an age-related improvement in both inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts, and treatment success although the differences between groups were not significant. Mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts for each age group (13–19, 20–29, and 30+ years old respectively) were 55.3% (P = 0.019 versus vehicle), 55.8% (P = 0.080) and 63.5%; and 47.1% (P < 0.001), 55.2% (P = 0.002) and 59.0% (P = 0.030). Treatment success for the 3 groups was achieved by 23.2% (P = 0.023), 21.3%, and 30.7% of patients, respectively, at week 12; differences between age groups were not significant. Quality of Life improved in all age groups, although changes with tretinoin 0.05% lotion were only significant compared with vehicle in adult females aged 20–29 years (self-perception, role-emotional and acne symptoms); improvements in each domain score by week 12 were also greatest in this age group. The majority of AEs were mild and transient; the most common treatment emergent AEs were application site pain and dryness especially in the older adult females (aged 30+ years). Local cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments were generally mild and improved by week 12. There were transient increases in scaling, burning and stinging in the adolescent females, peaking at week 4; all mean scores were ≤ 0.6 where 1 = mild.

CONCLUSIONS: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing inflammatory and comedonal lesions in adult and adolescent females with moderate or severe acne. There appear to be age-related efficacy and tolerability benefits favoring adult females.

### 50 years of topical retinoids for acne: evolution of treatment [^115tVsKg]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Since the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved tretinoin in 1971, retinoids alone or combined with other agents have become the mainstay of acne treatment. Retinoids act through binding to retinoic acid receptors, altering expression levels of hundreds of cellular proteins affecting multiple pathways involved in acne pathogenesis. Retinoids have evolved from first-generation agents, such as tretinoin, through chemical modifications resulting in a second generation (etretinate and acitretin for psoriasis), a third generation (adapalene and tazarotene) and, most recently, a fourth (trifarotene). For all topical retinoids, local irritation has been associated with poor tolerability and suboptimal adherence. Efforts to improve tolerability have utilized novel delivery systems and/or novel agents. This qualitative literature review summarizes the evolution of the four topical single-agent retinoids available for the treatment of acne in the US today and their various formulations, presenting the rationale behind their development and data from key studies.

### Retinoid therapy for acne. A comparative review [^116FqDfw]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Retinoids play a vital role in the treatment of acne because they act on the primary lesion, the microcomedo. They are synthetic derivatives of vitamin A (retinol), and are selected for their effectiveness. Several compounds are used for acne, either in topical or systemic form. We describe and compare the different topical retinoids, tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid), isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid), adapalene (derived from naphthoic acid), and tazarotene (acetylenic retinoid). They act mainly as comedolytics, but anti-inflammatory actions have also been discovered recently. The retinoids have great beneficial effects, but also some adverse effects, the main one being teratogenicity. It is preferable not to use them in topical form for pregnant women, although a pregnancy test is only compulsory for tazarotene. Only isotretinoin is used in systemic form. It acts on all the factors of acne and offers long remissions, and sometimes complete cures. Precautions must be taken for women of childbearing age due to its teratogenicity. It is also important to be aware of its other adverse effects, explain them to the patient and, if possible, deal with them in advance.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of Atralin Gel used once daily before bedtime for the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris were assessed in two 12-week prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. Subjects in these two trials ranged from 10 to 65 years of age, were approximately 52% female, 48% male, and were 74% Caucasian, 15% Black or African American, 3% Asian, and 8% Other.

Efficacy results at Week 12 are presented in Table 3. Success on the 6-point Global Severity Score is defined as a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (very mild). In Trial 2, subjects were also required to have at least two grades reduction from baseline for success. 'Very mild' acne is defined as: skin almost clear; rare non-inflammatory lesions present, with rare non-inflamed papules (papules may be hyperpigmented, though not pink-red, less than 4 lesions). The database was not large enough to assess whether there were differences in effects in age, gender, or race subgroups.

### Tretinoin (Retin-A) [^112shavX]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

General

If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation occurs, use of the medication should be discontinued. Exposure to sunlight, including sunlamps, should be minimized during the use of RETIN-A, and patients with sunburn should be advised not to use the product until fully recovered because of heightened susceptibility to sunlight as a result of the use of tretinoin. Patients who may be required to have considerable sun exposure due to occupation and those with inherent sensitivity to the sun should exercise particular caution. Use of sunscreen products and protective clothing over treated areas is recommended when exposure cannot be avoided. Weather extremes, such as wind or cold, also may be irritating to patients under treatment with tretinoin.

RETIN-A (tretinoin) acne treatment should be kept away from the eyes, the mouth, angles of the nose, and mucous membranes. Topical use may induce severe local erythema and peeling at the site of application. If the degree of local irritation warrants, patients should be directed to use the medication less frequently, discontinue use temporarily, or discontinue use altogether. Tretinoin has been reported to cause severe irritation on eczematous skin and should be used with utmost caution in patients with this condition.

Drug Interactions

Concomitant topical medication, medicated or abrasive soaps and cleansers, soaps and cosmetics that have a strong drying effect, and products with high concentrations of alcohol, astringents, spices or lime should be used with caution because of possible interaction with tretinoin. Particular caution should be exercised in using preparations containing sulfur, resorcinol, or salicylic acid with RETIN-A. It also is advisable to "rest" a patient's skin until the effects of such preparations subside before use of RETIN-A is begun.

### Tretinoin (Refissa) [^115o4VZn]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

(To understand fully the indication for this product, please read the entire INDICATIONS AND USAGE section of the labeling.)

Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%] is indicated as an adjunctive agent (see second bullet point below) for use in the mitigation (palliation) of fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin in patients who do not achieve such palliation using comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance programs (see bullet 3 for populations in which effectiveness has not been established). REFISSA DOES NOT ELIMINATE WRINKLES, REPAIR SUN-DAMAGED SKIN, REVERSE PHOTOAGING, or RESTORE A MORE YOUTHFUL or YOUNGER DERMAL HISTOLOGIC PATTERN. Many patients achieve desired palliative effects on fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin with the use of comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance programs including sunscreens, protective clothing, and emollient creams NOT containing tretinoin.

Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% has demonstrated NO MITIGATING EFFECT on significant signs of chronic sun exposure such as coarse or deep wrinkling, skin yellowing, lentigines, telangiectasia, skin laxity, keratinocytic atypia, melanocytic atypia, or dermal elastosis.
Refissa should be used under medical supervision as an adjunct to a comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance program that includes the use of effective sunscreens (minimum SPF of 15) and protective clothing when desired results on fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and roughness of facial skin have not been achieved with a comprehensive skin care and sun avoidance program alone.
The effectiveness of Refissa [Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%] in the mitigation of fine wrinkles, mottled hyperpigmentation, and tactile roughness of facial skin has not been established in people greater than 50 years of age OR in people with moderately to heavily pigmented skin. In addition, patients with visible actinic keratoses and patients with a history of skin cancer were excluded from clinical trials of Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05%. Thus the effectiveness and safety of Refissa in these populations are not known at this time.
Neither the safety nor the effectiveness of Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) for the prevention or treatment of actinic keratoses or skin neoplasms has been established.
Neither the safety nor the efficacy of using Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% daily for greater than 48 weeks has been established, and daily use beyond 48 weeks has not been systematically and histologically investigated in adequate and well-controlled trials. (See WARNINGS section.)

Given the high incidence of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), a preventative intervention would be desirable. Except for regular sunscreen use, the quest for chemoprevention of NMSC in the general population has been unsuccessful. Weinstock et al. assessed the effects of 0.1% topical tretinoin on NMSC. Like earlier efforts at chemoprevention, this study failed to show therapeutic benefit. Future successful preventative strategies will likely rely on short-term, intermittent therapy or treatments used for other common indications.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in an adult and adolescent female population [^113m3wck]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: Acne vulgaris (acne) is a common dermatological condition typically associated with adolescents, affecting about 85% of young people. However, it is also prevalent and persistent into adulthood, particularly in females. The efficacy of tretinoin in acne is well documented with large pivotal studies. The first lotion formulation of tretinoin was developed to provide an important alternative option to treat acne patients who may be sensitive to the irritant effects of other tretinoin formulations.

Objective: To determine whether efficacy and safety of tretinoin 0.05% lotion was similar in adolescent (< 18 years) and adult (≥ 18 years) women with moderate-to-severe acne.

Methods: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 studies in moderate or severe acne. Female subjects (aged 9 to 58 years, N = 909) randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions and treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear). Safety, adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous tolerability were evaluated throughout.

Results: At week 12, mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts in female subjects were 56.9% and 51.7%, respectively, compared with 47.1% and 34.9% with vehicle (P = < 0.001). Similar results were seen in adult and adolescent females in terms of reduction in inflammatory lesion counts with tretinoin 0.05% lotion; reduction in noninflammatory lesions was significantly greater in adult females (P = 0.002). Treatment success was achieved by 23.6% of female subjects by week 12, compared with 13.5% on vehicle (P < 0.001). Although treatment success was somewhat greater in adult females (24.6% versus 21.6%), the difference was not significant. The majority of AEs were mild and transient. There were five serious AEs (SAEs) reported (4/1, adult/adolescent, respectively). The most frequently reported treatment related AEs with tretinoin 0.05% lotion were application site pain (3.0%/5.7%), and application site dryness (4.9%/6.4%). Local cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments were generally mild-to-moderate and improved by week 12. Slight increases in mean scores were observed for scaling, burning and stinging within the first four weeks and appeared to be transient.

Conclusions: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than its vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions in female acne. Noninflammatory lesion count reduction was significantly greater in adult females compared with adolescent females. The new lotion formulation was well-tolerated.

### Tretinoin and the prevention of keratinocyte carcinoma (basal and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin): a veterans affairs randomized chemoprevention trial [^1178ZDnM]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Keratinocyte carcinoma (KC) is the most common cancer in the United States, with no proven means for prevention other than systemic retinoids, which have significant toxicity, and sunscreen. Topical tretinoin has been used for KC chemoprevention, although this use is unproven. Hence, we conducted the randomized Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention Trial of high-dose topical tretinoin for KC prevention. We randomized 1,131 patients to topical 0.1% tretinoin or a matching vehicle control for 1.5–5.5 years. The primary outcomes were time to development of new basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and new invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on the face or ears. The effects were not significant (P = 0.3 for BCC and P = 0.4 for SCC). The proportions of the tretinoin and control groups who developed a BCC at 5 years were 53 and 54% and an invasive SCC at 5 years were 28 and 31%. These differences (95% confidence intervals) were: for BCC, 1.0% (-6.5, 8.6%); for SCC, 3.6% (-3.1, 10.3%). No differences were observed in any cancer-related end points or in actinic keratosis counts. The only quality of life difference was worse symptoms in the tretinoin group at 12 months after randomization. This trial in high-risk patients demonstrates that high-dose topical tretinoin is ineffective at reducing risk of KCs.

### The use of retinoids in the treatment of photoaging [^1179KmL8]. Dermatologic Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Photoaging describes the clinical and histologic consequences of chronic sun exposure, the key features of which — wrinkles and mottled hyperpigmentation — are frequently and erroneously attributed to the aging process. Although a number of surgical procedures can improve the clinical appearance of photoaged skin, the only medical therapy with proved benefit derived from randomized clinical trial evidence is the use of topical retinoids, particularly tretinoin, isotretinoin, and tazarotene. Retinoids are capable not only of repairing photoaged skin at both the clinical and biochemical levels but their use may prevent photoaging. There is in addition emerging evidence that topical retinoids could be beneficial in the treatment of intrinsically aged skin.

### Tretinoin cream, USP Rx only for external use… [^112X9ALY]. FDA (DailyMed) (2013). Low credibility.

Chemically, tretinoin is all-trans-retinoic acid. It has a molecular weight of 300. 44 and has the following structural formula: Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones. There was no evidence of carcinogenic potential when 0. 025 mg/kg/day of tretinoin was administered topically to mice. For purposes of comparisons of the animal exposure to systemic human exposure, the maximum human systemic dose is defined as 1 gram of 0. 1% tretinoin applied daily to a 50 kg person. However, variations in teratogenic doses among various strains of rats have been reported.

In the cynomolgus monkey, which metabolically is closer to humans for tretinoin than the other species examined, fetal malformations were reported at doses of 10 mg/kg/day or greater, but none were observed at 5 mg/kg/day, although increased skeletal variations were observed at all doses. A dose-related increase in embryolethality and abortion was reported. Similar results have also been reported in pigtail macaques. Nonteratogenic effects: Topical tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic in rabbits when administered 0. 5 mg/kg/day. Oral tretinoin has been shown to be fetotoxic, resulting in skeletal variations and increased intrauterine death in rats when administered 2. 5 mg/kg/day.

If medication is applied excessively, no more rapid or better results will be obtained and marked redness, peeling, or discomfort may occur. Oral ingestion of the drug may lead to the same side effects as those associated with excessive oral intake of Vitamin A. Tretinoin gel or cream should be applied once a day, before retiring, to the skin where acne lesions appear, using enough to cover the entire affected area lightly. Gel: Excessive application results in "pilling" of the gel, which minimizes the likelihood of over application by the patient.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^115qGETQ]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Topical retinoids — retinoids are the core of topical therapy for acne because they are comedolytic, resolve the precursor microcomedone lesion, and are antiinflammatory, but use may be limited by dryness, peeling, erythema, and irritation, which can be mitigated by reduced frequency of application; some formulations of tretinoin are not photostable and should be applied in the evening, and tretinoin may be oxidized and inactivated by coadministration of BP, so it is recommended that the 2 agents be applied at different times. Tretinoin and adapalene are pregnancy category C, while tazarotene is category X; data suggest that adapalene is better tolerated than multiple concentrations of tretinoin (based on older formulations), and overall, the limitations of existing studies prohibit direct efficacy comparisons of topical retinoids; topical retinoids have been associated with increased photosensitivity, and concurrent daily sunscreen can be used to reduce the risk of sunburn.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Tretinoin is a metabolite of Vitamin A that binds with high affinity to specific retinoic acid receptors located in both the cytosol and nucleus, but cutaneous levels of tretinoin in excess of physiologic concentrations occur following application of a tretinoin-containing topical drug product.

Although tretinoin activates three members of the retinoid acid (RAR) nuclear receptors (RARα, RARβ, and RARγ) which act to modify gene expression, subsequent protein synthesis, and epithelial cell growth and differentiation, it has not been established whether the clinical effects of tretinoin are mediated through activation of retinoic acid receptors, other mechanisms, or both.

Although the exact mode of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that topical tretinoin decreases cohesiveness of follicular epithelial cells with decreased microcomedo formation. Additionally, tretinoin stimulates mitotic activity and increased turnover of follicular epithelial cells causing extrusion of the comedones.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

In two studies, the plasma levels of tretinoin and its major metabolites (13-cis-retinoic acid and 4-oxo-13-cis-retinoic acid) were investigated in a total of 14 patients (age: 13–25 years) with severe acne, who applied 4 g ± 0.5 g (range 3.5 g – 4.5 g) of Atralin Gel once daily to face, back and chest, as compared to a mean of 0.71 g (range of 0.07–3.71 g) applied in the controlled clinical trials. Blood samples were taken at baseline and immediately prior to treatment on Days 1, 5, 10 and 14. On Day 14, the final study day, samples also were taken 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours post-treatment.

The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites could be measured (LOQ = 0.5 ng/mL for all three analytes) in all patients at all time points. The range of plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13-cis-retinoic acid and all-trans-4-oxo-retinoic acid at baseline and after multiple once-daily applications of Atralin Gel, 0.05% for 14 days are given in Table 2 (below). Although some patients had increased concentrations of tretinoin or its metabolites over baseline values, no consistent increase in these concentrations were observed across patients.

### Comparing tretinoin to other topical therapies in the treatment of skin photoaging: a systematic review [^11654V4T]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Many morphological and histological changes take place in aging skin. Topical tretinoin is the gold standard anti-aging agent used to reduce signs of aging through stimulation of epidermal growth and differentiation and inhibition of collagenase.

Objective

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize studies evaluating the efficacy of tretinoin compared with other topical medications and cosmeceuticals in reducing the appearance of skin aging.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The literature search was conducted using the PubMed and Embase databases from conception to December 2023. Studies were included if they compared anti-aging outcomes of topical medications with those of topical tretinoin (also called all-trans retinoic acid and retinoic acid). Studies were excluded if they compared non-topical anti-aging treatments with tretinoin or were conducted on animal models.

Results

The literature search resulted in 25 studies that met all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most common study comparators to tretinoin included other forms of vitamin A. Outcomes were reported on the basis of visual reduction of aging signs, histological assessment of the epidermis and dermis, and protein expression. Although comparators to tretinoin had variable efficacy (greater in 7 studies, equivalent in 13 studies, and less in 3 studies), most studies found the comparator to be less irritating and better tolerated by patients than tretinoin.

Discussion

Tretinoin is currently the gold standard therapy for the treatment of photoaging, but its poor tolerability often limits its use. Unfortunately, given that most studies comparing topical therapies with tretinoin are of poor quality and/or demonstrate bias, there is a lack of substantial evidence to support an alternative first-line therapy. However, given there are some data to support the efficacy of retinoid precursors, namely retinaldehyde, pro-retinal nanoparticles, and conjugated alpha-hydroxy acid and retinoid (AHA-ret), these agents can be considered a second-line option for anti-aging treatment in patients who cannot tolerate tretinoin.

### Efficacy and tolerability of a novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate or severe acne vulgaris in adult females [^117NYT5i]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background: A novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion formulation has been shown to be efficacious and well-tolerated, and especially effective in adult female acne patients. While it is perhaps counter-intuitive that patients with more severe disease would show clinically significant improvement with topical monotherapy, topical retinoids have been shown to offer realistic treatment options in these patients.

Objective: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of once-daily tretinoin 0.05% lotion in adult females with moderate or severe acne.

Methods: Post hoc analysis of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies. Adult females (≥ 18 years of age) with moderate (N = 551) and severe (N = 55) acne were randomized (1:1) to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle, once-daily for 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments included changes in baseline inflammatory/noninflammatory lesions, treatment success (at least 2-grade reduction in Evaluator's Global Severity Score [EGSS] and clear/almost clear) and quality of life (QoL) using the validated Acne-QoL questionnaire. Safety, adverse events (AEs), and cutaneous tolerability were evaluated throughout.

Results: At week 12, efficacy in adult females with moderate acne (EGSS = 3) treated with tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly greater than that reported with vehicle. Mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts was 58.5% and 55.5% respectively compared with 50.3% and 39.8% with vehicle (P = 0.039 and P < 0.001). Treatment success was achieved by 25.4% of subjects by week 12, compared with 15.4% with vehicle (P = 0.006). Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was numerically more effective in adult females with severe acne (EGSS = 4). Mean percent reduction in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts was 59.0% and 58.8% respectively (compared with 53.5% and 45.5% with vehicle), and treatment success was achieved by 17.9% of subjects (compared with 4.5% with vehicle), with 46.6% of subjects achieving at least a 2-grade improvement in EGSS by week 12. Quality of life improvements with tretinoin 0.05% lotion were significant compared with vehicle in adult females with moderate acne (except role-social), but not in severe acne (probably due to the group size). The majority of AEs were mild and transient; more frequently reported in the moderate acne population where application site pain (2.9%), and application site dryness (5.0%) were the most common, compared with one report (4.5%) of application site pain and dryness in the severe acne population. Local cutaneous safety and tolerability assessments were generally mild-to-moderate and improved by week 12.

Limitations: The number of severe subjects enrolled in the studies was considerably less than the number of subjects with moderate acne, and the studies were not powered to demonstrate a difference in efficacy based on acne severity.

Conclusions: Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was significantly more effective than vehicle in achieving treatment success and reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions in adult females with moderate acne, with notable improvements in treating adult females with severe acne. It was well-tolerated, and all treatment-related AEs were mild or moderate.

### Efficacy of topical dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 50% solution vs tretinoin 0.5% cream in treatment of patients with primary macular amyloidosis: a split-side single-blinded randomized clinical trial [^112uKHAc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Primary localized cutaneous amyloidosis (PLCA) is a recalcitrant sporadic dermatological condition and most treatments have failed so far. We studied the efficacy of topical dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) 50% solution in comparison with tretinoin 0.5% cream in treatment of macular amyloidosis. In this split-side within-person single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 18 patients with bilateral macular amyloidosis received topical DMSO 50% solution and tretinoin 0.5% cream either on their right or the left side. The colorimetry, pruritus scoring, and photography were done. A significant pigmentation decline per each follow-up was observed in DMSO group compared to the tretinoin group (tretinoin: -1.31 vs DMSO: -7.34; difference in slopes: -6.03 [95% confidence interval: -12.06 to -0.01], P Interaction = .049). An insignificant diminution trend in pigmentation was observed for both treatments (P tretinoin = .672, P DMSO = .092). Also, both treatments relived itchiness, but DMSO completely dispatched itchiness from the first follow-up (P = 0.003 for tretinoin and < .0001 for DMSO). In conclusion, our results showed DMSO and tretinoin cream have the positive effect on the both pigmentation and itchiness in PLCA. DMSO may be more beneficial than tretinoin, since DMSO was significantly better in reducing itchiness. More investigations are warranted to provide sufficient evidence.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The pharmacodynamics of ALTRENO in the treatment of acne vulgaris are unknown.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its major metabolites (isotretinoin and 4-oxo-isotretinoin) were evaluated in 20 subjects in an open-label, randomized, pharmacokinetic study. Subjects aged 10 years to less than 17 years old with acne vulgaris applied approximately 3.5 g of ALTRENO to the skin of the entire face (excluding eyes and lips), neck, upper chest, upper back and shoulders once daily for 14 days. Single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics were determined from samples drawn on Days 1 and 2 of dosing and steady-state PK characteristics were determined from samples drawn on Days 14 and 15 under maximal use conditions. The mean baseline corrected Cmaxand AUC0-tof tretinoin and its metabolites after once daily application of ALTRENO for 14 days are shown below:

The mean concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites (isotretinoin and 4‑oxo‑isotretinoin) remain relatively stable and unchanged over the 24‑hour period after both the Day 1 dose and the Day 14 dose. Systemic concentrations of tretinoin appear to be at or near steady state by Day 14. Mean accumulation ratios of the baseline corrected AUC between Day 14 and Day 1 were 1.5, 4.5 and 7.3 for tretinoin, isotretinoin, and 4-oxo-isotretinoin, respectively.

### Observational study of clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel for the treatment of acne [^111kzaeG]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION: Acne vulgaris can cause pain/discomfort and have a negative impact on quality of life (QOL). Clin-RA is an acne treatment consisting of clindamycin phosphate 1.2% and tretinoin 0.025%, which has been proven effective and well tolerated in clinical studies. This prospective, non-interventional study aimed to capture data on previous treatment, acne severity, and QOL in patients with acne treated with Clin-RA and assess the efficacy and tolerability of Clin-RA in routine clinical practice.

METHODS: The study was performed at 18 centers in Sweden and enrolled patients aged ≥ 15 years with acne, who were prescribed Clin-RA for the first time. The observation period was ~12 weeks. The primary objective was to assess the patient's perception of their facial acne severity before and during Clin-RA treatment using a visual analog scale (VAS; 100 mm scale). Secondary objectives included QOL evaluation before and after treatment, using the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire.

RESULTS: 84 patients were enrolled and eligible for analyses (79.8% female; mean age 22.6 years). Patient-assessed VAS scores for acne severity decreased continuously during the study, indicating improvement: the median percentage reduction from baseline for VAS score was 17.6% at week 4 and 63.8% at week 12, with changes from baseline being statistically significant (P = 0.0004 at week 4; P < 0.0001 at weeks 8 and 12). Overall, QOL improved after Clin-RA treatment, reflected by a decrease in the mean (standard deviation) DLQI sum score from 8.8 (5.8) on day 0 to 4.9 (4.2) at week 12. Seventy percent of patients were satisfied/very satisfied with treatment. Clin-RA was well tolerated, with no serious adverse drug reactions reported.

CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with Clin-RA resulted in continuous improvement of facial acne over the course of 12 weeks, along with improved QOL and a tolerable safety profile, supporting the use of Clin-RA in clinical practice.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The safety and efficacy of Clindamycin Phosphate and Tretinoin Gel, applied once daily for the
treatment of acne vulgaris, was evaluated in 12-week multi-center,
randomized, blinded trials in subjects 12 years and older.

Treatment response was defined as the percent of subjects who had
a 2-grade improvement from baseline to Week 12 based on the
Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) and a mean absolute change from
baseline to Week 12 in 2 out of 3 (total, inflammatory and
non-inflammatory) lesion counts. The IGA scoring scale used in all the
clinical trials for Clindamycin Phosphate and Tretinoin Gel is as follows:

In Trial 1, 1,649 subjects were randomized to Clindamycin Phosphate and Tretinoin Gel,
clindamycin gel, tretinoin gel, and vehicle gel. The median age of
subjects was 17 years and 58% were females. At baseline, subjects had an
average of 71 total lesions of which the mean number of inflammatory
lesions was 25.5 lesions and the mean number of non-inflammatory lesions
was 45.1 lesions. The majority of subjects enrolled with a baseline IGA
score of 3. The efficacy results at Week 12 are presented in Table 3.

B. Hydrocortisone 2.5% cream
C. Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment
D. Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream
E. Minocycline 4% foam

Answers:
A. Tretinoin 0.025% cream – Correct. Although the only curative treatment for TAF is cessation of chronic friction to the affected area, the use of topical keratinolytics such as tretinoin may be used for symptomatic management.
B. Hydrocortisone 2.5% cream – Incorrect. TAF is not a primarily inflammatory process and typically lacks significant pruritis, therefore, anti-inflammatory and/or anti-pruritic therapies such as topical corticosteroids are not indicated.
C. Tacrolimus 0.1% ointment – Incorrect. Tacrolimus ointment is used as a second-line therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may also be considered for the treatment of lichen nitidus but are not indicated in the treatment of TAF.
D. Ruxolitinib 1.5% cream – Incorrect. Ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, may be used for short-term treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. It may also be used for the treatment of nonsegmental vitiligo.
E. Minocycline 4% foam – Incorrect. Topical minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, may be used for the treatment inflammatory acne vulgaris. There is no infectious component to TAF, therefore, topical antibiotics such as minocycline are not indicated.

### New developments in topical acne therapy [^117HQq3g]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Acne vulgaris is a common chronic inflammatory disease with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Although myriad acne treatments are available, current options may not be sufficient because of a lack of efficacy, limited tolerability, or burden of cost to patients. In this review, we highlight recently approved topical acne treatments, as well as those currently in clinical trials. Novel formulations of tretinoin, tazarotene, and minocycline provide modifications of and improvements to existing products. Trifarotene, a novel fourth-generation retinoid, has demonstrated improved tolerability compared with existing topical retinoids. Clascoterone is a novel first-in-class antiandrogen that topically addresses the hormonal etiology of acne. The late-phase clinical trials pipeline consists of agents with bactericidal and anti-sebum mechanisms. Although it is evident that acne treatments continue to evolve, it is important to recognize the need for further comparative studies among new and existing agents to define optimal treatment algorithms that address not only safety and efficacy but also cost-effective care.

Percutaneous absorption, as determined by the cumulative excretion of radiolabeled drug into urine and feces, was assessed in 44 healthy males and females after single and repeated daily tretinoin applications up to 28 days of 500 mg of a 0.1% tretinoin gel product. In this assessment, estimates of in vivo bioavailability, mean (SD) were 0.82 (0.11)% and 1.41 (0.54)%, for single and multiple daily topical applications, respectively. The plasma concentrations of tretinoin and its metabolites, 13- cis -retinoic acid, all- trans -4-oxo-retinoic acid, and 13- cis -4-oxo-retinoic acid, generally ranged from 1 to 3 ng/mL and were essentially unaltered after either single or multiple daily applications of RETIN-A MICRO, 0.1%, relative to baseline levels.

Clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not been performed with RETIN-A MICRO, 0.08%, 0.06% and 0.04%.

### Predictors of local adverse effects caused by topical tretinoin cream 0. 1% in the veterans affairs topical tretinoin chemoprevention trial [^1169iKYe]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Topical tretinoin is commonly prescribed, but its frequent adverse effects are barriers to use. Predictors of resistance or susceptibility to retinoid irritation are not known.

Objective

To identify baseline patient characteristics associated with adverse effects of topical tretinoin.

Methods

This cohort study used data collected from 324 participants in the Veterans Affairs Topical Tretinoin Chemoprevention trial who were randomized to apply tretinoin cream on the face and ears. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between baseline characteristics and local adverse effects.

Results

One hundred and ninety-seven patients (61% of those randomized to tretinoin) reported local adverse effects within 6 months. Clinical signs of severe photodamage at baseline [odds ratio (OR) 0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04–0.54] and history of acne (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.27–0.77) were associated with a decreased risk of adverse effects to tretinoin. The use of other topical medications at enrolment (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.15–3.08) predicted an increase in adverse effects.

Conclusions

In this study population, the common indications of topical tretinoin treatment were associated with lower risks of adverse effects. The concurrent use of other topical medications may worsen irritation caused by tretinoin.

### Tretinoin (Refissa) [^116pTxH9]. FDA (2014). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin is unknown although retinoids are believed to exert an effect on the growth and differentiation of various epithelial cells. When applied topically, however, there was no noted increase in desmosine, hydroxyproline, or elastin mRNA in human skin. In addition, the role of the irritative nature of this product in effecting the positive effects attributed to this product for its indication has not yet been fully determined.

The transdermal absorption of tretinoin from various topical formulations ranged from 1% to 31% of applied dose, depending on whether it was applied to healthy skin or dermatitic skin. When percutaneous absorption of Tretinoin Cream, USP (Emollient) 0.05% was assessed in healthy male subjects (n = 14) after a single application, as well as after repeated daily applications for 28 days, the absorption of tretinoin was less than 2% and endogenous concentrations of tretinoin and its major metabolites were unaltered.

### Systematic review on the rapidity of the onset of action of topical treatments in the therapy of mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris [^115PStoa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The time until a patient achieves a relevant improvement during the treatment of a skin disease is important for selecting a therapy, but has been largely neglected in reviews and guidelines. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the time until the onset of action (TOA) of topical acne treatments. The primary outcome was the TOA defined as the time until a 25% reduction in the mean number of inflammatory lesions had been achieved. A systematic literature search in Medline and Embase was carried out. Clinical trials that evaluated head-to-head comparisons of treatments in patients suffering from mild-to-moderate papulopustular acne were included. Abstract and full-text screening and data extraction were done independently by two investigators. With respect to inflammatory lesions, different concentrations of benzoyl peroxide (BPO) or adapalene did not seem to influence the TOA. BPO seemed to act more quickly than isotretinoin and tretinoin. Adapalene showed a shorter TOA than isotretinoin. Conflicting results were seen when comparing adapalene with tretinoin, with a tendency for adapalene to be faster. Clindamycin/BPO seemed to act more quickly than adapalene. Inconsistent results were seen for the comparison of clindamycin/BPO and BPO alone with a slight indication of a shorter TOA for clindamycin/BPO. Adapalene/BPO and clindamycin/BPO showed comparable TOA. When interpreting the data, the different study designs and the limited study quality need to be taken into account. Further research is needed to identify treatments that offer an early onset of action and possibly help to optimize patients' adherence. TOA should be considered as an additional outcome in acne trials.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris: assessment of efficacy and safety in patients aged 9 years and older [^116G1XC3]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Topical tretinoin has been extensively studied in clinical trials, and its essential role in the treatment of acne vulgaris (acne) established through evidence-based guidelines.

Objective

To evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion in moderate-to-severe acne in patients aged 9 years and older.

Methods

A total of 1640 patients, 9–58 years of age were randomized to receive tretinoin 0.05% lotion or vehicle in two double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week, 2-arm, parallel group studies evaluating safety and efficacy (inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts and acne severity using Evaluator Global Severity Scores [EGSS]). In addition, patients completed a patient satisfaction survey (PSS), Acne-specific quality of life (QoL) questionnaire and assessed their facial skin for shininess/oiliness improvement. The data from these two independent studies were pooled and analyzed.

Results

Tretinoin 0.05% lotion demonstrated statistically significant superiority to vehicle in reducing inflammatory and noninflammatory lesion counts (both P less than .001) at week 12 and improving acne severity (P less than .001). At week 12, mean percent change in inflammatory and noninflammatory lesions were 52% and 46%, respectively. Treatment success (a 2-grade improvement in EGSS and 'clear' or 'almost clear' was reported in 18% of patients. Tretinoin 0.05% lotion also showed significantly greater benefits relative to vehicle control in terms of patient satisfaction (P less than .001) and acne-specific QoL domains. Tretinoin 0.05% lotion was very well tolerated with no substantive differences in cutaneous tolerability among treatment groups. No patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events.

Limitations

Data from controlled studies may differ from clinical practice.

Conclusions

Tretinoin 0.05% lotion provides statistically significant greater efficacy than vehicle with a highly favorable safety and tolerability profile in moderate-to-severe acne patients. J Drugs Dermatol. 2018;17(10):1084–1091.

### Cosmeceuticals: focus on topical retinoids in photoaging [^112ra3ky]. Clinics in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Evidence from a randomized clinical trial showed that, in spite of the many surgical procedures effective in ameliorating the clinical appearance of photoaged skin, the only medical therapy with proven benefits in photoaged skin are topical retinoids, in particular tretinoin, isotretinoin, and tazarotene. The application of retinoids might not only clinically and biochemically repair photoaged skin, but their use might also prevent photoaging. Furthermore, new evidence suggests a beneficial role of topical retinoids in the treatment of intrinsically aged skin.

### Evaluating tretinoin formulations in the treatment of acne [^117JshKL]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

Topical tretinoin has been a standard treatment for acne vulgaris for more than 4 decades. While tretinoin has demonstrated proven efficacy in the treatment of acne lesions, it also is associated with the potential for skin irritation. Newer formulations have been designed to optimize both the drug concentration and the delivery vehicle with the aim to enable clinicians to provide increasingly effective acne treatment that minimizes irritation. These therapies include formulations with varying concentrations of tretinoin and vehicles that utilize a microsponge delivery system, hydrogels and micronized tretinoin, or propolymers. The purpose of this review is to evaluate different formulations and combinations of tretinoin in the treatment of acne vulgaris. While these advanced formulations were designed for controlled release of active ingredient, and have the potential to reduce cutaneous irritation relative to standard tretinoin cream and gel formulations, there is a need for comparative studies to evaluate the relative benefits of each of these advanced tretinoin formulations in optimizing acne treatment.

### Novel tretinoin 0.05% lotion for the once-daily treatment of moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in a preadolescent population [^115hMteu]. Pediatric Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Preadolescent acne (≤ 13 years) is common and may be one of the first signs of pubertal maturation. The trend to onset of adrenarche and menarche at an earlier age mirrors the increasingly younger age of acne onset. Comedones tend to predominate, but inflammatory lesions can also be present. Preadolescent acne severity may also be predictive of future disease severity, especially if it remains untreated until the patient is older. 1 Treatment of preadolescent acne is therefore important not only to ameliorate the development of more severe acne but also to reduce physical and emotional impact and perhaps improve adherence in later life.

Data related to treatment of preadolescent acne are limited, with most medications approved for age 12 and above; off‐label prescribing is common. Topical retinoids (eg, tretinoin, adapalene) have played an essential role in acne management because they inhibit the development of microcomedones and new acne papules. 2, 3 However, there is a common perception that they are primarily effective in comedonal acne, 4 and their use is associated with significant cutaneous irritation. 5, 6

A new lotion formulation of tretinoin 0.05% has recently been developed leveraging polymerized emulsion technology with the aim to improve both efficacy and tolerability of tretinoin. Here, a post hoc analysis of two large phase 3 clinical studies (N = 1640) evaluates its safety and efficacy in a preadolescent acne population with moderate‐to‐severe acne.

### Phase 4 study to assess tretinoin pump for the treatment of facial acne [^1168Vpt4]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

It is well known that the setting of clinical trials for registration studies do not necessarily represent efficacy seen in clinical practice, where physicians have the flexibility to select, combine, and change the acne treatment prescription. In this phase 4, open-label, multicenter, community-based study, 544 patients who were dissatisfied with their current acne treatment received tretinoin gel microsphere (TGM) 0.04% or 0.1% in a pump dispenser for 12 weeks. Patients were allowed the use of up to 2 other concurrent acne therapies, not including other retinoids. A total of 361 patients received TGM 0.04% and 183 received TGM 0.1%. Compliance was high (defined as 75% to 100% of prescribed doses taken) for approximately 95% of patients in both groups at every evaluation. At week 12, the mean modified Global Acne Grade score (mGAGs) and the investigator global evaluation (IGE) demonstrated significant (P < .0001) improvement from baseline for both concentrations, with 72% having at least moderate improvement. In approximately 25% of patients, acne was assessed as cleared or almost cleared. Most side effects were characteristic of topical retinoids. These results indicate TGM in a pump dispenser as an effective, well-tolerated acne treatment that is associated with a high rate of compliance.

### Evidence-based review: fixed-combination therapy and topical retinoids in the treatment of acne [^112kVXQf]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Topical fixed-combination products and topical retinoid monotherapy are established first-line treatments for mild-to-moderate acne vulgaris, yet adequate comparative data are lacking. The following evidence-based review addresses the question: "In patients with mild-to-moderate acne, are topical fixed-combination products or topical retinoids a more efficacious choice in reducing noninflammatory, inflammatory and total lesions after 12 weeks of treatment?" To identify relevant studies, a PubMed search was performed using "acne" and search terms for adapalene, tretinoin, tazarotene, benzoyl peroxide, clindamycin, or erythromycin. Forty-two studies from January 1991 to November 2009 were included. The studies were evaluated using the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy, and all but seven received the highest level of evidence grade. To evaluate efficacy, a side-by-side comparison was made using reduction in acne lesion counts at week 12 for study groups treated with fixed-combination therapy or retinoid monotherapy. Twenty-nine studies containing relevant efficacy data for fixed-combination therapy and retinoid monotherapy are summarized here. Nine studies compared fixed-combination therapy with retinoid monotherapy; in eight of these studies, fixed-combination therapy was significantly more efficacious in reducing acne lesion counts. This evidence-based review analyzes clinical evidence to date for these therapies to provide guidance in determining appropriate treatment for patients with mild-to-moderate acne.

### Comparison of clindamycin / benzoyl peroxide, tretinoin plus clindamycin, and the combination of clindamycin / benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin plus clindamycin in the treatment of acne vulgaris: a randomized, blinded study [^115qKzur]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

In the treatment of mild to moderate acne vulgaris, the combination of an antibiotic and benzoyl peroxide provides enhanced efficacy over the individual agents, with the potential to decrease the emergence of resistant strains of P. acnes. To evaluate treatment regimens combining the daily use of a clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel, a tretinoin gel, and a clindamycin gel, the current randomized, evaluator-blind study was conducted. Results demonstrate that once-daily administration of clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel (combination formulation) was as effective as clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide gel + tretinoin gel + clindamycin gel. Both of these regimens provided greater efficacy than tretinoin + clindamycin. Treatment with clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide demonstrated a significant benefit over other treatments at Week 2, highlighting its rapid onset of action. All regimens were safe and generally well tolerated, with less severe peeling seen in patients who received clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide. In conclusion, the regimens that included clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide were more effective than tretinoin + clindamycin in the treatment of acne vulgaris, with no clinical advantage of adding tretinoin + clindamycin to once-daily clindamycin/benzoyl peroxide treatment.

### A systematic review and network meta-analysis of topical pharmacological, oral pharmacological, physical and combined treatments for acne vulgaris [^113Dgat7]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Based on the NMA findings, the above considerations and cost‐effectiveness findings 36 the NICE guideline on acne vulgaris management recommends, as first‐line treatments, fixed topical treatment combinations (adapalene with BPO, clindamycin with BPO, or tretinoin with clindamycin) for mild‐to‐moderate acne, and fixed topical treatment combinations (adapalene with BPO, tretinoin with clindamycin) or oral tetracyclines (doxycycline or lymecycline) combined with topical treatments (fixed combination of adapalene with BPO; or azelaic acid) for moderate‐to‐severe acne. Where oral lymecycline or doxycycline are not tolerated or are contraindicated, alternative oral antibiotics such as trimethoprim or an oral macrolide (e.g. erythromycin) might be considered. Choice should be determined following shared decision making with the person with acne, taking into account their values and preferences on the benefits, risks and other characteristics of each treatment, their history of previous therapy and scarring, their risk of future scarring and the psychosocial burden imposed by acne. BPO alone may be considered as an option across all acne severity levels if other recommended first‐line treatments are contraindicated (e.g. during pregnancy) or there is a patient preference against their use. Topical retinoids and BPO should be initiated with alternate‐day or short‐contact application because of their increased risk of discontinuation owing to side‐effects. Photodynamic therapy may be considered as an option for adults with moderate‐to‐severe acne if other treatments are ineffective, not tolerated or contraindicated.
