## Question

What is the lipoprotein(a) test used to assess?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the Lipoprotein(a) test is used to assess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the fundamental purpose of Lp(a) testing in risk assessment. Then, I should review the biological basis of Lp(a) that explains its clinical implications. Next, I will examine the specific cardiovascular risks it predicts and the contexts in which testing is recommended. After that, I need to check thresholds for interpretation, analytic considerations, and disparities in use. Finally, I should consider how emerging therapies influence why we test and synthesize a clear clinical takeaway that ties these pieces together.

> Let me first confirm the overarching purpose of the Lp(a) test. The principal clinical role is to assess inherited, independent risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease that is not fully captured by standard lipid panels or risk estimators, with consistent evidence supporting a causal contribution to ASCVD across diverse populations and even when LDL-C is low or well controlled [^116FAxEM] [^117NuDdR] [^114tVCwL].

> I will now examine the biological basis to ensure the clinical logic holds. Lp(a) is an LDL-like apoB100-containing particle covalently linked to apolipoprotein(a), conferring pro-atherogenic, pro-inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic properties distinct from LDL; critically, 70% to over 90% of interindividual variability in Lp(a) levels is genetically determined, so the test primarily assesses inherited risk rather than lifestyle-related risk, and levels are relatively stable across the life course [^116FAxEM] [^11215S7e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about modifiability. At first glance one might assume lifestyle changes meaningfully lower Lp(a), but wait, I should verify that; the preponderance of evidence indicates Lp(a) is minimally affected by lifestyle, reinforcing its use as a marker of genetically determined, lifelong cardiovascular risk rather than a short-term modifiable factor [^116FAxEM] [^111Rref9].

> Next, I should review which outcomes Lp(a) testing helps predict. Elevated Lp(a) independently predicts incident ASCVD events such as myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease in primary and secondary prevention settings, with associations persisting after adjustment for traditional risk factors and appearing stronger when LDL-C is higher or in those with established CAD, though heterogeneity exists across studies [^116qfiTX] [^114tVCwL] [^111i6Uje].

> I need to ensure I consider valvular disease, not just vascular events. Elevated Lp(a) is also associated with the development and progression of calcific aortic valve stenosis independent of its ASCVD relationships, so the test additionally assesses risk for aortic valve disease over time [^111cXdW5].

> Let me think about when to order the test. Universal once-in-a-lifetime measurement in adults is recommended by European and Canadian societies to identify individuals with markedly elevated, inherited Lp(a), while targeted testing is prioritized in those with premature ASCVD, a family history of premature ASCVD or known high Lp(a), suspected or confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia, recurrent events or residual risk despite optimal LDL-C control, and in select youth with ischemic stroke or a high-risk family history to support cascade screening of relatives [^115Qq6KL] [^114WMZW8] [^117NuDdR] [^114ShmcG].

> Wait, I should verify how Lp(a) results actually shift clinical decisions. In borderline or intermediate risk adults, Lp(a) measurement can reclassify a substantial proportion upward, sharpening decisions on preventive therapy intensity; some consensus documents note reclassification rates exceeding 30% among those at very high Lp(a) levels, which can materially alter management plans [^117NuDdR].

> I should confirm interpretation thresholds and lifetime implications. A commonly used high-risk threshold is at or above 50 mg/dL, approximately 125 nmol/L, and very high concentrations above 180 mg/dL, about 430 nmol/L, confer lifetime ASCVD risk comparable to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, which signals the need for earlier and more aggressive cardiovascular risk factor modification across the lifespan [^115XUJDa] [^114ShmcG] [^115Qq6KL].

> Let me verify the practical testing considerations so I do not miss implementation barriers. Fasting is not required for Lp(a) measurement and results can be reported in mg/dL or nmol/L, but I should double-check assay characteristics, because isoform-independent methods improve accuracy and ongoing lack of assay harmonization has historically limited comparability across laboratories, which clinicians must consider when interpreting results [^113s2bMJ] [^114ShmcG] [^111cXdW5] [^116FAxEM].

> Next, I should review real-world patterns and equity concerns. Lp(a) testing remains underutilized in general and even among patients with CVD or a strong family history, with notable disparities by age, sex, and race and ethnicity, including lower testing among Black individuals despite generally higher Lp(a) levels and higher associated risk, highlighting a gap in comprehensive risk assessment that clinicians should proactively address [^111ot6Cr] [^114tVCwL] [^115VsCCH].

> Hold on, I should verify the concept of residual risk and therapeutic nuance. Lp(a) remains a risk factor even when LDL-C and apoB are well controlled, and although I almost said "statins lower Lp(a)", wait, that would be misleading because statins can modestly increase Lp(a), and elevated Lp(a) can inflate calculated LDL-C, which means clinicians should be cautious about intensifying LDL-C–lowering solely on the basis of an elevated "LDL-C" that partly reflects Lp(a) cholesterol content, with some proposing corrected LDL-C considerations in select scenarios [^116FAxEM] [^111BtH1R] [^112UxpX6] [^113A6taB].

> I should confirm how emerging therapies change the purpose of testing. With potent Lp(a)-targeting agents such as small interfering RNA olpasiran achieving 90% or greater mean reductions in phase 2 trials and multiple agents in cardiovascular outcome studies, Lp(a) testing increasingly serves to identify candidates for these therapies and to estimate potential absolute risk reduction based on baseline Lp(a) burden, though outcome data are pending [^1163pBUC] [^1167Genm] [^111Rref9].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize the clinical take-home to ensure nothing critical is missing. The Lp(a) test assesses genetically determined, independent cardiovascular and valvular risk, refines risk stratification beyond traditional factors, identifies residual risk despite optimal LDL-C lowering, guides intensity of preventive strategies, supports cascade screening of relatives, and is recommended at least once in adulthood with targeted indications for earlier testing in high-risk scenarios, especially as Lp(a)-lowering therapeutics advance toward clinical use [^116FAxEM] [^115Qq6KL] [^114WMZW8] [^117NuDdR].

Lipoprotein(a) testing checks for **genetically determined Lp(a) levels** [^116FAxEM] to identify individuals at increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) [^111Rref9]. Elevated Lp(a) is an **independent, causal risk factor** for ASCVD and CAVS [^111cXdW5], and is not captured by standard lipid panels [^115FfBLG]. Testing is **recommended at least once in adulthood** [^115Qq6KL], especially in those with premature ASCVD, family history, or familial hypercholesterolemia, to guide risk stratification and management [^114WMZW8] [^117NuDdR].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated lipoprotein(a)

Elevated Lp(a) is a **causal risk factor** for ASCVD and CAVS [^116FAxEM], driven by its LDL-like core and apo(a) moiety, which promote atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis [^111cXdW5]. High Lp(a) increases the risk of coronary artery disease [^116FAxEM], ischemic stroke [^116qfiTX], peripheral artery disease, and calcific aortic valve stenosis [^111Rref9].

---

## Populations recommended for lipoprotein(a) testing

Guidelines recommend testing in selected groups to **identify high-risk individuals** [^115Qq6KL]:

- **General adult population**: Measure once in adulthood to detect high inherited Lp(a) [^115Qq6KL] [^114WMZW8].
- **Premature ASCVD**: Personal or family history of early ASCVD [^117NuDdR] [^111ARvmU].
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia**: Suspected or confirmed FH [^114WMZW8] [^117NuDdR].
- **Recurrent ASCVD**: Events despite optimal LDL-C lowering.
- **Calcific aortic valve stenosis**: Suspected or confirmed CAVS [^117NuDdR] [^111Rref9].

---

## Interpretation of lipoprotein(a) test results

Lp(a) is reported in mg/dL or nmol/L, and **≥ 50 mg/dL (≥ 125 nmol/L)** is generally considered elevated and associated with higher ASCVD risk [^116FAxEM] [^111ARvmU]. Risk increases continuously with higher levels, though thresholds may vary by ancestry and clinical context [^111cXdW5].

---

## Clinical management of elevated lipoprotein(a)

Management centers on **aggressive risk reduction**, including [^117FuEpU] [^116FAxEM]:

- **Intensive LDL-C lowering**: High-intensity statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors [^117FuEpU] [^115GCFEZ].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Diet, exercise, and smoking cessation [^111cXdW5] [^117JUPp4].
- **Emerging therapies**: Antisense oligonucleotides and siRNA agents (e.g. olpasiran) are in trials and may substantially lower Lp(a) [^1163pBUC].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Genetic determination**: Levels are ~70–90% genetic and stable over life [^116FAxEM] [^111Rref9].
- **Assay variability**: Standardization is improving but remains a challenge [^116FAxEM] [^115FfBLG].
- **Limited therapies**: Few approved options specifically lower Lp(a) [^111Rref9] [^116FAxEM].

---

Lipoprotein(a) testing identifies individuals at increased risk of ASCVD and CAVS due to **genetically determined Lp(a)**, supporting targeted risk stratification and management [^114tVCwL].

### Lipoprotein(a): a genetically determined, causal, and prevalent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116FAxEM]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). High credibility.

High levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an apoB100-containing lipoprotein, are an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through mechanisms associated with increased atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Lp(a) is predominantly a monogenic cardiovascular risk determinant, with approximately 70% to over 90% of interindividual heterogeneity in levels being genetically determined. The two major protein components of Lp(a) particles are apoB100 and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease development even in the setting of effective reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB100.

Despite its demonstrated contribution to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden, there is a lack of standardization and harmonization of assays, universal guidelines for diagnosing and providing risk assessment, and targeted treatments to lower Lp(a). There is a clinical need to understand the genetic and biological basis for variation in Lp(a) levels and its relationship to disease in different ancestry groups. This scientific statement capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse basic science and clinical workgroup to highlight the history, biology, pathophysiology, and emerging clinical evidence in the Lp(a) field. Herein, we address key knowledge gaps and future directions required to mitigate the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk attributable to elevated Lp(a) levels.

### Lipoprotein(a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: A European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^117NuDdR]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) testing is essential for assessing cardiovascular risk. Consistent with epidemiological, genetic evidence, and recent European and Canadian guidelines, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) should be measured at least once in adults, preferably during the first lipid profile, to identify those with a high cardiovascular risk. Incorporating Lp(a) in global risk assessment may improve risk stratification, especially for individuals with very high Lp(a). In one study, 31%–63% of those with Lp(a) levels above the 99th percentile were reclassified from moderate to higher risk. Except for specific cases such as kidney or liver disease and acute infections, repeated measurement is generally not required as it does not enhance risk prediction.

In youth, Lp(a) measurement is recommended when there is a history of ischemic stroke or when a parent has premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with no other identifiable risk factors. Multiple testing may be necessary since Lp(a) levels can increase until adulthood.

The role of cascade testing for Lp(a) is justified by its risk enhancement potential. It is reasonable to measure Lp(a) if a parent or sibling has markedly elevated levels, using either systematic or opportunistic approaches. For instance, where services exist for cascade testing for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), these could extend to high Lp(a) testing. Cascade testing should also be considered in care models for diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and secondary prevention of ASCVD.

- **Consensus panel recommendations for Lp(a) testing**
- Lp(a) should be measured at least once in adults to identify individuals with high cardiovascular risk.
- Screening is also recommended in youth with a relevant family history.

Evidence that elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is substantial. Development of isoform-independent assays, in concert with genetic, epidemiological, translational, and pathophysiological insights, have established Lp(a) as an independent, genetic, and likely causal risk factor for CVD and CAVS. These observations are consistent across a broad spectrum of patients, risk factors, and concomitant therapies, including patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 80%. These approaches will allow testing of the "Lp(a) hypothesis" in clinical trials. This review summarizes the landscape of Lp(a), discusses controversies, and reviews emerging therapies to reduce plasma Lp(a) levels to decrease risk of CVD and CAVS.

### Lp(a) - an overlooked risk factor [^111cQiB3]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an increasingly discussed and studied risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis. Many genetic and epidemiological studies support the important causal role that Lp(a) plays in the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Although dependent upon the threshold and unit of measurement of Lp(a), most estimates suggest that between 20% and 30% of the world's population have elevated serum levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are predominantly mediated by genetics and are not significantly modified by lifestyle interventions.

Efforts are ongoing to develop effective pharmacotherapies to lower Lp(a) and to determine if lowering Lp(a) with these medications ultimately decreases the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. In this review, the genetics and pathophysiological properties of Lp(a) are discussed, as well as the epidemiological data demonstrating its impact on the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Recommendations for screening and how to currently approach patients with elevated Lp(a) are also noted. Finally, the spectrum of pharmacotherapies under development for Lp(a) lowering is detailed.

### Clinician's guide to the updated ABCs of cardiovascular disease prevention [^117JUPp4]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Cholesterol-containing lipoproteins are central to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL-C are associated with increased ASCVD risk, and lipid-lowering medications can reduce this risk. Intensive lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, should be recommended as first-line therapy for all patients.

The newest iteration of the guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults has significantly changed the approach to lipid management, identifying statins as the preferred drug class to lower LDL-C. Randomized controlled trial data support the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular risk in four groups:

1. Those with known ASCVD.
2. Those with an LDL-C level ≥ 190 mg/dL.
3. Individuals aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL.
4. Individuals aged 40 to 75 years with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated ASCVD 10-year risk of ≥ 7.5%.

The new pooled cohort risk estimator weighs age quite heavily; therefore, many more adults may be considered eligible for statin therapy despite having well-controlled risk factors. Consequently, a central component of the new guideline recommendations is to have an informed discussion with the patient about the relative benefits and risks of drug therapy before starting a statin.

- **Intensity of statin therapy**: Chosen to match the risk of those who are most likely to benefit. A high-intensity statin lowers LDL-C by ≥ 50%.

### High-density lipoprotein cholesterol and treatment guidelines [^111fbp94]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Setting consistent guidelines for the treatment of lipid abnormalities must consider several factors and balance the need for precision, favored by specialists, with practicality in the patient setting, favored by general medical practitioners. The appropriate populations for treatment should be clearly defined, and usual threshold levels, target levels, and treatment methodologies should be well established. Plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) has not been widely incorporated into guidelines as a significant abnormality predictive of cardiovascular risk and as a therapeutic target. However, this view is changing in light of the recent improved understanding of the importance of each lipid fraction abnormality, including HDL-C, in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic disease. Additionally, clinical trials have demonstrated the apparent benefit of increasing low levels of HDL-C in reducing cardiovascular events. The use of guidelines incorporating threshold and target levels for managing HDL-C in high-risk populations is increasingly seen as a practical means of improving patient outcomes, especially for special groups, such as the elderly and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^112MjMc4]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

The 2020 guidelines from the Endocrine Society recommend measuring coronary artery calcium (CAC) to inform shared decision-making in adult patients with endocrine disorders who are at borderline or intermediate risk (10-year ASCVD risk of 5–19.9%), particularly when additional risk-enhancing factors are present. This consideration is advised if the decision about statin treatment and/or other preventive interventions is uncertain.

### Lipoprotein (a) testing in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 5 large US health systems [^113KRxzj]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

The population with a lipoprotein (a) test was younger (median age, 61 versus 70 years), more frequently men (45.0% versus 41.1%), and less frequently Black individuals (11.6% versus 13.0%) compared with patients without a lipoprotein (a) test. In terms of medical comorbidities, patients with a lipoprotein (a) test had higher rates of ischemic stroke (25.2% versus 20.3%), hyperlipidemia (87.0% versus 78%), and familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) (7.7% versus 3.7%) compared with those without a lipoprotein (a) test.

In contrast, patients with a lipoprotein (a) test had lower rates of atrial fibrillation (17.7% versus 23.0%), hypertension (75.1% versus 84.1%), and diabetes (30.2% versus 35.9%) compared with those without a lipoprotein (a) test. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) was higher in those with lipoprotein (a) testing (87 versus 81 mg/dL), and a greater proportion were on statin therapy (70% versus 48.8%). Additionally, more patients with a lipoprotein (a) test were on ezetimibe (12.1% versus 2.9%) and PCSK9 inhibitors (6.9% versus 0.8%).

Multivariable analysis suggested that several factors were independently associated with the likelihood of lipoprotein (a) testing. This includes diagnoses of coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack, peripheral artery disease (PAD), or heart failure. A diagnosis of FH or hyperlipidemia, along with the use of any prior lipid-lowering therapy (LLT), was also positively associated with lipoprotein (a) testing. Of note, the level of LDL‐C appeared to be associated with lipoprotein (a) testing in a graded relationship.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for alcohol use disorder, and more specifically in the evaluation of liver disease, the ACG 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining noninvasive blood and/or imaging studies to assess the severity of fibrosis in patients with asymptomatic alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD).

Concerning diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, specifically regarding lipid profiles and fasting state, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend considering obtaining a repeat lipid profile in the fasting state for patients whose initial nonfasting lipid profile shows triglyceride levels ≥ 400 mg/dL (≥ 4.5 mmol/L).

### LDL-C: lower is better for longer-even at low risk [^1151byTA]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

However, 10-year predictions underestimate lifetime risk and are driven to a large extent by age. Clinical guidelines based on 10-year risk profiles are prone to ignore younger patients with a single risk factor, which is unlikely to result in deleterious outcomes in the forthcoming decade but is associated with an elevated incidence of disease later in life. This is perhaps justifiable for non-modifiable risk factors, but when multiple strategies exist to ameliorate the associated risk, as they do for LDL-C, there is a risk of missing opportunities to intervene now to improve health in later life.

There is considerable inconsistency in approaches used to manage patients at overall low risk of CVD (< 1%) who have persistently elevated levels of LDL-C (115 mg/dL [3 mmol/L]–190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L]). In the 2016 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidemias, no intervention was recommended until LDL-C reached 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L), which was a matter of considerable debate and presented problems in everyday clinical practice. In the 2019 recommendations, lifestyle modifications are suggested initially, and pharmacological interventions can now be considered for individuals with LDL-C above 115 mg/dL (3 mmol/L).

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^116GZwyF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The identification of individuals who would benefit most from Lp(a) testing is essential for optimizing cardiovascular risk assessment and implementing effective prevention strategies. While the evidence supporting Lp(a) as an independent risk factor for ASCVD and CAVD continues to grow, testing remains grossly underutilized. Determining appropriate testing strategies involves integrating guideline recommendations, identifying high-risk groups, addressing population-specific risks, and overcoming practical barriers to implementation.

- **Guidelines and recommendations**: Over the past decade, guidelines regarding Lp(a) measurement have evolved significantly, reflecting the growing recognition of its role in cardiovascular risk stratification. It is estimated that nearly 1 in 5 individuals worldwide have an elevated Lp(a) level (≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L). In 2018, the American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) included elevated Lp(a) (≥ 50 mg/dL or ≥ 125 nmol/L) as a "risk-enhancing factor" in the American cholesterol management guidelines.

	- The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines recommended a "once-in-a-lifetime" measurement of Lp(a) for all adults ≥ 18 years old, specifically to identify individuals with very high Lp(a) levels (> 180 mg/dL or > 430 nmol/L), which may confer a lifetime risk equivalent to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The rationale behind this universal testing approach is grounded in the genetic determination of Lp(a) levels, which remain relatively stable over a person's lifetime and are minimally affected by lifestyle or environmental factors.

### Practice bulletin no. 162: Prenatal diagnostic testing for genetic disorders [^112Yp6kD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Prenatal genetic diagnostic testing is intended to determine, with as much certainty as possible, whether a specific genetic disorder or condition is present in the fetus. In contrast, prenatal genetic screening is designed to assess whether a patient is at increased risk of having a fetus affected by a genetic disorder. Originally, prenatal genetic testing focused primarily on Down syndrome (trisomy 21), but now it can detect a broad range of genetic disorders.

Although it is necessary to perform amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) to definitively diagnose most genetic disorders, in some circumstances, fetal imaging with ultrasonography, echocardiography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be diagnostic of a particular structural fetal abnormality that is suggestive of an underlying genetic condition. The objective of prenatal genetic testing is to detect health problems that could affect the woman, fetus, or newborn and provide the patient and her obstetrician-gynecologist or other obstetric care provider with enough information to allow a fully informed decision about pregnancy management.

Prenatal genetic testing cannot identify all abnormalities or problems in a fetus, and any testing should be focused on the individual patient's risks, reproductive goals, and preferences. It is important that patients understand the benefits and limitations of all prenatal screening and diagnostic testing, including the conditions for which tests are available and the conditions that will not be detected by testing.

### Lescol [^112JBXmZ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

At the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary event, consideration can be given to initiating drug therapy at discharge if the LDL-C level is greater than 130 mg/dL (NCEP-ATP II).

Since the goal of treatment is to lower LDL-C, the NCEP recommends that LDL-C levels be used to initiate and assess treatment response. Only if LDL-C levels are not available, should the Total-C be used to monitor therapy.

C = cholesterol, TG = triglycerides, LDL = low density lipoprotein, VLDL = very low density lipoprotein, IDL = intermediate density lipoprotein.

Neither Lescol nor Lescol XL have been studied in conditions where the major abnormality is the elevation of chylomicrons, VLDL, or IDL (i.e. hyperlipoproteinemia Types I, III, IV, or V).

- **Cholesterol levels in pediatric patients**: The NCEP classification of cholesterol levels in pediatric patients with a familial history of hypercholesterolemia or premature cardiovascular disease is summarized below.

Children treated with fluvastatin in adolescence should be re-evaluated in adulthood and appropriate changes made to their cholesterol-lowering regimen to achieve adult treatment goals.

- **Coronary heart disease treatment**: In patients with coronary heart disease, Lescol and Lescol XL are indicated to reduce the risk of undergoing coronary revascularization procedures. Lescol and Lescol XL are also indicated to slow the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary heart disease as part of a treatment strategy to lower total and LDL cholesterol to target levels.

### Lipoprotein(a) for risk assessment in patients with established coronary artery disease [^111i6Uje]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to assess the prognostic utility of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in individuals with coronary artery disease (CAD). Data regarding an association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular (CV) risk in secondary prevention populations are sparse.

Plasma Lp(a) was measured in 6,708 subjects with CAD from 3 studies. This data was then combined with 8 previously published studies for a total of 18,978 subjects. Across the 3 studies, increasing levels of Lp(a) were not associated with the risk of CV events when modeled as a continuous variable (odds ratio [OR]: 1.03 per log-transformed SD, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96 to 1.11) or by quintile (Q5:Q1 OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.34). However, when data were combined with previously published studies of Lp(a) in secondary prevention, subjects with Lp(a) levels in the highest quantile were at increased risk of CV events (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.71), albeit with significant between-study heterogeneity (p = 0.001).

- **Low-density lipoprotein**: When stratified on the basis of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, the association between Lp(a) and CV events was significant in studies where average LDL cholesterol was ≥ 130 mg/dl (OR: 1.46, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.73, p < 0.001). This relationship did not achieve statistical significance in studies with an average LDL cholesterol < 130 mg/dl (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.60, p = 0.21).

Lp(a) is significantly associated with the risk of CV events in patients with established CAD; however, there exists marked heterogeneity across trials.

### Lipoprotein(a) testing trends in a large academic health system in the United States [^111ot6Cr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Low credibility.

In this large study of over 5.5 million adult patients seen across six academic health systems in California, lipoprotein(a) testing rates were low, with an overall prevalence of 0.3% and a prevalence of less than 4% among patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) (Figure 4). Rates of testing were low even among those with a family history of CVD, despite this being a population for whom there is guideline consensus for checking lipoprotein(a).

Lipoprotein(a) testing rates were higher among patients who also had more specialized tests, suggesting that lipoprotein(a) measurements are used more frequently in specialized versus general clinical practice. There were only modest and nonlinear increases in lipoprotein(a) testing over the study period. There were also notable disparities in lipoprotein(a) testing, which was performed less often in younger individuals, women, and racial and ethnic minorities.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^114ShmcG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

While universal testing may be ideal, targeted testing remains a pragmatic approach in most clinical settings. The following groups should be prioritized for Lp(a) measurement:

- **Individuals with premature ASCVD**: Premature ASCVD, defined as cardiovascular events occurring before age 55 in men and 65 in women, points to possible underlying genetic contributors, including elevated Lp(a). In these individuals, Lp(a) measurement may uncover a risk factor that may not be addressed by standard lipid-lowering therapies alone.

- **Family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a)**: Given the strong heritability of Lp(a) levels, first-degree relatives of individuals with premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a) should undergo testing. Cascade screening in such families can identify at-risk individuals before the onset of clinical disease, allowing for early intervention.

- **ReASCVD despite optimal LDL-lowering therapy**: Patients with less than expected response to statins or who continue to experience cardiovascular events despite achieving low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) targets may have residual risk driven by elevated Lp(a). In such cases, Lp(a) measurement can inform the need for more aggressive secondary preventive strategies.

- **Patients with suspected or confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: Lp(a) elevation is common among individuals with FH and may contribute to the observed variability in cardiovascular risk within this group. Identifying elevated Lp(a) in these patients can help stratify risk.

### Intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in cardiovascular disease prevention: Opportunities and challenges [^113A6taB]. Heart (2021). Low credibility.

In assessing progress towards goals, it should be noted that laboratory measurement of LDL-C at very low levels can present challenges, especially when lipoprotein (a) or plasma triglyceride levels are elevated. In this context, secondary goals relating to non-HDL-C or apolipoprotein B can be useful when judging whether to prescribe add-on therapy.

- **Opportunities and challenges**: Identification of an individual with elevated risk of ASCVD, based on risk factor screening and evaluation of their SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Estimation), or the presence of disorders that predispose to the development of ASCVD, such as type 2 diabetes or chronic kidney disease, would place them in the 'high risk' category. The goals include achieving LDL-C < 1.8 mmol/L and at least a 50% reduction from baseline. Among individuals with established ASCVD (on imaging or clinical presentation) and comorbidities (chronic kidney disease or history of diabetes with organ damage, proteinuria, hypertension), vascular imaging can aid in judging the most appropriate LDL-C goal. Where it is clear that a patient has atherosclerotic disease following an aggressive course, as indicated by serial events within 2 years, a goal of < 1.0 mmol/L is warranted.

Schematic representations like Figure 4, which show the rationale for intensive LDL-C lowering, highlight that the outer circle represents patients at 'high risk' with an LDL-C goal of below 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL).

### Physiological bases for the superiority of apolipoprotein B over low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a marker of cardiovascular risk [^115HNeMJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Pathophysiological Determinants of Plasma Particle Number

Plasma apoB is mainly determined by the total number of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, as apo B 48 contributes minimally to total apoB. The number of these particles can increase due to heightened production, reduced clearance, or a combination of both. A high number of VLDL particles may result from increased liver production, impaired clearance by the liver, impaired conversion to LDL particles, or any combination thereof. Similarly, an elevated number of LDL particles may occur due to impaired clearance by the LDL receptor pathway, increased production from VLDL particles, or a combination of both decreased clearance and increased production. Consequently, the pathophysiology of each apoB dyslipoproteinemia can be identified based on whether the primary defect lies in the clearance or production of apoB particles, or if significant defects occur in both areas.

- **VLDL-LDL particle metabolism**: This figure schematically depicts the regulation of VLDL and LDL particle numbers in plasma. VLDL particles are secreted by the liver into the plasma compartment, where they are either directly removed by the liver after much of their triglycerides (TG) have been metabolized or converted to LDL particles. At a steady state, the rate at which VLDL particles are secreted from the liver equals the rate at which they are either directly cleared or converted to LDL.

### Sex differences in the association between lipoprotein(a) and cardiovascular outcomes: The MGB Lp(a) registry [^115Tpx5E]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

Continuous variables are reported as mean ± SD or median (interquartile range) and compared by sex and lipoprotein(a) percentile groups using Student t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, as appropriate. Categorical data are reported as counts and percentages and compared across categories of lipoprotein(a) percentile groups using the χ² test of association or Fisher exact test. Incidence rates were calculated for the primary composite outcome of fatal or nonfatal MI and fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke, as well as for each of the secondary outcomes. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to assess the association of lipoprotein(a) percentile categories on primary and secondary outcomes and compared using log-rank tests. Schoenfeld residuals were used to check for proportional hazards assumptions.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was implemented to assess the association of the lipoprotein(a) percentile categories with the aforementioned cardiovascular outcomes, and these results were reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). This modeling was performed for each of the individual subpopulations defined by specific sex and age restrictions. In analyses involving individuals from both sexes, both lipoprotein(a) percentile category and biological sex were included as covariates. Spearman rank correlations were used to check for multicollinearity within the multivariable models, which were adjusted for age, race, hypertension, non-lipoprotein(a) hyperlipidemia, diabetes, CKD status, insulin use (in patients with diabetes), and other forms of previous medical conditions.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham Heart Study [^112s1Lqd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease but is not measured in routine clinical care. Screening for high lipoprotein(a) in individuals with moderate elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods and results**: We examined 2,606 Framingham Offspring participants (median age, 54 years; 45% men) prospectively, with a median follow-up of 15 years (n = 392 incident cardiovascular events). Individuals with higher (≥ 100 nmol/L) versus lower lipoprotein(a) were divided into groups based on LDL-C < 135 mg/dL versus ≥ 135 mg/dL. In Cox models, after adjustment for known risk factors, high lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL were each significant predictors of cardiovascular disease (LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL: hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006; high lipoprotein(a): HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026).

- **Risk assessment**: Across the groups of high/low lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL or < 135 mg/dL, the absolute cardiovascular disease risks at 15 years were 22.6% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 248), 17.3% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 758), 12.7% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 275) and 11.5% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 1328, reference group). Among individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, those with high lipoprotein(a) had a 43% higher risk (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.02). Presence of high lipoprotein(a) with moderate LDL-C levels (135–159 mg/dL) yielded absolute risks equivalent to those without elevated lipoprotein(a).

### Small interfering RNA to reduce lipoprotein(a) in cardiovascular disease [^1163pBUC]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The study OCEAN(a)-DOSE (olpasiran 225 mg every 12 weeks) was published in 2022 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: coronary artery disease, acute ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, dyslipidemia, and transient ischemic attack.

In the OCEAN(a)-DOSE (olpasiran 225 mg every 12 weeks) study, the trial question was: what is the role of olpasiran in patients with established ASCVD? The study design was a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). The population included 110 patients (33 female, 77 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with established ASCVD and a lipoprotein(a) concentration > 150 nmol/L. The key exclusion criteria were severe renal dysfunction or active liver disease.

The interventions consisted of 56 patients receiving olpasiran (at a dose of 225 mg every 12 weeks) and 54 patients receiving a matching placebo every 12 weeks. The primary outcome was a significant increase in the percent reduction in lipoprotein(a) concentration at week 36 (97.5% vs. -3.6%; AD 101.1%, 95% CI 96.5 to 105.8).

- **Secondary outcomes**: Significant increase in reduction in LDL-C concentration at week 36 (16.8% vs. -6.3%; AD 23.1%, 95% CI 11.4 to 34.8). Significant increase in reduction in ApoB concentration at week 36 (10.2% vs. -7.4%; AD).

### What are the priorities for managing cholesterol effectively [^111sySEP]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Many studies have confirmed the risk of coronary artery disease associated with elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The precise role of other lipids, however, is still under investigation. The relation between elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is complex, and the results of clinical trials evaluating interventions to lower triglycerides or increase levels of HDL-C have been equivocal.

Based on the data currently available, LDL-C remains the primary target for treatment. Ongoing clinical trials will help to answer the question of how low we should set our goals for lowering cholesterol in patients at risk.

### Lipoprotein(a), measured with an assay independent of apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, and risk of future cardiovascular events among initially healthy women [^116qfiTX]. JAMA (2006). Low credibility.

Controversy exists as to whether lipoprotein(a), a lipoprotein with homology to plasminogen, is a clinically meaningful cardiovascular risk marker in women. There is also poor agreement among lipoprotein(a) levels obtained by different assays.

- **Objective**: To determine the association of lipoprotein(a) levels, measured with an assay independent of apolipoprotein(a) isoform size, with the incidence of future cardiovascular events.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This was a prospective study of 27,791 initially healthy women in the Women's Health Study, enrolled between November 1992 and July 1995, and followed up for 10 years. Lipoprotein(a) levels were measured in blood samples obtained at baseline with an assay independent of apolipoprotein(a) isoform size.

- **Main outcome measure**: The main outcome measured was hazard ratios (HRs) for first-ever major cardiovascular events, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal cerebrovascular events, coronary revascularization, or cardiovascular deaths.

- **Results**: During the follow-up period, there were 899 incident cardiovascular events. After adjusting for factors such as age, smoking, blood pressure, body mass index, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, hormone use, C-reactive protein, and randomization treatment groups, women in the highest quintile of lipoprotein(a) (≥ 44.0 mg/dL) were 1.47 times more likely (95% CI, 1.21–1.79; P for trend < 0.001) to develop cardiovascular events than women in the lowest quintile (≤ 3.4 mg/dL). This association, however, was due almost entirely to a threshold effect among those with the highest lipoprotein(a) levels.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^115XUJDa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Testing for elevated lipoprotein(a) is not routinely performed in clinical practice despite recommendations from numerous medical societies for cascade screening in people with a family history of premature ASCVD and/or elevated lipoprotein(a). In a 2022 Scientific Statement, the American Heart Association recommended testing lipoprotein(a) in individuals with a family/personal history of ASCVD. It proposed that once standardization of lipoprotein(a) assays is achieved, a reassessment of broader population-based screening should be considered. Furthermore, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and the European Atherosclerosis Society advise lipoprotein(a) testing at least once in all adults, irrespective of family history. The success of cascade screening for identifying affected family members has already been demonstrated in familial hypercholesterolemia and has been shown to be cost-effective.

Recommendations for lipoprotein(a) testing:

Practically, lipoprotein(a) testing requires only routine, nonfasting blood draws, making it convenient for patients and health care professionals. While plasma lipoprotein(a) levels can be measured in nmol/L or mg/dL, intensive CVD risk factor management should be recommended for all individuals with elevated lipoprotein(a), where high risk is defined as ≥ 50 mg/dL (≥ 125 nmol/L). The benefits of lipoprotein(a) testing include improved CVD risk stratification by proactively identifying individuals at risk.

The study OCEAN(a)-DOSE (olpasiran 75 mg) was published in 2022 in the New England Journal of Medicine. This study is related to coronary artery disease, acute ischemic stroke, peripheral artery disease, dyslipidemia, and transient ischemic attack. The trial question was: what is the role of olpasiran in patients with established ASCVD?

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, RCT.

- **Population**: 112 patients (41 female, 71 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with established ASCVD and a lipoprotein(a) concentration > 150 nmol/L. The key exclusion criteria were severe renal dysfunction or active liver disease.

- **Interventions**:
	- n = 58 olpasiran (at a dose of 75 mg every 12 weeks)
	- n = 54 placebo (matching placebo every 12 weeks)

- **Primary outcome**: Significant increase in percent reduction in lipoprotein(a) concentration at week 36 (93.8% vs. -3.6%; AD 97.4%, 95% CI 92.8 to 102).

- **Secondary outcomes**:
	- Significant increase in reduction in LDL-C at week 36 (16.3% vs. -6.3%; AD 22.6%, 95% CI 11 to 34.1).
	- Significant increase in reduction in ApoB concentration at week 36 (9.3% vs. -7.4%; AD 16.7%, 95% CI 9.3 to 24.1).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant difference in adverse events was noted.

### How to appraise a diagnostic test [^113xHbGr]. World Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Clinicians frequently confront challenges when using diagnostic tests to decide whether the patient before them suffers from a particular target condition or diagnosis. The primary issues to consider when determining the validity of a diagnostic test study are how the authors assembled the patients and whether they used an appropriate reference standard in all patients to determine whether the patients did or did not have the target condition. Surgeons should be interested in the characteristics of the test that indicate the direction and magnitude of change in the probability of the target condition associated with a particular test result. The likelihood ratio best captures the link between the pretest probability of the target condition and the probability after the test results are obtained (also called the posttest probability). Many studies, however, present the properties of diagnostic tests in less clinically useful terms: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity denotes the proportion of people with the disorder in whom the test result is positive. Specificity denotes the proportion of people without the disorder in whom the test result is negative. Application of the guides presented in this article can allow surgeons to critically assess studies regarding a diagnostic test.

### Factors associated with lipoprotein(a) testing among multiethnic individuals [^117E7B3g]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and clinical guidelines recommend incorporating Lp(a) testing in routine care.

- **Objective**: Examine real-world, contemporary clinical testing patterns of Lp(a) among multiethnic populations.

- **Design**: In this nested case-control study, we assessed the prevalence and factors associated with Lp(a) testing within a large Northern Californian health system between 2010 and 2021. Incident density matching was used to select controls matched with a case for a case:control ratio of up to 1:5. Conditional logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between Lp(a) testing, sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics.

- **Participants**: We included individuals aged 18 years or older with ≥ 2 primary care visits during the study period.

- **Main measures**: Lp(a) testing rates over time and factors associated with testing based on demographic, medical, and healthcare utilization variables.

- **Key results**: Of the 1,484,410 individuals in the cohort, 14,818 (1.0%) underwent Lp(a) testing. The median Lp(a) level was 35 mg/dL and over a third of individuals had Lp(a) levels > 50 mg/dL. After adjustment, South Asian individuals were three times more likely to have undergone Lp(a) testing, as compared to non-Hispanic White individuals [OR = 3.19, (95% CI = 2.98, 3.41)], while those identified as non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic were significantly less likely to have undergone Lp(a) testing [OR = 0.70 (95% CI = 0.62, 0.80) and 0.64 (95% CI = 0.59, 0.69), respectively].

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^111BtH1R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020).

Third, many physicians aim to achieve an "LDL‐C" < 70 mg/dL for high‐risk patients, which is further supported by guidelines. Thus, many patients with "LDL‐C" ≥ 70 mg/dL and elevated lipoprotein(a) while on statin therapy, in fact, already have true LDL‐C significantly lower than 70 mg/dL. The recommendation to further increase LDL‐C–lowering therapy in such patients may not accurately reflect whether true LDL‐C versus lipoprotein(a) reflects additional residual risk. Because statins tend to increase lipoprotein(a), further increase in statin dosage in a patient with already true low LDL‐C may be counterproductive. Similarly, in patients being treated with PCSK9 inhibitors that achieve exceedingly low LDL‐C (i.e. < 20 mg/dL), true LDL‐C levels may be at or near zero if lipoprotein(a) is elevated, as we suggested recently.

Fourth, should lipoprotein(a) mass and/or cholesterol content be part of the FH diagnosis? Using a more accurate measurement of LDL‐C would result in many subjects not meeting the criterion of "LDL‐C" ≥ 190 mg/dL used in many scores unless the Lp(a)‐C was included in the measurement. The concept to formally include lipoprotein(a) in the diagnosis of FH is consistent with studies showing a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if patients with FH have concomitantly elevated lipoprotein(a) levels.

Fifth, the meta‐analysis included a wide range of patients receiving different statins and further reflected their use in a wide range of CVD prevention cohorts. Accurately quantitating true LDL‐C without its content of Lp(a)‐C will be important.

### Lipoprotein(a) testing patterns in a large health system [^1143uFab]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). As directed therapy for Lp(a) emerges, it is important to understand patterns of Lp(a) testing in routine clinical practice. We aimed to characterize Lp(a) testing across a large academic health system. Using electronic health record (EHR) data from 2014 to 2019, we compared patients who underwent Lp(a) testing with matched peers who had low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) assessment alone. We analyzed ordering provider characteristics and rates of initiation of new lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) within 12 months after testing.

Of 1,296 adults with Lp(a) test results, 629 (48.5%) had a prior history of ASCVD, and 667 (51.4%) did not. Compared with those with LDL-C testing alone, individuals who underwent Lp(a) testing were more likely to have experienced a myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke at a young age and had multiple prior cardiovascular events. While the majority of Lp(a) tests were ordered in outpatient encounters, a higher proportion of Lp(a) tests compared with LDL-C tests were performed in the inpatient setting. Neurology and psychiatry were the most common specialties to order Lp(a) tests in our cohort. There was a significantly increased initiation of LLT after Lp(a) testing compared with LDL-C testing across all medication types. Consistent with guidelines, Lp(a) testing is used in those with early-onset ASCVD and among those with multiple cardiovascular events. Lp(a) testing is associated with more aggressive LLT in the following year. Further research is needed to characterize these patterns more fully and explore the implications of Lp(a)-directed therapies.

### Fasting is not routinely required for determination of a lipid profile: Clinical and laboratory implications including flagging at desirable concentration cut-points — a joint consensus statement from the European Atherosclerosis Society and European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine [^113s2bMJ]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of this consensus statement is to critically evaluate the clinical implications of using non-fasting rather than fasting lipid profiles, and to provide guidance for laboratory reporting of abnormal non-fasting or fasting lipid profiles. Extensive observational data comparing random non-fasting lipid profiles with those determined under fasting conditions indicate that the maximal mean changes at 1–6 hours after habitual meals are not clinically significant. The observed changes are as follows: +0.3 mmol/L (26 mg/dL) for triglycerides; -0.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for total cholesterol; -0.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for LDL cholesterol; +0.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for calculated remnant cholesterol; -0.2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) for calculated non-HDL cholesterol. Concentrations of HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, and lipoprotein(a) are not affected by fasting or non-fasting status.

Furthermore, non-fasting and fasting concentrations vary similarly over time and are comparable in predicting cardiovascular disease. To improve patient compliance with lipid testing, it is recommended to routinely use non-fasting lipid profiles. However, fasting sampling may be considered when non-fasting triglycerides exceed 5 mmol/L (440 mg/dL). For non-fasting samples, laboratory reports should flag abnormal concentrations as follows: triglycerides ≥ 2 mmol/L (175 mg/dL), total cholesterol ≥ 5 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol ≥ 3 mmol/L (115 mg/dL), calculated remnant cholesterol ≥ 0.9 mmol/L (35 mg/dL), calculated non-HDL cholesterol ≥ 3.9 mmol/L (150 mg/dL), and HDL cholesterol ≤ 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL).

### Clinical genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia: JACC scientific expert panel [^114byJ2i]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Although awareness of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is increasing, this common, potentially fatal, yet treatable condition remains underdiagnosed. Despite FH being a genetic disorder, genetic testing is rarely used. The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation convened an international expert panel to assess the utility of FH genetic testing.

- **Rationale includes the following**: Facilitation of definitive diagnosis; pathogenic variants indicate higher cardiovascular risk, which indicates the potential need for more aggressive lipid lowering; increase in initiation of and adherence to therapy; and cascade testing of at-risk relatives.

The Expert Consensus Panel recommends that FH genetic testing become the standard of care for patients with definite or probable FH, as well as for their at-risk relatives. Testing should include the genes encoding the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B (APOB), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9). Other genes may also need to be considered for analysis based on patient phenotype. Expected outcomes include greater diagnoses, more effective cascade testing, initiation of therapies at earlier ages, and more accurate risk stratification.

### Lipoprotein(a) testing trends in a large academic health system in the United States [^114tVCwL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well-established risk factor for multiple cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), especially coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis (AS). Lipoprotein(a) is also associated with ischemic stroke, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), and heart failure (HF). The accumulation of epidemiologic and genetic studies strongly supports a causal role for lipoprotein(a) in CVD in diverse populations, even with low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. There is also growing evidence that lipoprotein(a) lowering translates to clinical benefit.

Lipoprotein(a) levels of > 30 and > 50 mg/dL are estimated to be present in 35% to 40% and 24% to 29% of the global population, respectively. There is consensus among the major international guidelines that lipoprotein(a) is an independent and genetically determined risk factor that enhances CVD risk, and all guidelines provide at least a relative indication for lipoprotein(a) testing in those with a family history of premature CVD. However, the guidelines differ in their recommendations for which other specific populations should be tested for lipoprotein(a). The European Society of Cardiology and Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommend screening all adults for elevated lipoprotein(a) at least once in their lifetime. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, National Lipid Association, and American Association of Clinical Endocrinology recommend lipoprotein(a) testing in patients with premature CVD, especially if not explained by other major risk factors.

### Ancestry, lipoprotein(a), and cardiovascular risk thresholds: JACC review topic of the week [^116gbJqC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

This study reviews ancestral differences in the genetics of the LPA gene, risk categories of elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as defined by guidelines, ancestry-specific Lp(a) risk, absolute and proportional risk, predictive value of risk thresholds among different ancestries, and differences between laboratory vs. clinical accuracy in Lp(a) assays. For clinical decision-making, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the predictive value of Lp(a) does not vary sufficiently to mandate the use of ancestry-specific risk thresholds.

This paper interprets the literature on Lp(a) and ancestral risk to support the following groups:

- **Clinicians**: Understanding cardiovascular disease risk in different ancestral groups.
- **Trialists**: Designing clinical trials to ensure adequate ancestral diversity for broad conclusions of drug effects.
- **Regulators**: Evaluating the design and interpretation of results of Lp(a)-lowering trials with different Lp(a) inclusion thresholds.
- **Clinical laboratories**: Measuring Lp(a) by assays that discriminate risk thresholds appropriately.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^11215S7e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

The objectives of this narrative review are threefold. First, we discuss underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that make Lp(a) a potent contributor to cardiovascular risk. Second, we discuss the landscape of Lp(a) measurement, including available assay techniques, standardization efforts, and interpretation of results, with a particular focus on addressing the ongoing challenges in clinical application. Third, we outline recommendations regarding who should undergo Lp(a) testing, incorporating insights from recent clinical practice guidelines. By synthesizing the latest data, this review seeks to inform clinicians and provide practical guidance on integrating Lp(a) measurement into routine cardiovascular risk assessment. Lastly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting Lp(a), underscoring their potential to reshape clinical practice in the future.

- **Pathophysiological role**: Lp(a) is a structurally unique lipoprotein particle consisting of an LDL-like core (apolipoprotein-B-100) that is attached to apo(a) via a disulfide bond. Though both LDL and Lp(a) contain one apolipoprotein-B (ApoB) molecule, Lp(a) does not bind to LDL receptors with the same affinity as LDL due to the steric interference of the apo(a) moiety on Lp(a). Additionally, apo(a) alters the shape of ApoB, which may in turn decrease binding to the LDL receptor. Decreased uptake by the LDL receptor and the presence of oxidized phospholipids on the apo(a) moiety contribute to an approximately six-fold higher atherogenicity for Lp(a) compared to LDL.

### High-density lipoprotein as a therapeutic target: A systematic review [^117XqcuD]. JAMA (2007). Low credibility.

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a cardiovascular risk factor that is gaining substantial interest as a therapeutic target.

- **Objectives**: To review the emerging strategies that modify high-density lipoproteins (HDLs).

- **Data sources**: Systematic search of English-language literature (1965-May 2007) in MEDLINE and the Cochrane database, using the key words HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-I along with the subheadings reverse cholesterol transport, CVD [cardiovascular disease] prevention and control, drug therapy, and therapy. Review of presentations made at major cardiovascular meetings from 2003–2007 and review of ongoing trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and guidelines from major cardiovascular societies were also included.

- **Study selection and data extraction**: Study selection prioritized randomized controlled trials over meta-analyses and mechanistic studies. Identified studies included proof-of-concept studies and key phase 1 through 3 trials of novel agents. Study eligibility was assessed by two authors, with disagreements resolved by consensus with a third.

- **Data synthesis**: Of 754 studies identified, 31 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Currently available therapeutic and lifestyle strategies, when optimized, increase HDL-C levels by 20% to 30%. While basic and small pilot studies have shown promise, proof that increasing HDL-C levels confers a reduction in major cardiovascular outcomes independent of changes in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides has been more elusive. Some novel therapeutic approaches continue to be explored.

### Hit or miss: The new cholesterol targets [^111HmLvz]. BMJ Evidence-based Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Drug treatment to reduce cholesterol to new target levels is now recommended in four moderate- to high-risk patient populations: patients who have already sustained a cardiovascular event; adult diabetic patients; individuals with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≥ 190 mg/dL; and individuals with an estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk ≥ 7.5%. Achieving these cholesterol target levels did not confer any additional benefit in a systematic review of 35 randomized controlled trials. Recommending cholesterol-lowering treatment based on estimated cardiovascular risk fails to identify many high-risk patients and may lead to unnecessary treatment of low-risk individuals. The negative results of numerous cholesterol-lowering randomized controlled trials call into question the validity of using low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as a surrogate target for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.

### Lipid re-screening: What is the best measure and interval [^114Y6Pym]. Heart (2010). Low credibility.

To estimate the long-term true change variation ('signal') and short-term within-person variation ('noise') of the different lipid measures and evaluate the best measure and the optimal interval for lipid re-screening, a retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2005 to 2008. The setting was a medical health check-up programme at a centre for preventive medicine in a teaching hospital in Tokyo, Japan.

Participants included 15,810 apparently healthy Japanese adults not taking cholesterol-lowering drugs at baseline. They had a mean body mass index of 22.5 kg/m² (SD 3.2). The main outcome measures involved annual measurement of the serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and calculation of the ratio of TC/HDL and LDL/HDL. Additionally, the ratio of long-term true change variation ('signal') to the short-term within-person variation ('noise') for each measure was assessed.

At baseline, participants (53% male) had a mean age of 49 years (range 21–92) and a mean TC level of 5.3 mmol/l (SD 0.9 mmol/l). They underwent annual check-ups over 4 years. The short-term within-person variations of TC, LDL, HDL, TC/HDL, and LDL/HDL were 0.12 (coefficient of variation (CV) 6.4%), 0.08 (CV 9.4%), 0.02 (CV 8.0%) mmol²/l², 0.08 (CV 7.9%) and 0.05 (CV 10.6%), respectively. The ratio of signal-to-noise at 3 years was largest for TC/HDL (1.6), followed by LDL/HDL (1.5), LDL (0.99), TC (0.8), and HDL (0.7), suggesting that cholesterol ratios are more sensitive re-screening measures.

### LDL cholesterol: How low to go [^116kRVgD]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Epidemiology and the results of large-scale outcome trials indicate that the association of LDL with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is causal and continuous, not only across levels seen in the general population but also down to sub-physiological values. There is no scientific basis to set a target or "floor" for LDL cholesterol lowering, which presents a clinical and conceptual dilemma for prescribers, patients, and payers. With the advent of powerful agents such as proprotein convertase/subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, LDL cholesterol can be lowered profoundly. However, health economic constraints mandate that this therapeutic approach needs to be selective. Based on the need to maximize the absolute risk reduction when prescribing combination lipid-lowering therapy, it is appropriate to prioritize patients with the highest risk, such as those with aggressive and established cardiovascular disease, who will obtain the highest benefit. This is particularly true for patients with elevated LDL cholesterol on optimized statin therapy.

### LDL-C: Lower is better for longer-even at low risk [^113Csehd]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

For individuals who manage good adherence to lifestyle interventions (LSI), indicated by a reduction of LDL-C by 20–25% or 28–35 mg/dL, an achieved LDL-C of ≤ 115 mg/dL (3 mmol/L), an annual check-up to monitor cardiovascular risk and reinforce messages about LSI is appropriate. For those with moderate success at reducing LDL-C using LSI, indicated by LDL-C > 115 mg/dL (3 mmol/L) but close to target and ≤ 140 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L), incorporating nutraceuticals/nutraceutical combinations and/or low-dose statin therapy and/or ezetimibe may be warranted, especially in those with statin-related muscle symptoms or those not willing to use statins. This strategy should be in combination with continued LSI to reach the recommended LDL-C goals.

- **Practical management notes**: This three-arm practical management is based on real-world adherence to lifestyle changes, which is usually only 25–30% and even worse in patients undergoing primary prevention. Real-world adherence to lipid-lowering therapy is also suboptimal, and poor adherence is associated with worse cardiovascular disease outcomes.

### Lipoprotein (a) testing in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 5 large US health systems [^115DMmhU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

We also found that lipoprotein (a) testing, regardless of lipoprotein (a) level, along with the level itself, are both associated with changes in LLT in the six months after testing. Lipoprotein (a) testing (compared with no testing) was associated with the initiation of both statin and nonstatin therapies. In contrast, an elevated lipoprotein (a) level (compared with a nonelevated level) was associated only with the initiation of PCSK9i and ezetimibe.

These results suggest that clinicians may be acting on lipoprotein (a) results with more aggressive therapies, indicating that testing may have an impact on clinical management, though causality cannot be established in this observational analysis. This is consistent with a prior study from Germany, which showed increased treatment intensity after lipoprotein (a) testing. Our study extends these results to the United States. Furthermore, our finding that statins were initiated regardless of lipoprotein (a) result may reflect overall clinician concern and/or better care in those with a lipoprotein (a) result, given that all of these individuals have a clear indication for statin therapy.

Notably, however, only 30% of individuals with a lipoprotein (a) test were initiated on a statin after testing, compared with 11% in those without testing, reflective of a continued gap in guideline‐based care. In contrast with statins, PCSK9i and ezetimibe were more likely to be initiated in those with lipoprotein (a) testing than in those without, but among those with testing, these drugs were only more likely to be initiated in individuals with an elevated lipoprotein (a) level.

### 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: Lipid modification to reduce cardiovascular risk [^115Qq6KL]. European Heart Journal (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to lipoprotein(a), EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering obtaining lipoprotein(a) at least once in each adult person's lifetime. This is to identify patients with very high inherited lipoprotein(a) levels, defined as greater than 180 mg/dL (> 430 mmol/L), as they have a lifetime risk of ASCVD equivalent to the risk associated with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, particularly concerning the lipid profile, the 2019 guidelines from AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA recommend measuring either a fasting or a nonfasting plasma lipid profile in patients aged 20 years or older who are not on lipid-lowering therapy. This measure is to estimate ASCVD risk and document baseline LDL-C.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^112UxpX6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

There is currently no gold standard method available to measure true LDL‐C or Lp(a)‐C. The main reason for this is that lipoprotein(a) is a low‐density lipoprotein (LDL)–containing particle, and thus its density overlaps with that of LDL, creating challenges in separating the respective particles without overlap for measuring their cholesterol content. In this study, we estimated corrected LDL‐C (LDL‐C corr) using parameters derived from prior biochemical studies. We hypothesized that the predictive value of LDL‐C corr would be diminished by removing the Lp(a)‐C content from LDL‐C. Furthermore, we quantified how patients might be reassigned into different LDL‐C categories if the Lp(a)‐C content was removed. We conducted the present analysis in a meta‐analysis from the Lipoprotein(a) Studies Collaboration of 18,043 patients with 5,390 CVD events derived from five landmark statin trials and in a US clinical laboratory database of 531,144 patients.

### Quantifying atherogenic lipoproteins for lipid-lowering strategies: Consensus-based recommendations from EAS and EFLM [^115FfBLG]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Low credibility.

The joint consensus panel of the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) and the European Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (EFLM) recently addressed present and future challenges in the laboratory diagnostics of atherogenic lipoproteins. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and calculated non-HDL cholesterol (= total - HDL cholesterol) constitute the primary lipid panel for estimating the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and can be measured in the nonfasting state. LDL cholesterol is the primary target of lipid-lowering therapies. For on-treatment follow-up, LDL cholesterol should be measured or calculated by the same method to reduce errors in treatment decisions due to marked between-method variations. Lipoprotein(a)-cholesterol is part of measured or calculated LDL cholesterol and should be estimated at least once in all patients at risk of ASCVD, especially in those whose LDL cholesterol decline poorly upon statin treatment.

- **Residual risk assessment**: The residual risk of ASCVD even under optimal LDL-lowering treatment should also be assessed by non-HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein B, especially in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertriglyceridemia (2–10 mmol/L). Non-HDL cholesterol includes the assessment of remnant lipoprotein cholesterol and should be reported in all standard lipid panels. Additional apolipoprotein B measurement can detect elevated LDL particle numbers often unidentified on the basis of LDL cholesterol alone.

- **Reference intervals**: Reference intervals of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins are reported for European men.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham Heart Study [^116khWRS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease, but it is not typically measured in routine clinical care. Screening for high lipoprotein(a) in individuals with moderate elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may identify those at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods and results**: We examined 2,606 Framingham Offspring participants (median age, 54 years; 45% men) prospectively with a median follow-up of 15 years, during which 392 incident cardiovascular events were recorded. Individuals with higher (≥ 100 nmol/L) versus lower lipoprotein(a) were divided into groups based on LDL-C levels: < 135 mg/dL versus ≥ 135 mg/dL. In Cox models, after adjustment for known risk factors, high lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL were each significant predictors of cardiovascular disease. The hazard ratio (HR) for LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL was 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006, and for high lipoprotein(a), HR was 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026. Across the groups of high/low lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL or < 135 mg/dL, the absolute cardiovascular disease risks at 15 years were 22.6% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 248), 17.3% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 758), 12.7% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 275), and 11.5% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 1,328, reference group). Among individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, those with high lipoprotein(a) had a 43% higher risk (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.02). The presence of high lipoprotein(a) with moderate LDL-C levels (135–159 mg/dL) yielded absolute risks equivalent to those with.

### Lipoprotein(a) testing trends in a large academic health system in the United States [^116EX3Pd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

- **Summary of key results**: Percentage of all adults, those with a family history of CVD, and those with a personal history of CVD who have undergone Lp(a) testing is highlighted. CVD indicates cardiovascular disease, and Lp(a) refers to lipoprotein(a).

This study highlights the underrecognition and underdiagnosis of elevated lipoprotein(a), despite its high prevalence. More than 20% of the general population, corresponding to an estimated 64 million individuals in the United States and 1.4 billion individuals worldwide, are affected. Various barriers hinder more widespread lipoprotein(a) testing, offering targets for improvement. These include the following: (1) lack of awareness of lipoprotein(a) as a CVD risk factor, (2) lack of awareness of guideline indications for lipoprotein(a) testing, (3) lack of awareness of methods to assess and manage risk in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a), (4) lack of implementation programs for lipoprotein(a) testing, (5) concerns about insurance coverage, and (6) uncertainty related to the variations in clinically available assays that report lipoprotein(a) levels.

Improved dissemination of the guidelines is necessary. There is also a need for more consistency across major societal guidelines to provide clinicians with greater certainty on when to use lipoprotein(a) testing. Numerous high‐quality review articles discuss the mechanistic, epidemiologic, and human population genetic studies linking lipoprotein(a) to CVD. This includes recent American Heart Association and European Atherosclerosis Society scientific statements on lipoprotein(a).

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, specifically related to the lipid profile tests, the AAPA/ABC/ACC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/AHA/APhA/ASPC/PCNA 2019 guidelines recommend considering measuring direct LDL-C or a modified LDL-C estimate to improve accuracy over the Friedewald formula in adult patients with an LDL-C level of less than 70 mg/dL (less than 1.8 mmol/L).

### Lipoprotein(a) and cardiovascular disease [^111Rref9]. Lancet (2024). Low credibility.

One in five people are at high risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis due to high lipoprotein(a). Lipoprotein(a) concentrations are lowest in people from East Asia, Europe, and Southeast Asia, intermediate in people from South Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, and highest in people from Africa. Concentrations are more than 90% genetically determined and 17% higher in post-menopausal women than in men.

Individuals at a higher cardiovascular risk should have lipoprotein(a) concentrations measured once in their lifetime to inform those with high concentrations to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and receive medication to lower other cardiovascular risk factors. With no approved drugs to lower lipoprotein(a) concentrations, it is promising that at least five drugs in development lower concentrations by 65–98%, with three currently being tested in large cardiovascular endpoint trials.

### Guidelines on the investigation and management of antiphospholipid syndrome [^114eNX6T]. British Journal of Haematology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for antiphospholipid syndrome, specifically with respect to initial laboratory testing, BSH 2012 guidelines recommend obtaining lupus anticoagulant testing and testing for IgG antibodies to β-2-glycoprotein I. This can be achieved using either an IgG anticardiolipin ELISA or an IgG anti-β-2-glycoprotein I ELISA. An anticardiolipin ELISA may detect antibodies to other phospholipid binding proteins as well as anti-β-2-glycoprotein I.

European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

- **Comparison of measured and calculated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol**: The study compared low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol calculated using the Friedewald equation with LDL cholesterol directly measured using both random non-fasting and fasting lipid profiles. Only lipid profiles with triglycerides < 4.5 mmol/L (400 mg/dL) were included, as LDL is typically measured using a direct LDL cholesterol assay when triglycerides are ≥ 4.5 mmol/L. "Mes" represents measured, and "Cal" represents calculated using the Friedewald equation (LDL cholesterol = total cholesterol − high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol − triglycerides/2.2; all values in mmol/L. For values in mg/dL, use triglycerides/5). The figure was designed by Prof. B.G. Nordestgaard and Dr. A. Langsted based on unpublished data from individuals participating in the Copenhagen City Heart Study 2001–2003 examination.

- **Remnant cholesterol calculation and significance**: Remnant cholesterol, equated with triglyceride-rich lipoprotein cholesterol, is calculated as total cholesterol minus LDL cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol, using non-fasting or fasting lipid profiles. If LDL cholesterol is also calculated, remnant cholesterol equals triglycerides/2.2 in mmol/L and triglycerides/5 in mg/dL. Calculated remnant cholesterol is identified as a strong causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease.

- **Non-HDL cholesterol calculation and use**: Non-HDL cholesterol is calculated as total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol and is equivalent to the combination of LDL cholesterol, remnant cholesterol, and lipoprotein(a) cholesterol (see Figure 1). The use of non-HDL cholesterol for cardiovascular disease risk prediction has been emphasized in several guidelines and consensus statements.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: An Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline [^111ARvmU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly in patients with endocrine disorders, the ES 2020 guidelines recommend measuring lipoprotein(a) to inform decision-making about short-term and lifetime ASCVD risk. This helps determine the need to intensify LDL-C-lowering therapy in adult patients who have a family history of premature ASCVD, a personal history of ASCVD, or a family history of high lipoprotein(a).

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham Heart Study [^114FT1XD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

- **High lipoprotein(a) in the presence of moderate LDL-C levels**: Guidelines consider plasma LDL-C levels ≥ 160 mg/dL as a risk enhancer and an optional indication for treatment. To better evaluate the clinical utility of screening for high lipoprotein(a), we calculated the observed cardiovascular risks for high LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL and for LDL-C 135 to < 160 mg/dL + lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L. The absolute risks at 15 years for those with LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL were 21.0%. Among participants who had LDL-C levels between 135 to < 160 mg/dL, risk was estimated at 23.5% when lipoprotein(a) ≥ 100 nmol/L and 17.3% when lipoprotein(a) < 100 nmol/L. Risk for individuals with LDL-C < 135 mg/dL was 13.7%.

In sensitivity analysis, we calculated the observed cardiovascular risk using different cutoff values for low, moderate, and high LDL-C (LDL < 130, LDL-C ≥ 130, and LDL-C ≥ 160) and moderate (70 nmol/L) and high lipoprotein(a) (100 nmol/L), and results were largely consistent with the main analysis.

### Lowering LDL cholesterol in adults: A prospective, community-based practice initiative [^113Sj2zd]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of our study was to determine if a clinic-wide initiative, employing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL)-lowering interventions, could serve as an effective health maintenance strategy to decrease LDL levels to 100 mg/dL. Patients whose initial LDL levels exceeded 100 mg/dL were placed on a lipid-lowering action plan and re-evaluated with a follow-up LDL (LDL(2)) measurement in 3–4 months. An additional action plan was administered to patients whose LDL(2) values remained elevated, with another retesting in 3–4 months to obtain a third LDL measurement (LDL(3)). The primary endpoints were the comparison of initial LDL(1) levels to post-intervention LDL measurements (LDL(2) or LDL(3)), while secondary endpoints included total cholesterol, total triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels across the three measurement periods.

Of the 514 patients who received action plans, 443 returned for follow-up lipid assessment. LDL levels in this group decreased from 140.7 ± 29.2 mg/dL (LDL(1)) to 110.9 ± 29.6 mg/dL (LDL(2)), with statistical significance (P < .05). Among these 443 patients, 167 individuals achieved LDL(2) levels that conformed to the National Cholesterol Education Program/Third Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (< 100 mg/dL), and 87 were deemed controlled by their primary care provider (LDL 100–130 mg/dL). However, 158 individuals had LDL(2) levels that remained either uncontrolled or did not meet the National Cholesterol Education Program/Third Adult Treatment Panel guidelines.

Regarding specific circumstances for dyslipidemia, particularly in pediatric patients, screening is crucial. The 2019 guidelines from AAPA, ABC, ACC, ACPM, ADA, AGS, AHA, APhA, ASPC, and PCNA recommend obtaining either a fasting or non-fasting lipoprotein profile as early as age 2 years. This early screening aims to detect familial hypercholesterolemia or rare forms of hypercholesterolemia in pediatric and adolescent patients who have a family history of either early cardiovascular disease (CVD) or significant hypercholesterolemia.

### Lipoprotein (a) testing in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in 5 large US health systems [^115VsCCH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Those who did undergo lipoprotein (a) testing in our study population were different in important ways from those who did not undergo testing, revealing potential disparities in testing patterns. Older age was associated with a lower likelihood of lipoprotein (a) testing; this may be related to the National Lipid Association guidelines, which specifically recommend lipoprotein (a) testing for individuals with premature ASCVD and who are therefore young by definition. Black race was also associated with a 24% lower likelihood of lipoprotein (a) testing; this likely represents a disparity in care, as Black individuals are known to have generally higher lipoprotein (a) levels than White individuals, with correspondingly higher lipoprotein (a)-related ASCVD risk. Access to health care, socioeconomic status, patient comfort, and lack of provider awareness of high-risk subgroups are possible explanations in general for lipid screening and management disparities in underrepresented minorities. As far as we are aware, this disparity in lipoprotein (a) testing across health systems has not been shown before and is important for addressing health equity in ASCVD prevention and management. Unsurprisingly, individuals with missing glycosylated hemoglobin and lipid levels were less likely to undergo lipoprotein (a) testing, potentially because they were not receiving routine preventive care.

In contrast, several factors were associated with a greater likelihood of lipoprotein (a) testing, including prior coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack, PAD, or heart failure.
