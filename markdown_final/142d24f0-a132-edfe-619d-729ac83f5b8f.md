## Question

Is carboplatin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether carboplatin is a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent, how it works, what it is used for, how it is dosed, what its toxicity profile is, and how it compares with cisplatin. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about its chemical identity and class. Then, I should verify the mechanism of action. Next, I will review labeled and guideline-supported indications. After that, I need to check dosing principles, especially renal function–based AUC dosing. Then, I will examine safety, monitoring, and special populations. Finally, I will compare carboplatin with cisplatin and synthesize practical clinical takeaways with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the identity and class. Carboplatin is a second-generation platinum coordination complex and a platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent, structurally related to cisplatin but with a dicarboxylato leaving group that alters its reactivity and toxicity profile, which is consistently described in FDA labeling and authoritative reviews [^83c0bffb] [^8355d329].

> I need to verify the mechanism of action. Carboplatin exerts cytotoxicity primarily by forming DNA adducts, predominantly interstrand cross-links, which disrupt DNA replication and transcription and trigger apoptosis; its aquation to the active species is slower than cisplatin, yet both agents produce comparable numbers of cross-links with similar biological effects, and this mechanism is cell-cycle nonspecific, which aligns with FDA pharmacology and mechanistic reviews [^83c0bffb] [^c31bd309] [^b5c795ac].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about clinical effects without anchoring indications. The FDA-labeled indications are for advanced ovarian cancer, both initial treatment and following prior chemotherapy, and carboplatin is also a standard backbone in combination regimens across multiple malignancies per NCCN and contemporary practice, including ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and urothelial carcinoma, with specific approvals such as atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in metastatic non-squamous NSCLC [^b5f38a08] [^c363d3d1] [^e678c41a] [^88004af6] [^44c24899] [^89575bcd].

> Next, I should review dosing principles. Carboplatin is dosed to a target AUC using the Calvert formula, which incorporates the desired AUC and the patient's glomerular filtration rate to predict exposure and mitigate hematologic toxicity; typical adult targets are AUC 5–6 mg/mL·min, and dose must be reduced in renal impairment because clearance is primarily renal, with about 65–71% of platinum excreted in urine within 12–24 hours in patients with normal renal function [^73eb3421] [^17cf1a64] [^c2c60889].

> Wait, let me verify pediatric and special-population nuances. In infants and young children, body weight–based dosing with therapeutic drug monitoring is used to target AUCs of roughly 5.2–7.8 mg/mL·min, and recent data suggest optimized weight-based doses of 6–9 mg/kg improve attainment of target exposures when TDM is not available, reflecting developmental pharmacokinetic differences [^309b53f2] [^32d48d0a].

> I will now examine the toxicity profile and monitoring. Myelosuppression is dose-limiting, particularly thrombocytopenia, with nadirs around day 21; anemia is cumulative and may require transfusion, and neutropenia can precipitate febrile events that drive dose delays or reductions, so CBCs should be checked frequently and cycles held until recovery of neutrophils to at least 2000/µL and platelets to at least 100,000/µL [^f93d7ff0] [^73eb3421]. Peripheral neuropathy occurs less often than with cisplatin but is not negligible, especially with cumulative exposure or in older adults, and hypersensitivity reactions increase with repeated exposures and can be managed with premedication and desensitization protocols when clinically indicated [^593d8bba] [^b1798d01] [^22a30388].

> But wait, what if renal function is compromised. Carboplatin is preferred over cisplatin in patients with moderate to severe CKD because it lacks direct nephrotoxicity, though its clearance is still renal and dose must be adjusted; conversely, cisplatin is renally cleared and nephrotoxic, so it is generally avoided in CKD stages G3–G5, reinforcing the need for GFR-based dosing and vigilance for hematologic toxicity in renally impaired patients [^2614597d] [^17cf1a64].

> Let me consider comparative effectiveness versus cisplatin. In advanced NSCLC, multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show carboplatin-based doublets yield similar overall survival to cisplatin-based regimens, with trade-offs in toxicity: carboplatin causes more thrombocytopenia, whereas cisplatin causes more nausea, vomiting, and nephrotoxicity; thus, agent selection should be individualized to comorbidities and patient preferences [^e75a5448] [^136a0416]. In ovarian cancer, carboplatin has largely supplanted cisplatin in first-line IV regimens due to comparable efficacy with better tolerability, and in SCLC, carboplatin and cisplatin appear similarly effective, with carboplatin favored when minimizing emesis or neuropathy is prioritized [^c363d3d1] [^e678c41a].

> Hold on, I should verify hypersensitivity risk and mitigation. Incidence of carboplatin hypersensitivity rises with cumulative exposure and after a carboplatin-free interval exceeding 12 months, and BRCA mutation carriers have higher risk; premedication and graded desensitization protocols enable safe rechallenge in many patients, preserving oncologic benefit when alternatives are limited [^b1798d01] [^151d795c] [^22a30388].

> I need to ensure supportive care is addressed. For emesis, carboplatin is moderate emetic risk when AUC is 4 or higher, and ASCO recommends a three-drug regimen including an NK1 antagonist, a 5-HT3 antagonist, and dexamethasone on day 1; for AUC less than 4, a two-drug antiemetic suffices, which helps balance efficacy and toxicity in practice [^2ead9644] [^7e36a06e].

> Let me reconsider any potential confusion about protein binding. Initially, I thought carboplatin might be protein-bound like cisplatin, but wait, I should double-check the label: carboplatin itself is not bound to plasma proteins, though platinum from carboplatin becomes irreversibly protein-bound and is slowly cleared, which explains prolonged terminal half-life of platinum species despite rapid renal elimination of intact drug [^83c0bffb] [^17cf1a64].

> In summary, carboplatin is a platinum-based DNA-damaging agent with broad oncologic utility, dosed to a target AUC using renal function, featuring myelosuppression as the principal toxicity and a favorable nephrotoxicity profile compared with cisplatin; careful hematologic monitoring, renal function–adjusted dosing, and hypersensitivity preparedness are essential to safe and effective use across diverse malignancies [^83c0bffb] [^73eb3421] [^c363d3d1].

Carboplatin is a **platinum-based chemotherapy** agent that forms DNA cross-links, disrupting replication and transcription and triggering apoptosis [^83c0bffb] [^b5c795ac]. It is **renally cleared** and dosed to a target AUC using the Calvert formula, with dose adjustments for renal impairment to limit myelosuppression [^c2c60889] [^17cf1a64]. Carboplatin is **standard in ovarian, lung, and bladder cancers** and is often used when cisplatin is unsuitable due to nephrotoxicity or neurotoxicity [^c363d3d1] [^e75a5448] [^44c24899]. Key toxicities are thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia; hypersensitivity reactions increase with repeated exposure and may require desensitization [^f93d7ff0] [^b1798d01] [^22a30388].

---

## Chemical structure and properties

Carboplatin is a **second-generation platinum analog** with a cyclobutanedicarboxylate leaving group, conferring greater stability and less reactivity than cisplatin [^c2c60889]. This reduces nephrotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity while maintaining antitumor activity [^c2c60889].

---

## Mechanism of action

Carboplatin exerts cytotoxicity primarily by forming **DNA adducts**, predominantly interstrand cross-links, which inhibit DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [^83c0bffb] [^b5c795ac]. Unlike cisplatin, carboplatin's slower aquation rate results in fewer non-specific protein interactions and less nephrotoxicity [^c2c60889].

---

## Pharmacokinetics

- **Absorption**: Administered intravenously; not orally bioavailable.
- **Distribution**: Volume of distribution ~16 L; not protein-bound, but platinum becomes irreversibly protein-bound and slowly cleared [^83c0bffb] [^17cf1a64].
- **Metabolism**: Minimal; aquation yields active species [^c31bd309].
- **Elimination**: Primarily renal; ~65% excreted within 12 hours and ~71% within 24 hours; elimination half-life ~2.6–5.9 hours [^83c0bffb] [^17cf1a64].

---

## Clinical indications

Carboplatin is indicated for multiple malignancies, including:

| **Cancer type** | **Indication** |
|-|-|
| Ovarian cancer | First-line and recurrent disease [^b5f38a08] [^c363d3d1] |
| Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) | First-line in combination regimens [^e75a5448] [^89575bcd] |
| Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) | First-line in combination regimens [^e678c41a] [^b07c4190] |
| Bladder cancer | Alternative to cisplatin in cisplatin-ineligible patients [^44c24899] |
| Triple-negative breast cancer | Neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings [^88004af6] [^23a8599c] |
| Head and neck cancers | Combination regimens [^c2c60889] |

---

## Dosage and administration

Carboplatin is dosed to a **target AUC** using the Calvert formula, incorporating creatinine clearance and desired exposure [^c2c60889]. Typical AUC targets are 4–6 mg/mL·min, adjusted for renal function and prior therapy [^7a616d63]. It is administered intravenously over 15–60 minutes, often every 3–4 weeks [^73eb3421].

---

## Side effects and toxicity

Carboplatin has a distinct toxicity profile compared with cisplatin:

- **Myelosuppression**: Dose-limiting; thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia are common [^f93d7ff0].
- **Gastrointestinal toxicity**: Nausea and vomiting are less severe than with cisplatin [^e75a5448].
- **Neurotoxicity**: Lower incidence than cisplatin but can occur with cumulative dosing [^593d8bba].
- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Occur in ~8–16% of patients, increasing with repeated exposures; desensitization protocols enable continued therapy [^b1798d01] [^22a30388].
- **Renal toxicity**: Minimal compared with cisplatin, but renal function monitoring is essential [^2614597d].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Carboplatin demonstrates **comparable efficacy to cisplatin** in many settings, including NSCLC and ovarian cancer, with improved tolerability [^e75a5448] [^c363d3d1]. In SCLC, carboplatin achieves similar response rates and survival to cisplatin [^e678c41a] [^b07c4190].

---

## Resistance mechanisms

Resistance to carboplatin involves multiple mechanisms, including:

- **Enhanced DNA repair**: Increased nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination [^d832fd80].
- **Reduced drug uptake**: Altered transporter expression [^d832fd80].
- **Detoxification**: Elevated glutathione and metallothionein levels [^notfound].
- **Defective apoptosis**: Altered Bcl-2 family protein expression [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend carboplatin as a **standard platinum agent** for ovarian, lung, and bladder cancers, particularly when cisplatin is contraindicated [^c363d3d1] [^e75a5448] [^44c24899]. Dose adjustments for renal impairment and monitoring for hypersensitivity are emphasized [^17cf1a64] [^b1798d01].

---

Carboplatin is a **platinum-based chemotherapy** with broad indications, favorable tolerability, and established efficacy; its renal clearance and AUC-based dosing require careful renal function assessment, and myelosuppression and hypersensitivity are the key management considerations.

### A subset of platinum-containing chemotherapeutic agents kills cells by inducing ribosome biogenesis stress [^b646958d]. Nature Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Cisplatin and its platinum analogs, carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are some of the most widely used cancer chemotherapeutics. Although cisplatin and carboplatin are used primarily in germ cell, breast and lung malignancies, oxaliplatin is instead used almost exclusively to treat colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers. Here we utilize a unique, multi-platform genetic approach to study the mechanism of action of these clinically established platinum anti-cancer agents, as well as more recently developed cisplatin analogs. We show that oxaliplatin, unlike cisplatin and carboplatin, does not kill cells through the DNA-damage response. Rather, oxaliplatin kills cells by inducing ribosome biogenesis stress. This difference in drug mechanism explains the distinct clinical implementation of oxaliplatin relative to cisplatin, and it might enable mechanistically informed selection of distinct platinum drugs for distinct malignancies. These data highlight the functional diversity of core components of front-line cancer therapy and the potential benefits of applying a mechanism-based rationale to the use of our current arsenal of anti-cancer drugs.

### Assessing the role of platinum agents in aggressive breast cancers [^23a8599c]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

As anticipated by their structure and mechanism of action, platinum analogs exhibit clinically significant antitumor activity in the more aggressive forms of breast cancer, both alone and in combination with other cytotoxic agents and targeted therapies. In early-stage human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, the administration of carboplatin together with a taxane (usually docetaxel) and trastuzumab (and pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting) is a standard of care regimen. In BRCA1 mutation carriers, neoadjuvant treatment with single-agent cisplatin results in a high pathologic complete response (pCR) rate. In both BRCA-mutated and sporadic triple-negative breast cancer, the addition of carboplatin to neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increases pCR rates. Despite these encouraging results, many questions remain about the role of platinum analogs in these patient populations, including their optimal doses and schedules, and utility in patients with advanced stage disease. A number of these questions are addressed by ongoing trials.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Carboplatin is a platinum-based drug that binds to DNA and forms DNA cross-links. These crosslinks inhibit DNA replication and transcription and trigger cytotoxic processes that lead to cell death.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Carboplatin exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response have not been fully characterized.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Carboplatin pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with creatinine clearance (CLcr) of about 60 mL/min or greater following a dose of 300 mg/m2to 500 mg/m2as an intravenous infusion over 30-minutes. The Cmaxand AUC0-INFincrease linearly with dose, although the increase was slightly more than dose proportional.

Distribution

The volume of distribution is 16 L.

Carboplatin is not bound to plasma proteins. No significant quantities of protein-free, ultrafilterable platinum-containing species other than carboplatin are present in plasma. However, platinum from carboplatin becomes irreversibly bound to plasma proteins.

Elimination

The elimination half-life is 2.6 to 5.9 hours and the total body clearance is 4.4 L/hour.

The elimination half-life of platinum from carboplatin bound to plasma proteins is a minimum of 5 days.

Excretion

The major route of elimination of carboplatin is renal excretion with 65% of the dose excreted in the urine within 12 hours and 71% within 24 hours. All of the platinum in the 24-hour urine is present as carboplatin.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment: In patients with CLcr below 60 mL/min, the total body and renal clearances of carboplatin decrease as renal function decreases.

### Low-dose carboplatin modifies the tumor microenvironment to augment CAR T cell efficacy in human prostate cancer models [^62a03ff1]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Whilst tumor cell sensitivity to carboplatin is clearly a feature, the transcriptomic changes within the TME following carboplatin treatment strongly suggest that pro-inflammatory effects are not solely dependent on cancer cell death. A single dose of carboplatin induced a cascade of events to sustain a pro-inflammatory microenvironment and T cell persistence. The increase in macrophages initially observed at 1 week post-treatment was sustained, with a shift to the M1 pro-inflammatory phenotype by 3 weeks post-treatment. Indeed, carboplatin is known to activate mouse macrophages, and consequently, the increased production of macrophage-derived factors, Ccl5 and Cxcl10, likely mediated the recruitment of T cells through known mechanisms, including TCR3 receptor recruitment. The evidence from our animal studies strongly suggests that the myeloid compartment plays a key role in the mechanism of action of carboplatin. Whether the response will be similar in humans is unknown, but it is of high relevance to the clinical translation of this combination therapy.

### Cellular processing of platinum anticancer drugs [^b5c795ac]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2005). Medium credibility.

Cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin are platinum-based drugs that are widely used in cancer chemotherapy. Platinum-DNA adducts, which are formed following uptake of the drug into the nucleus of cells, activate several cellular processes that mediate the cytotoxicity of these platinum drugs. This review focuses on recently discovered cellular pathways that are activated in response to cisplatin, including those involved in regulating drug uptake, the signalling of DNA damage, cell-cycle checkpoints and arrest, DNA repair and cell death. Such knowledge of the cellular processing of cisplatin adducts with DNA provides valuable clues for the rational design of more efficient platinum-based drugs as well as the development of new therapeutic strategies.

### Molecular pathways: the immunogenic effects of platinum-based chemotherapeutics [^834f48a2]. Clinical Cancer Research (2014). Low credibility.

The platinum-based drugs cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin belong to the most widely used chemotherapeutics in oncology, showing clinical efficacy against many solid tumors. Their main mechanism of action is believed to be the induction of cancer cell apoptosis as a response to their covalent binding to DNA. In recent years, this picture has increased in complexity, based on studies indicating that cellular molecules other than DNA may potentially act as targets, and that part of the antitumor effects of platinum drugs occurs through modulation of the immune system. These immunogenic effects include modulation of STAT signaling; induction of an immunogenic type of cancer cell death through exposure of calreticulin and release of ATP and high-mobility group protein box-1 (HMGB-1); and enhancement of the effector immune response through modulation of programmed death receptor 1-ligand and mannose-6-phosphate receptor expression. Both basic and clinical studies indicate that at least part of the antitumor efficacy of platinum chemotherapeutics may be due to immune potentiating mechanisms. Clinical studies exploiting this novel mechanism of action of these old cancer drugs have been initiated. Here, we review the literature on the immunogenic effects of platinum, summarize the clinical advances using platinum as a cytotoxic compound with immune adjuvant properties, and discuss the limitations to these studies and the gaps in our understanding of the immunologic effects of these drugs.

### Cellular and molecular pharmacology of oxaliplatin [^5a661c76]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Oxaliplatin, a diaminocyclohexane-containing platinum, has a spectrum of activity and mechanisms of action and resistance that appear to be different from those of other platinum-containing compounds, notably cisplatin. The first part of this review describes the differences between oxaliplatin and cisplatin in terms of their spectrum of activity and adduct formation and then goes on to discuss molecular and cellular experimental data that potentially explain them. Particular emphasis is placed on the differential role of DNA repair mechanisms. In addition, the anticancer effects of oxaliplatin are optimized when it is administered in combination with other anticancer agents, such as 5-fluorouracil, gemcitabine, cisplatin, or carboplatin; topoisomerase I inhibitors; and taxanes. In vitro and preclinical combination data that could optimize oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy are also reviewed.

### Platinum compounds 30 years after the introduction of cisplatin: implications for the treatment of ovarian cancer [^d832fd80]. Gynecologic Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Cisplatin and carboplatin have dominated the drug therapy of ovarian cancer and other gynecologic malignancies during the past three decades. This review, based on a recent international conference on metal coordination compounds, highlights advances in our understanding of their mechanisms of action and resistance. Two emerging areas are of special importance: 1) the role of transporters and exporters (first identified in the regulation of copper) in imparting the special selectivity of platinum drugs (also including oxaliplatin) for specific tumors; and 2) the relevance of inactivated DNA repair pathways, and in particular those related to BRCA genes in determining sensitivity of tumors to platinum drugs. The status of DNA repair pathways may become relevant to response to platinums and to the treatment of ovarian cancer in general: repair inhibitors are under testing alone or in combination with cytotoxic drugs for cancer.

### Clinical pharmacology of cancer therapies in older adults [^e6bec49d]. British Journal of Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Cisplatin and carboplatin

Both cisplatin and carboplatin rely on renal clearance and have a similar mechanism of action. The clearance of the drugs is triphasic in nature, consisting of a distribution half-life (13 min for cisplatin; 22 min for carboplatin), elimination half-life (43 min for cisplatin; 116 min for carboplatin), and terminal half-life (5.4 days for cisplatin; 5.8 days for carboplatin). Potential cisplatin toxicities that require early evaluation, dose modification, and/or treatment in older adults include nephrotoxicity, nausea and vomiting, electrolyte abnormalities, ototoxicity, myelosuppression, and peripheral neuropathy. Cisplatin can be directly nephrotoxic to the renal tubules; therefore, it must be used with caution in older adults who may already have impaired renal function. The dose of cisplatin should be adjusted if the glomerular filtration rate is 30–50 mL min −1, and it should not be given if creatinine clearance is < 30 mL min −1. The risk of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity can be ameliorated with intravenous hydration, and mannitol or furosemide diuresis. Carboplatin is not directly toxic to the renal tubules; however, since the drug is cleared renally, renal impairment will lead to increased drug levels. The clearance of carboplatin is linearly related to the patient's glomerular filtration rate. The Calvert formula, which takes into account a patient's glomerular filtration rate, is used to calculate the dose of carboplatin based on the desired AUC. A study of platinum-based chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer demonstrated that older patients were at increased risk for toxicity. In particular, compared with younger patients, older women were more likely to lose weight and older men were more likely to experience neuropsychiatric side effects and leucopenia.

### The resurgence of platinum-based cancer chemotherapy [^8355d329]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2007). Medium credibility.

The accidental discovery of the anticancer properties of cisplatin and its clinical introduction in the 1970s represent a major landmark in the history of successful anticancer drugs. Although carboplatin — a second-generation analogue that is safer but shows a similar spectrum of activity to cisplatin — was introduced in the 1980s, the pace of further improvements slowed for many years. However, in the past several years interest in platinum drugs has increased. Key developments include the elucidation of mechanisms of tumour resistance to these drugs, the introduction of new platinum-based agents (oxaliplatin, satraplatin and picoplatin), and clinical combination studies using platinum drugs with resistance modulators or new molecularly targeted drugs.

### Metabolic reprogramming from glycolysis to fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation in platinum-resistant cancer cells [^6034cdec]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Cisplatin and other platinum-based drugs, such as carboplatin and oxaliplatin, are widely used chemotherapy agents for multiple types of cancers, including ovarian, testicular, bladder, head and neck, nonsmall-cell lung cancer and others. Despite the high response rate following initial treatment, the effects of cisplatin and carboplatin are limited by severe side effects and high probability of drug resistance development. In view of the high prevalence of cisplatin or carboplatin use in cancer management, there is a critical need to develop effective therapeutic options to overcome the resistance.

The major mechanism-of-action of cisplatin is formation of DNA adducts, which block transcription and DNA synthesis, while at the same time, activate DNA damage response mechanisms and mitochondrial detoxification mechanisms. Apoptosis eventually ensues if DNA lesions are not repaired, and oxidative stress is not buffered. Numerous efforts have been devoted to elucidating the mechanisms of cancer cell resistance to cisplatin. Most of these studies focused on adduct formation and subsequent activation of cell death pathways, for example, reduced formation of DNA adducts due to altered uptake/efflux, enhanced DNA damage repair, or impaired mitochondrial apoptosis pathway after adduct formation. Other mechanisms of cisplatin resistance have received much less attention. Several studies have shown that cisplatin can have another mechanism-of-action by inducing oxidative stress in ovarian, prostate, and lung cancer. Yet, little is known regarding how the cancer cells' defense against oxidative stress contributes to cisplatin resistance.

### Carboplatin injection (carboplatin) [^96bda964]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Who should not take carboplatin?

Treatment with carboplatin is not recommended if you:

are allergic to carboplatin or other platinum-containing products, or to mannitol;
have a weakened blood-forming system (bone marrow depression) or significant bleeding;
are pregnant, intend to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding a baby.

How is carboplatin used?

Only a professional experienced in the use of cancer drugs should give you this medication. Carboplatin is given by dripping the medicine slowly and directly into a vein (intravenous infusion) for 15 minutes or longer. Your doctor will determine the dose of carboplatin for you based on your weight, height, and kidney function. Carboplatin may be given alone or with other drugs. Treatment is usually repeated every four weeks for a number of cycles.

Before and after carboplatin treatment, your doctor may give you medication to lessen the nausea and vomiting associated with this cancer treatment

What should you tell your doctor before starting treatment with carboplatin?

Discuss the benefits and risks of carboplatin with your doctor before beginning treatment.

Be sure to inform your doctor:

If you are allergic to carboplatin or other platinum-containing products, or to mannitol;
If you are or intend to become pregnant, since carboplatin may harm the developing fetus. It

### Platinum neurotoxicity pharmacogenetics [^4ba887a0]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin anticancer drugs are commonly used to treat lung, colorectal, ovarian, breast, head and neck, and genitourinary cancers. However, the efficacy of platinum-based drugs is often compromised because of the substantial risk for severe toxicities, including neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity can result in both acute and chronic debilitation. Moreover, colorectal cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin discontinue therapy more often because of peripheral neuropathy than tumor progression, potentially compromising patient benefit. Numerous methods to prevent neurotoxicity have thus far proven unsuccessful. To circumvent this life-altering side effect while taking advantage of the antitumor activities of the platinum agents, efforts to identify mechanism-based biomarkers are under way. In this review, we detail findings from the current literature for genetic markers associated with neurotoxicity induced by single-agent and combination platinum chemotherapy. These data have the potential for broad clinical implications if mechanistic associations lead to the development of toxicity modulators to minimize the noxious sequelae of platinum chemotherapy.

### Resistance to chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer: mechanisms and current strategies [^8c1373fa]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment for epithelial ovarian cancer has improved over the past 20 years with the introduction of the platinums and, more recently, taxane-based chemotherapy. The results of randomised-controlled trials have established paclitaxel in combination with a platinum agent as a standard initial chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer patients. Recent studies have suggested that docetaxel–carboplatin is as effective as paclitaxel–carboplatin chemotherapy.

Despite these treatment advances, most patients will relapse after achieving complete clinical response, and in the majority of these patients the disease is incurable. As a result, the treatment of recurrent disease is an important aspect in the overall management of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. A thorough understanding of drug resistance mechanisms is needed, as this remains the largest obstacle in treating patients with recurrent disease. Alterations to current taxane–platinum therapy such as the incorporation of newer noncross-resistant drugs, sequential therapy and intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration may help improve survival duration. This review examines some of the major mechanisms of resistance of tumours to anticancer drugs with particular reference to advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, and the means by which both clinical and laboratory researchers are seeking to circumvent these mechanisms in patients.

### Carboplatin [^c31bd309]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Carboplatin, like cisplatin, produces predominantly interstrand DNA cross-links rather than DNA-protein cross-links. This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.

In patients with creatinine clearances of about 60 mL/min or greater, plasma levels of intact carboplatin decay in a biphasic manner after a 30-minute intravenous infusion of 300 mg/m2to 500 mg/m2of carboplatin. The initial plasma half-life (alpha) was found to be 1.1 to 2 hours (n = 6), and the postdistribution plasma half-life (beta) was found to be 2.6 to 5.9 hours (n = 6). The total body clearance, apparent volume of distribution and mean residence time for carboplatin are 4.4 L/hour, 16 L and 3.5 hours, respectively. The Cmaxvalues and areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves from 0 to infinity (AUC inf) increase linearly with dose, although the increase was slightly more than dose proportional. Carboplatin, therefore, exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the dosing range studied (300 mg/m2to 500 mg/m2).

### Low-dose carboplatin modifies the tumor microenvironment to augment CAR T cell efficacy in human prostate cancer models [^c9c56178]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Interestingly, PDX-287R has a mutation in the mismatch repair gene mutS homologue 2 (MSH2), which may be associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in a range of solid tumors. This may have contributed to the response seen here and needs to be investigated in other prostate tumors with mismatch repair deficiency. The sequencing and timing of combination therapies may also influence response, and future studies are required to optimize their roles in enhancing CAR T cell therapy, for example, the use of real-time analyses to provide more dynamic insights into the spectrum of responses across time.

In this study, the action of carboplatin was assessed in immunosuppressed NSG mice, which lack T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. This model allows us to compare the response of individual patient tumors to treatment, and thus it is more reflective of tumor heterogeneity seen in the clinic. In addition, a potentially unappreciated benefit of this immunosuppressed model is that it allows the focus to be on the interaction between the tumor and human CAR T cells without a cognate effector immune response being induced through the murine lymphoid compartment. This lack of lymphoid cells was advantageous as it did not obscure the major shift we saw in the phenotypes of host myeloid cells, fibroblasts, ECM, and endothelial cells in response to carboplatin. This is likely to be a critical facet of the mechanism of action and is highly relevant to the human setting. However, this model is limited by the lack of crosstalk between immune cells within the TME, including the dynamic interaction between immune activation and suppression, and future studies need to be extended into an immunocompetent syngeneic setting.

### In vitro analysis of ovarian cancer response to cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel identifies common pathways that are also associated with overall patient survival [^02665fa1]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to characterise the biological signalling pathways that underlie response to standard of care therapy and to further determine the influence of these pathways on overall survival from OVCA. To accomplish these objectives, we integrated chemo-sensitivity data from OVCA cell lines treated with cisplatin, carboplatin, and carboplatin plus paclitaxel with genome-wide expression data to provide insights into the unique and common signalling pathways that may comprise the biological basis of OVCA response to primary therapy agents. Although it is recognised that platinum-based agents induce cell death via initial mechanisms (and molecular pathways) that are distinct from those of the taxanes, it is also accepted that the two groups of drugs likely share a number of final biological and molecular pathways associated with the apoptotic process, thus underlying the assumptions for this study. The identification of unique and shared determinants of drug response in OVCA has the potential to improve our understanding of OVCA chemo-response and also the stratification of patients for treatment with current therapies and the rational selection of agents targeted to these pathways for future treatment of OVCA.

### Modulation of immune checkpoint regulators in interferon γ induced urothelial carcinoma and activated T-lymphocyte cells by cytostatics [^44c24899]. Genes and Immunity (2023). Medium credibility.

Platinum-based drugs in urothelial cancer

As a platinum-based drug, we focused on cisplatin that is the most common applied drug member from the first generation. Alternatively, carboplatin is employed for advanced urothelial cancer patients who are ineligible for cisplatin. Carboplatin displays less systemic toxicity and is administered in patients with poor performance status such as those with restricted renal function. Pharmacologically, cisplatin and carboplatin bind to DNA via intra- and interstranded crosslinks causing DNA damage thereby triggering cell cycle block and apoptosis. Chemically, carboplatin has a 'slower leaving group release' when reacting with nucleophiles such as N7-guanine in DNA and this is attributed to less myelosuppressive related side effects. The common pharmacologic action of cisplatin and carboplatin suggests similar regulation of PD-L1 and PD-1. Variations in "non-canonical" actions targeting molecules beyond DNA, on the other hand, could differentially affect PD-L1 and PD-1 expression, an as yet undefined and speculative mechanism.

### First-line chemotherapy for ovarian cancer-the controversy continues [^588f5d3e]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Although it is hard to contradict the authors' concluding statement, those of us involved in managing this disease clearly need to go forwards rather than backwards from here. Further detailed comparisons of these four studies done at different times by different groups using different treatments can be useful in formulating hypotheses, but any conclusions should be drawn with caution, not least because of the heterogeneity of treated populations. Taxanes should remain an important element in the first line of management of these patients, for several reasons. There is clear evidence of efficacy in patients whose disease no longer responds to platinum, implying that the target cancer cell population is somewhat different, and this is supported by experimental data focusing on the presence or absence of functional p53. In addition, the mechanism of action and the toxicity profiles are quite different from platinum. For virtually all chemosensitive epithelial cancers, combination chemotherapy rather than single agent treatment has provided significant survival benefits when applied as initial therapy, and there seems no fundamental reason for concluding that ovarian cancer will ultimately prove to be different in this regard. The challenge now remains: how to identify the optimal combination?

The two trials, GOG 132 and ICON 3, do suggest that paclitaxel-cisplatin or paclitaxel-carboplatin, given as concurrent treatments every 3 weeks for 6 cycles with a 24 h or three paclitaxel infusion may not necessarily be the best approach. It is conceivable, indeed, that the two drugs exhibit a degree of antagonism in certain schedules, and experimental data on this are equivocal.

Alternative approaches should clearly be considered for clinical trial research and these could include sequential regimes, in which the taxanes and the platinum compound are given separately. The impact of modulators of response to chemotherapy, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, also merits serious consideration, since they may have an important effect on any taxane-platinum interactions. These and other approaches, such as the further evaluation of 'maintenance chemotherapy' with single agent paclitaxel, and the incorporation of other active agents such as liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan and gemcitabine provide a rich seam for clinical triallists in the next few years.

### Carboplatin [^17cf1a64]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Carboplatin is not bound to plasma proteins. No significant quantities of protein-free, ultrafilterable platinum-containing species other than carboplatin are present in plasma. However, platinum from carboplatin becomes irreversibly bound to plasma proteins and is slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of 5 days.

The major route of elimination of carboplatin is renal excretion. Patients with creatinine clearances of approximately 60 mL/min or greater excrete 65% of the dose in the urine within 12 hours and 71% of the dose within 24 hours. All of the platinum in the 24-hour urine is present as carboplatin. Only 3% to 5% of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine between 24 and 96 hours. There are insufficient data to determine whether biliary excretion occurs.

In patients with creatinine clearances below 60 mL/min, the total body and renal clearances of carboplatin decrease as the creatinine clearance decreases. Carboplatin dosages should therefore be reduced in these patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

The primary determinant of carboplatin injection clearance is glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and this parameter of renal function is often decreased in elderly patients. Dosing formulas incorporating estimates of GFR (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) to provide predictable carboplatin injection plasma AUCs should be used in elderly patients to minimize the risk of toxicity.

### Hypersensitivity reactions to platinum agents and taxanes [^22a30388]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary and Conclusions

The last two decades have witnessed significant advances in our understanding of risk factors, clinical phenotypes, and mechanisms of chemotherapy HSRs, as well as the role of diagnostic tools like skin testing. Desensitization to platinum and taxane agents has been shown to be safe and effective. In addition, RDD seems to be comparable to standard infusion in terms of treatment efficacy. In the largest desensitization study to date, patients with recurrent ovarian cancer receiving carboplatin via desensitization had a nonsignificant trend toward increased life expectancy compared to matched controls receiving standard infusion, suggesting that at the least there is no trade-off in terms of mortality. While drug desensitization has been applied to an increasing number of chemotherapy agents and biologics, there is ongoing interest in the development of better endophenotyping tools and biomarkers to personalize treatment.

Regardless of the pathway chosen, the optimal evaluation and management of patients with chemotherapy HSRs relies on multidisciplinary collaborations between allergy, oncology, pharmacy, nursing, and in some institutions critical care. Chemotherapy desensitizations and drug challenges are high-risk, high-complexity procedures that should be carried out with expert allergy guidance in settings equipped to treat reactions. Standardizing classification systems and research methods will increase knowledge of safe and personalized management strategies for patients and enable institutions to adapt these pathways to their unique needs.

### Enhancement of synthetic lethality via combinations of ABT-888, a PARP inhibitor, and carboplatin in vitro and in vivo using BRCA1 and BRCA2 isogenic models [^aa6d4a07]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Individuals with an inherited BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have an elevated risk of developing breast cancer. The resulting tumors typically lack homologous recombination repair as do a subset of sporadic tumors with acquired BRCA deficiency. Clinical responses to monotherapy with platinum drugs or poly PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been shown for BRCA-associated cancers. However, there are limited data on combination therapy with PARPi and platinum drugs, the mechanism of action of this combination, and the role of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in chemosensitivity. We compared the efficacy of ABT-888 (a PARPi) with that of cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum drugs) alone or in combinations by examining the survival of treated Brca-proficient and -deficient mouse embryonic stem cells. In addition, drug-induced growth inhibition of a BRCA1 and a BRCA2 null cell line were compared with their isogenic BRCA-complemented lines. Although each monotherapy killed or inhibited proliferation of Brca/BRCA-deficient cells, an enhanced effect was observed after treatment with ABT-888 in combination with carboplatin. Moreover, the ABT-888/carboplatin combination delayed tumor growth in Brca2 xenografts. The drugs caused DNA damage and apoptosis. Along with greater PARP activity in Brca/BRCA-deficient cells, these effects correlated with increased chemosensitivity. Our data suggest that ABT-888 and carboplatin combination treatment will be more successful than monotherapy in addressing many BRCA-associated cancers. A randomized phase II trial has recently been initiated to test this hypothesis to assist in the discovery of more effective therapies for patients with BRCA.

### Carboplatin injection (carboplatin) [^57ea012c]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Carboplatin, USP, like cisplatin, produces predominantly interstrand DNA cross-links rather than DNA-protein cross-links. This effect is apparently cell-cycle nonspecific. The aquation of carboplatin, USP, which is thought to produce the active species, occurs at a slower rate than in the case of cisplatin. Despite this difference, it appears that both carboplatin, USP and cisplatin induce equal numbers of drug-DNA cross-links, causing equivalent lesions and biological effects. The differences in potencies for carboplatin, USP and cisplatin appear to be directly related to the difference in aquation rates.

In patients with creatinine clearances of about 60 mL/min or greater, plasma levels of intact carboplatin, USP decay in a biphasic manner after a 30-minute intravenous infusion of 300 mg/m2to 500 mg/m2of carboplatin, USP. The initial plasma half-life (alpha) was found to be 1.1 to 2 hours (N = 6), and the post distribution plasma half-life (beta) was found to be 2.6 to 5.9 hours (N = 6). The total body clearance, apparent volume of distribution and mean residence time for carboplatin, USP is 4.4 L/hour, 16 L and 3.5 hours, respectively. The Cmaxvalues and areas under the plasma concentration vs time curves from 0 to infinity (AUC inf) increase linearly with dose, although the increase was slightly more than dose proportional. Carboplatin, USP, therefore, exhibits linear pharmacokinetics over the dosing range studied (300 mg/m2to 500 mg/m2).

### Pan-cancer whole-genome comparison of primary and metastatic solid tumours [^f3befd92]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

To determine which variants contribute the most to the observed significant frequency differences, individual actionable variants were tested for enrichment in metastatic tumours using a Fisher's exact test per cancer type and tier level. P values were FDR adjusted per cancer type and q < 0.05 was deemed to be significant. In Extended Data Fig. 8, only actionable variants from cancer types with a global significant difference (see above) and that were found at a minimum frequency of 5% in either primary or metastatic cohort and a minimum frequency difference of 5% between them were shown. However, the differences across all screened variants are available as part of Supplementary Table 7.

TEDs

We aimed to pinpoint drivers that are potentially responsible for lack of response to certain cancer treatments in the metastatic cohort. Hence, we devised a test that identifies driver alterations that are enriched in groups of patients treated with a particular treatment type compared with the untreated group of patients from the same cancer type (see Extended Data Fig. 9a for illustration of the workflow).

Treatments were grouped according to their mechanism of action so that multiple drugs with a shared mechanism of action were grouped into the mechanistic treatment category (for example, cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin were grouped as platinum). We created 323 treatment and cancer-type groups by grouping patients with treatment annotation according to their treatment record before the biopsy. One patient might be involved in multiple groups if they have received multiple lines of therapy or a simultaneous combination of multiple drugs. Only 92 treatment and cancer-type groups with at least ten patients were further considered in the analysis.

### Platinum drugs in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer [^ff34f93a]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

Cisplatin and carboplatin

Platinum agents have currently shown the greatest promise in patients with NSCLC. These agents induce their cytotoxic effects by targeting cellular DNA and are active against a number of tumour types. Cisplatin is thought to act by activating apoptosis and altering a number of other cellular parameters. It forms adducts with all DNA bases but preferentially binds to the N 7 positions of guanine and adenine in intact DNA. The main DNA lesions produced by both cisplatin and carboplatin, accounting for a total of 95% of platinum-DNA adducts, are at the G-G, A-G and G-X-G intrastrand crosslinks.

The dosages at which these agents are given varies according to the agent(s) with which they are being combined and the status of the patient. However, cisplatin is usually given at a dosage of 50–120 mg m −2 per cycle, whereas the dose of carboplatin is usually customised for each patient using the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and renal function of the patient, because this drug undergoes extensive renal excretion. An AUC of 4–6 per cycle, which is approximately equivalent to a dose in the range 200–350 mg m −2 per cycle, is usual. Both platinum agents are usually given every 3–4 weeks, according to the haematological status of the patient, for 3–6 cycles.

Analysis of the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) database of 2531 patients with extensive NSCLC (1974–1988) showed the use of cisplatin to be an independent predictor of improved outcome. Thus, most clinical studies of chemotherapy in advanced or locoregionally advanced NSCLC in recent years have incorporated cisplatin. However, because of the toxicity of cisplatin (see below), less toxic platinum alternatives have been developed. The most extensively evaluated has been carboplatin, with studies demonstrating the efficacy of carboplatin, alone or in combination. The available data suggest that carboplatin can substitute cisplatin in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. However, direct comparisons between cisplatin- and carboplatin-based chemotherapy have been very rare.presented the results of a randomised study comparing docetaxel plus cisplatin or carboplatin versus vinorelbine plus cisplatin at the 2001 meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Although the study was not designed to compare carboplatin with cisplatin, results in the carboplatin arm were inferior.

### Meta-analysis of platinum chemotherapy combinations with immunotherapy in metastatic urothelial carcinoma [^55fc7292]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations in our study, primarily the absence of individual-level patient data. This limitation prevents us from conducting more detailed subgroup analyses and personalized treatment recommendations based on specific patient characteristics. There may be variations in comorbidities across patient groups, with those in the carboplatin arm potentially having more comorbidities than those in the cisplatin arm. This discrepancy could impact the results of the study. Further research efforts should aim to incorporate individual patient-level data and conducted with matched groups will be needed to compare the results. On the other hand, this was an indirect comparison of the cisplatin and carboplatin-based combinations. It is difficult to compare the direct effects of cisplatin and carboplatin further, thus ignoring the primary effects of cisplatin and carboplatin in urothelial carcinoma.

In conclusion, although this meta-analysis suggests that the combination of IO and a cisplatin-based chemotherapy backbone appears to be more effective, there is a lack of direct data that compares the efficacy of cisplatin and carboplatin-based regimens in combination with IO. To clarify, we need more research comparing the IO combination with cisplatin- and carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. This effect may be attributed to the immunomodulatory effect of cisplatin. The clinical implications of these results underscore the necessity for a strategic selection of chemotherapy backbones in immunotherapy regimens for mUC, promoting cisplatin as the preferable option when clinically feasible. Future investigations should focus on unraveling the specific immunological mechanisms activated by cisplatin that contribute to enhanced therapeutic outcomes, thereby informing the development of more effective, tailored treatment paradigms for mUC.

### In vitro analysis of ovarian cancer response to cisplatin, carboplatin, and paclitaxel identifies common pathways that are also associated with overall patient survival [^a261b891]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

To distinguish between pathways that are unique to the mechanism of action of each drug and pathways that are common determinants of OVCA sensitivity, we identified pathways containing genes that were correlated with sensitivity to multiple drugs. Of the 25 pathways linked to sensitivity to carboplatin–paclitaxel combination therapy and the 68 pathways linked to cisplatin sensitivity, only 3 were identified in both analyses: 'Apoptosis and Survival/BAD Phosphorylation', 'Role of APC in Cell Cycle Regulation' (where APC is anaphase-promoting complex) and 'Transcription/CREB' (Figure 2D). Eight pathways were specifically correlated with carboplatin sensitivity, regardless of whether paclitaxel was used (Figure 2C). Two pathways were specifically correlated with sensitivity to paclitaxel treatment in both the presence and absence of carboplatin (Figure 2B).

To further distinguish core pathways involved in the response to chemotherapeutic agents in OVCA, we analysed the union of three individual comparisons: carboplatin sensitivity vs cisplatin sensitivity, carboplatin–paclitaxel sensitivity vs cisplatin sensitivity, and carboplatin–paclitaxel sensitivity vs carboplatin sensitivity. We identified three pathways with a shared role in OVCA sensitivity to carboplatin and cisplatin single-agent treatment and carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment: 1) 'Apoptosis and Survival/BAD Phosphorylation' 2) 'Role of APC in Cell Cycle Regulation', and 3) 'Transcription/CREB' (Figure 3). Diagrams of the genes/proteins involved in these pathways are provided in Figure 3 (GeneGo MetaCore output: September 29, 2010).

### Cisplatin versus carboplatin in combination with third-generation drugs for advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^e75a5448]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in both sexes worldwide. Approximately 50% of those diagnosed with lung cancer will have locally advanced or metastatic disease and will be treated in a palliative setting. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy has benefits in terms of survival and symptom control when compared with best supportive care.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of carboplatin-based chemotherapy when compared with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, both in combination with a third-generation drug, in people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To compare quality of life in people with advanced NSCLC receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and carboplatin combined with a third-generation drug.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 13 January 2019), MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to 13 January 2019), and Embase (via Ovid) (1974 to 13 January 2019). In addition, we handsearched the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meetings (January 1990 to September 2018) and reference lists from relevant resources.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing regimens with carboplatin or cisplatin combined with a third-generation drug in people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. We accepted any regimen and number of cycles that included these drugs, since there is no widely accepted standard regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the search results, and a third review author resolved any disagreements. The primary outcomes were overall survival and health-related quality of life. The secondary outcomes were one-year survival rate, objective response rate and toxicity.

Main Results

In this updated review, we located one additional RCT, for a total of 11 included RCTs (5088 participants, 4046 of whom were available for meta-analysis). There was no difference in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.20; 10 RCTs; 2515 participants; high-quality evidence); one-year survival rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.08; I² = 17%; 4004 participants; all 11 RCTs; high-quality evidence); or response rate (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.00; I² = 12%; all 11 RCTs; 4020 participants; high-quality evidence). A subgroup analysis comparing carboplatin with different doses of cisplatin found an overall survival benefit in favour of carboplatin-based regimens when compared to cisplatin at lower doses (40 to 80 mg/m 2) (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.28; 6 RCTs; 2508 participants), although there was no overall survival benefit when carboplatin-based chemotherapy was compared to cisplatin at higher doses (80 to 100 mg/m 2) (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.04; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs; 1823 participants). Carboplatin caused more thrombocytopenia (RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.49 to 4.04; I² = 68%; 10 RCTs; 3670 participants) and was associated with more neurotoxicity (RR 1.42, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.23; I² = 0%, 5 RCTs; 1489 participants), although we believe this last finding is probably related to a confounding factor (higher dose of paclitaxel in the carboplatin-containing treatment arm of a large study included in the analysis). There was no statistically significant difference in renal toxicity (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.45; I² = 3%; 3 RCTs; 1272 participants); alopecia (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.68; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs; 300 participants); anaemia (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.38; I2 = 77%; 10 RCTs; 3857 participants); and neutropenia (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.63; I² = 94%; 10 RCTs; 3857 participants) between cisplatin-based chemotherapy and carboplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. Two RCTs performed a health-related quality of life analysis; however, as they used different methods of measurement we were unable to perform a meta-analysis. One RCT reported comparative health-related quality of life data between cisplatin and carboplatin-containing arms but found no significant differences in global indices of quality of life, including global health status or functional scales. In this Cochrane review, we found that the quality of evidence was high for overall survival, one-year survival rate and response rate but moderate quality evidence for the other outcomes measured.

Authors' Conclusions

Advanced NSCL patients treated with carboplatin or cisplatin doublet with third-generation chemotherapy drugs showed equivalent overall survival, one-year survival, and response rate. Regarding adverse events, carboplatin caused more thrombocytopenia, and cisplatin caused more nausea/vomiting. Therefore, in this palliative therapeutic intent, the choice of the platin compound should take into account the expected toxicity profile, patient's comorbidities and preferences.

WARNING

Carboplatin injection should be administered under the supervision of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate treatment facilities are readily available.

Bone marrow suppression is dose related and may be severe, resulting in infection and/or bleeding. Anemia may be cumulative and may require transfusion support. Vomiting is another frequent drug related side effect.

Anaphylactic-like reactions to carboplatin, USP have been reported and may occur within minutes of carboplatin injection administration. Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines have been employed to alleviate symptoms.

### Resistance to chemotherapy in advanced ovarian cancer: mechanisms and current strategies [^62fc28c3]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

A subsequent randomised Phase III study has incorporated a taxane into the treatment regimen. The experimental arm comprised i.p. cisplatin (100 mg m −2) and i.v. paclitaxel (135 mg m −2), while the control arm consisted of i.v. cisplatin (75 mg m −2) and i.v. paclitaxel (135 mg m −2). The experimental treatment was associated with a statistically significant improvement in PFS (28 vs 22 months; P = 0.01), but there was no significant improvement in overall survival. This trial suffers from a number of design flaws, not least of which is the fact that delivering two cycles of carboplatin at AUC 9 in addition to six cycles of cisplatin–paclitaxel adds a longer duration of chemotherapy and an increased cumulative dose of platinum, thus unbalancing the trial in favour of the research arm, irrespective of the mode of administration. In addition, the timing of salvage therapies is not known, and may have influenced the PFS end point if administered before progression (salvage therapies are also likely to have influenced the overall survival, and were not controlled). Furthermore, considerably greater toxicity was observed in the experimental i.p. arm (grade IV thrombocytopenia and grade III gastrointestinal).

### Carboplatin (Kyxata) [^593d8bba]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Peripheral Neuropathy

Peripheral neuropathy, including paresthesia, can occur in patients treated with KYXATA.

Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 4% of patients receiving carboplatin as a single agent (6% of pretreated patients with ovarian cancer). Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 10% of patients older than 65 who were previously treated with carboplatin.

Prolonged treatment, treatment with other platinum-containing therapies, or use in combination with other drugs that cause peripheral neuropathy may increase the incidence or severity of peripheral neuropathy.

Monitor for signs and symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. Withhold, reduce, or discontinue KYXATA depending on the severity and persistence of peripheral neuropathy as clinically indicated.

5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on findings in animals and its mechanism of action, KYXATA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. Administration of carboplatin to pregnant rats caused adverse developmental outcomes, including embryo-fetal lethality and structural abnormalities.

Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KYXATA and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KYXATA and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Current and future potential roles of the platinum drugs in the treatment of ovarian cancer [^ec98b1d4]. Annals of Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

The discovery of cisplatin more than two decades ago was the most important therapeutic advance in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Today, cisplatin or carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel is the most commonly used first-line treatment for patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Although platinum drugs remain a critical component of chemotherapy in this type of cancer, cumulative toxicities can limit their use. These toxicities include nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity and ototoxicity with cisplatin and myelosuppression with carboplatin. Although these adverse events can often be managed, the interventions themselves can complicate and add to the costs of treatment. Importantly, acquired resistance to traditional platinum drugs often develops in patients with ovarian cancer and can limit the usefulness of these drugs. Research into new platinum drugs has focused on identifying compounds with improved tolerability profiles and, importantly, those which can circumvent mechanisms of platinum resistance. New platinum drugs currently under development that are showing promise in ovarian cancer include oxaliplatin, nedaplatin, satraplatin, BBR3464 and ZD0473. If the encouraging in vitro activity shown by new compounds, such as ZD0473 and BBR3464, translates into efficacy in the clinic, they may offer an extended spectrum of activity which includes patients with ovarian cancer resistant to the classical platinum drugs.

### Generation of evidence-based carboplatin dosing guidelines for neonates and infants [^32d48d0a]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Although real-time monitoring of carboplatin exposure remains the best practice for dosing carboplatin in infant cancer patients, the proposed body weight-based doses have the potential to increase the number of patients achieving optimal exposures of carboplatin, where TDM is not a viable option. Future work will focus on assessing the landscape of dosing recommendations for additional drugs widely used in neonates and infants, where clinical pharmacology data remain scarce.

### Genetic variation that predicts platinum sensitivity reveals the role of miR-193b* in chemotherapeutic susceptibility [^502064c7]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Platinum agents are the backbone of cancer chemotherapy. Recently, we identified and replicated the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs1649942) in predicting platinum sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Using the CEU samples from the International HapMap Project, we found the same SNP to be a master regulator of multiple gene expression phenotypes, prompting us to investigate whether rs1649942-mediated regulation of miRNAs may in part contribute to variation in platinum sensitivity. To these ends, 60 unrelated HapMap CEU I/II samples were used for our discovery-phase study using high-throughput genome-wide miRNA and gene expression profiling. Examining the relationships among rs1649942, its gene expression targets, genome-wide miRNA expression, and cellular sensitivity to carboplatin and cisplatin, we identified 2 platinum-associated miRNAs (miR-193b* and miR-320) that inhibit the expression of 5 platinum-associated genes (CRIM1, IFIT2, OAS1, KCNMA1, and GRAMD1B). We further replicated the relationship between the expression of miR-193b*, CRIM1, IFIT2, KCNMA1, and GRAMD1B, and platinum sensitivity in a separate HapMap CEU III dataset. We then showed that overexpression of miR-193b* in a randomly selected HapMap cell line results in resistance to both carboplatin and cisplatin. This relationship was also found in 7 ovarian cancer cell lines from NCI60 dataset and confirmed in an OVCAR-3 that overexpression of miR-193b* leads to increased resistance to carboplatin. Our findings highlight a potential mechanism of action for a previously observed genotype-survival outcome association. Further examination of miR-193b* in platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancer is warranted.

### Carboplatin injection (carboplatin) [^35245bb0]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

Carboplatin, USP is not bound to plasma proteins. No significant quantities of protein-free, ultrafilterable platinum-containing species other than carboplatin, USP are present in plasma. However, platinum from carboplatin, USP becomes irreversibly bound to plasma proteins and is slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of 5 days.

The major route of elimination of carboplatin, USP is renal excretion. Patients with creatinine clearances of approximately 60 mL/min or greater excrete 65% of the dose in the urine within 12 hours and 71% of the dose within 24 hours. All of the platinum in the 24-hour urine is present as carboplatin, USP. Only 3 to 5% of the administered platinum is excreted in the urine between 24 and 96 hours. There are insufficient data to determine whether biliary excretion occurs.

In patients with creatinine clearances below 60 mL/min the total body and renal clearances of carboplatin, USP decrease as the creatinine clearance decreases. Carboplatin injection dosages should therefore be reduced in these patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

The primary determinant of carboplatin injection clearance is glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and this parameter of renal function is often decreased in elderly patients. Dosing formulas incorporating estimates of GFR (see DOSAGE and ADMINISTRATION) to provide predictable carboplatin injection plasma AUCs should be used in elderly patients to minimize the risk of toxicity.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Needles or intravenous administration sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with carboplatin injection should not be used for the preparation or administration of the drug. Aluminum can react with carboplatin causing precipitate formation and loss of potency.

Drug Interactions

The renal effects of nephrotoxic compounds may be potentiated by carboplatin.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

The carcinogenic potential of carboplatin has not been studied, but compounds with similar mechanisms of action and mutagenicity profiles have been reported to be carcinogenic. Carboplatin has been shown to be mutagenic both in vitro and in vivo. It has also been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats receiving the drug during organogenesis. Secondary malignancies have been reported in association with multi-drug therapy.

Pregnancy

Pregnancy Category D

See WARNINGS.

Nursing Mothers

It is not known whether carboplatin is excreted in human milk. Because there is a possibility of toxicity in nursing infants secondary to carboplatin treatment of the mother, it is recommended that breastfeeding be discontinued if the mother is treated with carboplatin injection.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established (see WARNINGS, "audiologic toxicity").

Geriatric Use

Of the 789 patients in initial treatment combination therapy studies (NCIC and SWOG), 395 patients were treated with carboplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide. Of these, 141 were over 65 years of age and 22 were 75 years or older. In these trials, age was not a prognostic factor for survival. In terms of safety, elderly patients treated with carboplatin were more likely to develop severe thrombocytopenia than younger patients. In a combined database of 1,942 patients (414 were ≥ 65 years of age) that received single agent carboplatin for different tumor types, a similar incidence of adverse events was seen in patients 65 years and older and in patients less than 65. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because renal function is often decreased in the elderly, renal function should be considered in the selection of carboplatin injection dosage (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Part I: chemotherapy for epithelial ovarian cancer-treatment at first diagnosis [^592828a6]. The Lancet: Oncology (2002). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cancer leads to more deaths than any other gynaecological cancer in the more developed countries. During the past 30 years, survival has increased owing to improvements in diagnosis, surgery, and chemotherapy. Despite these advances, most patients will die from the disease, and the overall 5-year survival is less than 50%. Most patients with ovarian cancer need cytotoxic chemotherapy. Platinum agents (cisplatin and carboplatin) are the most important drugs to be included in first-line regimens. Randomised trials have recently confirmed the benefit of the addition of taxanes to platinum, and the standard of care has become the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel. However, unanswered questions remain over the optimum schedule, duration, and intensity of treatment, and the benefit or otherwise of the addition of other drugs to carboplatin and paclitaxel. The roles of intraperitoneal therapy and consolidation treatment after first-line chemotherapy are as yet undefined.

### Adaptive dosing and platinum-DNA adduct formation in children receiving high-dose carboplatin for the treatment of solid tumours [^b26e5205]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Data from this multi-centre study show the feasibility of real-time monitoring of carboplatin pharmacokinetics with adaptive dosing and indicate that this approach is necessary for the attainment of consistent AUC values in individual patients receiving high-dose carboplatin treatment. This approach is now being used in clinical studies in the UK, with the aim of improving efficacy and minimising toxicity of carboplatin in similar high-dose protocols, and is likely to be relevant to the treatment of both childhood and adult cancer patients. The pharmacodynamic data presented here suggest that a strong correlation exists between the pharmacokinetics of carboplatin and the drug–target interaction.

### Risk factors of hypersensitivity reactions to carboplatin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b1798d01]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The development of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to carboplatin can interrupt anticancer treatment and may shorten patient survival. Several studies have evaluated the risk factors for carboplatin HSRs, but the results have been inconclusive.

Objective

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to establish a consensus on the risk factors of HSRs to carboplatin in patients with cancer.

Methods

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, relevant studies were searched across MEDLINE, Embase, and Korean Medical Database. Inclusion criteria focused on original articles of case-control or cohort studies that evaluated risk factors for carboplatin HSRs in patients with cancer. Exclusion criteria targeted articles with incomplete or overlapping data. The latest search and quality assessment of the included studies, using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, was performed on February 1, 2023.

Results

Among 1,182 articles identified, 19 studies were included in the final systematic review and meta-analysis. The identified risk factors for carboplatin hypersensitivity included a history of allergy to medicines, food, or environmental factors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.46–2.12), BRCA mutation (OR = 4.03; 95% CI, 2.00–8.13), carboplatin free interval of 12 months or more (OR = 4.93; 95% CI, 2.89–8.40), increased cumulative dose (standardized mean difference, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.41–0.75), relapse (OR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.58–3.25), and younger age (standardized mean difference, -0.15; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.03).

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this meta-analysis provides the first comprehensive quantitative evaluation of risk factors for carboplatin HSRs in patients with cancer. These findings can guide the development of personalized risk assessment tools and preventive strategies, potentially improving patient safety and treatment outcomes in carboplatin-based chemotherapy.

### Phase 1b safety study of farletuzumab, carboplatin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in patients with platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian cancer [^07545b5f]. Gynecologic Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

This Phase 1b study assessed the safety and tolerability of FAR plus carboplatin/PLD as a first step toward the pursuit of this triple-agent regimen in future studies of EOC. Use of PLD as a replacement for paclitaxel, specifically in the context of FAR, is also of interest, given observations of immunosuppressive effects for paclitaxel in an ovarian cell line (stemming from an observed interference with interleukin-2-mediated immune system activation), which could potentially interfere with the immune-mediated mechanism of actions of FAR; however, the clinical relevance of these preclinical findings is uncertain. Nonetheless, in view of increased use of carboplatin/PLD in the platinum-sensitive EOC population, additional investigation of this combination plus a third agent appears warranted. Formal assessment of efficacy was not feasible given the study limitation of sample size in this Phase 1 study. As supported by the favorable safety data described here, a randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study is planned (MORAb-003-011 [NCT02289950]) to assess the efficacy of FAR in combination with carboplatin/PLD or carboplatin/paclitaxel (per investigator choice) in patients with platinum-sensitive EOC (low CA-125 at ≤ 3× upper limit of normal) at first relapse, with PFS as the primary endpoint.

In conclusion, we found that when FAR was combined with carboplatin/PLD for the treatment of platinum-sensitive EOC, the safety profile was consistent with that of the doublet of carboplatin/PLD. Further evaluation of FAR/carboplatin/PLD is underway.

### Carboplatin nanocapsules: a highly cytotoxic, phospholipid-based formulation of carboplatin [^f66acae6]. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Platinum-based drugs are widely used in cancer chemotherapy. However, their clinical use is limited by systemic toxicity, rapid blood clearance, and the occurrence of resistance. Our research is aimed at increasing the therapeutic index of these drugs by encapsulation in a lipid formulation. Previously, we developed a method for efficient encapsulation of cisplatin in a lipid formulation, yielding cisplatin nanocapsules. Here, we show that carboplatin, a cisplatin-derived anticancer drug with different chemical properties, can be efficiently encapsulated in a lipid formulation by a similar method. The carboplatin nanocapsules exhibit a very high cytotoxicity in vitro: the IC(50) value of carboplatin nanocapsules is up to a 1,000-fold lower than that of conventional carboplatin when tested on a panel of carcinoma cell lines. Cellular platinum content analysis and confocal fluorescent imaging of the interaction of the carboplatin nanocapsules with IGROV-1 cells indicate that the improved cytotoxicity is due to increased platinum accumulation in the cells, resulting from uptake of the formulation by endocytosis.

### Deleterious BRCA1 / 2 mutation is an independent risk factor for carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions [^151d795c]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical mechanism of hypersensitivity to platinum is unknown, but it is thought to be secondary to an IgE-mediated type I hypersensitivity or type IV T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity, particularly in delayed reactions. Carboplatin may act as a hapten that binds to serum proteins to elicit an immunologic reaction. Patients may be sensitised to the protein–platinum adduct beginning with the first-line treatment, with immunologic restimulation during subsequent regimens. Based on these findings, skin testing has been examined as a possible predictor of a reaction, but has not been shown to always reliably predict carboplatin HSR. In addition to the platinum compounds bound to serum proteins, the DNA–platinum adduct itself may be immunogenic. Loss of normal BRCA function impairs homologous recombination required for error-free repair of DNA double-strand breaks that may occur secondary to torsion caused by or excision of interstrand platinum–DNA adducts. It has been reported that dysfunctional BRCA1 also disrupts nucleotide excision repair, the mechanism through which platinum adducts are repaired. Thus, impaired DNA repair may contribute to increase in the DNA–platinum adducts, subsequently augmenting exposure and possible HSRs to carboplatin.

We observed no loss of clinical benefit from therapy in our BRCA1/2 mut patients with a history carboplatin HSR before or on study. Frequently, patients who develop carboplatin HSR will have platinum therapy discontinued because of concerns of potential subsequent life-threatening anaphylaxis. Some patients may be challenged with a different platinum, such as cisplatin or oxaliplatin. Approaches incorporating pre-treatment with histamine blockers and corticosteroids, with a progressive slow-infusion, can successfully manage reactions to administer additional carboplatin therapy. Our study patients with a prior history of carboplatin HSR received methylprednisolone, ranitidine, and diphenhydramine, and followed a progressive slow-infusion protocol. With the application of this approach, 4 of the 15 patients who had a prior history of carboplatin HSR (27%) developed HSR on trial, 3 of whom were successfully re-challenged with a modified slow-infusion protocol and received additional carboplatin doses. Only 5 of 18 patients (28%) who reacted to carboplatin on trial discontinued carboplatin secondary to their HSR. This suggests that, with appropriate premedications and infusion strategies, most patients with a history of HSR can receive subsequent carboplatin infusions without further issues.

### Zoledronic acid improves muscle function in healthy mice treated with chemotherapy [^fad2756b]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug used to treat solid tumors but also causes bone loss and muscle atrophy and weakness. Bone loss contributes to muscle weakness through bone-muscle crosstalk, which is prevented with the bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZA). We treated mice with carboplatin in the presence or absence of ZA to assess the impact of bone resorption on muscle. Carboplatin caused loss of body weight, muscle mass, and bone mass, and also led to muscle weakness as early as 7days after treatment. Mice treated with carboplatin and ZA lost body weight and muscle mass but did not lose bone mass. In addition, muscle function in mice treated with ZA was similar to control animals. We also used the anti-TGFβ antibody (1D11) to prevent carboplatin-induced bone loss and showed similar results to ZA-treated mice. We found that atrogin-1 mRNA expression was increased in muscle from mice treated with carboplatin, which explained muscle atrophy. In mice treated with carboplatin for 1 or 3days, we did not observe any bone or muscle loss, or muscle weakness. In addition, reduced caloric intake in the carboplatin treated mice did not cause loss of bone or muscle mass, or muscle weakness. Our results show that blocking carboplatin-induced bone resorption is sufficient to prevent skeletal muscle weakness and suggests another benefit to bone therapy beyond bone in patients receiving chemotherapy. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Netrin-1 blockade inhibits tumour growth and EMT features in endometrial cancer [^6e04ae41]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Netrin-1 is upregulated in cancers as a protumoural mechanism 1. Here we describe netrin-1 upregulation in a majority of human endometrial carcinomas (ECs) and demonstrate that netrin-1 blockade, using an anti-netrin-1 antibody (NP137), is effective in reduction of tumour progression in an EC mouse model. We next examined the efficacy of NP137, as a first-in-class single agent, in a PhaseI trial comprising 14patients with advanced EC. As best response we observed 8 stable disease (8 out of 14, 57.1%) and 1 objective response as RECIST v.1.1 (partial response, 1 out of 14 (7.1%), 51.16% reduction in target lesions at 6weeks and up to 54.65% reduction during the following 6months). To evaluate the NP137 mechanism of action, mouse tumour gene profiling was performed, and we observed, in addition to cell death induction, that NP137 inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). By performing bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-seq on paired pre- and on-treatment biopsies from patients with EC from the NP137 trial, we noted a net reduction in tumour EMT. This was associated with changes in immune infiltrate and increased interactions between cancer cells and the tumour microenvironment. Given the importance of EMT in resistance to current standards of care 2, we show in the EC mouse model that a combination of NP137 with carboplatin-paclitaxel outperformed carboplatin-paclitaxel alone. Our results identify netrin-1 blockade as a clinical strategy triggering both tumour debulking and EMT inhibition, thus potentially alleviating resistance to standard treatments.

### Cisplatin versus carboplatin in combination with third-generation drugs for advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^136a0416]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

An estimated 220,000 new cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 160,000 deaths are expected to occur in the US in 2013, representing about 28% of cancer-related mortality. Approximately 75% of these people will have locally advanced or metastatic disease and will be treated in a palliative setting. Platinum-based combination chemotherapy has benefits in terms of survival and symptom control when compared with best supportive care.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of carboplatin-based chemotherapy when compared with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, both in combination with a third-generation drug, in people with advanced NSCLC. To compare quality of life in people with advanced NSCLC receiving chemotherapy with cisplatin and carboplatin combined with a third-generation drug.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1966 to 6 March 2013), EMBASE (via Ovid) (1974 to 6 March 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 2, 2013), and LILACS (1982 to 6 March 2013). In addition, we handsearched the proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology Meetings (January 1990 to March 2013), reference lists from relevant resources and the Clinical Trial.gov database.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing regimens with carboplatin or cisplatin combined with a third-generation drug in people with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. We accepted any regimen and number of cycles that included these drugs, since there is no widely accepted standard regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed search results and a third review author resolved any disagreements. We analysed the following endpoints: overall survival, one-year survival, quality of life, toxicity and response rate.

Main Results

We included 10 trials with 5017 people, 3973 of whom were available for meta-analysis. There was no difference between carboplatin-based and cisplatin-based chemotherapy in overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 1.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 1.97, I(2) = 0%) and one-year survival rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.98; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.09, I(2) = 24%). Cisplatin had higher response rates when we performed an overall analysis (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, I(2) = 3%), but trials using paclitaxel or gemcitabine plus a platin in both arms had equivalent response rates (paclitaxel: RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.07, I(2) = 0%; gemcitabine: RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.16, I(2) = 34%). Cisplatin caused more nausea or vomiting, or both (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.67, I(2) = 53%) and carboplatin caused more thrombocytopenia (RR 2.00; 95% CI 1.37 to 2.91, I(2) = 21%) and neurotoxicity (RR 1.55; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.27, I(2) = 0%). There was no difference in the incidence of grade III/IV anaemia (RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.43, I(2) = 20%), neutropenia (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.08, I(2) = 49%), alopecia (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.68, I(2) = 0%) or renal toxicity (RR 0.52; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.45, I(2) = 3%). Two trials performed a quality of life analysis; however, they used different methods of measurement so we could not perform a meta-analysis.

Authors' Conclusions

The initial treatment of people with advanced NSCLC is palliative, and carboplatin can be a treatment option. It has a similar effect on survival but a different toxicity profile when compared with cisplatin. Therefore, the choice of the platin compound should take into account the expected toxicity profile and the person's comorbidities. In addition, when used with either paclitaxel or gemcitabine, the drugs had an equivalent response rate.

### Deleterious BRCA1 / 2 mutation is an independent risk factor for carboplatin hypersensitivity reactions [^130ae450]. British Journal of Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Cisplatin and carboplatin, elemental platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents, are cornerstones of gynaecologic cancer treatment. Comparable efficacy and reduced renal and neurotoxicity have led to broad international use of carboplatin. Carboplatin, in combination with paclitaxel, is now the standard front-line treatment for ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas, following cytoreductive surgery or in neoadjuvant therapy; it also is being evaluated in intraperitoneal adjuvant treatment regimens. Carboplatin is the preferred agent in combination regimens for women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers. In addition, it is being examined in on-going clinical trial in combination with investigational agents targeting the tumour microenvironment, DNA damage and repair, and/or cell cycle-specific categories, such as angiogenesis inhibitors and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors.

Carboplatin is generally well tolerated despite its cumulative bone marrow toxicity. Reports of hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) to carboplatin have increased with the rise in its repetitive use in many cancer patients. Incidence of carboplatin HSR ranges from 8 to 16% and can be as high as 44% in the second- and third-line settings. Symptoms and signs of this allergic reaction include mild rash to diffuse erythroderma, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, tachycardia, chest tightness, bronchospasm, dyspnea, and at the severe end, cardiopulmonary collapse. Women who experience moderate-to-severe HSR, defined by lack of or limited improvement of symptoms with interruption of carboplatin infusion, often have platinum therapy discontinued. Many may not be re-challenged, despite potential clinical benefit and published regimens of premedication and gradual increased drug exposure. Thus, the development of reliable parameters with which to identify those at highest risk for HSR has become an important clinical need.

Deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations (BRCA1/2 mut) account for up to 17% of the tubo-ovarian cancer population. These patients have increased therapeutic susceptibility to platinums and thus often receive multiple lines of platinum-based chemotherapy. We hypothesised that this repetitive and potentially higher lifetime platinum exposure may put BRCA mutation carriers with tubo-ovarian cancer at higher risk for platinum HSR. We examined this hypothesis in our cohort of sporadic high-grade serous and BRCA1/2 mut -positive ovarian cancer patients who received the combination of carboplatin and olaparib, a PARP inhibitor.

### Optimizing primary chemotherapy in ovarian cancer [^67972ec3]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Primary chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer includes the administration of a platinum agent (carboplatin or cisplatin) and a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel). Most patients (60% to 80%) experience subjective and objective evidence of a favorable response, with prolonged disease-free and overall survival being noted in a substantial subset of this population. Future investigative efforts will focus on the incorporation of new and novel antineoplastic agents into standard treatment, with the important goals of improving biologic activity, enhancing overall quality of life, and extending survival.

### An apoptosis-enhancing drug overcomes platinum resistance in a tumour-initiating subpopulation of ovarian cancer [^81cc6056]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Findings here demonstrate that birinapant can sensitize subsets of HGSC to carboplatin, and response correlates with high levels of cIAP in the CA125-negative subpopulation. The mechanism accounting for the efficacy of this treatment is through re-enabling apoptosis in this therapy-resistant population.

In vivo co-therapy increased HGSC progression-free survival

To facilitate in vivo testing of birinapant and carboplatin co-therapy with sufficient power and further elucidate the birinapant mechanism of action, three low passage cell lines were developed from birinapant-sensitive chemo-naive primary HGSCs: S1-GODL (TP53 mutant/BRCA WT), S3-GODL (TP53 null/BRCA WT) and S5-GODL (TP53 null/BRCA2 mutant). Cell lines resemble their parent HGSCs based on CA125 distribution and cancer initiating potential, DNA profile and transcriptome analysis (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c). These cell lines were chosen as they contain different TP53 mutations and BRCA status. Similar to primary HGSCs, in vitro therapy of these cells lines with carboplatin eliminated CA125-positive but not -negative cells, while addition of birinapant to carboplatin eliminated all tumour subpopulations (Supplementary Fig. 7a and Supplementary Data 2, n = 3 replicates). This therapeutic effect is likely cIAP specific as knockdown of cIAP1 and cIAP2 together was sufficient to sensitize all CA125-negative cells to carboplatin even in the absence of birinapant (Supplementary Fig. 7b and Supplementary Data 2, n = 3 replicates). Findings here suggest that degradation of both cIAP1 and cIAP2 by birinapant may be the main mechanism by which birinapant sensitizes the CA125-negative HGSC to carboplatin therapy.

### Factors for hematopoietic toxicity of carboplatin: refining the targeting of carboplatin systemic exposure [^0d4008b5]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

Area under the curve (AUC) dosing is routinely carried out for carboplatin, but the chosen target AUC values remain largely empirical. This multicenter pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) study was performed to determine the covariates involved in the interindividual variability of carboplatin hematotoxicity that should be considered when choosing individual target AUCs.

Patients and Methods

Three hundred eighty-three patients received carboplatin as part of established regimens. A semi-physiologic population PK-PD model was applied to describe separately the time course of absolute neutrophil and platelet counts using NONMEM software. The plasma ultrafiltrable carboplatin concentration (C(Carbo)) was assumed to inhibit the proliferation of blood cell precursors through a linear model: drug effect = slope × C(Carbo). The slope corresponds to the patients' sensitivity to carboplatin hematotoxicity. The relationships between the patients' sensitivity to the neutropenic or thrombopenic effects of carboplatin and various covariates, including associated chemotherapies, demographic, biologic, and pharmacogenetic data, were studied.

Results

The sensitivity of carboplatin-induced thrombocytopenia decreased in the case of concomitant paclitaxel chemotherapy (slope decreased by 24%), whereas it increased with coadministration of etoposide and gemcitabine (slope increased by 45% and 133%, respectively). For neutropenia, the sensitivity increased when carboplatin was combined with other cytotoxics (slope increased by 76%).

Conclusion

This study provides useful information to clinicians to better estimate the hematopoietic toxicity of carboplatin and thus choose more rationally carboplatin target AUCs as a function of pretreatment or concomitantly administered chemotherapies. For example, an AUC of 5 mg/mL · min is associated with a risk of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia of 2% in combination with paclitaxel versus 38% with gemcitabine in a non-pretreated patient.

### A phase II feasibility study of carboplatin followed by sequential weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine as first-line treatment for ovarian cancer [^65b11f43]. British Journal of Cancer (2004). Low credibility.

The majority of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer will require chemotherapy. It is now well established that first-line treatment should include a platinum compound, with carboplatin being the drug of choice, having been shown to have equivalent efficacy but less toxicity than cisplatin. Two large randomised studies in the 1990s of first-line therapy for ovarian cancer showed a survival benefit when a paclitaxel–platinum combination was compared with the previous standard of cyclophosphamide–cisplatin; therefore, the combination of platinum and paclitaxel became standard first-line therapy. Two other large randomised trials conducted by the International Collaborative Ovarian Neoplasm (ICON) group and the Gynaecologic Oncology Group (GOG) failed to confirm the benefit of the addition of paclitaxel to platinum. The reasons are unclear, but a negative interaction between the two drugs is not excluded. It is interesting to note that taxanes, when given in short infusions, clearly reduce the thrombocytopenia expected from carboplatin; again the mechanism is not understood. A number of patients in the non-taxane-containing arms of the ICON and GOG trials crossed over to receive paclitaxel at disease progression, and since results were equivalent this suggests that there may be no disadvantage to giving platinum and taxanes sequentially rather than concurrently. The ICON group has recently shown a benefit when paclitaxel was added to platinum in patients with potentially platinum-sensitive relapsed disease.

Despite the benefits observed in the above trials, however, the majority of women in these studies eventually died from their disease, thus underscoring the importance of designing trials to improve the results achieved with the combination of paclitaxel and platinum. One approach is to add other potentially non-cross-resistant agents and drugs that are being evaluated in this setting include topotecan, liposomal doxorubicin, and gemcitabine.

Gemcitabine, a pyrimidine analogue, is active in untreated and pretreated ovarian cancer. In a small study of chemonaive patients, single-agent gemcitabine produced a modest overall response rate of 18%. In patients with platinum-pretreated, relapsed ovarian cancer, response rates ranged from 13 to 28%, which are comparable with those of other agents (e.g. topotecan, liposomal doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) in a similar patient population. Gemcitabine is generally well tolerated with common toxicities including myelosuppression, lethargy, flu-like symptoms, peripheral oedema, and skin rashes. An unexplained rare severe pulmonary toxicity has been reported, particularly in patients with lung cancer who have received prior mediastinal radiotherapy.

### Platinum-based chemotherapy for early triple-negative breast cancer [^88004af6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Description of the intervention

Standard chemotherapy used in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting for TNBC involves anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy, combined with cyclophosphamide. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy is to treat micrometastatic systemic disease, which is not detectable by standard blood tests and imaging. Chemotherapy is indicated for most women with TNBC who are in good health. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines recommend offering chemotherapy to women with TNBC whose cancer size is larger than 1 cm, or any size with involvement of their lymph nodes. Chemotherapy may also be considered for women with smaller tumours.

The intervention being studied is platinum‐based chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) alone or in addition to the standard adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, to determine whether this improves survival from early TNBC. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and disease‐free survival (DFS). Achieving a pathological complete response (pCR) has strong prognostic value, particularly in the TNBC subtype (Cortazar 2014). Because of the assumed association between survival and pCR, many trials assess pCR while either waiting for data to mature or as their primary endpoint before deciding whether larger trials are feasible. Consequently, we reported pCR, along with OS and DFS.

How the intervention might work

Platinum agents damage DNA by causing single‐strand DNA breaks, resulting in apoptosis. DNA repair deficiencies are associated with germline or somatic mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2, which are frequently associated with TNBC. This is a proposed mechanism for the increased efficacy of the DNA‐damaging effects of platinum chemotherapy for TNBC. With genomic profiling, women identified as having basal‐type TNBC are also seen to have DNA‐repair deficiency (Guo 2017). Besides breast cancer, an enhanced response to platinum‐based chemotherapy is seen in women with BRCA mutations who have ovarian cancer (Pennington 2014), and BRCA ‐associated pancreatic cancer (O'Reilly 2020). Poly(adenosine diphosphate‐ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown efficacy for women with advanced BRCA breast cancer, although this treatment has not been compared to their response to platinum.

Potential adverse effects of platinum include an increase in myelosuppression, which can lead to dose omissions, interruptions or dose reduction of platinum chemotherapies, other chemotherapy drugs, or both. There are risks of additional toxicity from myelosuppression, with febrile neutropenia, anaemia or bleeding due to thrombocytopenia. Long‐term toxicities from platinum chemotherapy can include peripheral neuropathy, ototoxicity and renal impairment.

Oxaliplatin — general features and major symptoms include that oxaliplatin is a third-generation platinum-based chemotherapeutic agent most commonly used to treat metastatic colon cancer in combination with leucovorin and fluorouracil (FOLFOX regimen); with successive exposures, most patients develop reactions after the sixth treatment cycle, with the incidence being as high as 20%, comparable to that of carboplatin (incidence 27% after the sixth dose); symptoms are typical of a mast cell–mediated process with common symptoms including flushing, pruritus, urticaria, and back pain, while cardiovascular and respiratory anaphylaxis is less common, and less common reactions featuring fever and chills/rigors occur with IL-6 and TNF-α levels often elevated acutely, described as "idiosyncratic" or "cytokine storm–like".

Fig. 1
Mechanisms of immediate HSRs to platins and taxanes. Phenotypes of platin HSRs include type I reactions, cytokine release reactions, and mixed reactions, with the most heterogeneity seen with oxaliplatin (A). Taxanes may cause mast cell and/or basophil activation through IgE-mediated mechanisms, direct action on basophils, or IgG-mediated mechanisms that cause complement activation and release of anaphylatoxins (C3a, C5a) (A, B). Solvents for taxanes, such as Cremophor EL (paclitaxel) and polysorbate 80 (docetaxel), may also activate mast cells through an IgE-mediated mechanism or direct complement activation. Biomarkers include tryptase, histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins in type I reactions and IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1ß in cytokine release or mixed reactions (A, B). Desensitization is indicated for type I reactions and selected cases of cytokine release and mixed reactions, but not in direct mast cell/basophil activation (A).

Taxanes

Taxane agents are used in the treatment of breast, gynecologic, prostate, head and neck, and lung cancers, and include paclitaxel, docetaxel, nab-paclitaxel, and cabazitaxel (Table 1). Paclitaxel (Taxol) was originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, while docetaxel (Taxotere) was made from a semisynthetic process.

Similar to carboplatin, the incidence of HSR to paclitaxel has been best studied in gynecologic cancer. Initial studies found rates of immediate HSRs of up to 50% with paclitaxel and docetaxel infusions, resulting in the routine use of antihistamine and steroid premedication. Incidence rates, indications, and clinical presentations of immediate HSRs for taxanes are presented in Table 1. Immediate HSRs to paclitaxel and docetaxel occur in approximately 10% of patients despite premedication and are severe in 1%. They commonly occur within minutes during the first or second lifetime exposure, with symptoms such as flushing, dyspnea, throat tightness, hypotension, as well as more atypical symptoms like chest or back pain. Delayed rashes have also been reported hours to weeks after infusion. Severe reactions such as SJS/TEN, acute interstitial pneumonitis, and subacute cutaneous lupus erythematous have been described in case reports with paclitaxel, docetaxel, and nab-paclitaxel.

### Docetaxel: an alternative taxane in ovarian cancer [^c48912ca]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Overview of docetaxel–carboplatin trials

There is now a large body of evidence to suggest that in patients with ovarian cancer, carboplatin provides comparable antitumour activity to cisplatin, but with significantly less toxicity when given as monotherapy or in combination with other agents. The addition of carboplatin to a taxane regimen was expected to result in less emesis and neurotoxicity than cisplatin–taxane therapy, although concerns were expressed that the combined myelotoxicity of carboplatin and a taxane might result in significant myelosuppression, necessitating dose reduction. However, experience with paclitaxel–carboplatin has shown that the two agents can be given safely without reduction in the dosage of either component. Indeed, it appears that carboplatin-associated thrombocytopenia is reduced by co-administration of paclitaxel — an effect thought to occur at the level of the megakaryocyte rather than by a general pharmacokinetic interaction. Given these promising results, a series of Phase I/II trials have been conducted to assess docetaxel–carboplatin regimens in this setting, and Phase III trials are underway.

### Oxaliplatin-associated hypersensitivity reactions: clinical presentation and management [^f5fba1b6]. Clinical Colorectal Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions to cisplatin and carboplatin have been reported in the literature to occur at a rate of 10%-27%. Initial reports of hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin were low; however, more recently, it appears as if the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin is similar to that of the earlier generation platinum agents. The degree of the reaction varies from mild flushing to life-threatening anaphylactic responses. After a mild hypersensitivity reaction to oxaliplatin, re-exposing a patient can be considered after administering immunosuppressants (eg, high-dose corticosteroids and histamine antagonists) and/or prolonging the duration of oxaliplatin infusion. In the case of moderate-to-severe reactions to oxaliplatin, re-exposure is usually not considered, and alternative forms of therapy should be explored. However, there are reports of successful desensitization to oxaliplatin, and therefore, re-exposing a patient can be considered after carefully weighing the risks and benefits of additional oxaliplatin therapy.

### Skin testing in the evaluation and management of carboplatin-related hypersensitivity reactions [^0d2a1c48]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Carboplatin-induced hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) are a frequent occurrence in patients being retreated for malignancy. The most common and severe reactions are thought to be IgE mediated. Currently, skin testing is the only method used clinically to identify individuals sensitized to carboplatin. Despite almost 20 years of clinical use, a standardized approach to skin testing and its use in the management of carboplatin HSRs has not been well established. We review the utility of carboplatin skin testing and discuss factors that influence the interpretation of skin testing results. A risk stratification strategy using skin testing and desensitization to manage patients with carboplatin HSRs is proposed.

### Docetaxel: an alternative taxane in ovarian cancer [^c7ed3540]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent chemotherapeutic agents that block tubulin depolymerisation, leading to the inhibition of microtubule dynamics and cell cycle arrest. Although docetaxel and paclitaxel share a mutual tubulin binding site, mechanistic and pharmacological differences exist between these agents. For example, docetaxel has increased potency and an improved therapeutic index compared with paclitaxel, and its short 1-h infusion offers a substantial clinical advantage over the prolonged infusion durations required with paclitaxel. In clinical studies, docetaxel monotherapy demonstrated good response rates and an acceptable toxicity profile in both paclitaxel- and platinum-refractory ovarian cancer patients. In particular, neurotoxicity — a dominant side effect with both paclitaxel and cisplatin — occurs at a low incidence with docetaxel, making docetaxel a promising agent for combining cisplatin and other platinum compounds. In Phase II studies, the combination of docetaxel with either cisplatin or carboplatin has yielded impressive response rates of 69–74 and 81–87%, respectively. Furthermore, Phase III data suggest that docetaxel–carboplatin and paclitaxel–carboplatin are similarly efficacious with respect to progression-free survival and clinical response, although neurotoxicity occurs more frequently with the paclitaxel regimen. While paclitaxel–carboplatin remains the standard treatment for the management of advanced ovarian cancer, docetaxel–carboplatin appears to be a promising alternative, particularly in terms of minimising the incidence and severity of peripheral neuropathy.

### Chemotherapy for prostate cancer [^5d083b78]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Androgen deprivation therapy remains the mainstay of therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer and for selected patients with localized prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy is the model of target-based therapies in this disease. Although it is clear that other target-based therapies need to be developed, cytotoxic chemotherapy is emerging as an effective form of treatment for men with prostate cancer. The early studies combining mitoxantrone plus a corticosteroid demonstrated that chemotherapy could be given to men with symptomatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer with minimal toxicity, and significant palliation could be provided. Since then, it has been recognized that estramustine, when combined with a variety of microtubular inhibitors, is very active in hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Doublets combining estramustine plus a taxane seem to be the most active. Although it appears that estramustine may add some activity to taxanes, the mechanism of its activity is uncertain, and its overall value is similarly questioned, particularly in light of its significant toxicity. Regimens that omit estramustine are being explored (ie, either taxane alone or taxane plus biologic agents). In addition, triplet therapy (combining estramustine plus a taxane plus a third drug, such as carboplatin or etoposide) is being explored. Finally, the utility of chemotherapy is beginning to be explored in the context of earlier disease in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or serologically relapsing group of patients. Data from these studies are just beginning to be gathered.

### First-into-man phase I and pharmacokinetic study of XR5944.14, a novel agent with a unique mechanism of action [^184dbc8f]. British Journal of Cancer (2007). Low credibility.

Molecularly targeted therapies offer much hope for selected tumours. However, cytotoxic compounds are still the mainstay of systemic therapy for most malignancies. There remains a need for agents with novel mechanisms of action which offer a broad spectrum of antitumour activity and an improved safety profile compared with existing anticancer agents.

The bis-phenazine XR5944.14 (MLN 944) is a novel cytotoxic agent (Figure 1). Initially, it was thought to interfere with the normal function of topoisomerase I and II. Recent studies, however, have indicated that the agent intercalates into DNA and inhibits transcription, but has no effect on the catalytic activity of either topoisomerase I or II. XR5944.14 induces a G(1) and G(2) cell cycle arrest. Agents with this mechanism of action offer great promise because of their activity against a broad spectrum of tumour types.

The efficacy of XR5944.14 is not schedule-dependent, since the drug is able to kill tumour cells following only a brief exposure. In studies using murine and human tumour cell lines or xenograft models, XR5944.14 was exceptionally potent, showing several-fold greater activity than many common cytotoxic agents such as doxorubicin, camptothecin, topotecan or paclitaxel and synergy with carboplatin or doxorubicin. In nude mice bearing xenografts of human H69/P SCLC, both partial and complete regression of large established tumours were seen. Complete tumour regression was seen at well-tolerated doses of XR5944. XR5944 even delayed tumour growth in the HT29 human colon carcinoma, which is relatively refractory to cytotoxic chemotherapy.

Preclinical studies in mice and rats showed that XR5944.14 produced bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal epithelial damage. These effects were reversible and recovery was such that the drug could be given on a 3-weekly cycle. In dogs, prolongation of the QT-interval, acute urticaria and wheezing were seen, but this species is particularly sensitive to agents with the potential to cause histamine release.

### The 'other' big complication: how chronic kidney disease impacts on cancer risks and outcomes [^2614597d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Cancer treatments may cause kidney disease

The original platinum-based chemotherapy drug, cisplatin, was introduced in the 1970s and was a highly effective treatment against several solid organ malignancies including testicular, ovarian, lung, cervical and bladder cancers. However, it is renally excreted and highly nephrotoxic, causing a decrease in glomerular filtration (in a dose-dependent manner) within hours of administration. Intravenous hydration can mitigate the risk of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and is now considered an essential co-treatment, but cisplatin is routinely avoided in patients with pre-existing CKD (stages G3–G5). By comparison, carboplatin exhibits very low nephrotoxicity and may be selected as an alternative treatment in people with moderate CKD.

Many antimetabolites, used in the treatment of varied cancers, are at least partly renally excreted. At higher doses, methotrexate may be associated with intra-tubular precipitation, resulting in acute kidney injury and GFR decline. Dose reductions are generally advised in those with pre-existing CKD G3–G5 or those on dialysis. Small studies suggest that there may be a similar, dose-dependent nephrotoxicity associated with pemetrexed therapy (used in the treatment of lung cancer), particularly when patients received a prolonged course of treatment of 10 cycles or more.

The alkylating agent ifosfamide is substantially more nephrotoxic than its cousin, cyclophosphamide, although the evidence for this mostly comes from the paediatric literature. Ifosfamide typically causes tubular dysfunction, or in some cases may result in a (usually mild) reduction in GFR, although the long-term effects are uncertain. The risk of renal side effects increases with higher doses and cumulative exposure, co-administration with cisplatin and in patients with pre-existing kidney disease.

More recent advances in treatment have been enabled by a better understanding of cancer biology and its immune microenvironment, leading to novel immune-based therapies with remarkable improvements in patient outcomes. The use of these new immune agents continues to grow, with use in increasingly early stages of disease. Accordingly, we will continue to witness a shift from traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents to targeted therapies and immunotherapies. With this changing cancer therapy environment, the spectrum of adverse side effects will continue to diversify. This may be the case especially when these new anti-cancer agents are used in combination with conventional chemotherapies.

Cisplatin versus carboplatin in SCLC — Randomized trials and retrospective analysis of patients with SCLC suggest similar efficacy between cisplatin and carboplatin regimens. In a meta-analysis of 663 patients with limited-stage SCLC (32%) and extensive-stage SCLC (68%), no significant difference was observed in response rate (67% vs. 66%), progression-free survival (PFS) (5.5 vs. 5.3 months), or OS (9.6 vs. 9.4 months) between cisplatin- versus carboplatin-containing regimens. Carboplatin is frequently substituted for cisplatin to reduce the risk of emesis, neuropathy, and nephropathy, but the use of carboplatin carries a greater risk of myelosuppression.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

NOTE: Aluminum reacts with carboplatin causing precipitate formation and loss of potency, therefore, needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum parts that may come in contact with the drug must not be used for the preparation or administration of carboplatin injection.

Single Agent Therapy

Carboplatin injection, as a single agent, has been shown to be effective in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma at a dosage of 360 mg/m2intravenously on day 1 every 4 weeks (alternatively see Formula Dosing). In general, however, single intermittent courses of carboplatin should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 2,000 and the platelet count is at least 100,000.

Combination Therapy with Cyclophosphamide

In the chemotherapy of advanced ovarian cancer, an effective combination for previously untreated patients consists of:

Carboplatin - 300 mg/m2intravenously on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles (alternatively see Formula Dosing).

Cyclophosphamide - 600 mg/m2intravenously on day 1 every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. For directions regarding the use and administration of cyclophosphamide please refer to its package insert (see CLINICAL STUDIES).

Intermittent courses of carboplatin in combination with cyclophosphamide should not be repeated until the neutrophil count is at least 2,000 and the platelet count is at least 100,000.

Dose Adjustment Recommendations

Pretreatment platelet count and performance status are important prognostic factors for severity of myelosuppression in previously treated patients.

The suggested dose adjustments for single agent or combination therapy shown in the table below are modified from controlled trials in previously treated and untreated patients with ovarian carcinoma. Blood counts were done weekly, and the recommendations are based on the lowest post-treatment platelet or neutrophil value.

Carboplatin injection is usually administered by an infusion lasting 15 minutes or longer. No pre- or post-treatment hydration or forced diuresis is required.

Patients with Impaired Kidney Function

Patients with creatinine clearance values below 60 mL/min are at increased risk of severe bone marrow suppression. In renally-impaired patients who received single agent carboplatin therapy, the incidence of severe leukopenia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia has been about 25% when the dosage modifications in the table below have been used.

The data available for patients with severely impaired kidney function (creatinine clearance below 15 mL/min) are too limited to permit a recommendation for treatment.

These dosing recommendations apply to the initial course of treatment. Subsequent dosages should be adjusted according to the patient's tolerance based on the degree of bone marrow suppression.

### Supportive therapies in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced febrile neutropenia and appropriate use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors: a Delphi consensus statement [^f3c57725]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical impact of FN on patient management (when it affects treatment choices)

The consensus was achieved for five of the eight statements on the clinical impact of FN on patient management (Table 1). It was agreed that the severity of neutropenia was dependent on the intensity of chemotherapy (item 1) and that the chemotherapy regimen should be based on the patient's clinical characteristics and treatment goals after the evaluation of the risk of FN to ensure appropriate treatment (items 2 and 5).

Neutropenia is a dose-limiting side effect of chemotherapy and there is adequate evidence that the severity of neutropenia is dependent on the intensity of the chemotherapy regimen (defined by the type, dose, and number of myelosuppressive cytotoxic agents in a chemotherapy regimen). A highly intensive chemotherapy regimen is expected to cause more severe myelosuppression, resulting in a higher incidence of FN.

Chemotherapy dose and schedule are important clinical variables that can impact patient outcomes, but myelosuppression (mostly FN) drives chemotherapy dose reduction and dose delays. For example, grade 4 neutropenia can result in a 5- to 7-day delay in the next chemotherapy cycle. The incidence of grade 4 neutropenia, or FN, in patients with endometrial cancer was found to be significantly higher with six cycles of chemotherapy compared with four cycles, indicating that patients are likely to benefit from lower haematological toxicity with a shorter duration of chemotherapy. Moreover, patients who develop grade 3 or 4 neutropenia during chemotherapy are at increased risk for developing infections and sepsis, which may lead to dose interruptions or dose reductions and may compromise treatment efficacy.

Quantification of the risk associated with patient-related factors and neutropenic events is essential for clinical decision-making as it leads to better clinical outcomes, fewer complications, and closer adherence to treatment protocols. It also prevents patients from being inadequately or unnecessarily treated. Current guidelines suggest assessing FN risk at the start of each chemotherapy cycle in order to prevent or better manage the condition if it arises. A physiological model of granulopoiesis and its regulation has been used to predict ANC time profiles and incidences of neutropenia for chemotherapeutic agents like paclitaxel, carboplatin, gemcitabine, and doxorubicin by incorporating their mechanisms of action. This model can successfully predict individual patient ANC time profiles, which in most patient is a nadir between days 7–14 after the first dose and recovery to grade 2 neutropenia level at the end of cycle one, and could be useful for selecting appropriate therapeutic as well as support strategies for each patient.

### Optimal treatment of early-stage ovarian cancer [^101c203f]. Annals of Oncology (2014). Low credibility.

discussion

These updated data from ICON1 confirm the long-term RFS and OS benefit from adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy in women with early-stage OC. Results are consistent with previous trials and a meta-analysis. The magnitude of benefit appears greatest in women with high-risk disease, which indicates that chemotherapy should be standard of care in these patients. A small benefit in women with lower risk disease cannot be excluded, and chemotherapy should be discussed, considering individual patient and disease characteristics including cyst rupture, age and histological subtype.

The choice of the optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimen and the duration of treatment in early-stage OC is a subject of continuing debate. There were no treatment-related deaths in ICON1, but cytotoxic chemotherapy can have potentially serious and/or long-term complications, which are increased when taxanes are added to platinum-based therapy. In clinical practice, both carboplatin and carboplatin/paclitaxel are used in this setting, although there is no clear evidence base to support the use of combination therapy. Single-agent carboplatin was the chemotherapy most frequently used in ICON1 and ACTION and thus was the treatment recommended in first reports of these trials. The retrospective analyses comparing carboplatin with carboplatin/paclitaxel using the 120 stage 1 patients in the ICON3 trial lead to wide CIs in the estimates of treatment difference. Some will argue that the HR of 0.71 for PFS, despite the wide CIs, supports the use of carboplatin/paclitaxel, whereas others will argue that the HR of 0.98 for OS and increased toxicities with doublet therapies supports the use of single-agent carboplatin. However, in the absence of any prospective comparative randomised trials in this setting, with observed estimated HR of 0.98 in OS, we support the use of less toxic single-agent carboplatin. Further evidence for carboplatin alone comes from a small retrospective study which demonstrated no evidence of a difference in OS between carboplatin and carboplatin/paclitaxel. There was also no evidence from the trials identified in the systematic review supporting treatment intensification (Table 2).

WARNINGS

Bone marrow suppression (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia) is dose-dependent and is also the dose-limiting toxicity. Peripheral blood counts should be frequently monitored during carboplatin injection treatment and, when appropriate, until recovery is achieved. Median nadir occurs at day 21 in patients receiving single agent carboplatin. In general, single intermittent courses of carboplatin should not be repeated until leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts have recovered.

Since anemia is cumulative, transfusions may be needed during treatment with carboplatin, particularly in patients receiving prolonged therapy.

Bone marrow suppression is increased in patients who have received prior therapy, especially regimens including cisplatin. Marrow suppression is also increased in patients with impaired kidney function. Initial carboplatin injection dosages in these patients should be appropriately reduced (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION) and blood counts should be carefully monitored between courses. The use of carboplatin in combination with other bone marrow suppressing therapies must be carefully managed with respect to dosage and timing in order to minimize additive effects.

Carboplatin has limited nephrotoxic potential, but concomitant treatment with aminoglycosides has resulted in increased renal and/or audiologic toxicity, and caution must be exercised when a patient receives both drugs. Clinically significant hearing loss has been reported to occur in pediatric patients when carboplatin was administered at higher than recommended doses in combination with other ototoxic agents.

### Generation of evidence-based carboplatin dosing guidelines for neonates and infants [^309b53f2]. British Journal of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

To optimally dose childhood cancer patients it is essential that we apply evidence-based dosing approaches. Carboplatin is commonly dosed to achieve a cumulative target exposure (AUC) in children, with target AUC values of 5.2–7.8 mg/ml.min defined. To achieve these exposures patients are dosed at 6.6 mg/kg/day or 4.4 mg/kg for patients < 5 kg. The current study uses real world clinical pharmacology data to optimise body weight-based doses to effectively target AUCs of 5.2–7.8 mg/ml.min in infants.

Methods

Carboplatin exposures were determined across 165 treatment cycles in 82 patients ≤ 10 kg. AUC and clearance values were determined by Bayesian modelling from samples collected on day 1. These parameters were utilised to assess current dosing variability, determine doses required to achieve target AUC values and predict change in AUC using the modified dose.

Results

No significant differences in clearance were identified between patients < 5 kg and 5–10 kg. Consequently, for patients < 5 kg, 4.4 mg/kg dosing was not sufficient to achieve a target AUC of 5.2 mg/ml.min, with < 55% of patients within 25% of this target. Optimised daily doses for patients ≤ 10 kg were 6 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg for cumulative carboplatin target exposures of 5.2 and 7.8 mg/ml.min, respectively.

Conclusions

Adoption of these evidence-based carboplatin doses in neonates and infants will reduce drug exposure variability and positively impact treatment.

### Advanced ovarian cancer: a clinical update on first-line treatment, recurrent disease, and new agents [^ffad2246]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2004). Low credibility.

Platinum-based therapy plays an integral role in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer as well as in the recurrent disease setting. In advanced disease, the standard of care in the United States is maximal surgical cytoreduction followed by paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy. Results from the Gynecologic Oncology Group COG 158 trial show that paclitaxel/carboplatin is at least as effective as paclitaxel/cisplatin and is better tolerated and easier to administer. Three randomized phase III trials suggest that intraperitoneal chemotherapy may provide superior progression-free or overall survival relative to systemic chemotherapy, but at the price of increased toxicity. Results from COG 178 showed that prolonged maintenance paclitaxel therapy improved progression-free survival of patients with clinical complete responses to first-line chemotherapy. The ongoing COG 182 protocol for advanced ovarian cancer is comparing 8 cycles of paclitaxel/carboplatin with 4 experimental combinations incorporating topotecan, gemcitabine, or encapsulated doxorubicin. Currently, no randomized GOG trial evaluates maintenance or intraperitoneal therapy for advanced disease. With recurrent disease, a treatment-free interval of more than 6 months is an important predictor of platinum sensitivity. In this setting, carboplatin has been the cornerstone of treatment. Recent results from the International Collaborative Ovarian Neoplasm ICON 4 trial indicate that paclitaxel/carboplatin may offer superior efficacy to single-agent carboplatin. Additional randomized comparisons of carboplatin versus other carboplatin combinations are in progress. Finally, a variety of new cytotoxic and biologic agents are being evaluated in recurrent disease, either as single agents or in combination with standard chemotherapy.

Platinum complexes: cisplatin to BBR3464 –Hilary Calvert and Eve Wiltshaw

The platinum complexes cisplatin (XXII) and carboplatin (XXIII) are among the most successful anticancer agents developed. Their curative activity is seen in testicular teratoma and certain paediatric solid tumours, as well as significant effects against a broad spectrum of more common malignancies, notably ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, and small cell and nonsmall cell lung cancer. Tom Connors was among the first to study the activity of platinum complexes in preclinical tumour models. Sir Alexander Haddow, recognising the potential importance of this new class of drugs, encouraged the initiation of clinical trials with cisplatin at the Royal Marsden Hospital in 1972 by Eve Wiltshaw. These early clinical trials identified activity in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer although the toxicities were also severe–profuse nausea and vomiting, and renal failure. The advent of 5-hydroxytrypamine receptor type 3 antagonists and the use of hydration/diuresis has largely controlled these side effects, respectively. However, an alternative approach was initiated by Tom Connors and Ken Harrap which resulted in the identification of carboplatin as an equiactive yet non-nephrotoxic platinum complex. The first Phase I trial of carboplatin was completed in 1981 and this identified dose-limiting haematological toxicity, as well as early signs of activity, but failed to detect any significant renal side effects. The most important difference between cisplatin and carboplatin is the 30-fold reduced reactivity, which allows renal excretion without renal damage, as well as reduced emesis and neurotoxicity. However, whereas carboplatin produces no significant nephrotoxicity, renal function does have a marked effect on the haematological toxicity of the drug. Subsequent pharmacokinetic studies led to the development of renal function-based carboplatin dosing using the 'Calvert' formula. Using this formula, the absolute dose (in mg) required for each patient is calculated from the desired target area under the free carboplatin plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC–mg mL –1 min) and the patient's absolute glomerular filtration rate (GFR–ml min –1, preferably measured by an isotopic method and not from serum creatinine alone):

### First-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer: paclitaxel, platinum and the evidence [^46ef34e8]. British Journal of Cancer (2002). Low credibility.

BACKGROUND

In many countries the combination of carboplatin plus paclitaxel has become a standard first-line therapy for women requiring chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Recently, however, evidence has emerged questioning this approach. A systematic review by the NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination in York, commissioned by the NHS R&D Health Technology Assessment Programme (HTA) on behalf of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), reviewed four trials that compared standard platinum-based treatment against the combination of platinum and paclitaxel. At the time of this review three of the four trials remained unpublished. These trials have now all been published in full. In this study we examine the most recent published results of the trials identified by this review. Full details of the search strategy, methods and results of the original review are contained in the assessment report produced for NICE, which is published in monograph form by the HTA Programme (National Institute of Clinical Excellence, URL http://www.nice.org.uk/).

Although there are a number of differences between these trials, they all posed the same general question (Table 1

Table 1
Trials comparing paclitaxel/platinum combinations with a platinum-based control treatment). The first of these trials was GOG-111, conducted by the Gynecology Oncology Group (GOG) in the United States. This was first presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 1993 and published in full in 1996. In GOG-111 410 patients were randomised and the trial reported very positive results in favour of paclitaxel/cisplatin compared with cyclophosphamide/cisplatin with hazard ratio of 0.61 (95%CI 0.47–0.79) for overall survival. These results were later confirmed by a European-Canadian Intergroup trial (OV10), which randomised 680 patients between the same two treatments and reported preliminary results at ASCO in 1997 and was published in May 2000. However, these results were contradicted by a further GOG trial, GOG-132, comparing single agent cisplatin against the same paclitaxel/cisplatin combination used in GOG-111, with 424 patients randomised between these two arms (648 randomised in total between three arms, with the third arm being single agent paclitaxel). The results of GOG-132, also presented at ASCO in 1997 and published in January 2000, were very different, suggesting no benefit to the paclitaxel/cisplatin regimen.
