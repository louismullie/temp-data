## Question

How long should a utility requiring hospitalization be treated

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how long a "utility requiring hospitalization" should be treated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "utility" likely means in this context and whether it refers to a urinary tract infection that necessitates hospitalization. Then, I should verify the clinical scenario categories that change duration decisions, such as complicated UTI, pyelonephritis, catheter-associated UTI, and bacteremia. Next, I will review contemporary guideline recommendations and key trials to anchor durations. After that, I should consider special populations like pediatrics and immunocompromised hosts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned approach and state the bottom line with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "utility" is not a standard medical term here. Wait, let me verify the context clues: the references repeatedly discuss complicated urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, and catheter-associated UTI, all of which commonly require hospitalization, so the question almost certainly refers to a UTI requiring inpatient care rather than some other "utility" concept, and I will proceed on that assumption while noting I should correct the wording explicitly to "UTI requiring hospitalization" for clarity [^fc1d9dae] [^e8b20eae].

> Next, I should review the major clinical buckets that drive duration decisions, because duration is not one-size-fits-all. I need to ensure I separate complicated UTI including acute pyelonephritis, catheter-associated UTI, and UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia, since these categories have somewhat different evidence bases and guideline nuances even though the modern trend is toward shorter effective courses when patients are improving clinically [^fc1d9dae] [^d447f8a1] [^dd9942a8].

> For complicated UTI and acute pyelonephritis in hospitalized patients who are clinically improving on effective therapy, I should confirm the current IDSA stance. The 2025 IDSA guidance recommends shorter courses: 5–7 days with a fluoroquinolone or 7 days with a non-fluoroquinolone agent, rather than 10–14 days, and this applies when the patient is improving and the agent achieves adequate levels in urine and tissue. Importantly, the duration is counted from the first day of effective therapy, and longer courses may be needed in selected subgroups such as suspected prostatitis or slow response, so I need to keep those exceptions in mind [^fc1d9dae] [^8615b459] [^036eb922].

> Hold on, I should verify the evidence supporting 7 days even when bacteremia is present, because older practice favored 14 days. The 2025 IDSA guidance specifically suggests 7 days for complicated UTI with Gram-negative bacteremia when the patient is improving clinically on effective therapy, and an individual participant data meta-analysis of RCTs found no difference in 90-day mortality, relapse, or complications between 7 and 14 days for enterobacterales bacteremia, supporting shorter courses in stable, responding patients. Observational data in cUTI with bacteremia also suggest 7 days is effective when using agents with comparable IV-to-oral bioavailability, whereas 10 days may be needed otherwise, so I should align duration with agent selection and clinical response [^dd9942a8] [^213fe7b0] [^6b7a938d].

> For catheter-associated UTI, I need to check the legacy IDSA guidance and reconcile it with newer stewardship principles. The 2010 IDSA guidance recommended 7 days if symptoms resolve promptly, 10–14 days if there is a delayed response, and 3 days only for select non-severely ill women ≤ 65 years after catheter removal; however, more recent stewardship-focused guidance treats CA-UTI like other complicated UTIs and supports shorter effective durations when patients improve, so in current practice, 7 days is reasonable for most responding CA-UTI, with longer only if response is slow or source control is incomplete, and I should confirm catheter management at the same time [^d447f8a1] [^e8659a3d] [^89e06071].

> Let me consider pediatrics, because I should not overgeneralize adult data. For children with febrile UTI/pyelonephritis, traditional guidance supports 7–14 days total, but emerging pediatric data suggest that 7 days may suffice in many cases; the SCOUT RCT showed higher short-term failure with 5 total days after 5 days of initial therapy, whereas observational comparative effectiveness data suggest 6–9 days performs similarly to ≥ 10 days, and pediatric reviews increasingly endorse 7 days for uncomplicated pyelonephritis with consideration of longer courses for abscesses or nephronia, so I should tailor to severity, bacteremia, and imaging findings rather than default to prolonged therapy [^3389b020] [^84cfd348] [^6031a15d] [^38413887].

> I should double-check special situations that often require longer therapy or source control. Suspected acute bacterial prostatitis, uncontrolled obstruction, renal abscess or lobar nephronia, and immunocompromised hosts may need 10–14 days or more depending on response and source control; in these cases, I need to ensure imaging and urologic evaluation are pursued if the patient is not improving promptly, because persistent fever or positive cultures despite appropriate therapy should trigger reassessment for an ongoing nidus rather than simply extending antibiotics [^fc1d9dae] [^62b925aa] [^ca0d435c].

> Next, I should review practical implementation details that change risk-benefit. Early IV-to-oral switch is recommended as soon as the patient is hemodynamically stable, afebrile or improving, able to take oral medications, and an effective oral agent is available, and the total duration should still be counted from the first day of effective therapy. This approach reduces line-related complications, length of stay, and cost without compromising outcomes when source control and clinical response are adequate [^2e391f2e] [^a576c443] [^036eb922].

> But wait, what if the patient is not improving as expected? I need to ensure I reassess at 48–72 hours for a drug–bug mismatch, unresolved obstruction or abscess, or an alternative diagnosis, because extending therapy without addressing the source will not improve outcomes. IDSA algorithms explicitly advise evaluating for these issues when response is suboptimal, and that is the pivot point where duration may legitimately be extended or the regimen changed rather than reflexively prolonging the same course [^45cf5fbf] [^62b925aa].

> Let me synthesize a bottom line, and I should confirm it aligns with the highest-quality guidance. For most hospitalized patients with complicated UTI or pyelonephritis who are clinically improving on effective therapy, 7 days total is appropriate, with 5–7 days acceptable if a fluoroquinolone is used and the clinical course is favorable. For cUTI with Gram-negative bacteremia in stable, improving patients, 7 days is supported by RCT-derived IPD meta-analysis and IDSA guidance. For catheter-associated UTI with prompt response, 7 days is reasonable, extending to 10–14 days only if response is delayed or source control remains problematic. In children with pyelonephritis, 7 days is increasingly acceptable in uncomplicated cases, with longer courses reserved for severe disease, abscess, or immunocompromise. I should emphasize that all durations are counted from the first day of effective therapy and that early oral step-down should be pursued whenever feasible [^fc1d9dae] [^dd9942a8] [^213fe7b0] [^d447f8a1] [^6031a15d] [^036eb922].

> Finally, I should confirm the stewardship guardrails so we do not overextend. Shorter effective courses reduce adverse events, C. difficile risk, and resistance pressure without sacrificing cure when patients are selected appropriately and monitored closely. Therefore, I need to ensure timely culture-directed de-escalation, reassessment at 48–72 hours, and source control interventions rather than defaulting to prolonged therapy, and I should document the clinical rationale if I deviate from 7 days in either direction based on host factors, severity, or response [^3e5275a9] [^42068a3a] [^62b925aa].

For a hospitalized UTI, the standard duration is **7–14 days** [^cbea9908], with 7 days sufficient for most patients who are clinically improving and have no complications [^fc1d9dae]. Use **10–14 days** for complicated cases (e.g. bacteremia, abscess, immunocompromise, or slow response) [^fc1d9dae] [^6b7a938d]. Always tailor to clinical response, culture results, and comorbidities, and transition to oral therapy as soon as feasible [^2e391f2e].

---

## General principles guiding duration of therapy

- **Clinical response**: Duration should be adjusted based on patient response, including fever resolution, symptom improvement, and normalization of inflammatory markers [^0b65ff30].

- **Severity and complications**: Longer courses are indicated for severe infections, such as those associated with bacteremia, abscess formation, or immunocompromised states [^fc1d9dae].

- **Microbiological factors**: Culture and sensitivity results guide antibiotic selection and duration, particularly in cases of resistant organisms or atypical pathogens [^3e5275a9].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and immune status influence treatment duration and antibiotic choice [^b150fd7c].

---

## Recommended duration of therapy for hospitalized UTI

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Uncomplicated pyelonephritis (no bacteremia, rapid clinical improvement) | 7 days | High [^fc1d9dae] |
| Complicated UTI (including bacteremia, abscess, immunocompromise) | 10–14 days | High [^fc1d9dae] |
| Catheter-associated UTI (CA-UTI) with prompt clinical response | 7 days | Moderate [^d447f8a1] |
| CA-UTI with delayed response or persistent symptoms | 10–14 days | Moderate [^ccbb27e2] |
| Fungal UTI (e.g. Candida) | 10–14 days | Low [^notfound] |

---

## Evidence supporting shorter courses

Recent studies and guidelines support **shorter antibiotic courses** (5–7 days) for select hospitalized patients with uncomplicated pyelonephritis who are clinically improving, have no bacteremia, and are transitioned to appropriate oral therapy [^fc1d9dae] [^8615b459]. This approach reduces antibiotic exposure, adverse effects, and resistance risk without compromising clinical outcomes [^e51dc8ff].

---

## Factors influencing duration of therapy

Several factors **influence the appropriate duration** of therapy:

- **Presence of bacteremia**: Extends therapy to 10–14 days due to higher risk of relapse and complications [^fc1d9dae].

- **Immunocompromised state**: Requires longer courses (10–14 days) to ensure eradication and prevent recurrence [^fc1d9dae].

- **Structural abnormalities**: Such as obstruction or abscess, necessitate prolonged therapy and often surgical intervention [^ca0d435c].

- **Clinical response**: Slow or inadequate response warrants extension of therapy and reassessment for complications or alternative diagnoses [^62b925aa].

---

## Transition from intravenous to oral therapy

Transition to oral therapy is recommended once the patient is **clinically stable**, afebrile for 24–48 hours, and able to tolerate oral medications [^a576c443]. Oral agents should have reliable bioavailability and activity against the identified pathogen [^2e391f2e].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regular clinical assessment, including temperature, symptoms, and laboratory parameters, is essential during treatment. Repeat urine cultures are **not routinely required** but may be considered in cases of treatment failure, persistent symptoms, or immunocompromised patients [^cbea9908].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Uncomplicated cases**: 7 days of therapy if clinically improving and no bacteremia [^fc1d9dae].

- **Complicated cases**: 10–14 days, tailored to clinical response and complications [^fc1d9dae].

- **Catheter-associated UTI**: 7 days if prompt response; 10–14 days if delayed response [^d447f8a1] [^ccbb27e2].

- **Fungal UTI**: 10–14 days [^notfound].

- **Transition to oral therapy**: As soon as clinically feasible [^2e391f2e].

---

The duration of antibiotic therapy for hospitalized UTI patients **varies with clinical context**, but most cases are adequately treated within 7–14 days. Shorter courses are appropriate for select patients who are clinically improving, while longer courses are reserved for complicated cases or those with slow clinical response.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^fc1d9dae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) antibiotic duration — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and who are improving clinically on effective therapy, we suggest treating with a shorter course of antimicrobials, using either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence) or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence), rather than a longer course (10–14 days). An effective antimicrobial agent achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen. The duration of therapy is counted from the first day of effective antibiotic therapy. Most studies supporting this recommendation excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, severe sepsis, immunocompromising conditions, abscesses in the urinary tract, chronic kidney disease, bacterial prostatitis, complete urinary obstruction, or undergoing urologic surgical procedures. Some patients in these subpopulations may be at higher risk for complications or treatment failure and may need an individualized duration of therapy. Men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement.

### Appropriate antibiotic treatment of genitourinary infections in hospitalized patients [^01e3a0d3]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

The etiology of urinary tract infections (UTIs) that require hospitalization, whether they originate in the hospital or in the community, is changing, with increasing findings of gram-positive organisms. The Council for Appropriate and Rational Antibiotic Therapy (CARAT) criteria recommend evaluating treatment choices on the basis of sound clinical evidence, potential for therapeutic benefits, safety, optimal duration of treatment, and cost-efficacy in order to improve antibiotic treatment. Evidence-based guidelines recommend fluoroquinolones for the treatment of patients with cases of pyelonephritis or bacterial prostatitis severe enough to warrant hospitalization. For other serious UTIs, fluoroquinolones are usually recommended either when traditional agents have failed or when resistance to traditional agents is high. Even in the context of rapidly changing antimicrobial resistance patterns, the fluoroquinolones have maintained consistent, well-tolerated efficacy against many of the principal organisms responsible for UTIs, and are generally considered safe for most patients. To increase the likelihood of treatment success with first-line therapy, an antimicrobial agent must attain sufficient concentrations in the target tissue or in the urine for an appropriate amount of time. Both levofloxacin and gatifloxacin are excreted unchanged in the urine in concentrations that far exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of most uropathogens. Factors that affect cost-effectiveness that should be considered include acquisition costs as well as treatment success and ease of use for hospital staff.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^de98652c]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

In the last decade, treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) has become more complicated by the rising antimicrobial resistance of Enterobacteriaceae, the most common uropathogens. With a scarcity of new antimicrobial classes in the development pipe-line, it is essential to develop strategies to maintain effectiveness of the available antimicrobials. Therefore, among strategies to control resistance, the determination of an optimal duration of treatment is essential in addition to optimization of diagnostics to target treatment and antibiotic stewardship concerning antibiotic choice and dose. Shortening of antimicrobial therapy will lead to less selection pressure on the gut microbiome with benefits to both the individual patient as well as the ecological environment, including reduction of antibiotic resistance development. Therefore, the focus upon treatment duration of common infections should be that shorter is better. With respect to febrile UTI (fUTI) or acute pyelonephritis, trials upon treatment duration have usually focused on previously healthy young women and have addressed optimal treatment duration by comparing the same drug for different durations of therapy, or compared various treatment durations of different antimicrobial agents. As such, recommendations upon optimal treatment duration of UTIs in men, the elderly, hospitalized patients, and patients with comorbidities or bacteremia, remain unclear.

Recently, a randomized placebo-controlled trial showed that community-acquired acute uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women of all ages can be safely and efficaciously treated with oral ciprofloxacin for 7 days. Clearly, such findings need to be extended to men and patients with significant comorbidities. In the present investigator-initiated randomized trial of treatment duration, we use fUTI as the clinical syndrome of interest because this is a broadly recognized specific clinical presentation of patients. Consecutive patients with fUTI were included, including men and women with comorbidities, and treated with antibiotics for 7 or 14 days. The aims of the study were to compare clinical and bacteriological cure at both the short and long term.

### Telehealth and time burden in patients with advanced cancer… [^f663bae8]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Days with telehealth use rose from 2. 7% to
6. 0%, as did days with emergency department visits or hospitalizations, from 8. 7% to
9. 3%. Unraveling correlation vs causation in an analysis like this is of course challenging, particularly given the impact of COVID-19 itself on health care use. If the goal of cancer care during the last year of life should be to avoid inpatient hospitalizations, the authors note that telehealth interactions may be a double-edged sword. On the one hand, early telehealth evaluations may identify toxicities ahead of time and expedite ambulatory management, for example, prescribing oral nirmatrelvir and ritonavir quickly for patients with new COVID-19 infections before symptoms worsen.

On the other hand, telehealth interactions may mask worsening toxicities for which a well-positioned in-person clinic visit might have facilitated early intervention. This possibility is not as far-fetched as it may seem. A previous study from a different California health care system found similar associations between telehealth use and inpatient admissions that were largely driven by hospitalizations among non–English-speaking patients following telehealth visits. 2 Regardless of whether a causative association truly exists, the authors focused their study on patients with advanced cancers. For these patients with a median survival of only 89 days following diagnosis, 1 the authors wonder aloud whether the 6% of days that these patients spent on telehealth visits added substantial value.

In multiple myeloma, for which prognoses for newly diagnosed patients can easily exceed 10 years in the modern era, even 1 health care–related phone call per week may be considered time toxic for patients in remission. 7 Some of this determination is due to the reasons for such interactions, eg, the logistical toxicity of phone calls to insurance companies or specialty pharmacies to coordinate oncolytic medication approval and delivery. 4 To that end, one strength of the authors' analysis is their use of data from a large integrated US health care network with streamlined workflows. In more fragmented health care environments, we suspect that the time toxicity of telephone calls toward the end of life may be even higher.

Antibiotic durations should always be individualized to the patient and their clinical status. Many studies have underrepresentation of critically ill patients.

# 7 days is recommended in patients with community-acquired pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

* Consider prolonged courses of 14 days with non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli due to an increased risk of relapse/recurrence with shorter courses.

¶ After definitive source control.

† Trials excluded immunocompromised patients, patients with indwelling prostheses, infectious syndromes that required prolonged durations, or organisms that required prolonged durations of treatment (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus lugdunensis). Most evidence for shorter courses is in bacteremia from gram negative bacteria secondary to urinary tract infections. Control of the primary source and blood culture clearance should also be achieved.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e8b20eae]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) management — men with febrile, bacteremic urinary tract infection in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration (i.e., 10–14 days), although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking. Consider evaluation for an ongoing nidus of infection requiring source control in patients who do not have prompt clinical improvement. This recommendation places a high value on antibiotic stewardship considerations as well as reducing the burden of antimicrobial administration from a healthcare perspective and reducing the burden of taking antibiotics from a patient perspective. Refer to Figure 1.3 for a stepwise assessment of the intravenous to oral switch and the duration of antibiotic therapy.

### Defining effective durations of antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infections in hospitalized children [^38413887]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and urinary tract infections (UTI) are two common childhood infections often leading to hospital admission. National guidelines for CAP and UTI in children recommend durations of antibiotic therapy of 10 days and 7–14 days, respectively. Due to concerns of rising antimicrobial resistance and an increased awareness of harms associated with prolonged courses of antibiotics, there is a renewed emphasis on reevaluating commonly prescribed durations of antibiotic therapy across bacterial infections. We describe recent clinical trials and observational studies evaluating durations of therapy for CAP and UTI in adults and children and translate the findings to our suggested approach for selecting durations of antibiotic therapy in hospitalized children.

Recent Findings

There is a growing body of evidence, primarily in adults, that shorter durations of therapy than are commonly prescribed are just as effective as longer durations for CAP and UTIs.

Summary

Combining clinical trial data from adults with available data in children, we believe it is reasonable to consider 5 days of therapy for CAP, 3–5 days of therapy for cystitis, and 7 days of therapy for pyelonephritis for most hospitalized children with uncomplicated infections.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^3389b020]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy duration for febrile UTI — the total course of therapy should be 7 to 14 days, and there is evidence that 1- to 3-day courses for febrile UTIs are inferior to courses in the recommended range; therefore, the minimal duration selected should be 7 days. Outcomes of short courses (1–3 d) are inferior to those of 7- to 14-d courses, and there are minimal harm and minor cost effects of antimicrobial choice and duration of therapy. Aggregate quality of evidence: A/B (RCTs), intentional vagueness notes that no evidence distinguishes the benefit of treating 7 vs 10 vs 14 days, and the policy level is Strong recommendation/ recommendation.

### Antimicrobial therapy and respiratory hospitalization or death in adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-reply… [^bb277eac]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

In Reply Dr Chen and colleagues raise important questions regarding the interpretation of the data published by the CleanUP-IPF investigative group. 1 Two specific points require additional discussion. The first focuses on the overall interpretation of our study, which found — using an ITT analysis — that an antimicrobial therapy strategy does not yield beneficial results in a composite clinical end point in patients with IPF. Chen and colleagues suggest that the preliminary data underlying our study noted a reduction in mortality in patients with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonia in a per-protocol analysis compared with the ITT analysis. 2 This example highlights the limitations of per-protocol analyses, particularly those that are not carefully predefined, in clinical trials;. this is especially relevant to pragmatic trials.

3 Our investigative group chose a prospective, randomized, effectiveness clinical trial design following pragmatic principles, including broad inclusion criteria, limited exclusion criteria, a wide variety of participating sites, the absence of a placebo control, 2 antimicrobial agents with preliminary supportive data to provide clinical flexibility, and a relevant end point to enhance the generalizability of the study findings. 4 Our study1 confirms the feasibility of such an approach in a rare lung disorder, albeit with a limitation in documenting and securing maximal adherence to the study drug. Importantly, the trial was stopped for futility because estimates for most of the study end points were pointing in an unfavorable direction.

Our conclusion regarding the lack of utility of the co-trimoxazole treatment component of our therapeutic strategy, following the same dosing regimen as Shulgina et al, 2 is strengthened by the parallel, explanatory, placebo-controlled trial published by Wilson et al. 5 Despite 2 very different study designs, the treatment effect and study drug tolerability were remarkably similar in these trials. These results highlight the difficulty of drawing firm conclusions from per-protocol analyses of clinical trials while supporting the conclusion that co-trimoxazole therapy, delivered to alter disease progression in patients with IPF, is unlikely to have a beneficial effect.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for common infections in english primary care: cross sectional analysis and comparison with guidelines [^ed6b41b6]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

For two of the antibiotic indications we studied, treatment was frequently prescribed for shorter durations than recommended — both urinary tract infections in men: acute cystitis and acute prostatitis. This could arise because prescribers appreciate that recommendations for these conditions are based on expert opinion and historical precedent rather than evidence, and that treatment durations for urinary tract infections in women have declined considerably in recent years. It needs to be established whether shorter treatment durations are effective for men with urinary tract infections, as this is a small but important patient population with a risk of harm from under-treatment. Notably, the conditions for which course durations tended to be less than recommended in the guidelines were those for which evidence supporting duration of treatment is weak (supplementary figs S5-S7).

In general, the preference seemed to be for antibiotic prescriptions with durations of five or seven days or multiples thereof, without a clear evidence base for this preference. The preference for such durations has been observed previously in other settings and depended more on local practice and subspecialty than on clinical features such as fever, comorbidities, and severity. In addition, for conditions where guidelines recommend longer durations, the percentage of prescriptions beyond the recommendation is substantially lower than for conditions where guidelines recommend a relatively short duration.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to duration of treatment, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to recognize that men with febrile UTI in whom acute bacterial prostatitis is suspected may benefit from a longer treatment duration of 10–14 days, although evidence to guide the optimal duration in this subgroup is lacking.

### Defining the optimal duration of therapy for hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections and associated bacteremia [^6b7a938d]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data are available to guide effective antibiotic durations for hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs).

Methods

We conducted an observational study of patients ≥ 18 years at 24 US hospitals to identify the optimal treatment duration for patients with cUTI. To increase the likelihood patients experienced true infection, eligibility was limited to those with associated bacteremia. Propensity scores were generated for an inverse probability of treatment weighted analysis. The primary outcome was recurrent infection with the same species ≤ 30 days of completing therapy.

Results

1099 patients met eligibility criteria and received 7 (n = 265), 10 (n = 382), or 14 (n = 452) days of therapy. There was no difference in the odds of recurrent infection for patients receiving 10 days and those receiving 14 days of therapy (aOR: .99; 95% CI: .52–1.87). Increased odds of recurrence was observed in patients receiving 7 days versus 14 days of treatment (aOR: 2.54; 95% CI: 1.40–4.60). When limiting the 7-day versus 14-day analysis to the 627 patients who remained on intravenous beta-lactam therapy or were transitioned to highly bioavailable oral agents, differences in outcomes no longer persisted (aOR: .76; 95% CI: .38–1.52). Of 76 patients with recurrent infections, 2 (11%), 2 (10%), and 10 (36%) in the 7-, 10-, and 14-day groups, respectively, had drug-resistant infections (P = 0.10).

Conclusions

Seven days of antibiotics appears effective for hospitalized patients with cUTI when antibiotics with comparable intravenous and oral bioavailability are administered; 10 days may be needed for all other patients.

### Clinical progress note: antibiotic duration for common infections in hospitalized adults [^f45a99d9]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The evidence base supporting the effectiveness of shorter antibiotic courses for a variety of common infections has grown substantially, yet many implementation barriers remain. We examine recent data evaluating shorter antibiotic courses for bacteremia, community-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and complicated urinary tract infections/pyelonephritis.

### Intravenous antibiotic durations for common bacterial infections in children: when is enough enough? [^f72020f7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in hospitalized children sometimes extend well beyond clinical recovery and are often the primary determinants of length of stay. These durations, however, are not always based on solid evidence. Moreover, fixed durations are invariant to important individual factors. We review guidelines and the available evidence for durations of intravenous antibiotic therapy for meningitis, bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and osteomyelitis, conditions where intravenous antibiotics often extend beyond resolution of clinical symptoms. We propose a framework for the duration of therapy that is intended to serve as a guide when standards of care are either nonexistent, dated, conflicting, or contrary to evidence from published studies. This framework incorporates patient-centered factors such as severity of infection, response to therapy, ease of intravenous access, harms and costs of ongoing intravenous treatment, and family preferences.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to duration of treatment, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider treating patients with complicated UTI, including acute pyelonephritis, who are improving clinically on effective therapy, with a shorter course of antimicrobials, with either 5–7 days of a fluoroquinolone
or 7 days of a non-fluoroquinolone antibiotic
, rather than a longer course of 10–14 days.

Duration of therapy and oral step-down — guidance principles: Recommendations on durations of therapy are not provided, and durations may vary if initially inactive therapy was given; uncomplicated cystitis is typically mild and, if clinical improvement occurs despite empiric inactive therapy, it is generally not necessary to repeat urine culture, change the regimen, or extend the planned course, whereas for other infections if AST later indicates inactive empiric therapy, a change to an active regimen for a full treatment course (dated from the start of active therapy) is suggested; host factors and source control should inform duration decisions, and transitioning to oral therapy should be considered when susceptibility to an appropriate oral agent is demonstrated, the patient is hemodynamically stable, source control measures have occurred, and there are no concerns about insufficient intestinal absorption.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^9026c0c0]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7–14 days) for older patients than for younger women, but the scientific evidence for such recommendations is not clear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies marketing antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections, screened the reference list of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched the following data bases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International, Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings.

Selection Criteria

All randomized controlled trials in which different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women were compared. We excluded patients with fever or flank pain and those with complicating factors. Trials with treatment durations longer than 14 days or designed for prevention of urinary tract infection were also excluded. No language restriction was applied.

Data Collection and Analysis

The quality of all selected trials was assessed and data extracted by the reviewers. Main outcome measures were persistence of urinary symptoms (short-term and long-term efficacy), effect on mental and functional status and adverse drug reactions. To compare the different treatment durations, we defined the following categories of duration: single dose, short course (3–6 days) and long course (7–14 days). Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for each trial and outcome and were then combined using a random effects model.

Main Results

Thirteen trials were included in this review. Six trials compared single dose with short-term treatment (3–6 days), three studies single dose with long-term treatment (7–14 days) and four trials short-term with long term treatment. Eight trials also included younger patients, but provided a subgroup analysis for elderly women. The methodological quality of all trials was low. All trials reported results of bacteriological cure rate; less often clinical outcomes (e.g. improvement or cure of symptoms) were analyzed. Only five trials compared the same antibiotic given for a different length of time. We performed a separate analysis for these trials. The rate of persistent bacteriuria rate at short-term (two weeks post-treatment) was better in the longer treatment group (3–14 days) than in the single dose group (RR 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.86). However, the rate of persistent bacteria at long term and the clinical cure rate showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Patients showed a preference for single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.88), however this was based on only one trial comparing the same antibiotic. The comparison of short (3–6 days) and longer treatments (7–14 days) did not show any significant difference, but the number of included studies and sample size were low.

Reviewer's Conclusions

This review suggests that single dose antibiotic treatment is less effective but may be better accepted by the patients than longer treatment durations (3–14 days). In addition there was no significant difference between short course (3–6 days) versus longer course (7–14 days) antibiotics. The methodological quality of the identified trials was poor and the optimal treatment duration could not be determined. We therefore need more appropriately designed randomized controlled trials testing the effect, - on clinical relevant outcomes -, of different treatment durations of a given antibiotic in a strictly defined population of elderly women.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^ebf31aaf]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Women with fUTI can be successfully treated with antibiotics for 7 days, including those who initially were treated with β-lactams intravenously. In men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment for fUTI is inferior to 14 days when looking at short-term clinical cure. During long-term follow-up, even in men, 7 days of antibiotic treatment is non-inferior to 14 days.

Is should be considered that the primary outcome measures on future trials on antibiotic treatment duration of fUTI in men, should be set at 3 months instead of the traditional 2 weeks.

Future research should include standardized definitions of children with cUTI. Treatment duration and benefits of prophylaxis should be assessed separately for each subgroup, with outcomes not only considering treatment failure but also other factors including antibiotic resistance, side effects and home management in a more holistic way. Furthermore, studies should focus on evaluating the long-term outcomes of children treated according to these guidelines to further validate and refine these recommendations.

The comment states that this recommendation places a high value on de-escalating antibiotic therapy based on culture results and notes that de-escalation may be less practical in cases of cUTI managed in the outpatient setting.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^51ff1b50]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

This IPD systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported according to the PRISMA-IPD Statement, and Cochrane instructions for IPD-MA. Considering the priority of the results for decision-making, and taking into account expected new evidence from a large ongoing trial in the topic, we conduct this review as a living systematic review. For the living systematic review we will repeat the search every 12 months. Updates of the meta-analysis will be conducted when new evidence that is likely to influence the results will be identified.

We included RCTs comparing short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were hospitalized adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia, as defined in individual trials. We included only trials evaluating patients with Gram-negative bacteremia as their target population. Trials evaluating various infection types (e.g. pneumonia, urinary tract infection), and reporting bacteremic patients as a sub-group were not included. We excluded trials addressing source of bacteremia requiring prolonged treatment (endocarditis/endovascular infections; necrotizing fasciitis; osteomyelitis; abdominal abscesses and other unresolved abdominal sources requiring source control (surgery/drainage); central nervous system infections; empyema; any uncontrolled focus of infection (undrained abscess/deep seated intra-abdominal infection, undrained moderate to severe hydronephrosis). We also excluded patients with intracellular pathogens including Salmonella spp. and Brucella spp.

Interventions tested were antibiotics with in vitro activity against the pathogen for ≤ 7 vs > 7 days. Any choice and route of administration of antibiotics (oral or intravenous) were eligible for inclusion. Any source of bacteremia not requiring prolonged treatment (urinary tract infection, pneumonia, etc.) and any place of acquisition (community or hospital) were eligible for inclusion.

Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included 30-day all-cause mortality; relapse of bacteremia; length of hospital stay; readmissions; local suppurative and distant complications; restarting of Gram-negative-directed antibiotic therapy; emergence of resistance to study antibiotics; functional capacity and time to return to baseline capacity; new clinically or microbiologically documented infection; and adverse events: any diarrhea, C. difficile associated diarrhea, acute kidney injury, and rash (for secondary outcomes definitions, see Appendix).

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^34a473b4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pyelonephritis, an infection of the upper urinary tract, can lead to both short-term and long-term morbidity, including sepsis, acute kidney injury, renal scarring, and chronic hypertension. To alleviate symptoms during the acute phase of the infection and reduce the potential for long-term consequences, pediatric guidelines recommend treating pyelonephritis with a total of 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy.

A growing body of evidence supports the noninferiority of short durations of therapy (in the range of 5–7 days) compared with prolonged durations for producing clinical cure in adults with pyelonephritis. However, limited data explore this question in children. Moreover, there is a need for more robust evidence in children with urological abnomalities. The benefits of a short course of antibiotic therapy for pyelonephritis include improved patient convenience, a decreased likelihood of adverse drug events, a reduced risk of the emergence of antibiotic resistant organisms, and reduced abdominal discomfort.

Since 2016, The Johns Hopkins Hospital Pediatric Antibiotic Treatment Guidelines, accessible to clinicians at all 5 of the hospitals contributing data to the current study, recommend treating children with pyelonephritis with 7 days of antibiotic therapy (eFigure 1 in the Supplement). These guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary team including primary care clinicians, emergency medicine clinicians, hospitalists, urologists, nephrologists, intensivists, and infectious diseases clinicians based on a review of the available evidence in adult and pediatric populations and expert opinion where gaps in data were evident. However, despite the availability of local treatment guidelines, variability remains in prescribed treatment durations for children with pyelonephritis, providing an opportunity to investigate the association between varying durations of antibiotic therapy and patient outcomes. Our objective was to compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course (< 10 days) vs a prolonged-course (≥ 10 days) of antibiotics for the treatment of pyelonephritis.

### Complicated urinary tract infections [^6a84f0b8]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

A complicated urinary tract infection is that which occurs in a patient with an anatomically abnormal urinary tract or significant medical or surgical comorbidities. Whereas this definition may not cover each and every situation, it does serve to encompass the great majority of these patients and guide their care. The definition is necessarily broad, to assure that these potentially complex patients are appropriately managed. Thus, complicated urinary tract infection describes a group of patients that usually need a prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy, with all its attendant morbidities, costs, and outcome differences.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI — In patients with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly excluded patients with indwelling urinary catheters, sepsis or septic shock, immunocompromised states, severe renal insufficiency, and functional or structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, and some patients in these subpopulations may need an individualized plan of therapy. An effective antimicrobial agent means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the urine and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

Acute pyelonephritis treatment regimens — recommended doses and durations: For oral regimens in patients not requiring hospitalization, ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg BID for 7–10 d, levofloxacin 500 mg QD for 7–10 d, and levofloxacin 750 mg QD for 5 d are listed; alternatives are cefpodoxime 200 mg BID for 10 d and ceftibuten 400 mg QD for 10 d. When limited to pathogens with known susceptibility (not for initial empiric therapy), options include TMP-SMX 160/800 mg BID for 14 d and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 0.5/0.125 g TID for 14 d. For patients requiring hospitalization, empirical parenteral options include ciprofloxacin 400 mg BID, levofloxacin 250–500 mg QD or 750 mg QD, with alternatives including cefotaxime 2 g TID, ceftriaxone 1–2 g QD, ceftazidime 1–2 g TID, cefepime 1–2 g BID, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 1.5 g TID, piperacillin/tazobactam 2.5–4.5 g TID, gentamicin 5 mg/kg QD, ertapenem 1 g QD, imipenem/cilastin 0.5/0.5 g TID, meropenem 1 g TID, and doripenem 0.5 g TID.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^f35e2009]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment durations for lower and upper UTIs have gradually reduced, but randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses of shorter durations have largely excluded children with complications. Therefore, there is scant evidence for total durations shorter than 10–14 days for cUTI.

For neonates and infants < 2 months, the majority of retrospective studies in bacteremic, and nonbacteremic,– UTI used a total of 10–14 days of antibiotics with high success rates. A recent systematic review comparing the IV component in infants up to 3 months recommended: for bacteremic UTI, IV antibiotics up to 7 days; and for nonbacteremic UTI, up to 3 days. Switching from IV to oral in both situations is recommended when the infant is afebrile, well and tolerating oral intake.

For severe clinical presentations, a retrospective study of children with febrile UTI included those with initial tachycardia, hypotension and/or vomiting. It showed that 6–9 days was as effective as ≥ 10 days of total antibiotics, although it did not report numbers with severe features. Once features of sepsis resolve (usually by day 3), total antibiotic duration is dependent on bacteremia. A multicenter study of children under 6 months with UTI found bacteremia was more likely to be treated with ≥ 4 than ≤ 3 days IV (total 7–14 days). A case-control study comparing bacteremic versus nonbacteremic UTI found a difference in IV (5–7 vs. 3–4 days) but not total (11–12 days) antibiotic duration, and no differences in outcomes. For acute lobar nephronia, a review including overlapping RCTs compared 14 versus 21 days' total duration, with initial IV then switching to oral 2–3 days after defervescence. There was higher treatment failure with 14 days, but failure was associated with longer pre-presentation fever, suggesting longer treatment is necessary for more established abscesses.

### Antibiotic duration for treating uncomplicated, symptomatic lower urinary tract infections in elderly women [^fcad96c4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in elderly patients. Authors of non systematic literature reviews often recommend longer treatment durations (7 to 14 days) for older women, but the evidence for such recommendations is unclear.

Objectives

To determine the optimal duration of antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTI in elderly women.

Search Strategy

We contacted known investigators and pharmaceutical companies, screened reference lists of identified articles, reviews and books, and searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Healthstar, Popline, Gerolit, Bioethics Line, The Cochrane Library, Dissertation Abstracts International and Index to Scientific & Technical Proceedings without language restriction. Date of most recent search: 7 May 2008.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different treatment durations of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated symptomatic lower UTIs in elderly women were included. Whenever possible we obtained outcome data for older women included in studies with a broader age range. We excluded patients with fever, flank pain or complicating factors; studies with treatment durations longer than 14 days and prevention studies.

Data Collection and Analysis

The two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Fifteen studies (1644 elderly women) were included. Three studies compared single dose with short-course treatment (3 to 6 days), six compared single dose with long-course treatment (7 to 14 days) and six compared short- with long-course treatment. Methodological quality of all studies was low except for a more recent geriatric study. There was a significant difference for persistent UTI between single dose and short-course treatment (RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.84) and single versus long-course treatment (RR 1.93, 1.01 to 3.70 95% CI), in the short-term (< 2 weeks post-treatment) but not at long-term follow-up or on clinical outcomes. Patients preferred single dose treatment (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.88) to long-course treatments, but this was based on one study comparing different antibiotics. Short versus longer treatments showed no significant difference in efficacy. Rate of adverse drug reactions increased significantly with longer treatment durations in only one study.

Authors' Conclusions

Short-course treatment (3 to 6 days) could be sufficient for treating uncomplicated UTIs in elderly women, although more studies on specific commonly prescribed antibiotics are needed.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^12901a19]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge the limitations of this retrospective cohort study. First, our study was not designed to assess causality, and there are important differences (known and unknown) between residents who received suboptimal and optimal antibiotic treatment. While we did adjust for confounders of suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes, our findings neither confirm nor deny a causal relationship, as our findings may be confounded by unmeasured factors which affect suboptimal treatment and clinical outcomes. As such, while we found an association between suboptimal antibiotic treatment and poor clinical outcomes even after adjusting for several resident and CLC characteristics, this association may be impacted by residual confounding. Second, we defined UTI based on a urine culture and antibiotic treatment, per recommendations of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. While we excluded patients with other positive cultures and only included those exposed to common antibiotics recommended by national guidance or with reliable urinary concentrations, the antibiotic treatment captured may have been targeting another non-urinary tract infection type or asymptomatic bacteriuria. Additionally, we did not capture UTIs in which a urine culture was not obtained. Urine culturing practices are not standardized across VA CLCs, and some facilities may only recommend obtaining UTI cultures in certain clinical situations, such as recurrent infection. However, our population was mostly a complicated, male population, in which urine cultures would be generally recommended. Third, no established definitions for suboptimal antibiotic treatment of residents with UTI have been developed. There is no IDSA guidance for the treatment of complicated UTIs in males, so we based suboptimal treatment definitions on available guidelines for uncomplicated infection in females and expert opinion. Suboptimal antibiotic treatment is multifactorial and as such we considered three elements of suboptimal treatment (drug choice, dose frequency, and longer duration). However, other elements, such as drug strength and route of administration may also be suboptimal. Insufficient treatment duration is also a clinical problem. We excluded those treated for 2 days or less, but some residents may have still been exposed to insufficient treatment durations. Future research should continue to investigate and operationalize the definition of suboptimal antibiotic treatment among residents with UTI. Additionally, while we conducted analyses by subtype of suboptimal treatment, comparative analyses are warranted to determine which individual aspects of suboptimal antibiotic treatment (the drug choice, dose frequency, or longer than recommended duration) are the most strongly associated with poor outcomes. Forth, we measured all-cause hospitalizations, ED visits, and mortality. Our frail older resident population is already at risk for these events and many of the events observed may have not been related to antibiotic use. Alternatively, we likely underestimated antibiotic-related adverse events, as these events may not have been coded or other codes were used. Adverse events are difficult to identify in large databases as they are often not recorded in health claims and reports. Fifth, while we investigated five potential harms of suboptimal antibiotic use, we did not assess the development of colonization or infection with resistance, which is a well-known harm of antibiotic use. Finally, the generalizability of our findings conducted in a largely older male population may be limited to other non-VA long-term care populations.

### Shorter and longer courses of antibiotics for common infections and the association with reductions of infection-related complications including hospital admissions [^7aa75c0a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The current study did observe underlying confounding when looking at the risk of a poor outcome in the first 5 days follow-up (when all comparison groups had the same exposure). It is well known that patients at a higher risk of a complication following an acute infection are often the elderly, patients with impaired immune function and multimorbidity; so it was not surprising to see the incidence increase from 0.12% to 0.76% with an increasing Charlson score. Furthermore, the majority of events occurring within 7 days follow-up, suggesting very unwell patient are admitted before completion of their antibiotic course.

Current recommendations do not inform the prescriber of the best treatment for reoccurring infections (except for UTIs), nor do they consider a patient's historic antibiotic exposure, or patients that have had repeated-intermittent antibiotic prescriptions, all of which may affect the success of the subsequent antibiotic treatment. The prescriber is left to prescribe empirically, given the patients history with limited trial data to inform guidance for complex prior exposures. A recent epidemiological study observed reduced effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for patients with prior frequent intermittent antibiotic use compared to occasional users, suggesting that frequent use reduces antibiotic effectiveness and may drive individualized resistance, increasing the likelihood of treatment failure in the future. Further research is needed to determine the most effective strategies for optimizing duration of antibiotic treatment for individual patients, taking a combination of patient characteristics, clinical presentation, symptom severity, and prior use into consideration when identifying the patients who are more at risk of failing to recover on shorter antibiotic courses.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^6031a15d]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

National guidelines recommend treating children with pyelonephritis for 7 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy, yet data are lacking to suggest a more precise treatment duration.

Objective

To compare the clinical outcomes of children receiving a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotic treatment for pyelonephritis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Retrospective observational study using inverse probability of treatment weighted propensity score analysis of data from 5 hospitals in Maryland between July 1, 2016, and October 1, 2018. Participants were children aged 6 months to 18 years with a urine culture growing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or Proteus mirabilis with laboratory and clinical criteria for pyelonephritis.

Exposures

Treatment of pyelonephritis with a short-course (6 to 9 days) vs a prolonged-course (10 or more days) of antibiotics.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Composite outcome of treatment failure within 30 days of completing antibiotic therapy: (a) unanticipated emergency department or outpatient visits related to urinary tract infection symptoms, (b) hospital readmission related to UTI symptoms, (c) prolongation of the planned, initial antibiotic treatment course, or (d) death. A subsequent urinary tract infection caused by a drug-resistant bacteria within 30 days was a secondary outcome.

Results

Of 791 children who met study eligibility criteria (mean [SD] age 9.2 [6.3] years; 672 [85.0%]) were girls, 297 patients (37.5%) were prescribed a short-course and 494 patients (62.5%) were prescribed a prolonged-course of antibiotics. The median duration of short-course therapy was 8 days (interquartile range, 7–8 days), and the median duration of prolonged-course therapy was 11 days (interquartile range, 11–12 days). Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups in the inverse probability of treatment weighted cohort. There were 79 children (10.1%) who experienced treatment failure. The odds of treatment failure were similar for patients prescribed a short-course vs a prolonged-course of antibiotics (11.2% vs 9.4%; odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.75–1.98). There was no significant difference in the odds of a drug-resistant uropathogen for patients with a subsequent urinary tract infection within 30 days when prescribed a short-courses vs prolonged-course of antibiotics (40% vs 64%; odds ratio, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.09–1.43).

Conclusions and Relevance

The study findings suggest that short-course antibiotic therapy may be as effective as prolonged-courses for children with pyelonephritis, and may mitigate the risk of future drug-resistant urinary tract infections. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

### A systematic review of antimicrobial stewardship interventions to improve management of bacteriuria in hospitalized adults [^22f181a3]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Objectives

Bacteriuria is a common occurrence in many populations. Bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine in quantitative counts ≥ 10 5 colony-forming units/mL. Individuals with bacteriuria may develop symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI); however, many individuals remain asymptomatic. While treatment with antimicrobial agents is recommended for UTIs, current guidelines recommend against antimicrobial therapy for asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) except in specific populations, including pregnant individuals and those undergoing endoscopic urologic procedures associated with mucosal trauma. The Choosing Wisely ® and Choosing Wisely Canada ® campaigns also recommend against treating bacteriuria unless symptoms are present. Despite clear evidence-based recommendations for managing individuals with bacteriuria, suboptimal treatment for UTIs and inappropriate prescribing for ASB have been widely reported in the literature. -

Unnecessary use of antimicrobial agents is considered a major driver of antimicrobial resistance, one of the greatest global public health challenges today. In particular, high rates of resistance have been observed in bacteria that cause UTIs. In hospitalized patients, UTIs are one of the most common reasons for prescribing antibiotics, accounting for up to 17% of antimicrobial use. Detection of bacteriuria has been shown to lead to unnecessary therapy in 30% to 50% of ASB patients. and treatment of ASB has been found to account for half of all unnecessary fluoroquinolone regimens in hospitalized patients. To minimize the negative consequences of antimicrobial use, including antimicrobial resistance, antibiotics must be used judiciously.

As a result of growing rates of antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) initiatives are recommended to improve the use of antibiotics. Antimicrobial stewardship is defined as "coordinated interventions designed to improve and measure the appropriate use of [antibiotic] agents by promoting the selection of the optimal [antibiotic] drug regimen including dosing, duration of therapy, and route of administration."A Cochrane review of AMS interventions has shown improved compliance with antibiotic policy and reduced duration of antimicrobial use. The review however, did not focus on AMS interventions specifically for patients with bacteriuria. We aimed to determine whether implementation of AMS interventions improves management of bacteriuria (UTIs and ASB) in hospitalized adults, as compared to usual care.

### Duration of antibacterial treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women [^85c92aa4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) is a common disease, occurring frequently in young sexually active women. In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days.

Objectives

TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data concerning bacteriological and symptomatic failure rates, occurrence of pyelonephritis and adverse effects were extracted independently by two reviewers. Relative risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. Outcomes were also extracted by intention-to-treat analysis whenever possible.

Main Results

Thirty-two trials (9605 patients) were included. For symptomatic failure rates, no difference between three-day and 5–10 day antibiotic regimen was seen short-term (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.28) and long-term follow-up (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.27). Comparison of the bacteriological failure rates showed that three-day therapy was less effective than 5–10 day therapy for the short-term follow-up, however this difference was observed only in the subgroup of trials that used the same antibiotic in the two treatment arms (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.74, P = 0.01). This difference was more significant at long-term follow-up (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.73, P = 0.0002). Adverse effects were significantly more common in the 5–10 day treatment group (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.93, P = 0.0010). Results were consistent for subgroup and sensitivity analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

Three days of antibiotic therapy is similar to 5–10 days in achieving symptomatic cure during uncomplicated UTI treatment, while the longer treatment is more effective in obtaining bacteriological cure. In spite of the higher rate of adverse effects, treatment for 5–10 days could be considered for treatment of women in whom eradication of bacteriuria is important.

### Short compared with standard duration of antibiotic treatment for urinary tract infection: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials [^356073e6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2002). Low credibility.

Aims

To compare the effectiveness of short course (2–4 days) with standard duration oral antibiotic treatment (7–14 days) for urinary tract infection (UTI).

Methods

Meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials using a random effects model. Ten trials were eligible, involving 652 children with lower tract UTI recruited from outpatient or emergency departments. Main outcome measures were UTI at the end of treatment, UTI during follow up (recurrent UTI), and urinary pathogens resistant to the treating antibiotic.

Results

There was no significant difference in the frequency of positive urine cultures between the short (2–4 days) and standard duration therapy (7–14 days) for UTI in children at 0–7 days after treatment (eight studies: RR 1.06; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.76) and at 10 days to 15 months after treatment (10 studies: RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.33). There was no significant difference between short and standard duration therapy in the development of resistant organisms in UTI at the end of treatment (one study: RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01) or in recurrent UTI (three studies: RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.29).

Conclusion

A 2–4 day course of oral antibiotics is as effective as 7–14 days in eradicating lower tract UTI in children.

### European Association of Urology guidelines on urological infections: summary of the 2024 guidelines [^5165eba0]. European Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Urological infections significantly impact the wellbeing and quality of life of individuals owing to their widespread occurrence and diverse clinical manifestations. The objective of the guidelines panel was to provide evidence-based guidance on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and male accessory-gland infections, while addressing crucial public health aspects related to infection control and antimicrobial stewardship.

Methods

For the 2024 guidelines on urological infections, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations within the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of a thorough medical history and physical examination for patients with urological infections. The guidelines stress the role of antimicrobial stewardship to combat the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance, providing recommendations for antibiotic selection, dosing, and duration on the basis of the latest evidence.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

This overview of the 2024 EAU guidelines offers valuable insights into managing urological infections and are designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Patient Summary

The European Association of Urology has issued an updated guideline on urological infections. The guidelines provide recommendations for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, with a particular focus on minimising antibiotic use because of the increasing global threat of antimicrobial resistance.

### Fluconazole dose recommendation in urinary tract infection [^b36de55b]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the most appropriate dose of fluconazole for the treatment of symptomatic fungal urinary tract infection (UTI).

Data Sources

Primary literature identified through MEDLINE (1990-June 2000). Key search terms included fluconazole and urinary tract infection.

Data Synthesis

Fluconazole is approved for the treatment of candidal UTIs, but dosage recommendations are not consistent. An evaluation of clinical studies of fluconazole for the treatment of candidal UTI was performed.

Conclusions

Questions remain about the optimal dosing of fluconazole, including the most appropriate dose in non-albicans species of candida as well as the optimal duration of therapy. Until further studies are performed, a fluconazole 200-mg loading dose followed by 100 mg/d for at least four days appears to be the most appropriate dose for the treatment of symptomatic candidal UTI in patients without systemic fungal infection or severe renal failure.

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infections in the post-antibiotic era: a narrative review highlighting diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship [^9088d3c0]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As one of the most common indications for antimicrobial prescription in the community, the management of urinary tract infections (UTIs) is both complicated by, and a driver of, antimicrobial resistance.

Objectives

To highlight the key clinical decisions involved in the diagnosis and treatment of UTIs in adult women, focusing on clinical effectiveness and both diagnostic and antimicrobial stewardship as we approach the post-antimicrobial era.

Sources

Literature reviewed via directed PubMed searches and manual searching of the reference list for included studies to identify key references to respond to the objectives. A strict time limit was not applied. We prioritised recent publications, randomised trials, and systematic reviews (with or without meta-analyses) where available. Searches were limited to English language articles. A formal quality assessment was not performed; however, the strengths and limitations of each paper were reviewed by the authors throughout the preparation of this manuscript.

Content

We discuss the management of UTIs in ambulatory adult women, with particular focus on uncomplicated infections. We address the diagnosis of UTIs, including the following: definition and categorisation; bedside assessments and point-of-care tests; and the indications for, and use of, laboratory tests. We then discuss the treatment of UTIs, including the following: indications for treatment, antimicrobial sparing approaches, key considerations when selecting a specific antimicrobial agent, specific treatment scenarios, and duration of treatment. We finally outline emerging areas of interest in this field.

Implications

The steady increase in antimicrobial resistance among common uropathogens has had a substantial affect on the management of UTIs. Regarding both diagnosis and treatment, the clinician must consider both the patient (clinical effectiveness and adverse effects, including collateral damage) and the community more broadly (population-level antimicrobial selection pressure).

### Updates to recurrent uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women: AUA / CUA / SUFU guideline (2025) [^faf97b34]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 10a — antibiotic duration for acute cystitis episodes in recurrent UTI: Clinicians should treat rUTI patients experiencing acute cystitis episodes with as short a duration of antibiotics as reasonable, generally no longer than seven days (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). Supporting evidence includes a review of 15 trials (N = 1,644) where single-dose antibiotics increased short-term (< 2 weeks) bacteriological persistence versus short-course (3 to 6 days; RR: 2.01; 95% CI: 1.05 to 3.84; I2 = 36%) or long-course (7 to 14 days; RR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.01 to 3.70; I2 = 31%) therapy, and another review of 32 trials (N = 9,605) showing three-day courses, irrespective of class, increased long-term (4 to 10 weeks) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.60; I2 = 30%) versus more prolonged (5 to 10 day) therapy, with no differences in short-term (2 to 15 days) bacteriological failure (RR: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.44; I2 = 0%).

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^8144d778]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) — definition and treatment approach: In this document, cUTI refers to urinary tract infections associated with a structural or functional genitourinary abnormality or any UTI in an adolescent or adult male; the panel suggests cUTI be treated with similar agents and similar treatment durations as pyelonephritis, and when source control has occurred it is reasonable to use regimens akin to uncomplicated cystitis with day 1 of therapy being the day source control occurred.

### Poor clinical outcomes associated with suboptimal antibiotic treatment among older long-term care facility residents with urinary tract infection: a retrospective cohort study [^9345b820]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

The only subtype of potentially suboptimal antibiotic treatment that was associated with the composite poor clinical outcome and CDI in our study was potentially suboptimal dose frequency. The risk of CDI was 2.42 times higher among those treated with a suboptimal dose frequency versus optimal treatment. Potentially suboptimal dose frequency was also associated with hospitalization/ED visits and all-cause mortality. In prior work, a dose-dependent increased risk of CDI has been observed, with increasing cumulative defined daily dose of antibiotics resulting in increasing risks of CDI. Our results suggest that dose frequency, in addition to drug choice and antibiotic duration, may also impact risk of CDI and other poor outcomes.

We found no difference in risk for UTI recurrence for residents treated with potentially suboptimal or optimal antibiotic treatment. Previous work has found that among women with UTI, longer courses of antibiotics may be associated with increased risk of recurrent UTI, possibly due to alterations in urogenital flora. However, among males with UTI treated in the outpatient setting, longer treatment duration was not associated with UTI recurrence, nor was antibiotic choice. Interestingly, for unclear reasons, among the subgroup of residents treated with initial beta-lactam therapy, suboptimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of UTI recurrence which requires further investigation.

It is possible that suboptimal initial treatment could lead to clinical failure, the consequences of which could be serious and may include bacteremia, urosepsis, acute care hospitalization, and potentially death. In our study, suboptimal treatment was not associated with mortality. It is possible that despite being suboptimal, an appropriate agent was ultimately used considering the susceptibility of the uropathogen causing the UTI. Three previous studies have similarly demonstrated that inappropriate empiric therapy for UTI was not associated with an increased risk of mortality. Excessive treatment duration versus optimal treatment was associated with a decreased hazard of mortality. The optimal duration of treatment of males with UTI is largely unknown. In females, durations as short as 3 days are recommended for those with uncomplicated infection, but for males longer durations between 7 and 14 days are generally recommended. Further investigation is needed to determine optimal treatment duration in males to decrease the risk of treatment failure.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^a576c443]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Timing of intravenous to oral antibiotics transition for complicated UTI with associated Gram-negative bacteremia — In patients presenting with complicated UTI (including acute pyelonephritis) and associated Gram-negative bacteremia treated initially with parenteral therapy who are clinically improving, able to take oral medication, and for whom an effective oral option is available, we suggest transitioning to oral antibiotics rather than continuing parenteral therapy for the remaining treatment duration (conditional recommendation, very low certainty of the evidence). The trials supporting this recommendation mostly included patients who were afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and had achieved source control (relief of any urinary obstruction) before transitioning to oral antibiotics. An effective antimicrobial agent for bacteremic patients means that the antibiotic achieves therapeutic levels in the bloodstream, urine, and relevant tissue and is active against the causative pathogen.

### Duration of antibiotic therapy for bacteremia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^bc9de796]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

The eligible trials of treatment duration in pyelonephritis involved diverse patient populations, durations of treatment, and outcome measures, and this explains the heterogeneity of outcomes with shorter durations of therapy. Recently, the results of several RCTs have demonstrated short-course (5 or 7 days) fluoroquinolone therapy to be equally as efficacious as 10 to 14 days of treatment with comparator medications. IDSA guidelines were accordingly amended to recommend therapy for 7 days, but the issue of bacteremia was not explicitly addressed. Our data suggest that patients with bacteremia secondary to uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be successfully treated with shorter-duration therapy.

The sole trial of treatment duration in SSTI demonstrated that, in a carefully selected healthy adult population, a short duration of therapy was associated with a cure rate equal to that of a long duration of therapy. However, the explicit exclusion of patients with more serious infections, argues that it is unlikely that these data can be directly extrapolated to critically ill patients with bacteremic soft tissue infections.

The present review has several important limitations. The prespecified search strategy excluded unpublished data and non-English language trials. Of eligible trials, bias may have been introduced by low rates of blinding and use of placebo controls. Some studies included only patients with early clinical improvement for randomization to short- or long-course therapy; consequently, the effect size and findings may not be generalizable to sicker patient populations. Other trials excluded patients post-randomization or presented only per-protocol analyses and so may have excluded bacteremic patients failing therapy. Treatment outcomes for patients with bacteremia in individual studies were derived from small post hoc subgroup analyses. Finally, within individual infectious syndromes, significant variability was encountered both in study design and in the durations of therapy employed (with 14 days even considered shorter-course therapy in one study). However, the lack of outcome heterogeneity between syndromes suggests that it is valid to pool BSI data from multiple infectious foci into a single meta-analysis or enroll such patients within a single RCT.

### Short-course antibiotics for common infections: what do we know and where do we go from here? [^e51dc8ff]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Over the past 25 years, researchers have performed > 120 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) illustrating short courses to be non-inferior to long courses of antibiotics for common bacterial infections.

Objective

We sought to determine whether clinical data from RCTs affirm the mantra of 'shorter is better' for antibiotic durations in 7 common infections: pneumonia, urinary tract infection, intra-abdominal infection, bacteraemia, skin and soft tissue infection, bone and joint infections, pharyngitis and sinusitis.

Sources

Published RCTs comparing short- versus long-course antibiotic durations were identified through searches of PubMed and clinical guideline documents.

Content

Short-course antibiotic durations consistently result in similar treatment success rates as longer antibiotic courses among patients with community-acquired pneumonia, complicated urinary tract infections in women, gram-negative bacteraemia, and skin and soft tissue infections when the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate antimicrobials are used, and patients show clinical signs of improvement. For patients with osteomyelitis, 6 weeks of antibiotics is adequate for the treatment of osteomyelitis in the absence of implanted foreign bodies and surgical debridement. Whether durations can be further shortened with debridement is unclear, although small studies are promising.

Implications

With few exceptions, short courses were non-inferior to long courses; future research should focus on appropriately defining the patient population, ensuring the correct choice and dose of antimicrobials and developing meaningful outcomes relevant for frontline clinicians.

### A meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials comparing short-and long-course antibiotic therapy for urinary tract infections in children [^00006251]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Short-course antibiotic regimens, ranging in duration from a single dose to 3 days, are the current standard of care for the treatment of acute lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) in adult women. Despite multiple small randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) showing no difference in efficacy between short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) therapy in children, concerns about occult pyelonephritis and renal scarring have prompted standard recommendations of 7 to 14 days of antibiotics for UTIs in children.

Objective

To determine whether long-course antibiotic therapy is more effective than short-course therapy for the treatment of UTIs in children, and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity in the results of existing studies.

Methods

We searched online bibliographic databases (Medline and Cochrane Clinical Trials Registry) for RCTs comparing short- and long-course therapy for the treatment of UTI in children, and examined the references of all retrieved articles. Candidate studies for meta-analysis were restricted to RCTs comparing short-course (≤ 3 days) and long-course (7–14 days) outpatient therapy for acute UTI in children age 0 to 18 years. We excluded studies that were restricted to children with recurrent UTI or included children with asymptomatic bacteriuria. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated using a 9-item scoring system developed by the investigators. Data on the primary outcomes-treatment failure and reinfection rate-were extracted when available and reanalyzed based on intention to treat whenever possible. To determine whether anatomic level of infection (upper vs lower urinary tract) influenced the results, the meta-analysis was repeated on the subgroup of studies that attempted to restrict their participants to children with lower UTI. To determine whether there was a dose-response effect for the duration of short-course therapy, we performed separate subgroup analyses of studies of single-dose or single-day therapy and studies of 3-day therapy. To explore other potential sources of study result heterogeneity, such as study quality and patient age, we developed a random-effects regression model that included these variables as covariates.

Results

The pooled estimate for the relative risk (RR) of treatment failure with short-course antibiotic therapy was 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19–3.15) and for the RR of reinfection was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.39–1.47). When we excluded the 3 studies that did not attempt to restrict their participants to patients with lower UTI, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.74 (95% CI: 1.05–2.88) and of reinfection was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.32–1.52). For the subgroup of studies comparing single-dose or 1-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 2.73 (95% CI: 1.38–5.40) and of reinfection was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.12–1.18). For the subgroup of studies comparing 3-day therapy to long-course therapy, the pooled RR of treatment failure was 1.36 (95% CI: 0.68–2.72) and of reinfection was 0.99 (95% CI: 0.46–2.13). In the meta-regression, neither study quality nor mean participant age was significantly associated with the odds ratio of treatment failure or reinfection, in either the complete set of studies or the subset of studies restricted to patients with lower UTI.

Conclusions

In pooled analyses of published studies comparing long- and short-course antibiotic treatment of UTI in children, long-course therapy was associated with fewer treatment failures without a concomitant increase in reinfections, even when studies including patients with evidence of pyelonephritis were excluded from the analysis. Until there are more accurate methods for distinguishing upper from lower UTI in children, no additional comparative trials are warranted and clinicians should continue to treat children with UTI for 7 to 14 days.

### Meta-analyses in prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections [^60373424]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common, and complications result in significant morbidity and mortality and also consume resources. This overview summarizes the current evidence for the prevention and treatment of UTI in adults and children from meta-analyses. The quality and applicability of this evidence in clinical practice for different patient groups is discussed. Suggestions are made for future research, because it is apparent that there are evidence gaps for particular subgroups of people.

### Guidelines for the treatment of pneumonia and urinary tract infections: evaluation of methodological quality using the appraisal of guidelines, research and evaluation II instrument [^c10af6fc]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

Reliance on evidence-based medicine requires high methodological standards from guideline developers. We sought to determine the methodological quality of guidelines on pneumonia and urinary tract infections (UTIs). We included guidelines published by national or international committees in the last 10 years providing recommendations for antibiotic type or duration. We applied the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II checklist, adding under each item the specific focus relevant to bacterial infections, addressing antibiotic resistance and local epidemiology. Three assessors scored each guideline independently. Mean aggregated scores, converted to percentage per domain, are presented. We included 13 guidelines on the treatment of pneumonia and seven guidelines for the treatment of UTI. 'Scope and purpose' scored 69.4% for pneumonia and 71.4% for UTI. Guidelines were downgraded for lack of an epidemiological overview relevant to intended users. 'Stakeholder involvement' scored 39.5% for pneumonia and 44.5% UTI, with the major fault being lack of patient consultation. 'Rigour of development' scored 42.8% for pneumonia and 56.9% for UTI. Commonly, the search process lacked precision, no risk of bias assessment was performed, outcomes in primary studies were not critically assessed or used to direct recommendations, and there was no formal methodology for formulating recommendations. 'Clarity of presentation' scored highest: 67.7% for pneumonia and 68.5% for UTI. 'Applicability' of the guidelines in antibiotic stewardship programmes was usually not addressed: 16.9% and 25.4%, respectively. 'Editorial independence' scored 30.6% for pneumonia and 55.6% for UTI. Formal examination of guidelines in infectious diseases showed worrying findings related to core methodology and potential bias caused by competing interests.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^e6fdfc78]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) empiric therapy — process to guide choice proposes a four-step approach that includes assessing severity of illness for initial prioritization, considering patient-specific risk factors for resistant uropathogens to optimize coverage, evaluating other patient-specific considerations to reduce adverse events, and for patients with sepsis, consulting a relevant local antibiogram if available.

### Antibiotic stewardship in pediatrics [^f021b1d9]. Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Stewardship strategies in the inpatient setting — local guidelines — The development and dissemination of institutional guidelines for diagnosing and treating common infectious syndromes is a key function of stewardship programs, and guidelines provide evidence-based and standardized diagnostic and treatment recommendations based on local data and promote adherence to the use of formulary drugs. Antibiotic guidelines can be developed to target common indications for antibiotic use, such as community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, hospital- and ventilator-associated pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, intraabdominal infections, and neonatal and pediatric sepsis, and these indications represent the majority of antibiotic use in most institutions. Inpatient guidelines can discuss appropriate clinical criteria suggestive of bacterial infections, diagnostic testing (including imaging studies when needed), specific empirical and targeted therapy (including dosing and options for severe drug allergies), and appropriate durations of therapy.

### Diagnosis and management of acute pyelonephritis in adults [^cbea9908]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

There are approximately 250,000 cases of acute pyelonephritis each year, resulting in more than 100,000 hospitalizations. The most common etiologic cause is infection with Escherichia coli. The combination of the leukocyte esterase test and the nitrite test (with either test proving positive) has a sensitivity of 75 to 84 percent and a specificity of 82 to 98 percent for urinary tract infection. Urine cultures are positive in 90 percent of patients with acute pyelonephritis, and cultures should be obtained before antibiotic therapy is initiated. The use of blood cultures should be reserved for patients with an uncertain diagnosis, those who are immunocompromised, and those who are suspected of having hematogenous infections. Outpatient oral antibiotic therapy with a fluoroquinolone is successful in most patients with mild uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Other effective alternatives include extended-spectrum penicillins, amoxicillin-clavulanate potassium, cephalosporins, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Indications for inpatient treatment include complicated infections, sepsis, persistent vomiting, failed outpatient treatment, or extremes of age. In hospitalized patients, intravenous treatment is recommended with a fluoroquinolone, aminoglycoside with or without ampicillin, or a third-generation cephalosporin. The standard duration of therapy is seven to 14 days. Urine culture should be repeated one to two weeks after completion of antibiotic therapy. Treatment failure may be caused by resistant organisms, underlying anatomic/functional abnormalities, or immunosuppressed states. Lack of response should prompt repeat blood and urine cultures and, possibly, imaging studies. A change in antibiotics or surgical intervention may be required.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^2dd6efb9]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common drivers of antibiotic use and hospitalizations. In the United States, almost 10 million outpatients are diagnosed with UTIs each year, and UTIs account for 16% of all infectious disease-related hospitalizations and 6% of all infectious disease-related deaths. Despite various prevention strategies, recurrent UTIs are very common.

Any reduction of antibiotic exposure is important to diminish selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, costs, and drug-related side-effects. Current guidelines for antibiotic treatment duration of febrile UTI/pyelonephritis largely reflect expert opinion, as only few intervention studies compared different durations. Most studies in this regard were performed to establish short-term therapy in uncomplicated simple UTIs. Motivated by the emerging antibiotic resistance of uropathogens and the ecological effects of antibiotics, the minimal effective duration of antibiotic therapy is being challenged, especially in the elderly, in whom UTIs are often over diagnosed and therefore over treated. The use of biomarkers might improve the management of patients with UTIs.

The biomarker procalcitonin (PCT) was established for antibiotic stewardship in respiratory tract infections and sepsis. As an indicator for systemic infections, it showed high prognostic value to predict bacteremia in patients with urosepsis. In the PRORATA trial, which documented a safe reduction of antibiotic usage through a PCT-guided strategy in patients with sepsis, UTIs were the source of infection in 7% of patients. In patients with lower UTIs, PCT may need to be complemented with inflammatory surrogates of local infection such as pyuria. Normalization of pyuria in the first days after initiation of therapy correlated with a successful outcome in women with lower UTIs. Therefore, we assumed that an algorithm based on PCT and pyuria could safely reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with UTIs.

### Short-course therapy for urinary tract infections in children: the SCOUT randomized clinical trial [^84cfd348]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

There is a paucity of pediatric-specific comparative data to guide duration of therapy recommendations in children with urinary tract infection (UTI).

Objective

To compare the efficacy of standard-course and short-course therapy for children with UTI.

Design, Setting, Participants

The Short Course Therapy for Urinary Tract Infections (SCOUT) randomized clinical noninferiority trial took place at outpatient clinics and emergency departments at 2 children's hospitals from May 2012, through, August 2019. Data were analyzed from January 2020, through, February 2023. Participants included children aged 2 months to 10 years with UTI exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobials.

Intervention

Another 5 days of antimicrobials (standard-course therapy) or 5 days of placebo (short-course therapy).

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome, treatment failure, was defined as symptomatic UTI at or before the first follow-up visit (day 11 to 14). Secondary outcomes included UTI after the first follow-up visit, asymptomatic bacteriuria, positive urine culture, and gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Results

Analysis for the primary outcome included 664 randomized children (639 female [96%]; median age, 4 years). Among children evaluable for the primary outcome, 2 of 328 assigned to standard-course (0.6%) and 14 of 336 assigned to short-course (4.2%) had a treatment failure (absolute difference of 3.6% with upper bound 95% CI of 5.5.%). Children receiving short-course therapy were more likely to have asymptomatic bacteriuria or a positive urine culture at or by the first follow-up visit. There were no differences between groups in rates of UTI after the first follow-up visit, incidence of adverse events, or incidence of gastrointestinal colonization with resistant organisms.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, children assigned to standard-course therapy had lower rates of treatment failure than children assigned to short-course therapy. However, the low failure rate of short-course therapy suggests that it could be considered as a reasonable option for children exhibiting clinical improvement after 5 days of antimicrobial treatment.

### Antibiotic stewardship interventions for urinary tract infections in outpatient settings: a narrative review [^41ec04b0]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate antibiotic choice or duration of therapy for urinary tract infections (UTIs) in outpatients is common and is a major contributor to antibiotic overuse. Most studies on outpatient antibiotic stewardship for UTIs follow a pre-design or post-design with a multifaceted intervention; these trials generally have found improvement in appropriateness of antibiotic use for UTI. Audit and feedback was one of the most commonly employed strategies across these trials but may not be sustainable. Future research on antibiotic stewardship for UTIs in outpatients should measure both effectiveness and implementation success.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^3bbce08e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Blood cultures were obtained in 339 patients, of which 80 (24%) had bacteremia with growth of E. coli in the majority of the cases (n = 67, 84%).

Both treatment regimens resulted in a high clinical cure rate at short-term follow-up in the ITT population (90% vs. 95% in patients treated for 7 or 14 days, respectively) (Table 3). The difference in short-term clinical cure rate between both treatment arms was 4.5% (90% CI, –10.7 to 1.7, P non-inferiority = 0.072). Accordingly, the criteria for non-inferiority were not met as the 90% CI exceeded the predefined non-inferiority margin of 10%. The median time to defervescence did not differ between the two groups: 2 (IQR, 1–2) days in 7-day antimicrobial treatment, 2 (IQR, 1–3) days in 14-day antimicrobial treatment. Short-term clinical cure was 85% in non-randomized patients, whereas median time to defervescence amounted to 2 (IQR, 1–3) days. Among all analysis performed, there were no significant differences between ITT and PP analysis. Therefore, within the following, only outcomes of ITT analysis are presented.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^ec349743]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

As UTIs are one of the most common indications for antibiotic therapy, the impact of a reduction of treatment duration could be enormous. This study provides evidence that guidance of antibiotic therapy in patients with a UTI by a PCT-pyuria algorithm for antibiotic guidance is feasible. The implementation of an algorithm into clinical workflows is practicable as shown by our group in respiratory tract infections. The efficacy of this approach is evidenced by the 90 day observation period for the primary endpoint, which included both the initial and any subsequent antibiotic treatments.

Overall and in most subgroups (except for the small subgroup of patients with uncomplicated simple UTIs), the PCT-pyuria algorithm led to shorter initial duration of antibiotic therapy. The tested algorithm can help to determine the optimal length of antibiotic therapy and avoid antibiotic overuse.

There was an imbalance in randomization of eight patients with uncomplicated simple UTI with only two being randomized to the PCT-pyuria group. Since all six patients in the standard guidelines group were treated according to our algorithm with single-dose fosfomycin, the median duration of the initial antibiotic therapy in this subgroup was similar between both groups.

Only one patient in the PCT-pyuria group, who relapsed with urosepsis and had to be hospitalized for 3 days and treated with intravenous antibiotics, was initially treated with NSAIDs according to the study protocol. Given the small number of outpatients, the safety of NSAIDs for simple uncomplicated UTIs cannot be determined based on our study. Despite recent data with promising results for this approach, a recent review emphasized the need for immediate antimicrobial therapy rather than delayed treatment or symptomatic management with ibuprofen alone.

### Antibiotic prescribing patterns for adult urinary tract infections within emergency department and urgent care settings [^40f2f18f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a common reason for emergency department (ED) and urgent care (UC) visits. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are frequently prescribed for treatment of UTI in the outpatient setting; however, data evaluating prescribing patterns after FDA safety warnings is limited, especially in UC. The study goal was to investigate and compare antimicrobial prescribing for UTIs in a single-site ED and an off-site UC in an urban, academic health system. This retrospective study included patients presenting with a UTI to the ED or UC between January and June 2018. Those 18 years or older with uncomplicated, complicated UTI, or pyelonephritis were included. Exclusion criteria were catheter-related UTI, urinary tract abnormalities, immunocompromised, or hospitalization. Primary outcome was FQ prescribing rate for all UTI in the ED and UC. Secondary outcomes were rates of non-FQ prescribing, re-presentation, bug-drug mismatch, and treatment durations. 184 patients were included. FQ prescribing rate was similar in ED and UC (21.2% vs. 16.3%, p = 0.4). Non-FQs prescribed in ED and UC were nitrofurantoin (20.2% vs 53.6%), beta-lactams (46.1% vs 22.6%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (12.5% vs. 5%). A longer than recommended duration was identified in 46.3% UC patients compared to 21.2% ED patients. Thirty-day re-presentation with persistent UTI symptoms occurred more frequently in the ED compared to UC (13.5% vs. 7.5%). Predictors of FQ prescribing on logistic regression were male, recurrent UTI, and malignancy. FQ prescribing rate for UTI treatment was low with no difference between ED and UC. Opportunity exists to improve treatment duration and antimicrobial choice.

### A collaborative approach intended to reduce the duration of short term urinary catheters in adult patients at a tertiary care medical center also significantly reduced the duration of hospitalization [^594ac853]. American Journal of Infection Control (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections are the leading cause of nosocomial infections in the United States. The major contributing factor is the placement of indwelling urinary catheters.

Methods

Following a chart review of adult patients hospitalized at a tertiary care medical center who required the use of a short-term (≤ 2 weeks) indwelling urinary catheter, a collaborative effort was initiated by an Infectious Diseases physician to develop protocols focused on the clinical service involved for the expeditious removal of short-term indwelling urinary catheters. The protocols relied in part on the standards of practice by pertinent medical/surgical subspecialty societies. Usage of urinary catheters and duration of hospitalization following implementation of the protocols was assessed.

Results

Based on a multivariate analysis controlling for demographic variables, comorbidities, medical vs surgical service, and indication for the urinary catheterization, the median duration of catheterization was significantly reduced from 6.7 days to 3.6 days after the protocols were initiated (P < .001), and the median duration of hospitalization was significantly reduced from 9.5 days to 5.9 days (P < .001). No patient had to have the urinary catheter reinserted.

Conclusions

Development of collaborative protocols for the removal of short-term indwelling urinary catheters significantly reduced both the duration of catheterization and the duration of hospitalization.

### Incidence of pediatric urinary tract infections before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^a949aa13]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Primary Outcome

Our primary outcome was the incidence of UTI diagnosis in any ambulatory or inpatient setting. Due to ongoing controversy surrounding the appropriate diagnostic criteria for UTI and because claims databases do not provide urinalysis or urine culture results, a UTI diagnosis code plus antibiotic treatment was used to define UTI diagnosis (hereafter referred to as UTI). Urinary tract infection diagnosis codes included all ICD-10 codes corresponding to pediatric UTI, cystitis, and/or pyelonephritis (eTable 1 in Supplement 1). Previous work has reported that the positive predictive value of ICD-9 codes for UTI in hospitalized patients is low (50%-61% using laboratory-confirmed UTI as the reference standard); however, the positive predictive value increases considerably (85%-93%) using provider-confirmed UTI via medical record review as the highest standard. For this reason, we opted to add the requirement of evidence of an accompanying claim for an antibiotic prescription fill with a course duration of 14 days or less within 7 days of the initial diagnosis or an inpatient antibiotic code (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) for UTI-related antibiotics (eTable 2 in Supplement 1). Any diagnosis of UTI occurring within 2 weeks of a previous diagnosis counted as a singular diagnosis due to potential return visits for the same infection. A 2-week time period was selected since the longest recommended duration for antibiotic treatment is 14 days. For infants aged 60 days or younger, we excluded diagnoses of UTI that occurred within 0 to 3 days of age due to an extremely low likelihood of UTI in this age groupand the possibility that a maternal UTI diagnosis code could carry over into the birth hospitalization. In MarketScan, the principal diagnosis code is not necessarily the one listed in the primary diagnostic position of inpatient visits, and since outpatient billing codes do not have principal diagnosis codes, we allowed for UTI diagnosis codes to be in any position.

### Treatment duration of febrile urinary tract infection: a pragmatic randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled non-inferiority trial in men and women [^5526d411]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Main outcome measures

The primary endpoint was the clinical cure rate through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit (short-term clinical cure). Clinical cure was defined as being alive with absence of fever and resolution of UTI symptoms (either absence of symptoms or at least 2 points improvement on a 0–5 point severity score scale), without additional antimicrobial therapy (for relapse of UTI). Secondary outcome measures were bacteriological cure through the 10- to 18-day post-treatment visit, clinical cure rate through the 70- to 84-day post-treatment visit (cumulative clinical cure), all-cause mortality, adverse event rate determined at 10–18 days and 70–84 days post-treatment, and rate of UTI relapses. In addition, outcome measures were analyzed as stratified by specific predefined subgroups (men, patients with complicated UTI, older age, patients with bacteremic UTI). Bacteriologic cure was defined as eradication of the study entry uropathogen with no recurrence of bacteriuria (pathogen growth < 10 4 CFU/mL in women or < 10 3 CFU/mL in men of a midstream urine culture combined with disappearance of leucocyturia).

### The best rules for antimicrobial stewardship in urogenital tract infections [^5b3f0c5f]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) belong to the most common community-acquired and nosocomial infections, but therapy of UTIs is limited by resistance of pathogens and nonoptimal using of antibacterials. Narrative review of recent (2020–2018) literature dedicated to antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) in urological infections has been done.

Recent Findings

Analysis of recent 64 articles has shown following principles of AMS for UTIs: selecting the correct drug, correct dose, and shortest clinically effective duration of therapy whenever possible, is a base for optimal antimicrobial stewardship; symptomatic UTIs should be treated with antimicrobials to alleviate symptoms, and in the case of more serious infection, to prevent complications; in both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection, quantitative culture is the gold standard for diagnosis; we have to avoid prescriptions of antibiotics when possible; we have to follow European and National Guidelines; we must avoid prescription of fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy for UTIs by many reasons, one of these is urogenital tuberculosis; the choice of antibiotic for UTI should be based on local level of resistance of uropathogens.

Summary

Studies of antimicrobial stewardship in urology are limited. Nevertheless, there are some golden rules, which may help to reduce inappropriate use of antimicrobials, improve patient outcomes, reduce side effects of antibiotic therapy, decrease the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant infections, as well as decrease total costs of the therapy.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^213fe7b0]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We aim to compare the effect of short versus long treatment duration in Gram-negative bacteremia on all-cause mortality in pre-specified sub-groups.

Methods

Individual participant data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short (≤ 7) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. Participants were adults (≥ 18 years), with Gram-negative bacteremia during hospital stay. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science to identify trials conducted up to May 2022. Primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, relapse of bacteremia, length of hospital stay, readmission, local or distant infection complications, adverse events, and resistance emergence. Outcomes were assessed in pre-specified subgroups: women vs men; non-urinary vs urinary source; presence vs absence of hypotension on initial presentation; immunocompromised patients versus non-immunocompromised patients, and age (above/below 65). Fixed-effect meta-analysis model was used to estimate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). All three trials had low risk of bias for allocation generation and concealment.

Findings

Three RCTs (1186 patients) were included; 1121 with enterobacterales bacteremia. No significant difference in mortality was demonstrated between 7- and 14-days treatment (90-day mortality: OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.73–1.58; 30-day mortality: 1.08, 0.62–1.91). Relapse (1.00, 0.50–1.97); length of hospital stay (P = 0.78); readmission (0.96, 0.80–1.22); and infection complications (local: 1.62 0.76–3.47; distant: 2.00, 0.18–22.08), were without significant difference, and so were adverse events or resistance emergence. No significant difference in clinical outcomes between 7 and 14 days of antibiotics was demonstrated in the subgroups of gender, age, hemodynamic status, immune status, and source of infection.

Interpretation

For patients hemodynamically stable and afebrile at 48 h prior to discontinuation, seven days of antibiotic therapy for enterobacterales bacteremia result in similar outcomes as 14 days, in terms of mortality, relapse, length of hospital stay, complications of infection, resistance emergence, and adverse events. These results apply for any adult age group, gender, source of infection, immune status, and hemodynamic status on presentation.

Funding

There was no funding source for this study.

### Procalcitonin and pyuria-based algorithm reduces antibiotic use in urinary tract infections: a randomized controlled trial [^3aae425a]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common drivers of antibiotic use. The minimal effective duration of antibiotic therapy for UTIs is unknown, but any reduction is important to diminish selection pressure for antibiotic resistance, costs, and drug-related side-effects. The aim of this study was to investigate whether an algorithm based on procalcitonin (PCT) and quantitative pyuria reduces antibiotic exposure.

Methods

From April 2012 to March 2014, we conducted a factorial design randomized controlled open-label trial. Immunocompetent adults with community-acquired non-catheter-related UTI were enrolled in the emergency department of a tertiary-care 600-bed hospital in northwestern Switzerland. Clinical presentation was used to guide initiation and duration of antibiotic therapy according to current guidelines (control group) or with a PCT-pyuria-based algorithm (PCT-pyuria group).

The primary endpoint was overall antibiotic exposure within 90 days. Secondary endpoints included duration of the initial antibiotic therapy, persistent infection 7 days after end of therapy and 30 days after enrollment, recurrence and rehospitalizations within 90 days.

Results

Overall, 394 patients were screened, 228 met predefined exclusion criteria, 30 declined to participate, and 11 were not eligible. Of these, 125 (76% women) were enrolled in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 96 patients with microbiologically confirmed UTI constituted the per protocol group; 84 of 125 (67%) patients had a febrile UTI, 28 (22%) had bacteremia, 5 (4%) died, and 3 (2%) were lost to follow-up. Overall antibiotic exposure within 90 days was shorter in the PCT-pyuria group than in the control group (median 7.0 [IQR, 5.0–14.0] vs. 10.0 [IQR, 7.0–16.0] days, P = 0.011) in the ITT analysis. Mortality, rates of persistent infections, recurrences, and rehospitalizations were not different.

Conclusions

A PCT-pyuria-based algorithm reduced antibiotic exposure by 30% when compared to current guidelines without apparent negative effects on clinical outcomes.

### CQUIN audit for prescription of antibiotics for urinary tract infections in an acute medical assessment unit [^8394d24a]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Problem

We needed to assess whether urinary tract infections (UTIs) presenting on an acute medical assessment unit in a district general hospital were being treated with antibiotics that complied with hospital guidelines, which are based on local bacterial prevalences and sensitivities. Non-compliance can lead to inappropriate duration of treatment, requirements for further course of different antibiotics, increased length of stay, and ultimately increased morbidity and mortality.

### Duration of antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia-systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis [^475c2152]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gram-negative bacteremia is common in both community and health care settings, with a significant increase in incidence described for some Gram-negative bacteria in recent years. Prolonged duration of antibiotic therapy for such common infections may lead to increased resistance emergence; adverse events and secondary infections, including Clostridioides difficile infection; prolonged hospital-stay; and excess cost.

tThough recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the non-inferiority of shorter antibiotic courses for Gram-negative bacteremia, prolonged courses are still commonly used and current guidelines still recommend the range of 7–14 days. In addition, it is unclear whether shorter courses of antibiotics are appropriate for specific sub-groups of patients, such as those with non-urinary source of bacteremia; intensive care patients, elderly, and others.

Observational design is a limited tool for evaluating duration of therapy due to confounding by indication and immortal time bias issues. Thus, RCTs are the preferred design to answer this question. Individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of RCTs is considered to be the gold standard of systematic review. IPD meta-analysis advantages (among others) are narrowing the confidence intervals, and increasing the power to evaluate treatment effect in specific sub-groups of patients.

We performed an IPD meta-analysis of RCTs evaluating short (≤ 7 days) versus longer (> 7 days) antibiotic treatment for Gram-negative bacteremia. We aimed to explore outcomes in several pre-specified sub-groups of patients. We hypothesized no significant difference between short and long antibiotic course for either of the sub-groups.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^408a6c9a]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

For nonurologic underlying conditions affecting the kidneys, RCTs that did not exclude renal impairment showed no difference comparing ≤ 3 versus ≥ 4 days IV of a total of 8–15 days, although renal impairment was not analyzed separately. Postrenal transplant, expert opinion recommends 14 days total for febrile UTI/pyelonephritis, switching from IV with clinical improvement.

Although immunocompromised children were unusually included in a study of febrile UTI, numbers were too small to extrapolate findings of shorter antibiotic durations. A small study found children with cancer often have few classic UTI symptoms, so diagnosis and definitive treatment may be delayed. Immunocompromised children usually have multiple admissions and antibiotic courses, so they are more likely to have unusual bacteria or resistance. Once definitive treatment starts, there is no reason for prolonged courses in this or other chronic conditions (eg, diabetes and liver disease).

For children with significant urologic abnormalities, the only study comparing total antibiotic duration included 23% with urological abnormalities and found no difference between 6–9 and ≥ 10 days in treatment failure/recurrence, although it did not analyze them separately. Two RCTs investigating IV duration for febrile UTI included 34% and 37% children with VUR, respectively, and found no difference between 3 and ≥ 7 days IV of a total 8–15 days. A retrospective study including 1930 children with urological abnormalities found they were more likely to be treated with ≥ 4 days than ≤ 3 days IV (total 7–14 days), but this was not associated with outcomes. A retrospective study including urological abnormality compared 1 day versus 2–3 days' IV (median total 10 days) and found no difference in readmission, although outcomes were not analyzed by urological abnormality. Recruitment is currently underway for an RCT of cUTI comparing 1 versus 3 days of IV of a total of 7 days of antibiotics.

For children with multiple recurrent UTIs, antibiotic duration should be tailored to each individual acute UTI presentation. Multiple antibiotic courses for recurrent UTIs increase the likelihood of resistance. Longer admissions (although not antibiotic durations) have been shown for ESBL-E UTIs than for non-ESBL-E UTI. IV treatment via hospital-in-the-home programs could shorten hospital length of stay. For resistant UTIs, a comparison of IV durations of ≥ 3 days with 0–2 days showed no difference in recurrence, although total duration was not reported. Definitive antibiotic treatment should not usually need a longer duration simply due to resistance.

### Comparative effectiveness of antibiotic treatment duration in children with pyelonephritis [^9f3b9489]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

Our findings suggest that children receiving a short course (median 8 days) vs a prolonged course (median 11 days) of antibiotic therapy for the treatment of pyelonephritis experience similar clinical outcomes. Although results did not achieve statistical significance, children who received a short course of antibiotic therapy may be less likely to have subsequent infections within the following 30 days with a more resistant strain of the same uropathogen (40% vs 64%). This finding adds to the growing body of evidence supporting shorter durations of therapy than traditionally prescribed for the treatment of common bacterial infections.

To our knowledge, this is the first comparative effectiveness research study evaluating the optimal duration of therapy for pyelonephritis in children. Our data provide evidence that may help guide treatment recommendations for a common pediatric infection, particularly when combined with the high-quality randomized clinical trial data supporting shorter (5–7 days) durations of therapy for adults with pyelonephritis. Furthermore, our study included populations frequently excluded from traditional comparative effectiveness UTI studies, including those with immunocompromised systems, structural urologic abnormalities, and previous UTIs, increasing the generalizability of our findings to the pediatric population at highest risk for the development of pyelonephritis.

We found that children aged 4 to 13 years had a significantly higher odds of treatment failure (regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed) than children aged less than 4 years or greater than 14 years. We hypothesize that this finding was likely due to differences in risk factors in the aged 4 to 13 years group compared with younger and older children. A possible explanation for the development of UTIs in healthy children less than aged 4 years is evolving elimination and hygiene practices during infancy and toilet training periods,; whereas children older than 14 years are more likely to experience UTIs related to sexual activity. Children between these ages, however, are less likely to develop UTIs unless there are anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract, neurological abnormalities, or functional bowel control conditions. The presence of underlying urologic abnormalities was independently associated with treatment failure, regardless of the duration of therapy prescribed.

### The personalized treatment of invasive candidiasis still has a long way to go [^901cd514]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The individualization of treatment duration for candidemia and/or IC remains challenging.

The prolonged use of antibiotics can disrupt the host's microbiota and induce resistance in pathogens, leading to suggestions from guidelines such as the Surviving Sepsis Campaign's sepsis and septic shock guidelines to use shorter courses of treatment whenever possible. However, these suggestions are limited to bacterial causes of pneumonia, intra-abdominal infections, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream infections, excluding candidemia and/or IC. Currently, treatment continues for two weeks after two negative blood cultures, following infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) and European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (ESCMID) guidelines, to prevent recurrence. However, this "one-size-fits-all" approach may not suit all patients and could unnecessarily prolong hospital stays, increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) and antibiotic resistance, and escalate healthcare costs.

### Guidelines for complicated urinary tract infections in children: a review by the European society for pediatric infectious diseases [^ca0d435c]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

In neonates and infants < 2 months, common pathogens include E. coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp. Enterobacter spp. group B streptococcus and Enterococcus spp. In preterm infants, hematogenous transmission is more prevalent, with CoNS and Candida spp. being causative pathogens. Empirical IV ampicillin and gentamicin are recommended for neonatal UTI by the World Health Organization. Resistance should be considered with maternal history of antibiotics during pregnancyor maternal ESBL-E cultured. Empirical treatment should be based on maternal isolates, although if unable to access these, gentamicin is usually sufficient. For prolonged stays in neonatal intensive care, resistant hospital pathogens, including MRSA, should be considered with empirical vancomycin if the infant is severely unwell.

Once culture results are available, empiric antibiotics can be targeted and potentially narrowed.

Antibiotic Duration and Timing of IV to Oral Switch

For most children with cUTI, there is not enough evidence to support varying from current practice and expert opinion recommending a total of 10–14 days (GRADE D).
When IV antibiotics are started, recommended IV durations vary between ≤ 3 days and ≤ 7 days depending on the cUTI subgroup and presence of bacteremia, with an early switch when the child is afebrile and clinically well (GRADES C and D).
Longer total durations (up to 21 days) may be needed for renal abscesses or nephronia, and renal USS is recommended after 14 days to determine progress and ultimate antibiotic duration (GRADE B).
For frequently relapsing UTI with the same organism, investigations should assess for an ongoing focal source of infection (GRADE D).
Shorter total durations (6–9 days) and a single dose IV component show early promise, but prospective studies are needed with more children with complicated UTI (GRADES C and D).

### Antibiotic management of urinary tract infection in elderly patients in primary care and its association with bloodstream infections and all cause mortality: population based cohort study [^52fbfba1]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

In the context of randomised controlled trials, strict exclusion criteria particularly related to age have been applied that prevent the results being generalised to older adult populations who may require a different approach in the management of UTI. In contrast, our study specifically looked at the group of older patients (> 65 years) who are more susceptible to complications and are often neglected in UTI related research. We showed that antibiotics prescribed at the time of UTI diagnosis may benefit this vulnerable population by significantly reducing the risk of all cause mortality and the rate of bloodstream infection and hospital admission.

Recent guidance from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence has proposed no antibiotic or delayed antibiotic prescriptions when infection is likely to be self limiting in an effort to reduce inappropriate prescribing. Evidence and recommendations, however, refer mainly to upper respiratory tract infections. Evidence is nonetheless emerging that delayed prescribing in the treatment of UTI is becoming more acceptable in practice.

A randomised controlled trial evaluated various antibiotic management strategies, including empirical delayed (by 48 hours) antibiotics and immediate antibiotics strategies for UTI in women younger than 70 years. No significant differences in symptom duration, severity, or frequency of symptoms between the strategies were reported. In our study, deferred antibiotics were associated with less severe adverse outcomes than no antibiotics for older adults but still showed a significantly higher risk of mortality compared with immediate antibiotics.

The question remains as to why a significant proportion (about 7%) of vulnerable older patients had a diagnosis of UTI but were not prescribed antibiotics. It could be patient or doctor choice, but it is also possible that antimicrobial stewardship programmes and quality premium payments are encouraging a culture of more judicious antibiotic use. Public Health England recently reported a 13.2% reduction in antibiotic prescribing in primary care between 2013 and 2017.

There is also a major concern about the risk of C difficile infection in elderly people associated with antibiotic use, which also includes trimethoprim.

Other circumstances, such as the presence of mild urinary symptoms, may encourage clinicians to withhold antibiotics in the context of a working diagnosis of UTI. Nevertheless, if this explanation holds true, patients with disease not severe enough to prompt antibiotic treatment are at risk of severe consequences.

### Assessment of the appropriateness of antimicrobial use in US hospitals [^382f912d]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Hospital antimicrobial consumption data are widely available; however, large-scale assessments of the quality of antimicrobial use in US hospitals are limited.

Objective

To evaluate the appropriateness of antimicrobial use for hospitalized patients treated for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or urinary tract infection (UTI) present at admission or for patients who had received fluoroquinolone or intravenous vancomycin treatment.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cross-sectional study included data from a prevalence survey of hospitalized patients in 10 Emerging Infections Program sites. Random samples of inpatients on hospital survey dates from May 1 to September 30, 2015, were identified. Medical record data were collected for eligible patients with 1 or more of 4 treatment events (CAP, UTI, fluoroquinolone treatment, or vancomycin treatment), which were selected on the basis of common infection types reported and antimicrobials given to patients in the prevalence survey. Data were analyzed from August 1, 2017, to May 31, 2020.

Exposure

Antimicrobial treatment for CAP or UTI or with fluoroquinolones or vancomycin.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The percentage of antimicrobial use that was supported by medical record data (including infection signs and symptoms, microbiology test results, and antimicrobial treatment duration) or for which some aspect of use was unsupported. Unsupported antimicrobial use was defined as (1) use of antimicrobials to which the pathogen was not susceptible, use in the absence of documented infection signs or symptoms, or use without supporting microbiologic data; (2) use of antimicrobials that deviated from recommended guidelines; or (3) use that exceeded the recommended duration.

Results

Of 12 299 patients, 1566 patients (12.7%) in 192 hospitals were included; the median age was 67 years (interquartile range, 53–79 years), and 864 (55.2%) were female. A total of 219 patients (14.0%) were included in the CAP analysis, 452 (28.9%) in the UTI analysis, 550 (35.1%) in the fluoroquinolone analysis, and 403 (25.7%) in the vancomycin analysis; 58 patients (3.7%) were included in both fluoroquinolone and vancomycin analyses. Overall, treatment was unsupported for 876 of 1566 patients (55.9%; 95% CI, 53.5%-58.4%): 110 of 403 (27.3%) who received vancomycin, 256 of 550 (46.6%) who received fluoroquinolones, 347 of 452 (76.8%) with a diagnosis of UTI, and 174 of 219 (79.5%) with a diagnosis of CAP. Among patients with unsupported treatment, common reasons included excessive duration (103 of 174 patients with CAP [59.2%]) and lack of documented infection signs or symptoms (174 of 347 patients with UTI [50.1%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings suggest that standardized assessments of hospital antimicrobial prescribing quality can be used to estimate the appropriateness of antimicrobial use in large groups of hospitals. These assessments, performed over time, may inform evaluations of the effects of antimicrobial stewardship initiatives nationally.

Regarding specific circumstances for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend to consider initiating antimicrobial treatment to reduce the risk of subsequent CA-UTI in female patients with CA-ASB persisting 48 hours after short-term indwelling catheter removal.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for urinary tract infections after removal of urinary catheter: meta-analysis [^208ee87f]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Urinary catheterization is common in patients in hospital, particularly for surgical patients in the perioperative period when physiological mechanisms of bladder emptying are suspended. Catheterization of the urinary tract, however, is associated with an increased risk of bacteriuria and symptomatic urinary tract infection, the risk being associated with the duration of catheterization. National guidelines recommend removal of urinary catheters once they are no longer needed, and surgical experts advocate discontinuation of catheterization as early as 24–48 hours postoperatively. Bacteriuria in a patient with a catheter, however, can persist after the catheter is removed and can develop into a symptomatic urinary tract infection. Manipulation of the catheter itself during removal might also predispose to infection. Current definitions' from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) for catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) reflect this by identifying infections up to 48 hours after catheter removal as catheter associated.

Whether administration of prophylactic antibiotics when the catheter is removed will prevent subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infection is unclear. Randomized trials have yielded conflicting results, and there has been no meta-analysis. Also, there is considerable heterogeneity in the management of antimicrobial prophylaxis around removal of a urinary catheter. The 2009 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of catheter associated urinary tract infection determined that there was insufficient evidence to recommend widespread antibiotic prophylaxis after catheterization. In contrast, in their 2008 best practice policy statement the American Urological Association (AUA) concluded that antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for patients with bacteriuria at time of catheter removal, particularly for those with certain risk factors (such as advanced age, immunodeficiency, or anatomic abnormalities of the urinary tract).

We performed a meta-analysis of controlled trials to clarify whether antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of urinary catheter removal confers a benefit in terms of preventing subsequent symptomatic urinary tract infections.
