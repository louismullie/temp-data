## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about formoterol's role in asthma management, including its pharmacology, evidence base, guideline positioning, dosing, safety, and practical implementation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and pharmacologic profile. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for as-needed ICS–formoterol versus SABA and versus maintenance ICS. Next, I will review guideline recommendations across GINA, VA/DoD, and NHLBI. After that, I need to check dosing limits, device considerations, and age-related nuances. Finally, I will examine safety signals, FDA labeling constraints, and synthesize a practical, stepwise clinical recommendation with caveats and monitoring needs.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and core pharmacology. Formoterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist with rapid onset, typically within 1–3 minutes, and a duration around 12 hours, which underpins its use both as maintenance bronchodilation and as a reliever when combined with an inhaled corticosteroid in single-inhaler regimens [^bfc1dd04] [^9ea85ba7]. Wait, let me verify the receptor selectivity claim; in vitro data show more than 200-fold greater beta2 versus beta1 activity, which aligns with the clinical bronchodilator profile and relatively lower cardiac signal at therapeutic doses, though clinical extrapolation should be cautious [^59045867].

> Next, I should review the pivotal evidence for as-needed ICS–formoterol in mild asthma. The SYGMA 1 and SYGMA 2 programs demonstrated that as-needed budesonide–formoterol reduced severe exacerbations by roughly 50–60% versus as-needed SABA and achieved noninferiority to daily budesonide for exacerbation risk, with substantially lower cumulative ICS exposure in the as-needed arm, which is clinically meaningful for steroid-sparing strategies [^ab1af738] [^b550ba8d]. Hold on, I should verify the magnitude; yes, meta-analytic summaries consistently cite a 60–64% reduction in severe exacerbations versus SABA alone, reinforcing the anti-inflammatory reliever concept in mild disease [^10aa712a].

> I will now examine the evidence base for maintenance-and-reliever therapy in moderate-to-severe asthma. Multiple randomized trials and Cochrane reviews show that budesonide–formoterol MART reduces severe exacerbations and oral steroid use compared with fixed-dose ICS–LABA plus SABA, with similar or better asthma control and lower total ICS dose, supporting both efficacy and steroid-sparing benefits in real-world settings [^74625d36] [^c1e070bc]. Let me double-check the magnitude; pooled analyses suggest about a 25–30% reduction in exacerbations versus comparator regimens, which is consistent across several studies and underpins guideline endorsement [^74625d36] [^fc6e8cf3].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. GINA 2024 recommends as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol as the preferred reliever across Steps 1–2 and MART as preferred for Steps 3–5 in adults and adolescents, reflecting both exacerbation risk reduction and simplicity of a single inhaler strategy [^4adef1d0] [^8e0585ff]. The VA/DoD 2025 guideline suggests ICS plus rapid-onset LABA (formoterol) as both controller and reliever for patients 12 years and older, with stronger recommendations in those uncontrolled on ICS alone, and explicitly notes that formoterol is the LABA studied and effective in this role [^cb344c57] [^f615c13d]. NHLBI 2020 conditionally recommends SMART for Steps 3–4 with high certainty of evidence, emphasizing reduced exacerbations and similar or lower steroid exposure compared with alternatives [^5217db2e].

> Hold on, I should verify dosing limits and device considerations because these affect safety and implementation. For patients 12 years and older, the maximum total daily formoterol dose is 54 mcg (12 puffs of 4.5 mcg), and for ages 4–11 years it is 36 mcg (8 puffs), with counseling to contact a clinician if exceeding these thresholds or if symptoms persist despite use [^cdabadb9] [^861f4ac7]. I need to ensure device choice is addressed; combination ICS–formoterol products are preferred over separate inhalers to support adherence, and patients require education on purpose, frequency, and technique to avoid overuse and to recognize worsening control [^c7159e56] [^2f52c918].

> I should confirm safety signals and regulatory nuances. Large FDA-mandated safety studies show that budesonide–formoterol is noninferior to budesonide alone for serious asthma-related events, with fewer exacerbations, supporting the safety of combination therapy when ICS is present [^15c71619] [^19c0b017]. But wait, what if formoterol is used without ICS? Historical and contemporary data indicate increased risk of serious asthma events with LABA monotherapy, which is why GINA and labeling discourage LABA without ICS and restrict some formoterol products to COPD maintenance only, not asthma [^5597e174] [^de064b49]. I should double-check pediatric data; while adult safety is reassuring, pediatric event counts are smaller and certainty is lower, so shared decision-making and close follow-up are prudent in children [^811cbb10].

> Let me consider special populations and implementation barriers. For children 5–11 years, evidence is less robust than in adults, though GINA includes MART as an option and emphasizes careful monitoring; FeNO can be considered to guide anti-inflammatory therapy when uncertainty exists in persistent allergic asthma [^b4341bb2]. I need to check access and formulary issues; cost and coverage can limit availability of ICS–formoterol, and clinicians may need to simulate the strategy with separate ICS and formoterol inhalers or consider ICS–SABA where available, while counseling on correct timing and technique to preserve anti-inflammatory benefit [^2f52c918] [^b38e841e].

> Next, I should review comparative effectiveness versus other reliever strategies. As-needed ICS–formoterol consistently outperforms SABA-only reliever strategies for exacerbation prevention, and compared with daily ICS plus SABA, it achieves similar or better exacerbation outcomes with lower cumulative steroid exposure, which is a key advantage in mild asthma [^ab1af738] [^b550ba8d]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ICS–SABA reliever might have equivalent data; hold on, I should verify. The evidence base for ICS–SABA is smaller and more recent, whereas ICS–formoterol has multiple large RCTs and meta-analyses, so ICS–formoterol remains the preferred, better-evidenced option where available [^95cb081d] [^10aa712a].

> I will now synthesize a practical, stepwise approach. For adults and adolescents with mild asthma, prescribe as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol as the reliever, replacing SABA-only rescue, with education on correct use and a hard cap of 12 puffs/day of formoterol and a low threshold to escalate if frequent use emerges [^4adef1d0] [^861f4ac7]. For those with moderate-to-severe asthma or uncontrolled symptoms on ICS alone, implement MART with a single ICS–formoterol inhaler for maintenance and relief, again respecting the 12-puff/day formoterol limit and arranging close follow-up to titrate the maintenance dose and reinforce technique [^cb344c57] [^cdabadb9]. If ICS–formoterol is unavailable, consider separate ICS and formoterol inhalers used together as needed, or ICS–SABA where accessible, with explicit counseling to avoid LABA monotherapy and to monitor for overuse [^2f52c918] [^b38e841e].

> Finally, I need to ensure key safety counseling is explicit. Emphasize that formoterol should never be used without ICS in asthma, that exceeding the daily puff limit warrants reassessment of control and possible step-up, and that patients should seek urgent care if symptoms rapidly worsen despite appropriate use, aligning with both evidence and labeling cautions [^5597e174] [^3423c8d5]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with the totality of evidence; yes, across RCTs, meta-analyses, and guidelines, the balance of benefits and risks favors ICS–formoterol strategies when implemented with education and monitoring, which is why it has become a cornerstone of modern asthma care in adolescents and adults [^4adef1d0] [^cb344c57].

Formoterol is a **rapid-onset, long-acting beta2-agonist** (LABA) used for asthma and COPD, providing both quick relief and sustained bronchodilation [^9ea85ba7]. It is **safe and effective when combined with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)** [^15c71619], reducing exacerbations and improving control across severities [^74625d36] [^ab1af738]. Formoterol is unique among LABAs for its fast onset, enabling use as both maintenance and reliever therapy in single-inhaler regimens (SMART/MART) [^4adef1d0] [^5217db2e], which lowers exacerbation risk versus SABA-only rescue [^ab1af738] [^10aa712a]. It is not recommended as monotherapy due to LABA-related risks [^5597e174] [^3423c8d5]; always pair with ICS in asthma [^cb344c57]. Common adverse effects are tremor, palpitations, and headache; monitor for cardiovascular effects, especially at high doses [^77fb294f] [^3423c8d5].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Selective beta2-adrenergic agonist causing bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation [^59045867].
- **Onset and duration**: Rapid onset (1–3 min) and long duration (≈12 h), supporting both rescue and maintenance use [^9ea85ba7] [^bfc1dd04].
- **Receptor selectivity**: High beta2 selectivity (> 200-fold vs beta1), minimizing cardiac effects at therapeutic doses [^59045867].

---

## Clinical indications

Formoterol is indicated for **asthma** as combination therapy with ICS for maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART/MART) in adults and adolescents [^4adef1d0] [^5217db2e], and for **COPD** as maintenance bronchodilator therapy [^de064b49].

---

## Clinical efficacy

- **Asthma**: Improves lung function, symptoms, and quality of life; reduces exacerbations when combined with ICS [^74625d36] [^ab1af738].
- **COPD**: Improves FEV1, symptoms, and exercise tolerance; reduces exacerbations and rescue use [^9ea85ba7] [^8fef7b5f].
- **SMART/MART**: Single-inhaler ICS–formoterol reduces severe exacerbations versus SABA-only rescue and versus fixed-dose ICS–LABA plus SABA [^ab1af738] [^74625d36].

---

## Safety profile and adverse effects

- **Common adverse effects**: Tremor, palpitations, headache, muscle cramps, and hypokalemia [^notfound].
- **Serious adverse effects**: Rare asthma-related deaths and intubations, especially with LABA monotherapy; risk is mitigated by ICS co-use [^5597e174] [^15c71619].
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease; monitor for tachycardia and arrhythmias [^3423c8d5].

---

## Regulatory considerations

Formoterol is **FDA-approved for COPD maintenance** but not for asthma monotherapy; in asthma, it must be used with ICS [^de064b49] [^5597e174]. Maximum recommended daily dose is 12 puffs (54 mcg) in adults and adolescents [^cdabadb9] [^861f4ac7].

---

## Comparison with other LABAs

| **Parameter** | **Formoterol** | **Salmeterol** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset of action | Rapid (1–3 min) | Slow (10–20 min) |
| Duration of action | ≈12 h | ≈12 h |
| Clinical use | Maintenance and reliever (SMART/MART) | Maintenance only |
| Exacerbation risk reduction | Significant with ICS | Moderate with ICS |

---

## Current clinical guidelines

GINA 2024 recommends as-needed low-dose ICS–formoterol as the **preferred reliever** across severities, and SMART/MART for Steps 3–5 in adults and adolescents [^4adef1d0] [^8e0585ff]. VA/DoD 2025 suggests ICS plus rapid-onset LABA (formoterol) as both controller and reliever for patients 12 years and older [^cb344c57] [^f615c13d]. NHLBI 2020 conditionally recommends SMART for Steps 3–4 in patients aged ≥ 12 years [^5217db2e] [^0e6cca3b].

---

## Practical considerations

Patient education should cover **correct inhaler technique**, adherence, and recognition of worsening symptoms [^c7159c56]. Device selection should favor **single-inhaler combinations** to simplify regimens and improve adherence [^2f52c918]. Monitoring should track **control, exacerbations, and adverse effects**, with therapy adjustments as needed [^5217db2e].

---

Formoterol is a **rapid-onset LABA** that, when combined with ICS, improves asthma and COPD outcomes and enables simpler, more effective SMART/MART regimens. It is not for monotherapy in asthma; use with ICS and monitor for adverse effects, especially at high doses.

### Formoterol versus short-acting β-agonists as relief medication for adults and children with asthma [^b86b04f6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Formoterol is a long-acting beta(2)-agonist but because it has a fast onset of action it can also be used as a relief medication.

Objectives

To asses the efficacy and safety of formoterol as reliever therapy in comparison to short-acting beta(2)-agonists in adults and children with asthma.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and websites of clinical trial registers (for unpublished trial data), and we checked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol. The date of the most recent search was February 2010.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, parallel-arm trials of at least 12 weeks duration in patients of any age and severity of asthma. Studies randomised patients to any dose of as-needed formoterol versus short-acting beta(2)-agonist. Concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids or other maintenance medication was allowed, as long as this was not part of the randomised treatment regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. Outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by the second author. We sought unpublished data on primary outcomes.

Main Results

This review includes eight studies conducted in 22,604 participants (mostly adults). Six studies compared formoterol as-needed to terbutaline whilst two studies compared formoterol with salbutamol as-needed. Background maintenance therapy varied across the trials. Asthma exacerbations and serious adverse events showed a direction of treatment effect favouring formoterol, of which one outcome reached statistical significance (exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids). In patients on short-acting beta(2)-agonists, 117 people out of 1000 had exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids over 30 weeks, compared to 101 (95% CI 93 to 108) out of 1000 for patients on formoterol as-needed. In patients on maintenance inhaled corticosteroids there were also significantly fewer exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids on formoterol as-needed (Peto OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.91). There was one death per 1000 people on formoterol or on short-acting beta(2)-agonists.

Authors' Conclusions

In adults, formoterol was similar to short-acting beta(2)-agonists when used as a reliever, and showed a reduction in the number of exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids. Clinicians should weigh the relatively modest benefits of formoterol as-needed against the benefits of single inhaler therapy and the potential danger of long-term use of long-acting beta(2)-agonists in some patients. We did not find evidence to recommend changes to guidelines that suggest that long-acting beta(2)-agonists should be given only to patients already taking inhaled corticosteroids. There was insufficient information reported from children in the included trials to come to any conclusion on the safety or efficacy of formoterol as relief medication for children with asthma.

### Regular treatment with formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid versus regular treatment with salmeterol and an inhaled corticosteroid for chronic asthma: serious adverse events [^ef2a34c8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Asthma is characterised by chronic inflammation of the airways and recurrent exacerbations with wheezing, chest tightness, and cough. Treatment with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators can result in good control of symptoms, prevention of further morbidity, and improved quality of life. However, an increase in serious adverse events with the use of both regular formoterol and regular salmeterol (long-acting beta₂-agonists) compared with placebo for chronic asthma has been demonstrated in previous Cochrane Reviews. This increase was statistically significant in trials that did not randomise participants to an inhaled corticosteroid, but not when formoterol or salmeterol was combined with an inhaled corticosteroid. The confidence intervals were found to be too wide to ensure that the addition of an inhaled corticosteroid renders regular long-acting beta₂-agonists completely safe; few participants and insufficient serious adverse events in these trials precluded a definitive decision about the safety of combination treatments.

Objectives

To assess risks of mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials that have randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid versus regular salmeterol and an inhaled corticosteroid.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Register of Trials, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two trial registries to identify reports of randomised trials for inclusion. We checked manufacturers' websites and clinical trial registers for unpublished trial data, as well as Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol and salmeterol. The date of the most recent search was 24 February 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included controlled clinical trials with a parallel design, recruiting patients of any age and severity of asthma, if they randomised patients to treatment with regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol (each with a randomised inhaled corticosteroid) and were of at least 12 weeks' duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review, extracted outcome data from published papers and trial registries, and applied GRADE rating for the results. We sought unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events from study sponsors and authors. The primary outcomes were all cause mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events. We chose not to calculate an average result from all the formulations of formoterol and inhaled steroid, as the doses and delivery devices are too diverse to assume a single class effect.

Main Results

Twenty-one studies in 11,572 adults and adolescents and two studies in 723 children met the eligibility criteria of the review. No data were available for two studies; therefore these were not included in the analysis. Among adult and adolescent studies, seven compared formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and fluticasone (N = 7764), six compared formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone (N = 1923), two compared formoterol and mometasone to salmeterol and fluticasone (N = 1126), two compared formoterol and fluticasone to salmeterol and fluticasone (N = 790), and one compared formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and budesonide (N = 229). In total, five deaths were reported among adults, none of which was thought to be related to asthma. The certainty of evidence for all-cause mortality was low, as there were not enough deaths to permit any precise conclusions regarding the risk of mortality on combination formoterol versus combination salmeterol. In all, 201 adults reported non-fatal serious adverse events. In studies comparing formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and fluticasone, there were 77 in the formoterol arm and 68 in the salmeterol arm (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.59; 5935 participants, 7 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). In the formoterol and beclomethasone studies, there were 12 adults in the formoterol arm and 13 in the salmeterol arm with events (Peto OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.08; 1941 participants, 6 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). In the formoterol and mometasone studies, there were 18 in the formoterol arm and 11 in the salmeterol arm (Peto OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.20; 1126 participants, 2 studies; moderate-certainty evidence). One adult in the formoterol and fluticasone studies in the salmeterol arm experienced an event (Peto OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 3.10; 293 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence). Another adult in the formoterol and budesonide compared to salmeterol and budesonide study in the formoterol arm had an event (Peto OR 7.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 375.68; 229 participants, 1 study; low-certainty evidence). Only 46 adults were reported to have experienced asthma-related serious adverse events. The certainty of the evidence was low to very low due to the small number of events and the absence of independent assessment of causation. The two studies in children compared formoterol and fluticasone to salmeterol and fluticasone. No deaths and no asthma-related serious adverse events were reported in these studies. Four all-cause serious adverse events were reported: three in the formoterol arm, and one in the salmeterol arm (Peto OR 2.72, 95% CI 0.38 to 19.46; 548 participants, 2 studies; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, for both adults and children, evidence is insufficient to show whether regular formoterol in combination with budesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, or mometasone has a different safety profile from salmeterol in combination with fluticasone or budesonide. Five deaths of any cause were reported across all studies and no deaths from asthma; this information is insufficient to permit any firm conclusions about the relative risks of mortality on combination formoterol in comparison to combination salmeterol inhalers. Evidence on all-cause non-fatal serious adverse events indicates that there is probably little to no difference between formoterol/budesonide and salmeterol/fluticasone inhalers. However events for the other formoterol combination inhalers were too few to allow conclusions. Only 46 non-fatal serious adverse events were thought to be asthma related; this small number in addition to the absence of independent outcome assessment means that we have very low confidence for this outcome. We found no evidence of safety issues that would affect the choice between salmeterol and formoterol combination inhalers used for regular maintenance therapy by adults and children with asthma.

### Key recommendations for primary care from the 2022 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) update [^043e58b2]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) was established in 1993 by the World Health Organization and the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute to improve asthma awareness, prevention and management worldwide. GINA develops and publishes evidence-based, annually updated resources for clinicians. GINA guidance is adopted by national asthma guidelines in many countries, adapted to fit local healthcare systems, practices, and resource availability. GINA is independent of industry, funded by the sale and licensing of its materials. This review summarizes key practical guidance for primary care from the 2022 GINA strategy report. It provides guidance on confirming the diagnosis of asthma using spirometry or peak expiratory flow. GINA recommends that all adults, adolescents and most children with asthma should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing therapy to reduce the risk of severe exacerbations, either taken regularly, or (for adults and adolescents with "mild" asthma) as combination ICS–formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief. For patients with moderate–severe asthma, the preferred regimen is maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with ICS–formoterol. Asthma treatment is not "one size fits all"; GINA recommends individualized assessment, adjustment, and review of treatment. As many patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma are not referred early for specialist review, we provide updated guidance for primary care on diagnosis, further investigation, optimization and treatment of severe asthma across secondary and tertiary care. While the GINA strategy has global relevance, we recognize that there are special considerations for its adoption in low- and middle-income countries, particularly the current poor access to inhaled medications.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^f615c13d]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Primary Care Management of Asthma — pharmacotherapy: We recommend inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for asthma control (Strength: Strong for; Category: Not reviewed, Amended). For patients (ages 12 and over) with asthma, we suggest inhaled corticosteroids combined with a rapid-onset long-acting beta agonist (e.g., formoterol), for control and relief of asthma (Strength: Weak for; Category: Reviewed, New-replaced). For patients with uncontrolled asthma on inhaled corticosteroids alone, we recommend the use of both inhaled corticosteroids and rapid-onset long-acting beta agonists (e.g., formoterol) as both controller and reliever (Strength: Strong for; Category: Reviewed, Amended).

### Formoterol used as needed – clinical effectiveness [^f9b3e446]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

A number of studies have already demonstrated the clinical effectiveness of formoterol when used as maintenance therapy in patients requiring both a beta2-agonist with a long duration of action and a regular inhaled corticosteroid. However, formoterol has a unique mechanism of action that gives it both fast- and long-acting properties. Hence the question arises as to whether formoterol can also be used as first-line reliever medication in addition to maintenance therapy. Compared with terbutaline, formoterol used as needed in steroid-treated mild to moderate asthma has superior efficacy, not only significantly improving peak flow, but also the exacerbation rate. In moderate to severe asthma, formoterol used as needed has demonstrated efficacy comparable with salbutamol and terbutaline in improving symptoms and lung function. Single doses of formoterol have also been shown to result in protection against exercise-induced bronchoconstriction for periods up to 12 h. Furthermore, bronchoprotection was maintained following repeated dosing, although further research is needed to confirm the duration of protection achieved with frequent and regular use. Initial research also suggests that formoterol is as effective and well tolerated as terbutaline in the treatment of acute asthma attacks. The evidence presented supports the use of formoterol on an as-needed basis for effective asthma control.

### Combination formoterol and budesonide as maintenance and reliever therapy versus combination inhaler maintenance for chronic asthma in adults and children [^74625d36]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is characterised by chronic inflammation of the airways and recurrent exacerbations with wheezing, chest tightness and cough. Treatment with inhaled steroids and bronchodilators often results in good control of symptoms, prevention of further morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life. Several steroids and beta2-agonists (long- and short-acting) as well as combinations of these treatments are available in a single inhaler to be used once or twice a day, with a separate inhaler for relief of symptoms when needed (for patients in Step three or higher, according to Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines). Budesonide/formoterol is also licenced for use as maintenance and reliever therapy from a single inhaler (SiT; sometimes referred to as SMART therapy). SiT can be prescribed at a lower dose than other combination therapy because of the additional steroid doses being received as reliever therapy. It has been suggested that using SiT improves compliance and hence reduces symptoms and exacerbations, but it is unclear whether it increases side effects associated with the use of inhaled steroids.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler (SiT) to be used for both maintenance and reliever therapy in asthma in comparison with maintenance treatment provided through combination inhalers with a higher maintenance steroid dose (either fluticasone/salmeterol or budesonide/formoterol), along with additional fast-acting beta2-agonists for relief of symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials, online trial registries and drug company websites. The most recent search was conducted in November 2013.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel-group, randomised controlled trials of at least 12 weeks' duration. Studies were included if they compared single-inhaler therapy with budesonide/formoterol (SiT) versus combination inhalers at a higher maintenance dose of steroids than was given in the SiT arm (either salmeterol/fluticasone or budesonide/formoterol).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring hospitalisation, exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and serious adverse events (including mortality).

Main Results

Four studies randomly assigning 9130 people with asthma were included; two were six-month double-blind studies, and two were 12-month open-label studies. No trials included children younger than age 12. Trials included more women than men, with mean age ranging from 38 to 45, and mean baseline steroid dose (inhaled beclomethasone (BDP) equivalent) from 636 to 888 μg. Mean baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) percentage predicted was between 70% and 73% in three of the trials, and 96% in another. All studies were funded by AstraZeneca and were generally free from methodological biases, although the two open-label studies were rated as having high risk for blinding, and some evidence of selective outcome reporting was found. These possible sources of bias did not lead us to downgrade the quality of the evidence. The quantity of inhaled steroids, including puffs taken for relief from symptoms, was consistently lower for SiT than for the comparison groups. Separate data for exacerbations leading to hospitalisations, to emergency room (ER) visits or to a course of oral steroids could not be obtained. Compared with higher fixed-dose combination inhalers, fewer people using SiT had exacerbations requiring hospitalisation or a visit to the ER (odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.90; I(2) = 0%, P = 0.66), and fewer had exacerbations requiring a course of oral corticosteroids (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.87; I(2) = 0%, P = 0.82). This translates to one less person admitted to hospital or visiting the ER (95% CI 0 to 2 fewer) and two fewer people needing oral steroids (95% CI 1 to 3 fewer) compared with fixed-dose combination treatment with a short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) reliever (per 100 treated over eight months). No statistical heterogeneity was observed in either outcome, and the evidence was rated of high quality. Although issues with blinding were evident in two of the studies, and one study recruited a less severe population, sensitivity analyses did not change the main results, so quality was not downgraded. We could not rule out the possibility that SiT increased rates of serious adverse events (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.13; I(2) = 0%, P = 0.98; moderate-quality evidence, downgraded owing to imprecision). We were unable to say whether SiT improved results for several secondary outcomes (morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), rescue medication use, symptoms scales), and in cases where results were significant, the effect sizes were not considered clinically meaningful (predose FEV1, nocturnal awakenings and quality of life).

Authors' Conclusions

SiT reduces the number of people having asthma exacerbations requiring oral steroids and the number requiring hospitalisation or an ER visit compared with fixed-dose combination inhalers. Evidence for serious adverse events was unclear. The mean daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in SiT, including the total dose administered with reliever use, was always lower than that of the other combination groups. This suggests that the flexibility in steroid administration that is possible with SiT might be more effective than a standard fixed-dose combination by increasing the dose only when needed and keeping it low during stable stages of the disease. Data for hospitalisations alone could not be obtained, and no studies have yet addressed this question in children younger than age 12.

### The ICS / formoterol reliever therapy regimen in asthma: a review [^84c891ac]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma recommends that low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol be preferred to short-acting beta 2 -agonists as reliever therapy in adolescents and adults with asthma, across the range of asthma severity. This recommendation represents the most fundamental change in asthma management for many decades. In this commentary, we review the rationale for combination ICS/formoterol therapy, the evidence on which this recommendation has been made, the limitations in the evidence, the practical issues relevant to the implementation of ICS/formoterol reliever-based regimens in clinical practice, and the emerging evidence for the efficacy and safety of combination ICS/salbutamol reliever therapy regimens.

### Combination formoterol and inhaled steroid versus beta2-agonist as relief medication for chronic asthma in adults and children [^c003c3ed]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Formoterol has a fast onset of action and can therefore be used to relieve symptoms of asthma. A combination inhaler can deliver formoterol with different doses of inhaled corticosteroid; when used as a reliever both drugs will be delivered more frequently when asthma symptoms increase. This has the potential to treat both bronchoconstriction and inflammation in the early stages of exacerbations.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of combined inhalers containing both formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid when used for reliever therapy in adults and children with chronic asthma.

Search Strategy

We last searched the Cochrane Airways Group trials register in April 2008.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials in adults and children with chronic asthma, where a combination inhaler containing formoterol and inhaled corticosteroid is compared with fast-acting beta2-agonist alone for the relief of asthma symptoms. This should be the only planned difference between the trial arms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted the characteristics and results of each study. Authors or manufacturers were asked to supply unpublished data in relation to primary outcomes.

Main Results

Three trials involving 5905 participants were included. In patients with mild asthma who do not need maintenance treatment, no clinically important advantages of budesonide/formoterol as reliever were found in comparison to formoterol as reliever. Two studies enrolled patients with more severe asthma who were not controlled on high doses of inhaled corticosteroids (around 700 mcg/day in adults), and had suffered a clinically important asthma exacerbation in the past year. Hospitalisations related to asthma in the two studies comparing budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and relief with the same dose of budesonide/formoterol for maintenance with terbutaline for relief yielded an odds ratio of 0.68 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.16), which was not a statistically significant reduction. One adult study found a reduction in exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids compared to terbutaline, odds ratio 0.56 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.74) and the study in children found less serious adverse events with budesonide/formoterol used for maintenance and relief. There was no significant difference in annual growth in children using budesonide/formoterol reliever in comparison to terbutaline.

Authors' Conclusions

In mild asthma it is not yet known whether patients who use a budesonide/formoterol inhaler for relief of asthma symptoms derive any clinically important benefits. In more severe asthma, one study that enrolled patients who were not controlled on quite high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, and had suffered an exacerbation in the previous year, demonstrated a reduction in the risk of exacerbations that require oral corticosteroids with budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and relief in comparison with budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and terbutaline or formoterol for relief. The incidence of serious adverse events in children was also less using budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and relief in one study, which similarly enrolled children who were not controlled on medium to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids, and compared to terbutaline relief with an explorative maintenance dose of budesonide/formoterol that is not approved for treatment.

### Best practice advice for asthma exacerbation prevention and management in primary care: an international expert consensus [^970fec3b]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Best Practice Advice 6: Consider the use of AIR, MART (formerly known as SMART) or ICS-SABA quick reliever regimens for treating asthma and exacerbations to address underlying inflammation as well as provide bronchodilation

For patients requiring maintenance treatment (GINA Steps 3–5), maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART), formerly known as single-inhaler maintenance-and-reliever therapy (SMART), is referred to by the GINA report as a "treatment regimen in which the patient uses an ICS-formoterol inhaler every day (maintenance dose), and also uses the same medication as needed for relief of asthma symptoms (reliever doses)". The clinical rationale for recommending MART, or a combination of ICS and fast-acting bronchodilator, is based on the increased risk of severe or fatal exacerbations with SABA-only use, as well as evidence showing a lower frequency of exacerbations with ICS + formoterol as maintenance and rescue therapy.

For patients only requiring reliever treatment (Steps 1–2), GINA recommends the use of AIR, or low dose as-needed ICS-formoterol, as the preferred treatment (Track 1).

Use of ICS along with a SABA for rescue therapy can reduce exacerbations compared to SABA-only rescue therapy. In the PREPARE trial, adults with moderate-to-severe asthma who were instructed to take ICS every time they used rescue therapy had a lower annualized rate of severe exacerbations than those who weren't instructed to take ICS with rescue therapy. In the MANDALA randomized, double-blind trial, adults and adolescents with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma receiving albuterol-budesonide as rescue therapy had a significantly lower risk of severe asthma exacerbations than those receiving albuterol alone. Of note, albuterol-budesonide is approved for the as-needed treatment or prevention of bronchoconstriction and to reduce the risk of exacerbations in patients with asthma 18 years of age and older in the United States.

### Inhaled steroids with and without regular formoterol for asthma: serious adverse events [^811cbb10]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between beta 2 -agonists and increases in asthma mortality. There has been much debate about whether regular (daily) long-acting beta 2 -agonists (LABA) are safe when used in combination with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). This updated Cochrane Review includes results from two large trials that recruited 23,422 adolescents and adults mandated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Objectives

To assess the risk of mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events (SAEs) in trials that randomly assign participants with chronic asthma to regular formoterol and inhaled corticosteroids versus the same dose of inhaled corticosteroid alone.

Search Methods

We identified randomised trials using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. We checked websites of clinical trial registers for unpublished trial data as well as FDA submissions in relation to formoterol. The date of the most recent search was February 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with a parallel design involving adults, children, or both with asthma of any severity who received regular formoterol and ICS (separate or combined) treatment versus the same dose of ICS for at least 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We obtained unpublished data on mortality and SAEs from the sponsors of the studies. We assessed our confidence in the evidence using GRADE recommendations. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and all-cause non-fatal serious adverse events.

Main Results

We found 42 studies eligible for inclusion and included 39 studies in the analyses: 29 studies included 35,751 adults, and 10 studies included 4035 children and adolescents. Inhaled corticosteroids included beclomethasone (daily metered dosage 200 to 800 µg), budesonide (200 to 1600 µg), fluticasone (200 to 250 µg), and mometasone (200 to 800 µg). Formoterol metered dosage ranged from 12 to 48 µg daily. Fixed combination ICS was used in most of the studies. We judged the risk of selection bias, performance bias, and attrition bias as low, however most studies did not report independent assessment of causation of SAEs. DeathsSeventeen of 18,645 adults taking formoterol and ICS and 13 of 17,106 adults taking regular ICS died of any cause. The pooled Peto odds ratio (OR) was 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61 to 2.56, moderate-certainty evidence), which equated to one death occurring for every 1000 adults treated with ICS alone for 26 weeks; the corresponding risk amongst adults taking formoterol and ICS was also one death (95% CI 0 to 2 deaths). No deaths were reported in the trials on children and adolescents (4035 participants) (low-certainty evidence). In terms of asthma-related deaths, no children and adolescents died from asthma, but three of 12,777 adults in the formoterol and ICS treatment group died of asthma (both low-certainty evidence). Non-fatal serious adverse eventsA total of 401 adults experienced a non-fatal SAE of any cause on formoterol with ICS, compared to 369 adults who received regular ICS. The pooled Peto OR was 1.00 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.16, high-certainty evidence, 29 studies, 35,751 adults). For every 1000 adults treated with ICS alone for 26 weeks, 22 adults had an SAE; the corresponding risk for those on formoterol and ICS was also 22 adults (95% CI 19 to 25). Thirty of 2491 children and adolescents experienced an SAE of any cause when receiving formoterol with ICS, compared to 13 of 1544 children and adolescents receiving ICS alone. The pooled Peto OR was 1.33 (95% CI 0.71 to 2.49, moderate-certainty evidence, 10 studies, 4035 children and adolescents). For every 1000 children and adolescents treated with ICS alone for 12.5 weeks, 8 had an non-fatal SAE; the corresponding risk amongst those on formoterol and ICS was 11 children and adolescents (95% CI 6 to 21). Asthma-related serious adverse eventsNinety adults experienced an asthma-related non-fatal SAE with formoterol and ICS, compared to 102 with ICS alone. The pooled Peto OR was 0.86 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.14, moderate-certainty evidence, 28 studies, 35,158 adults). For every 1000 adults treated with ICS alone for 26 weeks, 6 adults had an asthma-related non-fatal SAE; the corresponding risk for those on formoterol and ICS was 5 adults (95% CI 4 to 7). Amongst children and adolescents, 9 experienced an asthma-related non-fatal SAE with formoterol and ICS, compared to 5 on ICS alone. The pooled Peto OR was 1.18 (95% CI 0.40 to 3.51, very low-certainty evidence, 10 studies, 4035 children and adolescents). For every 1000 children and adolescents treated with ICS alone for 12.5 weeks, 3 had an asthma-related non-fatal SAE; the corresponding risk on formoterol and ICS was 4 (95% CI 1 to 11).

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find a difference in the risk of death (all-cause or asthma-related) in adults taking combined formoterol and ICS versus ICS alone (moderate- to low-certainty evidence). No deaths were reported in children and adolescents. The risk of dying when taking either treatment was very low, but we cannot be certain if there is a difference in mortality when taking additional formoterol to ICS (low-certainty evidence). We did not find a difference in the risk of non-fatal SAEs of any cause in adults (high-certainty evidence). A previous version of the review had shown a lower risk of asthma-related SAEs in adults taking combined formoterol and ICS; however, inclusion of new studies no longer shows a difference between treatments (moderate-certainty evidence). The reported number of children and adolescents with SAEs was small, so uncertainty remains in this age group. We included results from large studies mandated by the FDA. Clinical decisions and information provided to patients regarding regular use of formoterol and ICS need to take into account the balance between known symptomatic benefits of formoterol and ICS versus the remaining degree of uncertainty associated with its potential harmful effects.

### Formoterol as relief medication in asthma: a worldwide safety and effectiveness trial [^218a6ec3]. The European Respiratory Journal (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of as-needed formoterol with salbutamol in a large international real-life asthma study. Children and adults (n = 18,124) were randomised to 6 months as-needed treatment with open-label formoterol 4.5 microg Turbuhaler or salbutamol 200 microg pressurised metered dose inhaler or equivalent. Primary safety variables were asthma-related and nonasthma-related serious adverse events (SAE)s and adverse events (AE)s resulting in discontinuation (DAE)s. The primary efficacy variable was time to first asthma exacerbation. The incidences of AEs, SAEs and DAEs arising from SAEs were not significantly different between treatments. DAEs for nonserious AEs were higher with formoterol. Asthma-related AEs decreased with formoterol (1,098 (12.3%) versus 1,206 (13.5%)), asthma-related SAEs were similar (108 (1.2%) versus 121 (1.4%)) but more asthma-related DAEs occurred in the formoterol group (89 (1.0%) versus 48 (0.5%)). Time to first exacerbation was prolonged (hazard ratio 0.86) and less as-needed and maintenance medication was used with formoterol. Reductions of exacerbations with as-needed formoterol versus salbutamol increased with increasing age and asthma medication level. This real-life study demonstrates that formoterol as-needed has a similar safety profile to salbutamol, and its use as a reliever therapy is associated with fewer asthma symptoms and exacerbations.

### Safety and effectiveness of as-needed formoterol in asthma patients taking inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol or ICS-salmeterol maintenance therapy [^3bae1b0c]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

As-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol reliever is recommended in patients with asthma prescribed maintenance ICS-formoterol. Clinicians often ask whether ICS-formoterol reliever can be used with other maintenance ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonists.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of as-needed formoterol in patients taking maintenance ICS-formoterol or ICS-salmeterol from the RELIEF study.

Methods

RELIEF (SD-037-0699) was a 6-month, open-label study that randomized 18,124 patients with asthma to as-needed formoterol 4.5 μg or salbutamol 200 μg on top of maintenance therapy. This post hoc analysis included patients on maintenance ICS-formoterol or ICS-salmeterol (n = 5436). The primary safety outcome was a composite of serious adverse events (SAEs) and/or adverse events leading to discontinuation (DAEs); the primary effectiveness outcome was time-to-first exacerbation.

Results

For both maintenance groups and both relievers, similar numbers of patients had ≥ 1 SAE and/or DAE. In patients taking maintenance ICS-salmeterol, but not ICS-formoterol, significantly more non-asthma-related and nonserious DAEs occurred with as-needed formoterol versus as-needed salbutamol (P = 0.0066 and P = 0.0034, respectively). In patients taking maintenance ICS-formoterol, there was a significantly lower risk in time-to-first exacerbation with as-needed formoterol versus as-needed salbutamol (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.70, 0.95; P = 0.007). In patients taking ICS-salmeterol maintenance, time-to-first exacerbation was not significantly different between treatment arms (HR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84, 1.06; P = 0.35).

Conclusions

As-needed formoterol significantly reduced exacerbation risk compared with as-needed salbutamol when added to maintenance ICS-formoterol, but not to maintenance ICS-salmeterol. More DAEs were seen with ICS-salmeterol maintenance therapy plus as-needed formoterol. Further research is needed to assess whether this is relevant to as-needed combination ICS-formoterol.

### Fluticasone / formoterol combination therapy is as effective as fluticasone / salmeterol in the treatment of asthma, but has a more rapid onset of action: an open-label, randomized study [^913f9317]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fluticasone propionate (fluticasone) and the long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) formoterol fumarate (formoterol) are being made available as a combination product (fluticasone/formoterol, flutiform ®) in a single aerosol inhaler. This 12-week, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, phase 3 study compared the efficacy and safety of fluticasone/formoterol with the commercially available combination product fluticasone/salmeterol.

Methods

Patients aged ≥ 18 years (N = 202) with mild-to-moderate–severe, persistent asthma for ≥ 6 months prior to screening were included in the study. After a screening phase (4–10 days), eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to receive fluticasone/formoterol or fluticasone/salmeterol during the 12-week treatment period. The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of fluticasone/formoterol versus fluticasone/salmeterol, measured by pre-dose forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1), at week 12.

Results

Fluticasone/formoterol was comparable to fluticasone/salmeterol for the primary efficacy endpoint, mean pre-dose FEV 1 at week 12. The new combination was also comparable to fluticasone/salmeterol for change from baseline to week 12 in pre-dose FEV 1, change from pre-dose FEV 1 at baseline to 2-hour post-dose FEV 1 at week 12 and discontinuations due to lack of efficacy. Importantly, fluticasone/formoterol was superior to fluticasone/salmeterol in time to onset of action throughout the duration of the study. The two treatments demonstrated similar results for various other secondary efficacy parameters, including other lung function tests, patient-reported outcomes, rescue medication use, asthma exacerbations and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores. Fluticasone/formoterol was well tolerated and had a good safety profile that was similar to fluticasone/salmeterol.

Conclusions

The results of this study indicate that fluticasone/formoterol is as effective as fluticasone/salmeterol, and has a more rapid onset of action, reflecting the faster bronchodilatory effects of formoterol compared with those of salmeterol. If patients perceive the benefits of therapy with fluticasone/formoterol more rapidly than with fluticasone/salmeterol, this could have a positive impact on preference and adherence.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^0a2907d7]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacotherapy — The 2019 VA/DoD Asthma CPG evidence review compared a combination inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist (ICS/LABA) as controller and quick relief therapy to maintenance ICS and to fixed dose maintenance ICS/LABA, noting that the LABA used in the combined ICS/LABA controller/reliever was formoterol. There are currently several LABAs approved for patients with asthma, with some having a more rapid onset of action (e.g., formoterol) while others have a slower onset (e.g., salmeterol). Despite evidence showing reduced exacerbations using formoterol combined with ICS as both controller and reliever, this strategy was not recommended by the 2019 VA/DO D Asthma CPG. The Food and Drug Administration had approved ICS/LABAs as maintenance controller medications for asthma but not as fast acting relievers, and although ICS/formoterol combinations still do not have FDA approval as quick relief medications, later asthma guidelines have supported their use as controller/relievers (GINA).

### Combination fluticasone and salmeterol versus fixed dose combination budesonide and formoterol for chronic asthma in adults and children [^3a9729e1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Long-acting beta-agonists are a common second line treatment in people with asthma inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. Single device inhalers combine a long-acting beta-agonist with an inhaled steroid delivering both drugs as a maintenance treatment regimen. This updated review compares two fixed-dose options, fluticasone/salmeterol FP/SALand budesonide/formoterol, since this comparison represents a common therapeutic choice.

Objectives

To assess the relative effects of fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in people with asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials with prespecified terms. We performed additional hand searching of manufacturers' web sites and online trial registries. Search results are current to June 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised studies comparing fixed dose fluticasone/salmeterol and budesonide/formoterol in adults or children with a diagnosis of asthma. Treatment in the studies had to last for a minimum of 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review. We combined continuous data outcomes with a mean difference (MD), and dichotomous data outcomes with an odds ratio (OR). We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

Main Results

Five studies met the review entry criteria (5537 adults). Study populations entered the studies having previously been treated with inhaled steroids and had moderate or mild airway obstruction (mean FEV(1) predicted between 65% and 84% at baseline). Most of the studies assessed treatment over a period of six months. The studies were at a low risk of selection and performance/detection bias, although we could not determine whether missing data had an impact on the results. Availablility of outcome data was satisfactory. Primary outcomesThe odds ratio for exacerbations requiring oral steroids was lower with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not reach statistical significance (OR 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.07, four studies, N = 4949). With an assumed risk with budesonide/formoterol of 106/1000 participants requiring oral steroids, treatment with fluticasone/salmeterol would lead to between 25 fewer and seven more people per 1000 experiencing a course of oral steroids. Although the odds of hospital admission was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol, this did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.29, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.47, four studies, 4879 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between two fewer and 10 more people per 1000 would be hospitalised on fluticasone/salmeterol. The odds of a serious adverse event related to asthma was higher with fluticasone/salmeterol but did not differ significantly between treatments (OR 1.47, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.86, three studies, 4054 participants). With an assumed risk in the budesonide/formoterol of 7/1000, between two fewer and 13 more people per 1000 would experience a serious adverse event on fluticasone/salmeterol. Secondary outcomesLung function outcomes, symptoms, rescue medication, composite of exacerbations leading to either emergency department visit or hospital admission, withdrawals and adverse events did not differ statistically between treatments. Assessment of quality of life was limited to two studies, both of which gave results that did not reach statistical significance. One study reported one death out of 1000 participants on fluticasone/salmeterol and no deaths in a similar number of participants treated with budesonide/formoterol. No deaths were reported in the other studies.

Authors' Conclusions

Statistical imprecision in the effect estimates for exacerbations and serious adverse events do not enable us to conclude that either therapy is superior. The uncertainty around the effect estimates justify further trials to provide more definitive conclusions; the overall quality of evidence based on GRADE recommendations for the three primary outcomes and withdrawals due to serious adverse events was moderate. We rated the quality of evidence for mortality to be low. Results for lung function outcomes showed that the drugs were sufficiently similar that further research is unlikely to change the effects. No trials were identified in the under-12s and research in this population is a high priority. Evaluation of quality of life is a priority for future research.

### Budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy versus maintenance budesonide plus terbutaline reliever therapy in adults with mild to moderate asthma (PRACTICAL): a 52-week, open-label, multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled trial [^aff458a4]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

In adults with mild asthma, a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid with a fast-onset long-acting β-agonist (LABA) used as reliever monotherapy reduces severe exacerbations compared with short-acting β-agonist (SABA) reliever therapy. We investigated the efficacy of combination budesonide-formoterol reliever therapy compared with maintenance budesonide plus as-needed terbutaline.

Methods

We did a 52-week, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre, superiority, randomised controlled trial at 15 primary care or hospital-based clinical trials units and primary care practices in New Zealand. Participants were adults aged 18–75 years with a self-reported doctor's diagnosis of asthma who were using SABA for symptom relief with or without maintenance low to moderate doses of inhaled corticosteroids in the previous 12 weeks. We randomly assigned participants (1:1) to either reliever therapy with budesonide 200 μg-formoterol 6 μg Turbuhaler (one inhalation as needed for relief of symptoms) or maintenance budesonide 200 μg Turbuhaler (one inhalation twice daily) plus terbutaline 250 μg Turbuhaler (two inhalations as needed). Participants and investigators were not masked to group assignment; the statistician was masked for analysis of the primary outcome. Six study visits were scheduled: randomisation, and weeks 4, 16, 28, 40, and 52. The primary outcome was the number of severe exacerbations per patient per year analysed by intention to treat (severe exacerbations defined as use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days because of asthma, or admission to hospital or an emergency department visit because of asthma requiring systemic corticosteroids). Safety analyses included all participants who had received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12616000377437.

Findings

Between May 4, 2016, and Dec 22, 2017, we assigned 890 participants to treatment and included 885 eligible participants in the analysis: 437 assigned to budesonide-formoterol as needed and 448 to budesonide maintenance plus terbutaline as needed. Severe exacerbations per patient per year were lower with as-needed budesonide-formoterol than with maintenance budesonide plus terbutaline as needed (absolute rate per patient per year 0·119 vs 0·172; relative rate 0·69, 95% CI 0·48–1·00; p = 0·049). Nasopharyngitis was the most common adverse event in both groups, occurring in 154 (35%) of 440 patients receiving as-needed budesonide-formoterol and 144 (32%) of 448 receiving maintenance budesonide plus terbutaline as needed.

Interpretation

In adults with mild to moderate asthma, budesonide-formoterol used as needed for symptom relief was more effective at preventing severe exacerbations than maintenance low-dose budesonide plus as-needed terbutaline. The findings support the 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma recommendation that inhaled corticosteroid-formoterol reliever therapy is an alternative regimen to daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid for patients with mild asthma.

### Controlled trial of budesonide-formoterol as needed for mild asthma [^ab1af738]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

Background

In double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, budesonide-formoterol used on an as-needed basis resulted in a lower risk of severe exacerbation of asthma than as-needed use of a short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA); the risk was similar to that of budesonide maintenance therapy plus as-needed SABA. The availability of data from clinical trials designed to better reflect clinical practice would be beneficial.

Methods

We conducted a 52-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, controlled trial involving adults with mild asthma. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: albuterol (100 μg, two inhalations from a pressurized metered-dose inhaler as needed for asthma symptoms) (albuterol group); budesonide (200 μg, one inhalation through a Turbuhaler twice daily) plus as-needed albuterol (budesonide maintenance group); or budesonide-formoterol (200 μg of budesonide and 6 μg of formoterol, one inhalation through a Turbuhaler as needed) (budesonide-formoterol group). Electronic monitoring of inhalers was used to measure medication use. The primary outcome was the annualized rate of asthma exacerbations.

Results

The analysis included 668 of 675 patients who underwent randomization. The annualized exacerbation rate in the budesonide-formoterol group was lower than that in the albuterol group (absolute rate, 0.195 vs. 0.400; relative rate, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33 to 0.72; P < 0.001) and did not differ significantly from the rate in the budesonide maintenance group (absolute rate, 0.195 in the budesonide-formoterol group vs. 0.175 in the budesonide maintenance group; relative rate, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.79; P = 0.65). The number of severe exacerbations was lower in the budesonide-formoterol group than in both the albuterol group (9 vs. 23; relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.86) and the budesonide maintenance group (9 vs. 21; relative risk, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.96). The mean (± SD) dose of inhaled budesonide was 107 ± 109 μg per day in the budesonide-formoterol group and 222 ± 113 μg per day in the budesonide maintenance group. The incidence and type of adverse events reported were consistent with those in previous trials and with reports in clinical use.

Conclusions

In an open-label trial involving adults with mild asthma, budesonide-formoterol used as needed was superior to albuterol used as needed for the prevention of asthma exacerbations.

### Budesonide / formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy versus conventional best practice [^966242bd]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (Symbicort SMART) reduces asthma exacerbations and symptoms versus fixed-dose regimens plus short-acting beta(2)-agonists (SABA) in double-blind trials. Information is lacking regarding its effectiveness versus conventional best practice (CBP). This pooled analysis of six 6-month, randomized, open-label studies examined asthma control and exacerbation risk in asthmatics (aged ≥ 12 years). Patients (N = 7855) symptomatic on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or stable/symptomatic on ICS/long-acting beta(2)-agonists (LABA) received budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy (160/4.5microg bid and as needed) or CBP (ICS or ICS/LABA ± other agents at an approved dose plus as-needed SABA). Overall asthma control was assessed comparing the incidence of exacerbations and levels of asthma control using the asthma control questionnaire (ACQ). Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy did not significantly reduce time to first severe exacerbation (primary variable) versus CBP (P = 0.062). However, patients in this group experienced 15% fewer exacerbations (0.20 versus 0.24/patient/year; P = 0.021) and used 27% less ICS (P < 0.0001). Odds of remaining well controlled (ACQ ≤ 0.75) over 6 months were higher with budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy versus CBP (45% versus 41%, odds ratio [OR] 1.29; P < 0.01) while risk of remaining uncontrolled decreased (25% versus 29%, OR 0.81; P < 0.01). Budesonide/formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy improves key aspects of asthma control versus physicians' choice of CBP.

### Budesonide-formoterol metered-dose inhaler vs fluticasone-salmeterol dry-powder inhaler [^05858f15]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is there a clinical difference in outcomes associated with transitioning from budesonide-formoterol metered-dose inhaler therapy to fluticasone-salmeterol dry-powder inhaler therapy for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma?

Findings

In this primary self-controlled case series and secondary matched cohort study of 260 268 and 258 577 US veterans, respectively, transition to fluticasone-salmeterol dry-powder inhaler therapy under a national formulary change was associated with higher rates of prednisone use and increased all-cause and respiratory-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations.

Meaning

These results suggest that there was an increase in adverse health outcomes after the shift from budesonide-formoterol metered-dose inhaler therapy to fluticasone-salmeterol dry-powder inhaler therapy in the Veterans Health Administration.

### Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate [^19c0b017]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Postmarketing Safety and Efficacy Study

A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, safety study compared budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate with budesonide, each administered as 2 inhalations twice daily over 26 weeks (NCT01444430). The primary safety objective was to evaluate whether the addition of formoterol to budesonide therapy (budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate) was non-inferior to budesonide in terms of the risk of serious asthma-related events (asthma-related hospitalization, endotracheal intubation, and death). The study was designed to rule out a pre-defined risk margin of serious asthma-related events of 2.0. A blinded adjudication committee determined whether events were asthma-related.

This study enrolled patients who were 12 years of age and older, had a clinical diagnosis of asthma for at least 1 year, and had at least 1 asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids or an asthma-related hospitalization in the previous year. Patients were stratified to one of the two dose levels of budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate or budesonide based on assessment of asthma control and ongoing asthma therapy. Patients with a history of life-threatening asthma were excluded. The study included 11,693 patients [5846 receiving budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate (80/4.5 or 160/4.5) and 5847 receiving budesonide (80 or 160 mcg)], whose mean age was 44 years, and of whom 66% were female and 69% were Caucasian.

Budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate was non-inferior to budesonide in terms of time to first serious asthma-related events based on the pre-specified risk margin, with an estimated hazard ratio of 1.07 [95% CI: 0.70, 1.65] (Table 7).

The primary efficacy endpoint was asthma exacerbations, defined as a deterioration of asthma that led to use of systemic corticosteroids for at least 3 days, or a hospitalization, or an emergency room visit that required systemic corticosteroids. The estimated hazard ratio for time to first asthma exacerbation rate for budesonide and formoterol fumarate dihydrate relative to budesonide was 0.84 [95% CI: 0.75, 0.94]. This outcome was primarily driven by a reduction in systemic corticosteroid use.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^cb344c57]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

ICS plus rapid-onset long-acting beta agonist (LABA) controller/reliever strategy — recommendation and use in adolescents and adults: We suggest that ICS combined with a rapid-onset long-acting beta agonist (e.g., formoterol) as both controller and reliever be the preferred strategy for the treatment of asthma in patients 12 years and older. There was insufficient evidence to recommend this strategy in patients ages 4–11. The primary benefit of this strategy was a reduction in asthma exacerbations, most clearly seen in studies enrolling patients who were considered poorly controlled or moderate to severe; these patients were instructed to use ICS/rapid-onset LABA as everyday maintenance therapy and in addition as required for symptoms, while in mild asthma it was used intermittently in response to symptoms and was superior to SABA alone and non-inferior to maintenance ICS plus SABA as needed for symptoms; although inclusion of mild-asthma evidence weakens the strength of this recommendation, it improves clinical utility since asthma control and severity are dynamic.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to management of exacerbation, self-management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to include the following short-term self-management strategies for 1–4 weeks for worsening asthma in the written asthma action plans for patients on Track 1 with ICS-formoterol reliever:

- **steps 1–2, as-needed-only ICS-formoterol as usual treatment**: Use 1 inhalation of ICS-formoterol, such as budesonide-formoterol 200/6 mcg or beclometasone dipropionate-formoterol 100/6 mcg, whenever needed for symptom relief, with a maximum 12 inhalations in any 24-hour period

- steps 3–5, maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol as usual treatment: Continue usual maintenance dose of ICS-formoterol. For symptom relief, use 1 inhalation of ICS-formoterol whenever needed, with a maximum total 12 inhalations in any 24-hour period (as-needed plus maintenance doses).

### Formoterol for maintenance and as-needed treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^c98859b2]. Respiratory Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Formoterol is a long-acting beta2-agonist with a rapid onset of effect in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), making it potentially suitable for both maintenance and as-needed bronchodilator treatment. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of maintenance formoterol in patients with COPD and to compare the effects of additional formoterol as needed with terbutaline. In this 6-month, double-blind study, 657 patients with COPD (40 years, forced expiratory volume in 1s [FEV1] 40–70% predicted normal) were randomized to formoterol 9 microg twice daily (bid) plus terbutaline 0.5 mg as needed (FORM bid), formoterol 9 microg bid plus formoterol 4.5 microg as needed (FORM bid+prn), or placebo bid plus terbutaline 0.5 mg as needed (placebo), all administered via Turbuhaler. Primary efficacy variables were FEV1 and the sum of breathlessness and chest tightness scores combined symptom score. Formoterol significantly (P < 0.01) increased FEV(1) compared with placebo: FORM bid 6.5% (95% CI: 2.5, 10.7%); FORM bid+prn 11.8% (95% CI: 7.7, 16.2%). Combined symptom score decreased significantly in both formoterol groups compared with placebo: FORM bid -0.27 (95% CI: -0.49, -0.06; P = 0.012); FORM bid+prn -0.32 (95% CI: -0.53, -0.11; P = 0.0026). Similar significant (P < 0.05) improvements were seen in both formoterol groups for morning peak expiratory flow, cough and sleep scores, and reliever use. In this study, formoterol 9 microg bid via Turbuhaler as maintenance therapy, with either formoterol or terbutaline as rescue medication, provided sustained improvements in lung function and COPD symptoms. Both formoterol regimens were well tolerated with no differences in adverse events or electrocardiogram profiles.

### Formoterol, 24 microg bid, and serious asthma exacerbations: similar rates compared with formoterol, 12 microg bid, with and without extra doses taken on demand, and placebo [^b13ff097]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

The primary objective was to determine whether high-dose formoterol, 24 mug bid, was associated with more asthma exacerbations compared with lower formoterol doses in patients with stable persistent asthma. Serious asthma exacerbations (life threatening or requiring hospitalization) were the primary end point. Secondary end points included significant exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids, all exacerbations, and changes in FEV1.

Design

In a multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, patients were randomized to 16 weeks of treatment with formoterol, 24 microg bid; formoterol, 12 microg bid, with up to two additional 12-microg doses daily on demand for worsening symptoms (12 microg bid plus on demand); formoterol, 12 microg bid; or placebo. The formoterol 12-microg-bid plus on-demand regimen was administered open label, while the other three regimens were double blind.

Setting

Outpatient clinics.

Patients

A total of 2,085 patients aged ≥ 12 years with stable, persistent asthma were enrolled and treated; 65% (n = 1,347) received regular concomitant antiinflammatory therapy during the study.

Measurements and Results

Nine patients had respiratory-related serious adverse events (SAEs) requiring hospitalization: two patients (0.4%) in the 24-microg-bid group; one patient (0.2%) in the 12-microg-bid plus on-demand group; five patients (0.9%) in the 12-microg-bid group; and one patient (0.2%) in the placebo group. All of these events were asthma related, except for two SAEs in the 12-microg-bid group that were later considered not to be asthma related by independent reviewers who were not associated with the conduct of the study. The proportions of patients with significant asthma exacerbations (requiring systemic corticosteroids) were similar in the 24-microg-bid group (6.3%, 33 of 527 patients), 12-microg-bid group (5.9%, 31 of 527 patients) and placebo group (8.8%, 45 of 514 patients) and lower in the 12-microg-bid plus on-demand group (4.4%, 23 of 517 patients; p = 0.0057 vs placebo). All treatments were well tolerated. All formoterol treatment regimens had a significant effect on FEV1 measured 2 h after dose during the study (p < 0.0001 vs placebo); and on predose trough FEV1 measured at all visits after baseline (p < 0.002 vs placebo).

Conclusions

Treatment with formoterol, 24 microg bid, was not associated with an increase in serious asthma exacerbations compared with the lower formoterol doses or placebo.

### Effect of budesonide in combination with formoterol for reliever therapy in asthma exacerbations: a randomised controlled, double-blind study [^c1e070bc]. Lancet (2006). Excellent credibility.

Background

The contributions of as-needed inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta2 agonists (LABA) to asthma control have not been fully established. We compared the efficacy and safety of three reliever strategies: a traditional short-acting beta2 agonist; a rapid-onset LABA (formoterol); and a combination of LABA and an inhaled corticosteroid (budesonide-formoterol) in symptomatic patients receiving budesonide-formoterol maintenance therapy.

Methods

We did a 12-month, double-blind, parallel-group study in 3394 patients (aged 12 years or older), in 289 centres in 20 countries, who were using inhaled corticosteroids at study entry and symptomatic on budesonide-formoterol (160 microg and 4.5 microg, respectively), one inhalation twice daily, during a 2-week run-in. After run-in, patients were randomly assigned budesonide-formoterol maintenance therapy plus one of three alternative as-needed medications-terbutaline (0.4 mg), formoterol (4.5 microg), or budesonide-formoterol (160 microg and 4.5 microg). The primary outcome was time to first severe exacerbation, defined as an event resulting in hospitalisation, emergency room treatment, or both, or the need for oral steroids for 3 days or more.

Findings

Time to first severe exacerbation was longer with as-needed budesonide-formoterol versus formoterol (p = 0.0048; log-rank test) and with as-needed formoterol versus terbutaline (p = 0.0051). The rate of severe exacerbations was 37, 29, and 19 per 100 patients per year with as-needed terbutaline, formoterol, and budesonide-formoterol, respectively (rate ratios budesonide-formoterol versus formoterol 0.67 [95% CI 0.56–0.80; p < 0.0001]; budesonide-formoterol versus terbutaline 0.52 [0.44–0.62; p < 0.0001]; formoterol versus terbutaline 0.78 [0.67–0.91; p = 0.0012]). Asthma control days increased to a similar extent in all treatment groups. As-needed formoterol did not significantly improve symptoms compared with as-needed terbutaline. All treatments were well tolerated.

Interpretation

Both monocomponents of budesonide-formoterol given as needed contribute to enhanced protection from severe exacerbations in patients receiving combination therapy for maintenance.

### Efficacy and safety of maintenance and reliever combination budesonide-formoterol inhaler in patients with asthma at risk of severe exacerbations: a randomised controlled trial [^14266d97]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

The Single combination budesonide-formoterol inhaler Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (SMART) regimen reduces severe asthma exacerbations in patients, but whether the high doses of corticosteroid and β agonist increase the risk of adverse effects with both short-term and cumulative exposure is not certain. Our aim was to investigate whether the SMART regimen would reduce the risk of overuse of β agonist, reduce the likelihood of patients to seek medical review when such episodes occurred, and if any reduction in severe asthma exacerbations would be at the cost of a higher burden of systemic corticosteroid.

Methods

In this 24-week trial undertaken at four primary health-care practices and one hospital in New Zealand, patients (aged 16–65 years) with a recent asthma exacerbation were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SMART or standard fixed-dose regimen. Treatment in the SMART group consisted of two actuations of budesonide-formoterol (200 μg and 6 μg, respectively, per actuation) twice daily, delivered through a combination metered dose inhaler (MDI), with one extra actuation as needed for relief of symptoms; treatment in the standard group consisted of two actuations of budesonide-formoterol (200 μg and 6 μg, respectively, per actuation) twice daily through a combination MDI with one to two actuations of salbutamol (100 μg per actuation) by MDI as needed for relief of symptoms. MDIs were monitored electronically to measure actual use of medication. The allocation sequence for randomisation was computer generated, with a block size of eight per site. Participants, investigators, and the statistician were not masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with at least one high-use episode of β agonist (more than eight actuations per day of budesonide-formoterol in addition to the four maintenance doses in the SMART group or more than 16 actuations per day of salbutamol in the standard group). Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12610000515099.

Findings

303 patients were randomly assigned to the SMART (n = 151) or standard group (n = 152). No significant difference was noted between the SMART and standard groups in the proportion of participants with at least one high-use episode of β agonist (84 [56%] vs 68 [45%], respectively, relative risk 1·24 [95% CI 0·99–1·56]; p = 0·058). There were fewer days of high use in the SMART group (mean 5·1 days [SD 14·3] vs 8·9 days [20·9], relative rate 0·58 [0·39–0·88]; p = 0·01). Of the patients who had at least one high-use episode, those in the SMART group had fewer days of high use without medical review (8·5 days [17·8] vs 18·3 days [24·8], 0·49 [0·31–0·75]; p = 0·001). The SMART regimen resulted in higher inhaled corticosteroid exposure (943·5 μg budesonide per day [1502·5] vs 684·3 μg budesonide per day [390·5], respectively; ratio of means 1·22 [1·06–1·41]; p = 0·006), but reduced oral corticosteroid exposure (77·5 mg prednisone [240·5] vs 126·6 mg prednisone [382·1], respectively; p = 0·011), with no significant difference in composite systemic corticosteroid exposure (793·7 mg prednisone equivalent per year [893·1] vs 772·1 mg prednisone equivalent per year [1062·7], respectively; 1·03 [0·86–1·22]; p = 0·76). Participants in the SMART group had fewer severe asthma exacerbations (35 [weighted mean rate per year 0·53] vs 66 [0·97]; relative rate 0·54 [0·36–0·82]; p = 0·004).

Interpretation

The SMART regimen has a favourable risk-to-benefit profile and can be recommended for use in adults at risk of severe asthma exacerbations.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^5217db2e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Asthma management — Recommendation 13 for individuals aged 12 years and older conditionally recommends inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy compared with higher-dose ICS–long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) as daily controller therapy and short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) for quick relief, with high certainty of evidence; for Step 4, the preferred therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used both daily and as needed, and the maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 12 puffs (54 μg) for those aged 12 years and older. This recommendation applies to all individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older. Individuals with asthma should use ICS-formoterol as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once or twice daily, with an additional 1 to 2 puffs as needed for symptoms up to a maximum of 12 puffs (54 μg formoterol) per day, and clinicians should advise individuals to contact their clinician if they need to use more than these amounts. The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, clinicians managing asthma should regularly assess individuals using this therapy, and this therapy is appropriate for Step 4. Individuals with asthma should not use ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy if they are taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy, and SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled with alternate treatments such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy. If maintenance ICS-LABA plus SABA provides adequate control, it does not need to be changed; however, if uncontrolled, individuals should receive the preferred SMART if possible before stepping up to a higher step of therapy.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^c7159e56]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/long-acting beta agonist (LABA) prescribing and device considerations emphasize that these medications may be administered as two separate medications, however, are frequently administered together into one inhaler and are recommended for asthma control therapy, and that there are currently several LABAs, with some having a more rapid onset of action (e.g., formoterol) and others a slower onset (e.g., salmeterol); the LABA used in the combined ICS/LABA controller/reliever studies, and thus recommended by the Work Group, was formoterol which has a rapid onset of action. The patient focus group identified the value of access to combination medication for both control and reliever therapy, and the Work Group recognized the convenience of combination ICS/LABA devices, noting that combination products simplify treatment plans and support improved adherence by avoiding the need for multiple devices or delivery systems. When prescribing ICS/LABA as reliever medication, care should be taken that patients are prescribed rapid-onset/long-acting beta agonists (e.g., formoterol) versus a LABA with longer onset of action (e.g., salmeterol), and patients will need education regarding the purpose, frequency of use/overuse of medication as well as inhaler administration technique; other implications include that ICS/LABA is not FDA approved for children under 6 years old.

### Budesonide / formoterol in a single inhaler for maintenance and relief in mild-to-moderate asthma: a randomized, double-blind trial [^263ecb4b]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To compare a novel asthma management strategy — budesonide/formoterol in a single inhaler for both maintenance therapy and symptom relief — with a higher dose of budesonide plus as-needed terbutaline.

Methods

This was a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study in patients with mild-to-moderate asthma (n = 697; mean age, 38 years [range, 11 to 79 years]; mean baseline FEV1, 75% of predicted; mean inhaled corticosteroid [ICS] dosage, 348 microg/d). Following a 2-week run-in period, all patients received two blinded, dry powder inhalers, one containing maintenance medication and one containing medication to be used as needed for the relief of symptoms. Patients were randomized to receive either budesonide/formoterol (80 microg/4.5 microg, two inhalations qd) for maintenance plus additional inhalations as needed for symptom relief, or budesonide (160 microg, two inhalations qd) for maintenance medication plus terbutaline (0.4 mg) as needed. The primary efficacy variable was morning peak expiratory flow (PEF).

Results

Patients receiving budesonide/formoterol showed greater improvements in morning PEF than patients receiving budesonide (increases of 34.5 L/min vs 9.5 L/min, respectively; p < 0.001). The risk of having a severe exacerbation (hospitalization/emergency department [ED] treatment, oral steroids for asthma, or a ≥ 30% decrease from baseline in morning PEF on 2 consecutive days) was 54% lower with budesonide/formoterol vs budesonide (p = 0.0011). Budesonide/formoterol patients experienced 90% fewer hospitalizations/ED treatments due to asthma than budesonide patients (1 vs 10, respectively; p = 0.026). The increased efficacy with budesonide/formoterol was achieved with less ICS than was used in the budesonide group (mean dose, 240 microg/d vs 320 microg/d, respectively) and with 77% fewer oral steroid treatment days vs budesonide (114 days vs 498 days, respectively). Both treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Budesonide/formoterol for both maintenance and relief improves asthma control with a lower steroid load compared with a higher dose of budesonide plus terbutaline.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^4adef1d0]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Track 1 — the reliever is as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol: This is the preferred approach recommended by GINA for adults and adolescents because using low-dose ICS formoterol (an anti-inflammatory reliever; AIR) reduces the risk of severe exacerbations compared with regimens that use SABA as reliever, with similar symptom control, and the regimen is simpler with a single medication across treatment steps. With this approach, when a patient at any treatment step has asthma symptoms, they use low-dose ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler for symptom relief; in Steps 1–2, this provides their anti-inflammatory therapy, and in Steps 3–5 patients also take ICS formoterol as their daily maintenance treatment; together, this is called "maintenance-and-reliever therapy" (MART).

### Comparison of budesonide / formoterol versus fluticasone furoate / vilanterol as maintenance and reliever therapy for asthma control: a real-world observational study [^ea5e4d9d]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Asthma presents with variable symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway inflammation. This inflammation causes airway hyperresponsiveness and exacerbations, making it a crucial target for asthma treatment. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are the primary treatment for managing asthma symptoms and minimizing future risks due to inflammation. Long-acting B2 agonists (LABAs) are added to ICSs when asthma symptoms are not fully controlled by ICSs alone. Budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR) can serve as both a controller and a rescue medication thanks to the rapid and long-acting bronchodilator properties of formoterol. This treatment is termed Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART). Previous studies have shown that asthma patients treated with SMART had reduced acute exacerbation rates, improved symptom control, and required a lower dosage of ICSs.

### Over-the-counter dispensing: widening access to inhaled corticosteroid / formoterol reliever therapy [^eb903e82]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The limited availability of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol reliever therapy in many countries is an issue of international concern. As recommended by the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) strategy, ICS/formoterol is preferred to short-acting β 2 agonists (SABA) as reliever therapy in adolescents and adults with asthma across the range of asthma severity. As-needed ICS/formoterol reduces the risk of severe exacerbations by between 55% and 32% compared with SABA reliever therapy when taken alone in mild asthma or together with maintenance ICS/long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA) therapy in moderate or severe asthma, respectively. It reduces the risk of β 2 agonist overuse in the situation of worsening asthma and the associated delay in seeking medical review, both key risk factors for asthma mortality. It allows titration of ICS use according to changes in asthma severity through the vehicle of bronchodilator use and ensures delivery of ICS therapy in patients not prescribed or nonadherent to maintenance ICS-based medication. It is simple to use, requiring only one inhaler device regardless of severity and is the regimen preferred by most patients.

### Regular treatment with formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid versus regular treatment with salmeterol and an inhaled corticosteroid for chronic asthma: serious adverse events [^4267fc2d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

An increase in serious adverse events with both regular formoterol and regular salmeterol in chronic asthma has been demonstrated in comparison with placebo in previous Cochrane reviews. This increase was significant in trials that did not randomise participants to an inhaled corticosteroid, but less certain in the smaller numbers of participants in trials that included an inhaled corticosteroid in the randomised treatment regimen.

Objectives

We set out to compare the risks of mortality and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials which have randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol, when each are used with an inhaled corticosteroid as part of the randomised treatment.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Manufacturers' web sites of clinical trial registers were checked for unpublished trial data and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol and salmeterol were also checked. The date of the most recent search was July 2009.

Selection Criteria

Controlled clinical trials with a parallel design, recruiting patients of any age and severity of asthma were included if they randomised patients to treatment with regular formoterol versus regular salmeterol (each with a randomised inhaled corticosteroid), and were of at least 12 weeks duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review and extracted outcome data. Unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events were sought from the sponsors and authors.

Main Results

Eight studies met the eligibility criteria of the review recruiting 6,163 adults and adolescents. There were seven studies (involving 5,935 adults and adolescents) comparing formoterol and budesonide to salmeterol and fluticasone. All but one study administered the products as a combined inhaler, and most used formoterol 50 mcg and budesonide 400 mcg twice daily versus salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone 250 mcg twice daily. There were two deaths overall (one on each combination) and neither were thought to be related to asthma. There was no significant difference between treatment groups for non-fatal serious adverse events, either all-cause (Peto OR 1.14; 95% CI 0.82 to 1.59, I(2) = 26%) or asthma-related (Peto OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.37 to 1.26, I(2) = 33%). Over 23 weeks the rates for all-cause serious adverse events were 2.6% on formoterol and budesonide and 2.3% on salmeterol and fluticasone, and for asthma-related serious adverse events, 0.6% and 0.8% respectively. There was one study (228 adults) comparing formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone, but there were no deaths or hospital admissions. No studies were found in children.

Authors' Conclusions

The seven identified studies in adults did not show any significant difference in safety between formoterol and budesonide in comparison with salmeterol and fluticasone. Asthma-related serious adverse events were rare, and there were no reported asthma-related deaths. There was a single small study comparing formoterol and beclomethasone to salmeterol and fluticasone in adults, but no serious adverse events occurred in this study. No studies were found in children. Overall there is insufficient evidence to decide whether regular formoterol and budesonide or beclomethasone have equivalent or different safety profiles from salmeterol and fluticasone.

### Fluticasone / formoterol combination therapy is as effective as fluticasone / salmeterol in the treatment of asthma, but has a more rapid onset of action: an open-label, randomized study [^dc627e92]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Starting dose of study medication

A total of 73 (72.3%) patients in the fluticasone/formoterol group and 76 (75.2%) patients in the fluticasone/salmeterol group started the study on the high-dose option. Only a very small number of patients required a change in dose strength (to a higher dose) during the study (five in the fluticasone/formoterol group, three in the fluticasone/salmeterol group).

Compliance

Compliance was over 75% in 99% of patients in the fluticasone/formoterol group and in 98% of patients in the fluticasone/salmeterol group.

Primary outcome measure

In terms of the primary efficacy endpoint, mean pre-dose FEV 1 at week 12, fluticasone/formoterol was comparable to fluticasone/salmeterol (least-squares [LS] mean of the treatment difference at week 12: –0.061 L; 95% CI: –0.161, 0.040; p = 0.007, demonstrating non-inferiority; PP population; Figure 2).

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the primary care management of asthma [^2f52c918]. DoD/VA (2025). High credibility.

VA/DoD Asthma CPG — Controller/reliever therapy context — The 2025 VA/DoD Asthma CPG uses the terminology controller/reliever rather than maintenance and reliever and notes that particularly for mild asthma a symptom driven controller/reliever strategy does not require daily maintenance use. The majority of studies evaluated a single inhaler combination of inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol, and at the time of this guideline, formoterol is the only long-acting beta agonist (LABA) studied and effective in controller/reliever therapy, although it is not FDA approved as a reliever medication. A small number of studies evaluated a single inhaler combination of ICS/albuterol; albuterol is fast-acting with a shorter duration of action and is considered a short acting beta agonist (SABA). Access to combination inhalers may be limited due to cost or formulary considerations; with education, patients could duplicate the combined controller/reliever strategy by taking separate beta agonist and inhaled corticosteroid inhalers at the same time with close follow-up; combination products simplify treatment plans, support improved adherence by avoiding multiple devices, and patients will need education on purpose, frequency of use/overuse, and inhaler administration technique.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^10aa712a]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Mild asthma — as-needed low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)–formoterol for symptom relief is supported by randomized evidence, with low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed investigated in six randomized controlled trials and showing reduced severe exacerbations by 60–64% compared with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA). Compared with regular ICS, severe exacerbation risk with as-needed ICS–formoterol was similar in blinded studies or lower in open-label pragmatic trials, and a meta-analysis reported the risk of emergency department presentation/hospitalization was 37% lower versus regular ICS–plus as-needed SABA. As-needed ICS–formoterol was as effective as daily ICS for reducing exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, and reductions in severe exacerbations versus regular ICS (or SABA alone) were independent of baseline characteristics; qualitative research found it was preferred by most patients with mild asthma but emphasized shared decision making is needed.

Asthma management — patient counseling for single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) with ICS-formoterol should include that clinicians should inform individuals and caregivers the major demonstrated benefits are reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits and in use of systemic corticosteroids; studies found no difference in documented harms between this therapy and daily ICS-LABA; studies showed that combination ICS-formoterol reduces exposure to corticosteroids, suggesting the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid-associated harms; and this recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals because of cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance.

### Bringing asthma care into the twenty-first century [^9398ec02]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The GINA 2019 update

GINA describes this update as the biggest change to asthma management proposed in over 30 years. Single inhaler ICS/formoterol is now recommended as the preferred reliever in place of SABA alone across the full spectrum of asthma severity (only for patients already on ICS/formoterol maintenance at GINA steps 3–5)(Fig. 3). Recommending use of an anti-inflammatory combination reliever for this inflammatory disease, rather than SABA alone, which can worsen inflammation, resolves a major paradox in most previous guidelines. The new approach proposed by GINA 2019 had already been suggested by a consortium of international experts on asthma management in the Lancet Commission 2017. A large body of data already exists on the efficacy and safety of the budesonide/formoterol combination when used as an as-needed reliever medication in moderate-to-severe asthma –. There is also a study showing that symptom-driven use of beclometasone/salbutamol as reliever was as effective as regular use of beclometasone, with a lower cumulative ICS dose. There are currently no data demonstrating the efficacy and safety of combining ICS/formoterol with maintenance ICS/LABA treatment that does not contain formoterol.

### Formoterol mono-and combination therapy with tiotropium in patients with COPD: a 6-month study [^606e530c]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Although guidelines recommend combining long-acting bronchodilators in COPD, data are limited. We examined the clinical efficacy and safety of formoterol, tiotropium and the combination in patients with COPD. Eight hundred and forty-seven patients with COPD (mean FEV(1) 52% predicted; FEV(1)/FVC 53%) were randomized to receive one of the following four treatments for 24 weeks: formoterol 10 microg b.i.d. plus tiotropium 18 microg o.d.; formoterol 10 microg b.i.d.; tiotropium 18 microg o.d., or placebo. The study was partially blinded (formoterol and placebo). For the primary endpoint, FEV(1) 2h post-dose after 24 weeks, there were small differences in favour of the combination therapy versus formoterol (0.07 L, p = 0.044) or tiotropium (0.06 L, p = 0.066). All three treatments were superior to placebo (p < 0.001). The combination was statistically superior to monotherapy for: the primary endpoint (p = 0.044 vs. formoterol); FEV(1) 5 min after the first dose (p < 0.001) and at 12 weeks (p < 0.05 vs. tiotropium); and peak expiratory flow averaged over the first 6 weeks (p < 0.001 vs. both). The three active treatments were significantly more effective than placebo for secondary endpoints: COPD-related 'bad days', symptoms, use of rescue medication and peak expiratory flow, and aspects of health-related quality of life. The overall incidence of adverse events was similar with all active treatments, although COPD-related adverse events were more common with tiotropium. Combined bronchodilator therapy may be a valuable treatment option for patients with COPD.

### Formoterol in clinical practice – safety issues [^77fb294f]. Respiratory Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

While short-acting beta2-agonists are seen as the cornerstone of treatment as relief medication for asthma, current guidelines recommend long-acting beta2-agonists as maintenance therapy in combination with inhaled corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe asthma, poorly controlled on present treatment. Although evidence has shown that formoterol, with its fast- and long-acting profile, is effective when used both as regular and as-needed therapy in all types of asthma, there has been some concern about the potential of beta2-agonists with long-acting profiles to produce side effects with a longer duration than seen with short-acting beta2-agonists. Also, where formoterol is used as needed, a higher total daily dose would be anticipated than when taken twice daily for regular maintenance therapy and this again has led to some concern. In a number of studies, formoterol has been shown to be well tolerated, and although systemic effects expected with this class of drugs did occur, formoterol had significantly less effect on serum potassium, pulse, blood pressure, cardiac frequency and QT interval compared with terbutaline. In addition, the duration of effects was equivalent to that observed with terbutaline and salbutamol and the relative therapeutic index of formoterol compared with salbutamol was found to be 2.5. Furthermore, studies looking at long-term use of formoterol have shown there is no reduction in bronchodilatory effect, and thus, no development of tolerance. In conclusion, formoterol is well tolerated in high doses, producing side effects typical of its class, but with a duration no longer than occurs with short-acting beta2-agonists. These observations, and the lack of tolerance development, suggest that formoterol may be appropriate treatment for patients with asthma of all types and severities on an as-needed basis or as regular treatment.

### Asthma maintenance and reliever therapy: should this be the standard of care? [^164b0915]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of asthma management is to achieve optimal asthma control, defined by the absence of daytime symptoms, nighttime waking, reliever use, functional limitation, and lung function stability, and to also reduce the future risks of asthma exacerbations, deterioration in lung function, and the medication's adverse effects. The most widely used maintenance therapy is inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). This review considered the evidence in which the combination of the ICS budesonide and the rapid-onset long-acting β-agonist (LABA) formoterol can be used as a standard of care for maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

Data Sources

The archival literature of peer-reviewed studies on the efficacy and safety of budesonide-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

Results

The ICS-LABA combination containing budesonide-formoterol reduces future risk of severe asthma exacerbations and provides similar levels of day-to-day asthma control when compared with using high-dose ICS alone, or combination ICS-LABA therapy and short-acting β 2 -agonist as a reliever.

Conclusion

Budesonide-formoterol as a single combination maintenance and reliever inhaler is effective in reducing asthma exacerbation risk, requires a lower maintenance dose of ICS, and results in a simplified approach to asthma management.

### Formoterol as reliever medication in asthma: a post-hoc analysis of the subgroup of the RELIEF study in east Asia [^b5743d36]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The primary results of the global RELIEF study showed that the proportion of patients with an AE was similar between treatment groups (42% of patients in both formoterol and salbutamol groups experienced at least one AE) as was the proportion of patients experiencing SAEs (3.1% and 3.3%, respectively). The most commonly reported AEs included aggravated asthma (12–13% of each patient group) and nasopharyngitis (5%). The time to first exacerbation was longer with formoterol (HR 0.86) and 16% less as-needed medication was used in the formoterol group in the final treatment period. In this subgroup of patients in East Asia, the results for SAEs (3.8% and 4.7%, respectively), time to first exacerbation (HR 0.86) and as-needed medication use (reliever use for formoterol was 18% lower than salbutamol in the final treatment period) all favoured formoterol to a similar, if not the same, extent as in the main study population. Interestingly, only 21% of patients recruited from East-Asian countries reported an AE compared with 42% of the global RELIEF study population. It is possible that this result reflects cultural differences in study populations with regard to reporting events.

### Formoterol fumarate-inhalation solution… [^59045867]. FDA (DailyMed) (2020). Medium credibility.

In a pre- and post-natal development study with rats dosed during the late stage of pregnancy, formoterol fumarate caused stillbirth and neonatal mortality at an exposure approximately 1, 500 times the MRHD. However, no effects were observed in this study at an exposure approximately 50 times the MRHD. Formoterol fumarate is a long-acting, beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist. Inhaled formoterol fumarate acts locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. In vitro studies have shown that formoterol has more than 200-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors than at beta1-receptors.

The pharmacologic effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including formoterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate to cyclic-3', 5'-adenosine monophosphate. Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells. In vitro tests show that formoterol is an inhibitor of the release of mast cell mediators, such as histamine and leukotrienes, from the human lung. Formoterol also inhibits histamine-induced plasma albumin extravasation in anesthetized guinea pigs and inhibits allergen-induced eosinophil influx in dogs with airway hyper-responsiveness. The relevance of these in vitro and animal findings to humans with COPD is unknown. The mean increase from baseline in QTcB interval over the 12-week treatment period was ≤ 4.

8 msec for formoterol fumarate inhalation solution and ≤
4. 6 msec for placebo. The percent of patients who experienced a maximum change in QTc greater than 60 msec at any time during the 12-week treatment period was 0% and 1. 8% for formoterol fumarate inhalation solution and placebo, respectively, based on Bazett's correction, and

1. 6% and 0. 9%, respectively, based on Fridericia's correction.

### Fluticasone / formoterol combination therapy is as effective as fluticasone / salmeterol in the treatment of asthma, but has a more rapid onset of action: an open-label, randomized study [^e4344d0e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Statistical analyses

The primary endpoint (pre-dose FEV 1 at week 12) and several secondary efficacy endpoints (change from baseline to week 12 in pre-dose FEV 1, change from pre-dose FEV 1 at baseline to 2-hour post-dose FEV 1 at week 12, discontinuations due to lack of efficacy and time to onset of action) were tested on the PP population in a confirmatory manner, with pre-defined non-inferiority limits. Non-inferiority for the primary endpoint would be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was ≥ –0.2 L. For discontinuation due to lack of efficacy, the upper limit of the 95% CI was required to be ≤ 10% (for the difference between the percentage of patients in each treatment group) for non-inferiority to be demonstrated.

Non-inferiority of fluticasone/formoterol to fluticasone/salmeterol for the primary endpoint was tested on the PP population using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and dose group as factors and the pre-dose FEV 1 values at week 0 as a linear covariate, and centre as a random effect. Secondary endpoints were analysed as follows: change in pre- and post-dose FEV 1, PEFR measurements, other lung function parameters and AQLQ scores were analysed using ANCOVA; the difference in percentages and 95% CIs were calculated for discontinuations due to lack of efficacy; time to onset of action was analysed using the multiple failures time model; rescue medication use was analysed using a Wilcoxon rank sum test; asthma symptoms and sleep disturbance scores were analysed using a linear model; patient assessment of asthma medication was analysed using a proportional odds model; asthma exacerbations were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Other endpoints, including safety parameters, were summarized using descriptive statistics. All hypothesis tests were two-sided and conducted at the 5% error level.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^8e0585ff]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Choosing between asthma treatment options highlights that at each treatment step, 'preferred' controller and reliever regimens are recommended that provide the best benefit-to-risk ratio for both symptom control and risk reduction, and choice of the preferred controller and/or preferred reliever is based on evidence from efficacy studies and effectiveness studies, with a particular focus on symptoms and exacerbation risk; safety and relative cost are also considered. In Step 5, there are different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2. In adults and adolescents, options are shown in two tracks, and Track 1, with as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever, is the preferred approach for most patients, based on evidence of overall lower exacerbation risk and similar symptom control.

Contraindications regarding the use of budesonide / glycopyrrolate / formoterol INH (also known as Breztri Aerosphere):
- **Concomitant use of LABA-containing medications**: do not use budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate more often or at higher doses than recommended, or in conjunction with other medications containing LABAs.
- **Primary treatment for asthma**: do not use budesonide/glycopyrrolate/formoterol fumarate for the treatment of asthma, as the safety and efficacy have not been established in patients with asthma.

### Efficacy and safety of formoterol for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^9ea85ba7]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Formoterol is a selective long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) that provides significant and sustained bronchodilatory effect for up to 12h following a single dose. The onset of effect is significantly faster with formoterol compared with an alternative LABA, salmeterol, although both have a similar duration of action. The overall efficacy of formoterol in improving lung function and controlling symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is comparable to that of salmeterol and potentially superior to that of ipratropium or theophylline. Formoterol provides additional benefit when administered in combination with other bronchodilators or inhaled corticosteroids. In clinical studies, formoterol was well tolerated and had an adverse-event profile similar to that of other beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists. Formoterol is a rapidly acting, well-tolerated, effective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist that can be regularly used as a long-acting bronchodilator for patients with moderate to severe COPD, as per recommendations of the current treatment guidelines.

### Budesonide / formoterol as effective as prednisolone plus formoterol in acute exacerbations of COPD. A double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, parallel-group, multicentre study [^76f10404]. Respiratory Research (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Oral corticosteroids and inhaled bronchodilators with or without antibiotics represent standard treatment of COPD exacerbations of moderate severity. Frequent courses of oral steroids may be a safety issue. We wanted to evaluate in an out-patient setting whether a 2-week course of inhaled budesonide/formoterol would be equally effective for treatment of acute COPD exacerbations as standard therapy in patients judged by the investigator not to require hospitalisation.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomised, non-inferiority, parallel-group, multicentre study comparing two treatment strategies; two weeks' treatment with inhaled budesonide/formoterol (320/9 microg, qid) was compared with prednisolone (30 mg once daily) plus inhaled formoterol (9 microg bid) in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD attending a primary health care centre. Inclusion criteria were progressive dyspnoea for less than one week, FEV1 30–60% of predicted normal after acute treatment with a single dose of oral corticosteroid plus nebulised salbutamol/ipratropium bromide and no requirement for subsequent immediate hospitalisation, i.e. the clinical status after the acute treatment allowed for sending the patient home. A total of 109 patients (mean age 67 years, 33 pack-years, mean FEV1 45% of predicted) were randomized to two weeks' double-blind treatment with budesonide/formoterol or prednisolone plus formoterol and subsequent open-label budesonide/formoterol (320/9 microg bid) for another 12 weeks. Change in FEV1 was the primary efficacy variable. Non-inferiority was predefined.

Results

Non-inferiority of budesonide/formoterol was proven because the lower limit of FEV1-change (97.5% CI) was above 90% of the efficacy of the alternative treatment. Symptoms, quality of life, treatment failures, need for reliever medication (and exacerbations during follow-up) did not differ between the groups. No safety concerns were identified.

Conclusion

High dose budesonide/formoterol was as effective as prednisolone plus formoterol for the ambulatory treatment of acute exacerbations in non-hospitalized COPD patients. An early increase in budesonide/formoterol dose may therefore be tried before oral corticosteroids are used.

### Beclomethasone / formoterol in the management of COPD: a randomised controlled trial [^b7387c76]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of beclomethasone/formoterol versus budesonide/formoterol (non-inferiority) and versus formoterol (superiority) in patients with severe stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Methods

A double-blind, double-dummy, randomised, active-controlled, parallel-group study. After 4 weeks run-in with ipratropium/salbutamol (40/200 μg, three times daily) patients were randomised to receive beclomethasone/formoterol (200/12 μg pressurised metered dose inhaler), budesonide/formoterol (400/12 μg dry powder inhaler) or formoterol (12 μg dry powder inhaler) twice daily for 48 weeks. Co-primary efficacy variables were change from baseline to 48 weeks in pre-dose morning forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and mean rate of COPD exacerbations.

Results

Of 718 patients randomised, 703 (232 beclomethasone/formoterol, 238 budesonide/formoterol, 233 formoterol) were in the ITT analysis. Improvement in pre-dose morning FEV(1) was 0.077 L, 0.080 L and 0.026 L for beclomethasone/formoterol, budesonide/formoterol and formoterol respectively (LS mean from the ANCOVA model). Beclomethasone/formoterol was not inferior to budesonide/formoterol (95% CI of the difference -0.052, 0.048) and superior to formoterol (p = 0.046). The overall rate of COPD exacerbations/patient/year was similar and not statistically significantly different among treatments (beclomethasone/formoterol 0.414, budesonide/formoterol 0.423 and formoterol 0.431). Quality of life and COPD symptoms improved in all groups and use of rescue medication decreased. Safety profiles were as expected and treatments well-tolerated.

Conclusions

Beclomethasone/formoterol (400/24 μg) treatment for 48 weeks improved pulmonary function, reduced symptoms compared to formoterol, was safe and well-tolerated in patients with severe stable COPD. Neither of the long-acting β2-agonist/inhaled corticosteroid combinations affected the low exacerbation rate seen in this population.

### Fluticasone / formoterol combination therapy is as effective as fluticasone / salmeterol in the treatment of asthma, but has a more rapid onset of action: an open-label, randomized study [^f028b04b]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The efficacy of inhaled fluticasone and of inhaled formoterol is documented extensively in the literature, including as part of ICS/LABA combination therapies with other components. Prescribing data indicate that fluticasone and formoterol are already co-prescribed and used concurrently in patients with asthma. Now these two components are brought together into a single combination therapy option. It has previously been demonstrated that fluticasone/formoterol has comparable efficacy to its individual components administered concurrently.

This study demonstrated that fluticasone/formoterol is comparable to standard fluticasone/salmeterol therapy in terms of the primary endpoint (pre-dose FEV 1 at week 12), as well as for several secondary efficacy endpoints (change from baseline to week 12 in pre-dose FEV 1, change from pre-dose FEV 1 at baseline to 2-hour post-dose FEV 1 at week 12 and discontinuation due to lack of efficacy). Fluticasone/formoterol also demonstrated similar efficacy to fluticasone/salmeterol for various other measures of lung function, rescue medication use, patient reported outcomes and asthma exacerbations. Furthermore, the safety and tolerability profiles of the two treatments were similar.

Importantly, fluticasone/formoterol was superior to fluticasone/salmeterol in terms of time to onset of action. This is most likely to be due to the rapid onset of action of formoterol, which is equivalent to that of salbutamol. Although the proportion of patients in both treatment groups showing onset of action at weeks 2, 6 and 12 was lower than at week 0 (baseline), reflecting the fact that the patients were not as well controlled at baseline and thus more responsive to study medication, the superiority of fluticasone/formoterol over fluticasone/salmeterol was maintained. The benefit of fluticasone/formoterol in terms of speed of onset of action may be clinically important, given that a consensus panel of practising physicians has suggested that a rapid onset of action might be expected to have a positive impact on the adherence of patients to their treatment. However, it should also be considered that patients who are well controlled may not experience the benefit offered by a medication with a rapid onset of action.

### Fluticasone / formoterol combination therapy is as effective as fluticasone / salmeterol in the treatment of asthma, but has a more rapid onset of action: an open-label, randomized study [^0cea1cc0]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Sample size

The sample size was focused on the difference in the 12-week FEV 1 values analysed within a linear model with the baseline FEV 1 value as a covariate. It was assumed that the observed treatment difference would not exceed 0.02 and the standard deviation would be 0.5. The non-inferiority bound was fixed to 0.2, corresponding to an effect size of 0.4, which could be interpreted as 'mild-to-moderate'. For a two-sided level of significance (α = 0.05, power of 80%), 113 patients per treatment group were required. Assuming a correlation between the 12-week and baseline FEV 1 values of approximately 0.5, the sample size would be reduced to 85 patients per treatment group. The comparison was focused on the per protocol (PP) population. Assuming that approximately 10% of the randomized patients would not be part of the PP population, 200 patients needed to be randomized to this study.

Analysis populations

The relevant study sets were as follows: safety population, all patients who received study treatment and had at least one post-dose safety assessment; full analysis set (FAS), all randomized patients who received study treatment and had at least one post-dose primary efficacy (FEV 1) measurement; PP population, all FAS patients who completed the study without major protocol violations affecting the primary efficacy (FEV 1) endpoint.

In Step 1, the recommendation for as-needed, low-dose ICS–formoterol for adults and adolescents with symptoms less than twice per month is supported by indirect evidence for a large reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA alone. Extension of this recommendation to Step 1 was also supported by several important considerations:

- Historically, recommendations for as-needed SABA alone were never supported by evidence of long-term safety or efficacy; early guidelines had assumed that patients with mild asthma would not benefit from ICS and were concerned about its risks based on experience with OCS.
- The past distinction between eligibility for Step 1 and Step 2 treatment based on symptom frequency (e.g. ≤ or > 2 d/wk) was arbitrary, not evidence-based.
- The use of as-needed ICS–formoterol markedly reduces severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA, even in patients with SABA use less than or equal to two times per week at baseline (so-called intermittent asthma).
- A single day with more than two, more than four, more than six, or more than eight doses of as-needed budesonide–formoterol reduced the short-term (21-d) risk of severe exacerbations, compared with as-needed SABA alone (post hoc analysis). A similar effect was seen with ICS–formoterol MART in Steps 3–4.
- Even modest overuse of SABA (e.g. dispensing three or more albuterol canisters per year, i.e. average of ⩾1.6 puffs/d) is associated with an increased risk of severe exacerbations and, in one study, higher asthma mortality.
- Even occasional short courses of OCS (e.g. four to five courses over 7 yr [i.e. less than one course per year]), are associated with significant short-term risks and cumulative risks of long-term adverse effects such as osteoporosis and diabetes.
- Regular, daily, low-dose ICS treatment is highly effective in reducing asthma symptoms and risk, including in patients with infrequent symptoms, but poor adherence to ICS is common, exposing patients to the risks of SABA-only treatment.
- As-needed budesonide–formoterol is well tolerated in mild asthma.
- Starting treatment with SABA alone trains the patient to regard it as their primary asthma treatment.

### Questions in mild asthma: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^47318754]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

As-needed use of ICS taken with a bronchodilator for symptom relief

As-needed ICSs were evaluated with rapid-acting bronchodilators in three different regimens: 1) as-needed ICS plus formoterol (LABA) in a single inhaler, 2) as-needed ICS plus albuterol (SABA) in a single inhaler, and 3) as-needed ICS plus albuterol in separate inhalers.

Low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief was investigated in six randomized controlled trials. As-needed ICS–formoterol reduced the risk of severe exacerbations by 60–64% compared with as-needed SABA. Compared with regular ICS, the severe exacerbation risk with as-needed ICS–formoterol was similar in blinded studies or lower in open-label pragmatic trials, possibly related to poorer adherence to regular ICS. In the meta-analysis, the risk of emergency department presentation/hospitalization was 37% lower with as-needed ICS–formoterol versus regular ICS plus as-needed SABA.

### Budesonide / formoterol maintenance and reliever therapy: an effective asthma treatment option? [^fc6e8cf3]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

This 12-month dose-titration study assessed the effectiveness of budesonide/formoterol for maintenance plus relief with a control group using salmeterol/fluticasone for maintenance plus salbutamol for relief. Adolescents and adults (n = 2,143; mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) 73% predicted; mean inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) 884 microg.day(-1)) were randomised to budesonide/formoterol 160/4.5 microg two inhalations b.i.d. plus additional inhalations as needed, or salmeterol/fluticasone 50/250 microg b.i.d. plus salbutamol as needed. Treatment was prescribed open label; after 4 weeks, physicians could titrate maintenance doses in accordance with normal clinical practice. Maintenance plus as-needed budesonide/formoterol prolonged the time to first severe exacerbation versus salmeterol/fluticasone (25% risk reduction). The total number of severe exacerbations was significantly reduced in the budesonide/formoterol group (255 versus 329). Both regimens provided sustained improvements in symptoms, as-needed use, quality of life and FEV1, with differences in favour of the budesonide/formoterol group for as-needed use (0.58 versus 0.93 inhalations.day(-1)) and FEV1 (post-beta2-agonist values). Mean ICS dose during treatment was similar in both groups (653 microg budesonide.day(-1) (maintenance plus as-needed) versus 583 microg fluticasone.day(-1)). The simplified strategy using budesonide/formoterol for maintenance and reliever therapy is feasible, safe and at least as effective as salmeterol/fluticasone plus salbutamol.

Asthma guideline — SMART implementation and dosing states SMART is appropriate for Step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) treatment; ICS-formoterol should be administered as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once to twice daily and one to two puffs as needed for asthma symptoms; the maximum number of puffs per day is 12 (54 μg formoterol) for individuals aged 12 years and older and 8 (36 μg formoterol) for children aged 4 to 11 years, and clinicians should advise individuals or caregivers to contact their physician if they need to use more than these amounts; the calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation; ICS-formoterol should not be used as quick-relief therapy in individuals taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy; SMART is administered with a single inhaler containing both formoterol and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), primarily budesonide in reviewed studies, with one study using beclomethasone.

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically with respect to ICSs and LABAs, NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend to offer ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy in ≥ 12 years old patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma rather than:

- higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy

- same-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy.

Ages 5–11 years terminology and monitoring — The terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler, and where formoterol is specified in the steps, it is because the evidence is based on studies specific to formoterol. In individuals ages 5–11 years with persistent allergic asthma in which there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement is conditionally recommended as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessment.

### Controversies in allergy: should I combine an ICS with a SABA or with formoterol for reliever therapy? [^b38e841e]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Multiple approaches with inhaler therapies can be used when treating asthma. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce airway inflammation, whereas bronchodilators relax airway smooth muscle. Anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR) therapy combines an ICS with quick-onset bronchodilators for use as a rescue therapy. Several AIR strategies have demonstrated efficacy in reducing asthma exacerbations. There are currently 2 inhalers that combine an ICS with a quick onset bronchodilator into a single inhaler: one which combines an ICS with short-acting β 2 -agonist (ICS-SABA) and one which combines an ICS with the long-acting β 2 -agonist formoterol (ICS-formoterol). Alternatively, AIR therapy can be provided with the ICS and the SABA in 2 separate inhalers. The provider may come across challenges when choosing a specific therapy best suited for each patient, including insurance and regulatory issues. This article reviews the literature on AIR therapy in adult and pediatric populations with asthma along with implementation considerations when choosing a specific AIR strategy.

### Randomised trial comparing as-needed versus regular treatment with formoterol in patients with persistent asthma [^a3f93dcd]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the equivalent efficacy of inhaled formoterol in asthmatic patients, either given as-needed or on a regular twice-daily schedule.

Methods

Randomised, open 12-week study in patients with mild to moderate asthma not adequately controlled with inhaled glucocorticosteroids alone. Patients received inhaled formoterol as needed or on a regular schedule (2x2 puffs/day with 6 microg formoterol per puff). Patients in the twice-daily formoterol group could use salbutamol as a rescue medication. The primary endpoint was the number of patients with asthma exacerbations in each group.

Results

Thirty-nine centres randomised 359 patients. The number of patients with asthma exacerbations showed neither a clinically relevant nor a statistically significant difference between groups: formoterol as-needed: 3.95% (7 of 177); twice daily: 3.45% (6 of 174). Patients in the formoterol as-needed group used significantly less formoterol (-1.5 puffs per day; P < 0.0001). Including the saved rescue medication (up to one puff per day), total beta-2 agonist use in the formoterol as-needed group decreased by approximately 2–2.5 puffs per day. Both formoterol treatment schedules were well tolerated. Musculoskeletal pain and tremor were less frequent in the formoterol as-needed group: headaches were slightly more frequent.

Conclusion

Formoterol given as needed and without additional beta-2 agonist, and formoterol given on a regular basis twice daily, supplemented by salbutamol as a rescue medication, appeared equally effective in this clinical study. Drug consumption was markedly lower in the former group.

### Efficacy and safety of inhaled formoterol 4.5 and 9 μ g twice daily in Japanese and European COPD patients: phase III study results [^8fef7b5f]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the long-acting β₂-agonist formoterol in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.

Methods

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational phase III study randomized patients ≥ 40 years of age with moderate-to-severe COPD to inhaled formoterol 4.5 or 9 μg twice daily (bid) via Turbuhaler or placebo for 12 weeks. Salbutamol 100 μg/actuation via pMDI was permitted as reliever medication. The primary outcome variable was change (ratio) from baseline to treatment period in FEV1 60-min post-dose.

Results

613 patients received treatment (formoterol 4.5 μg n = 206; 9 μg n = 199; placebo n = 208); 539 (87.9%) male; 324 (52.9%) Japanese and 289 (47.1%) European. End of study increases in FEV1 60-min post-dose were significantly greater (p < 0.001 for both) with formoterol 4.5 and 9 μg bid (113% of baseline for both) than with placebo, as were all secondary outcome measures. The proportion of patients with an improvement in St George's Respiratory Questionnaire score of ≥ 4 was 50.2% for formoterol 4.5 μg (p = 0.0682 vs. placebo), 59.2% (p = 0.0004) for 9 μg, and 41.3% for placebo. Reduction in reliever medication use was significantly greater with formoterol vs. placebo (9 μg: -0.548, p < 0.001; 4.5 μg: -0.274, p = 0.027), with 9 μg being significantly superior to 4.5 μg (-0.274, p = 0.029). Formoterol was well tolerated with the incidence and type of adverse events not being different for the three groups.

Conclusions

Formoterol 4.5 μg and 9 μg bid was effective and well tolerated in patients with COPD; there was no difference between formoterol doses for the primary endpoint; however, an added value of formoterol 9 μg over 4.5 μg bid was observed for some secondary endpoints.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^6d9e72b5]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Track 1 (preferred) steps 1–2 treatment for adults and adolescents uses as-needed low-dose combination ICS-formoterol, which is used as needed for symptom relief, and before exercise or before expected allergen exposure. Information about Steps 1 and 2 is combined because the recommended treatment (as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol) is the same. In Track 1, Step 1–2 treatment with as-needed-only low-dose combination ICS-formoterol is recommended for step-down treatment for patients whose asthma is well controlled on low-dose maintenance-and-reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol (Evidence D) or on regular low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA (Evidence A), and for initial asthma treatment for patients previously using SABA alone (or with newly diagnosed asthma), with normal or mildly reduced lung function; some clinical factors, outlined below, may prompt consideration of starting treatment instead at Step 3, with low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy.

### Regular versus as-needed budesonide and formoterol combination treatment for moderate asthma: a non-inferiority, randomised, double-blind clinical trial [^9f71a774]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment guidelines for patients with moderate persistent asthma recommend regular therapy with a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a longacting β2 agonist plus as-needed rapid-acting bronchodilators. We investigated whether symptom-driven budesonide and formoterol combination therapy administered as needed would be as effective as regular treatment with this combination plus as-needed symptom-driven terbutaline for patients with moderate asthma.

Methods

In this non-inferiority randomised clinical trial, we recruited adult patients (18–65 years of age) with stable moderate persistent asthma, according to 2006 Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines. Patients were recruited from outpatient clinics of secondary and tertiary referral hospitals and university centres. After a 6-week run-in period of inhaled regular budesonide and formoterol plus as-needed terbutaline, the patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive placebo twice daily plus as-needed treatment with inhaled 160 μg budesonide and 4·5 μg formoterol (as-needed budesonide and formoterol therapy) or twice-daily 160 μg budesonide and 4·5 μg formoterol combination plus symptom-driven 500 μg terbutaline (regular budesonide/formoterol therapy) for 1 year. Randomisation was done according to a list prepared with the use of a random number generator and a balanced-block design stratified by centre. Patients and investigators were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was time to first treatment failure measured after 1 year of treatment using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the power of the study was calculated based on the rate of treatment failure. Analyses were done on the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00849095.

Findings

Between April 20, 2009, and March 31, 2012, we screened 1010 patients with moderate asthma and randomly assigned 866 eligible patients to the two treatment groups (424 to as-needed budesonide and formoterol therapy and 442 to regular budenoside and formoterol therapy). Compared with regular budesonide and formoterol therapy, as-needed budesonide and formoterol treatment was associated with a lower probability of patients having no treatment failure at 1 year (Kaplan-Meier estimates 53·6% for as-needed treatment vs 64·0% for regular treatment; difference 10·3% [95% CI 3·2–17·4], at a predefined non-inferiority limit of 9%). Patients in the as-needed budesonide and formoterol group had shorter time to first treatment failure than those in the regular therapy group (11·86 weeks vs 28·00 weeks for the first quartile [ie, the time until the first 25% of patients experienced treatment failure]). The difference in treatment failures was largely attributable to nocturnal awakenings (82 patients in the as-needed treatment group vs 44 in the regular treatment group). Both treatment regimens were well tolerated.

Interpretation

In patients with moderate stable asthma, as-needed budesonide and formoterol therapy is less effective than is the guideline-recommended regular budesonide and formoterol treatment, even though the differences are small.

### The role of ICS-containing rescue therapy versus SABA alone in asthma management today [^95cb081d]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) recommends that short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA) monotherapy should no longer be prescribed, and that as-needed combination inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol is the preferred reliever therapy in adults and adolescents with mild asthma. These recommendations are based on the risks of SABA monotherapy, the evidence that ICS-formoterol reliever therapy markedly decreases the occurrence of severe asthma exacerbations compared with SABA reliever therapy alone, and because ICS-formoterol reliever therapy has a favorable risk/benefit profile compared with maintenance ICS plus SABA reliever therapy. Data supporting the use of combination ICS-albuterol reliever therapy in mild asthma are more limited, but there are studies that inform its use in this population. In this review, we compare, using a pros and cons format, the (1) long-term safety and efficacy of ICS-formoterol reliever therapy versus SABA reliever therapy alone, (2) long-term safety and efficacy of ICS-albuterol reliever therapy versus SABA reliever therapy alone, (3) immediate bronchodilator effects of ICS-formoterol versus SABA alone, and (4) clinical and regulatory factors that may inform reliever therapy prescription decisions. By presenting the evidence of these reliever inhaler options, we hope to inform the reader while also calling for necessary future effectiveness and implementation research.

### Once-vs twice-daily budesonide / formoterol in 6-to 15-year-old patients with stable asthma [^ffa91179]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess efficacy/tolerability of once-daily budesonide/formoterol pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) versus budesonide pMDI (primary) and twice-daily budesonide/formoterol (secondary) in children/adolescents with asthma stabilized with twice-daily budesonide/formoterol.

Methods

This 12-week multicenter, double-blind randomized controlled study (www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00646321) included 521 patients aged 6 to 15 years with mild/moderate persistent asthma. Patients stabilized during a 4- to 5-week run-in with twice-daily budesonide/formoterol pMDI 40/4.5 microgx2 inhalations (160/18 microg daily) received twice-daily budesonide/formoterol pMDI 40/4.5 microgx2 inhalations (160/18 microg daily), once-daily budesonide/formoterol pMDI 80/4.5 microgx2 inhalations (160/9 microg daily; evening), or once-daily budesonide pMDI 80 microgx2 inhalations (160 microg daily; evening).

Results

Once- or twice-daily budesonide/formoterol was more effective than budesonide for evening peak expiratory flow (primary variable) at the end of the 24-hour once-daily dosing interval (P ≤ .027). Twice-daily budesonide/formoterol demonstrated better efficacy versus once-daily treatments for evening predose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (P ≤ .011), versus budesonide for daytime/nighttime rescue medication (P ≤ .023), and versus once-daily budesonide/formoterol for daytime rescue medication (last 12 hours of once-daily dosing) (P = 0.032). There were no significant between-group differences for daytime/nighttime asthma symptoms, nighttime awakenings attributed to asthma, or health-related quality of life. Fewer patients experienced asthma worsening (predefined criteria) with twice-daily budesonide/formoterol (8.2%) versus once-daily budesonide (15.5%) (P = 0.036) or once-daily budesonide/formoterol (19.6%) (P = 0.002). All treatments were well tolerated.

Conclusions

Once-daily budesonide/formoterol demonstrated significantly better efficacy than once-daily budesonide for most pulmonary-function variables. Twice-daily budesonide/formoterol (160/18 microg daily) maintenance therapy was generally more effective than stepping down to once-daily dosing (160/9 microg daily). Treatments were well tolerated, and there was no evident safety benefit for once- versus twice-daily dosing.

### Comparison of the efficacy of formoterol and salmeterol in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease: a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial [^3b3653f4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Beta2-adrenergic agonists are frequently used for the prevention and relief of bronchospasm in patients with reversible obstructive airway disease. Formoterol and salmeterol are long-acting beta2-agonists. In addition to its long duration of action, formoterol has been reported to have an onset of action similar to that of albuterol.

Objective

This study compared the effects on lung function of regular twice-daily inhalation of formoterol or salmeterol in adults with moderate to moderately severe persistent asthma who were receiving daily inhaled corticosteroids.

In this 6-month, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group study, patients with moderate or moderately severe asthma were randomized to receive either formoterol 12 microg BID or salmeterol 50 microg BID. The primary end point was mean morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) measured 5 minutes after dosing and entered in a patient diary each day during the first 4 weeks of treatment. Secondary end points included mean morning and evening predose PEF and number of episode-free days recorded in the patient diaries during the first 4 weeks of treatment, use and time of rescue medication, symptom scores, and overall mean morning predose PEF (spirometric measurements made by the physician during scheduled visits) for the entire treatment period. Safety assessments included spontaneously reported adverse events and vital signs.

Results

A total of 528 patients were randomized to study treatment, 262 to formoterol and 266 to salmeterol. There were no significant differences in demographic or baseline characteristics between treatment groups, except in the proportion of current smokers in the formoterol group (4.6%) compared with the salmeterol group (1.5%; P = 0.039). Based on the information recorded in patients' diaries, those receiving formoterol showed significant improvement in mean morning PEF measured 5 minutes after dosing (P < 0.001), reduced use of rescue medication (P < 0.03), and an increased number of episode-free days (P < 0.04) compared with patients receiving salmeterol. Mean predose morning and evening PEF and symptom scores based on diary data and mean morning predose PEF based on measurements obtained during office visits were comparable between the 2 treatment groups throughout the study.

Conclusions

In this open-label trial, patients randomized to formoterol treatment had greater improvement in mean PEF 5 minutes after dosing, required significantly less rescue medication (fewer actuations of albuterol), and experienced more episode-free days compared with patients receiving salmeterol. Thus, although both formoterol and salmeterol are long-acting beta2-agonists, formoterol had a more rapid onset of action.

### Serious asthma events with budesonide plus formoterol vs. budesonide alone [^15c71619]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Concerns remain about the safety of adding long-acting β2-agonists to inhaled glucocorticoids for the treatment of asthma. In a postmarketing safety study mandated by the Food and Drug Administration, we evaluated whether the addition of formoterol to budesonide maintenance therapy increased the risk of serious asthma-related events in patients with asthma.

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, 26-week study, we randomly assigned patients, 12 years of age or older, who had persistent asthma, were receiving daily asthma medication, and had had one to four asthma exacerbations in the previous year to receive budesonide-formoterol or budesonide alone. Patients with a history of life-threatening asthma were excluded. The primary end point was the first serious asthma-related event (a composite of adjudicated death, intubation, and hospitalization), as assessed in a time-to-event analysis. The noninferiority of budesonide-formoterol to budesonide was defined as an upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the risk of the primary safety end point of less than 2.0. The primary efficacy end point was the first asthma exacerbation, as assessed in a time-to-event analysis.

Results

A total of 11,693 patients underwent randomization, of whom 5846 were assigned to receive budesonide-formoterol and 5847 to receive budesonide. A serious asthma-related event occurred in 43 patients who were receiving budesonide-formoterol and in 40 patients who were receiving budesonide (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 1.65]); budesonide-formoterol was shown to be noninferior to budesonide alone. There were two asthma-related deaths, both in the budesonide-formoterol group; one of these patients had undergone an asthma-related intubation. The risk of an asthma exacerbation was 16.5% lower with budesonide-formoterol than with budesonide (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.94; P = 0.002).

Conclusions

Among adolescents and adults with predominantly moderate-to-severe asthma, treatment with budesonide-formoterol was associated with a lower risk of asthma exacerbations than budesonide and a similar risk of serious asthma-related events.

### Regular treatment with formoterol and inhaled steroids for chronic asthma: serious adverse events [^7b4313c3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between beta2-agonists and increases in asthma mortality. Much debate has surrounded possible causal links for this association and whether regular (daily) long-acting beta2-agonists are safe when used alone or in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids. This is an updated Cochrane Review.

Objectives

To assess the risk of fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events in people with chronic asthma given regular formoterol with inhaled corticosteroids versus the same dose of inhaled corticosteroids alone.

Search Methods

Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Web sites of clinical trial registers were checked for unpublished trial data; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol were also checked. The date of the most recent search was August 2012.

Selection Criteria

Controlled clinical trials with a parallel design were included if they randomly allocated people of any age and severity of asthma to treatment with regular formoterol and inhaled corticosteroids for at least 12 weeks.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events were obtained from the sponsors. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE recommendations.

Main Results

Following the 2012 update, we have included 20 studies on 10,578 adults and adolescents and seven studies on 2788 children and adolescents. We found data on all-cause fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events for all studies, and we judged the overall risk of bias to be low. Six deaths occurred in participants taking regular formoterol with inhaled corticosteroids, and one in a participant administered regular inhaled corticosteroids alone. The difference was not statistically significant (Peto odds ratio (OR) 3.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 16.03, low-quality evidence). All deaths were reported in adults, and one was believed to be asthma-related. Non-fatal serious adverse events of any cause were very similar for each treatment in adults (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.27, moderate-quality evidence), and weak evidence suggested an increase in events in children on regular formoterol (Peto OR 1.62, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.28, moderate-quality evidence). In contrast with all-cause serious adverse events, the addition of new trial data means that asthma-related serious adverse events associated with formoterol are now significantly fewer in adults taking regular formoterol with inhaled corticosteroids (Peto OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.88, moderate-quality evidence). Although a greater number of asthma-related events were reported in children receiving regular formoterol, this finding was not statistically significant (Peto OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.48 to 4.61, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

From the evidence in this review, it is not possible to reassure people with asthma that regular use of inhaled corticosteroids with formoterol carries no risk of increasing mortality in comparison with use of inhaled corticosteroids alone. On the other hand, we have found no conclusive evidence of serious harm, and only one asthma-related death was registered during more than 4200 patient-years of observation with formoterol. In adults, no significant difference in all-cause non-fatal serious adverse events was noted with regular formoterol with inhaled corticosteroids, but a significant reduction in asthma-related serious adverse events was observed in comparison with inhaled corticosteroids alone. In children the number of events was too small, and consequently the results too imprecise, to allow determination of whether the increased risk of all-cause non-fatal serious adverse events found in a previous meta-analysis on regular formoterol alone is abolished by the additional use of inhaled corticosteroids. We await the results of large ongoing surveillance studies mandated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for more information. Clinical decisions and information provided to patients regarding regular use of formoterol have to take into account the balance between known symptomatic benefits of formoterol and the degree of uncertainty associated with its potential harmful effects.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^8dc61bfe]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Individuals ages 12+ years — The terms ICS-LABA and ICS-formoterol indicate combination therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually and preferably in a single inhaler. Where formoterol is specified in the steps, it is because the evidence is based on studies specific to formoterol. In individuals ages 12 years and older with persistent allergic asthma in which there is uncertainty in choosing, monitoring, or adjusting anti-inflammatory therapies based on history, clinical findings, and spirometry, FeNO measurement is conditionally recommended as part of an ongoing asthma monitoring and management strategy that includes frequent assessment. Bronchial thermoplasty was evaluated in Step 6. The outcome was a conditional recommendation against the therapy.

### Stopping long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) for children with asthma well controlled on LABA and inhaled corticosteroids [^2a68d38a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is the most common chronic medical condition among children and is one of the most common causes of hospitalisation and medical visits. Poorly controlled asthma often leads to preventable exacerbations that require additional medications, hospital stays, or treatment in the emergency department. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are the preferred add-on treatment for children with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a 'black box' warning for LABA in asthma, and now recommends that they be used "for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved".

Objectives

To compare the effect on asthma control and adverse effects of stepping down to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-only therapy versus continuing ICS plus LABA in children whose asthma is well controlled on combined ICS and LABA therapy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, and also searched www. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.who.int/ictrp/en/, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, and manufacturers' trial registries (GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca). We searched all databases from their inception to the present, and imposed no restriction on language of publication. The most recent search was done in April 2015.

Selection Criteria

We looked for parallel randomised controlled trials of at least eight weeks' duration, available as published full text, abstract only, or unpublished data. We excluded studies including participants with other chronic respiratory comorbidities (for example bronchiectasis). We looked for studies in which children (18 years or younger) whose asthma was well controlled on any dose of ICS and LABA combination therapy were randomised to: a) step-down therapy to ICS alone or b) continued use of ICS and LABA. We included any dose of LABA (formoterol, salmeterol, vilanterol) and any dose of ICS (beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, mometasone, flunisolide, fluticasone propionate, fluticasone furoate, triamcinolone) delivered in a combination inhaler or in separate inhalers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened all records identified in the searches. We used a data extraction tool in Microsoft Excel to manage searches and document reasons for inclusion and exclusion, and to extract descriptive and numerical data from trials meeting the inclusion criteria. The prespecified primary outcomes were exacerbations requiring oral steroids, asthma control, and all-cause serious adverse events.

Main Results

Despite conducting extensive searches of electronic databases, trial registries and manufacturers' websites we identified no trials matching the inclusion criteria. After removing duplicates, we screened 1031 abstracts, and assessed 43 full-text articles for inclusion. We identified several adult studies, which will be summarised in a separate review (Ahmad 2014). The most common reasons for exclusion after viewing full texts were 'wrong comparison' (n = 22) and 'adult population' (n = 18). Some adult studies recruited adolescents from age 15, but none reported data separately for those under 18.

Authors' Conclusions

There is currently no evidence from randomised trials to inform the discontinuation of LABAs in children once asthma control is achieved with ICS plus LABA. It is disappointing that such an important issue has not been studied, and a randomised double-blind trial recruiting children who are controlled on ICS plus LABA is warranted. The study should be large enough to assess children of different ages, and to measure the important safety and efficacy outcomes suggested in this review over at least six months. The only randomised evidence for stopping LABA has been conducted in adults; it will be summarised in a separate review.

### Formoterol fumarate dihydrate (formoterol fumarate) [^3423c8d5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use).

Serious Asthma-Related Events

Inform patients that long-acting beta agonist, such as formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, when used as monotherapy [without an inhaled corticosteroid], increase the risk of serious asthma-related events, including asthma-related death. Formoterol fumarate inhalation solution is not indicated for the treatment of asthma.

Acute Exacerbations or Deteriorations

Formoterol fumarate inhalation solution is not indicated for relief of acute symptoms, and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta2-agonist (the healthcare provider should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used). Patients should be instructed to seek medical attention if their symptoms worsen despite recommended doses of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution, if formoterol fumarate inhalation solution treatment becomes less effective, or if they need more inhalations of a short-acting beta2-agonist than usual.

Appropriate Dosing

Patients should not stop using formoterol fumarate inhalation solution unless told to do so by a healthcare provider because symptoms may get worse. Patients should not inhale more than the prescribed number of vials at any one time. The daily dosage of formoterol fumarate inhalation solution should not exceed one vial twice daily (40 mcg total daily dose). Excessive use of sympathomimetics may cause significant cardiovascular effects and may be fatal.

### Safety and efficacy of fluticasone / formoterol combination therapy in adolescent and adult patients with mild-to-moderate asthma: a randomised controlled trial [^32cc6bed]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The third co-primary endpoint, evaluated for the fluticasone/formoterol versus placebo treatment arms, showed that the combination product was statistically significantly superior to placebo with respect to the time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Fewer patients in the combination therapy group prematurely left the study because of lack of treatment efficacy compared to those in any of the other three treatment groups.

Probably the most important and clinically relevant endpoint for patients is disease control. This was evaluated in this study by analysing the number of asthma control days, asthma exacerbations, rescue medication-free days, symptom-free days, and awakening-free nights. Although not a validated endpoint, the definition of asthma control used in this study was robust and highly relevant (recorded as days with no asthma symptoms, no sleep disturbance due to asthma, and no use of rescue medication). The use of the gatekeeping approach meant that these secondary endpoints could not be subjected to confirmatory statistical testing. However, the greatest improvements in these symptomatic endpoints were seen for patients administered the combination product compared to those receiving either of the individual treatments or placebo. Patients treated with the combination product also reported fewer asthma exacerbations throughout the study compared to each of the other treatment arms.

A potential criticism of this study could be the recruitment of patients who were not on ICS monotherapy at baseline, perhaps suggesting the potential for over-treatment of patients with milder asthma. This would not be consistent with GINA guidelines, which suggest a stepwise treatment approach whereby patients with persistent asthma should be initiated on a low to medium dose of inhaled corticosteroids prior to treatment escalation in the event of a suboptimal response. Nonetheless, the median FEV 1 as a percentage of predicted value at baseline was relatively low (72–75% across the treatment groups), suggesting that a notable proportion of patients had moderately severe asthma and significant pulmonary impairment.

Furthermore, whilst the authors would not advocate a change to established treatment paradigm, two observations are nonetheless evident from this study. Firstly, pre-specified subgroup analysis of the populations of patients with no history of ICS use at baseline and those who were on an ICS at baseline demonstrate that both subgroups showed improvements for the two co-primary lung function endpoints over 12 weeks of treatment. Secondly, the treatment benefits for ICS-requiring patients were similar to or better than those for ICS-naïve patients on all three co-primary endpoints (versus the relevant comparator). These data may reflect the clinical benefit that patients could receive when stepping-up treatment to combination therapy.

### As-needed budesonide-formoterol versus maintenance budesonide in mild asthma [^b550ba8d]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

The study SYGMA 2 was published by Bateman ED and colleagues in 2018 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Asthma. In the SYGMA 2 study, the trial question was: is budesonide-formoterol noninferior to budesonide maintenance therapy in patients with mild asthma? In the SYGMA 2 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SYGMA 2 study, the population was: 4176 patients (2597 female, 1579 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with mild asthma and were eligible for treatment with regular ICSs. The key exclusion criteria were worsening asthma involving change in asthma treatment or the usee of systemic corticosteroids in the previous 30 days, current or former smoking with a history of ≥ 10 pack-years, and a history of life-threatening asthma. In the SYGMA 2 study, the interventions were: n = 2089 budesonide and formoterol (twice-daily placebo plus budesonide 200 mcg and formoterol 6 mcg used as needed) n = 2087 budesonide maintenance (twice-daily budesonide 200 mcg plus terbutaline 0.5 mg as needed). In the SYGMA 2 study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in the percentage of patients achieving an improvement in ACQ-5 score (40.3% vs. 44.3%; OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99). In the SYGMA 2 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the SYGMA 2 study, the conclusion was: in patients with mild asthma and were eligible for treatment with regular ICSs, budesonide and formoterol were noninferior to budesonide maintenance with respect to the percentage of patients achieving an improvement in ACQ-5 score.

### Long-acting beta2-agonists for chronic asthma in adults and children where background therapy contains varied or no inhaled corticosteroid [^6184d605]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common respiratory disease among both adults and children and short acting inhaled beta-2 agonists are used widely for 'reliever' bronchodilator therapy. Long acting beta-2 agonists (LABA) were introduced as prospective 'symptom controllers' in addition to inhaled corticosteroid 'preventer' therapy (ICS). In this updated review we have included studies in which patients were either not on ICS as a group, or in which some patients, but not all, were on ICS to complement previous systematic reviews of studies where LABA was given in patients uniformly receiving ICS. We have focussed particularly on serious adverse events, given previous concerns about potential risks, especially of death, from regular beta-2 agonist use.

Objectives

This review aimed to determine the benefit or detriment on the primary outcome of asthma control with the regular use of LABA compared with placebo, in mixed populations in which only some were taking ICS and in populations not using ICS therapy.

Search Strategy

We carried out searches using the Cochrane Airways Group trial register, most recently in October 2005. We searched bibliographies of identified RCTs for additional relevant RCTs and contacted authors of identified RCTs for other published and unpublished studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised studies of at least four weeks duration, comparing a LABA given twice daily with a placebo, in chronic asthma. Selection criteria to this updated review have been altered to accommodate recently published Cochrane reviews on combination and addition of LABA to ICS therapy. Studies in which all individuals were uniformly taking ICS were excluded from this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers performed data extraction and study quality assessment independently. We contacted authors of studies for missing data.

Main Results

Sixty-seven studies (representing 68 experimental comparisons) randomising 42,333 participants met the inclusion criteria. Salmeterol was used as long-acting agent in 50 studies and formoterol fumarate in 17. The treatment period was four to nine weeks in 29 studies, and 12 to 52 weeks in 38 studies. Twenty-four studies did not permit the use of ICS, and forty permitted either inhaled corticosteroid or cromones (in three studies this was unclear). In these studies between 22% and 92% were taking ICS, with a median of 62%. There were significant advantages to LABA treatment compared to placebo for a variety of measurements of airway calibre including morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), evening PEF and FEV1. They were associated with significantly fewer symptoms, less use of rescue medication and higher quality of life scores. This was true whether patients were taking LABA in combination with ICS or not. Findings from SMART (a recently published surveillance study) indicated significant increases in asthma related deaths, respiratory related deaths and combined asthma related deaths and life threatening experiences. The absolute increase in asthma-related mortality was consistent with an increase of around one per 1250 patients treated with LABA for six months, but the confidence intervals are wide (from 700 to 10,000). Post-hoc exploratory subgroups suggested that African-Americans and those not on inhaled corticosteroids were at particular risk for the primary end-point of death or life-threatening asthma event. There was also a suggestion of an increase in exacerbation rate in children. Pharmacologically predicted side effects such as headache, throat irritation, tremor and nervousness were more frequent with LABA treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

LABA are effective in the control of chronic asthma in the "real-life" subject groups included. However there are potential safety issues which call into question the safety of LABA, particularly in those asthmatics who are not taking ICS, and it is not clear why African-Americans were found to have significant differences in comparison to Caucasians for combined respiratory-related death and life threatening experiences, but not for asthma-related death.
