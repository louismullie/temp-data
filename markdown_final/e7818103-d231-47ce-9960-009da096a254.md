## Question

why is it important to replace magnesium before potassim

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why magnesium should be replaced before potassium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic relationship between magnesium and potassium, especially the concept of refractory hypokalemia. Then, I should verify the mechanistic basis for magnesium-dependent potassium handling. Next, I will review clinical evidence and guideline recommendations that operationalize magnesium-first strategies. After that, I should consider special scenarios like torsades de pointes, refeeding syndrome, and diuretic-induced hypokalemia. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and double-check for any exceptions or caveats that might modify sequencing in real-world care.

> Let me first confirm the core clinical principle: hypokalemia is often refractory to potassium repletion if magnesium deficiency is not corrected, and this refractory phenomenon has been repeatedly described in classic and contemporary literature, with concomitant magnesium deficiency reported in roughly 38–42% of hypokalemic patients, which explains why potassium alone frequently fails to normalize intracellular potassium stores [^117Q9pYU] [^115zSPas].

> I need to check the mechanistic basis next. Magnesium is a required cofactor for Na+/K+-ATPase, the pump that maintains high intracellular potassium and low intracellular sodium; when magnesium is low, Na+/K+-ATPase activity is impaired, so potassium cannot be effectively pumped into cells despite extracellular repletion, leading to persistent intracellular potassium depletion and functional hypokalemia even as serum potassium transiently rises [^114tYe6C] [^1158nXBt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — I should verify the renal tubular mechanism as well. Low intracellular magnesium disinhibits ROMK channels in the distal nephron, increasing potassium secretion into the urine; thus, magnesium deficiency both reduces cellular potassium uptake and increases renal potassium wasting, a dual hit that perpetuates hypokalemia unless magnesium is restored [^116iX746] [^111GMS12].

> Next, I should review guideline-level direction. The AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmia guideline explicitly advises that when both potassium and magnesium are deficient, magnesium should be replaced first to facilitate successful potassium repletion, and it recommends maintaining potassium around 4.5–5.0 mmol/L in high-risk arrhythmia settings. ESC guidance similarly endorses IV magnesium with potassium supplementation in torsades, reinforcing magnesium-first practice in arrhythmia care [^112fF8mn] [^115qNq1M] [^114X6utR].

> Let me consider torsades de pointes specifically, because timing matters. Magnesium sulfate 2 g IV is first-line therapy for TdP irrespective of baseline serum magnesium, and potassium should be repleted to therapeutic levels after magnesium is on board. This sequencing reduces pause-dependent triggers and stabilizes repolarization before attempting full potassium correction, which aligns with both AHA/ACC and ESC statements [^115fGZM7] [^113m8FBf] [^114X6utR].

> I should confirm how this applies to refeeding syndrome. ASPEN guidance instructs checking and repleting potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before advancing nutrition, and to hold or reduce caloric advancement if these electrolytes are severely low; given insulin-driven intracellular shifts, correcting magnesium first helps ensure potassium repletion sticks as feeding proceeds, reducing rebound hypokalemia and arrhythmias [^112fayVP] [^116HRU8J] [^111Dqbv2] [^114tYe6C].

> Wait, let me verify the diuretic context, since thiazides and loops are common. Thiazides are magnesuric and frequently cause concomitant magnesium and potassium depletion; potassium alone often fails in this setting, and case-based and experimental observations support magnesium repletion to render potassium replacement effective, so magnesium-first is prudent in diuretic-induced hypokalemia [^1178PEza] [^115cM239].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence quantifying the effect. Observational ED data show that coadministering magnesium with potassium did not shorten time to potassium normalization, but it was associated with more hypermagnesemia, underscoring the need to individualize dosing rather than abandoning the principle; mechanistic and physiologic data remain compelling for magnesium's enabling role even when randomized data are limited [^115MQkB5] [^117Q9pYU].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach and double-check safety. First, assess for concurrent hypomagnesemia in any patient with hypokalemia, especially with arrhythmias, diuretic use, refeeding risk, or QT-prolonging drugs. Second, replete magnesium to at least 2.0 mEq/L, typically with 2–4 g IV magnesium sulfate in adults, while monitoring for hypermagnesemia. Third, replete potassium to the clinical target (often 4.0–5.0 mmol/L in high-risk settings) once magnesium is adequate. And fourth, monitor ECGs and electrolytes closely, as serum potassium does not reliably reflect tissue stores and arrhythmia risk persists until both cations are corrected [^115fGZM7] [^115bFNEa] [^114tYe6C].

> But wait, what if magnesium is normal — do I still prioritize magnesium? The physiologic rationale and guidelines still support ensuring magnesium sufficiency before or alongside potassium in high-risk arrhythmia or refractory cases, because serum magnesium can mislead and intracellular deficits may persist; however, in stable, low-risk patients with isolated mild hypokalemia and confirmed normal magnesium, potassium-only repletion may suffice, with reassessment if hypokalemia recurs or proves refractory [^114tYe6C] [^111GMS12] [^115fGZM7] [^1172DfwK].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the message is precise: replace magnesium before or concurrently with potassium when hypokalemia is moderate to severe, refractory, or occurring in high-risk contexts because magnesium is required for Na+/K+-ATPase function and for suppressing renal potassium wasting. Correcting magnesium first restores the cellular machinery needed to retain potassium intracellularly and prevents the frustrating cycle of refractory hypokalemia, aligning with mechanistic data, clinical observations, and major society guidelines [^117Q9pYU] [^112fF8mn] [^114X6utR].

---

Replacing magnesium before potassium is essential because **magnesium deficiency causes refractory hypokalemia** by increasing renal potassium wasting and impairing Na+/K+-ATPase, so potassium repletion alone often fails until magnesium is corrected [^117Q9pYU] [^116iX746]. Magnesium replacement restores Na+/K+-ATPase function, stabilizes cardiac membranes, and reduces arrhythmia risk, especially in torsades de pointes and other QT-prolonging states [^112fF8mn] [^115fGZM7]. Clinical guidelines recommend correcting magnesium first or concurrently with potassium to ensure effective potassium repletion and prevent recurrent hypokalemia [^112fF8mn] [^114X6utR].

---

## Physiological mechanisms linking magnesium and potassium

Magnesium is a **critical cofactor** for Na+/K+-ATPase, which maintains intracellular potassium and extracellular sodium gradients; magnesium deficiency impairs this pump, causing potassium efflux and extracellular loss [^1158nXBt]. Magnesium also inhibits ROMK channels in the renal distal tubule; when magnesium is low, ROMK activity increases, **increasing urinary potassium loss** and worsening hypokalemia [^116iX746].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting magnesium replacement before potassium

Multiple clinical studies and reviews show that **uncorrected magnesium deficiency causes refractory hypokalemia**, in which potassium repletion alone fails until magnesium is corrected [^117Q9pYU] [^1178PEza]. Whang et al. (1992) reported that 38–42% of hypokalemic patients had concomitant magnesium deficiency, and potassium repletion was ineffective until magnesium was replaced [^117Q9pYU]. Similarly, thiazide-induced hypokalemia often reflects magnesium depletion, and potassium repletion fails without magnesium correction [^1178PEza].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize correcting magnesium before or alongside potassium:

- **AHA/ACC/HRS 2018**: In torsades de pointes or acquired QT prolongation, give IV magnesium first, then replete potassium to ≥ 4.0 mmol/L [^112fF8mn] [^112nxdEK].
- **ESC 2022**: For electrical storm with torsades, administer IV magnesium and supplement potassium [^114X6utR].
- **ASPEN 2020**: In refeeding syndrome, check and replete magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus before feeding; delay calories if these are severely low [^112fayVP] [^116HRU8J].

## Clinical scenarios requiring magnesium replacement before potassium

Several scenarios **require magnesium-first repletion**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale for magnesium-first repletion** |
|-|-|
| Torsades de pointes | Magnesium stabilizes cardiac membranes and suppresses arrhythmias; potassium repletion alone is insufficient [^112fF8mn] [^115fGZM7] |
| Refractory hypokalemia | Magnesium deficiency causes potassium wasting; potassium repletion fails without magnesium [^117Q9pYU] [^1178PEza] |
| Diuretic-induced hypokalemia | Thiazides cause magnesium and potassium loss; magnesium must be corrected first [^1178PEza] |
| Refeeding syndrome | Insulin-driven shifts lower magnesium and potassium; magnesium must be repleted before feeding [^111Fi758] [^111Dqbv2] |

---

## Risks of not replacing magnesium before potassium

Failing to correct magnesium can cause **persistent hypokalemia** due to ongoing renal potassium wasting and impaired cellular uptake, increasing the risk of recurrent arrhythmias, including torsades, even after potassium repletion [^117Q9pYU] [^115qNq1M]. It also worsens cardiac arrhythmias and QT prolongation, raising the risk of sudden cardiac death [^115YdEe1] [^115FUKx9].

---

## Clinical outcomes of magnesium replacement before potassium

Correcting magnesium before potassium improves potassium repletion success, reduces recurrent hypokalemia, and stabilizes cardiac rhythms. In torsades, **magnesium-first therapy** effectively suppresses arrhythmias and improves outcomes [^112fF8mn] [^115fGZM7].

---

## Practical clinical approach

A practical approach is to **check magnesium in all patients with hypokalemia**, especially if hypokalemia is refractory or there is arrhythmia risk. Replete magnesium first or alongside potassium, and monitor electrolytes and ECGs during repletion, particularly in high-risk patients [^114tYe6C] [^112fF8mn].

---

Replacing magnesium before potassium is essential to overcome refractory hypokalemia, restore cellular potassium homeostasis, and reduce arrhythmia risk; **magnesium-first strategies are supported by physiology, clinical evidence, and major guidelines**.

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: a review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^114tb8rT]. Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

POTASSIUM-ENRICHED, SODIUM-REDUCED SALT SUBSTITUTES

Potassium-enriched, sodium-reduced salt substitutes, or potassium-enriched salts, are products that can be used as a direct switch for regular salt (sodium chloride) for seasoning, preserving, and manufacturing foods. Potassium-enriched salts are made by replacing a proportion of the sodium chloride in regular salt with potassium chloride. Sometimes, other nonpotassium substitutes, such as magnesium sulfate, may also be added. The sodium content of potassium-enriched salts ranges from 0% to 100%. Other terms used to describe the products include low-sodium salt, potassium salt, mineral salt, and sodium-reduced salt. The first formal clinical identification of potassium-enriched salt as an option for BP control was included in the 1995 WHO and International Society of Hypertension guidelines, recommending that substitution of common salt by mineral salt low in sodium and rich in potassium and magnesium has been found to be effective in reducing BP in older hypertensives.

A strong body of evidence supports making a like-for-like switch from regular salt to potassium-enriched salt in patients with hypertension. A key benefit of switching from regular salt to potassium-enriched salt is that it lowers BP through the joint effects of reducing sodium intake and supplementing potassium intake. In addition, potassium-enriched salts seem to be a feasible way of achieving change in sodium and potassium intake in a way that other approaches to reducing sodium and increasing potassium do not. For example, in a recent large-scale and long-term trial that tested the effects of switching to potassium-enriched salt, there was 92% adherence to potassium-enriched salt 5 years after trial commencement with sustained effects objectively demonstrated by 5-year urinary sodium, urinary potassium, and BP levels. The main reasons why adherence was so high in this and other studies of potassium-enriched salt seem to be that the taste is similar to regular salt and the product can be used like regular salt with no requirement for behavior change in cooking or seasoning. –

### Additional evidence for the treatment of potassium disorders… [^114pPBqW]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

1 Deep tendon reflexes may be affected by extremes of potassium levels and are an important part of the physical examination. Calcium chloride must be administered through a central line, whereas 20 to 40 mEq per L of potassium per hour may be initially administered via two proximally placed, large-bore peripheral lines, if tolerated. However, the traditionally taught formula that 10 mEq per L of intravenous potassium replacement increases serum potassium by 0. 1 mEq per L is a great memory tool, it is not valid for extreme hypokalemia, as demonstrated by the Segal equation. Although not currently in the guidelines, more recent data support the following: All hospitalized patients should maintain a potassium level between 3. 5 and 5 mEq per L instead of 4 to 5 mEq per L based on large cohort studies showing no difference in all-cause in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit transfers, ventricular fibrillation, cardiovascular death, or cardiac arrest. 2–4 When hypokalemia is suspected, administer 1 to 2 g of magnesium sulfate in an intravenous bolus to decrease the risk of torsades de pointes because it is quicker than intravenous potassium and is analogous to administering calcium gluconate in the setting of hyperkalemia. For hyperkalemia, use 5 units of intravenous insulin because this is equally effective as 10 units, with a lower hypoglycemia risk. 5 For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and without metabolic acidosis, use lactated ringers instead of normal saline to avoid further transcellular shifts from hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. For hyperkalemia with hypovolemia and metabolic acidosis, consider the addition of isotonic bicarbonate solution.

○ As needed, acetazolamide, ○ As needed, fludrocortisone, particularly in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers.
6. 4 The current evidence does not definitively favor one resuscitative fluid for each clinical scenario. In the most critically ill adults, balanced crystalloids such as lactated ringers have favorable outcomes. 5 The recommendation for dosing of isotonic bicarbonate in patients who have hyperkalemia with metabolic acidosis and other important considerations are provided in Table 6.

### Electrolyte orders in the neuroscience intensive care unit: worth the value or waste? [^115qmsXz]. Neurocritical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Background

To assess the value of the practice of obtaining frequent electrolyte measurements in patients with extended stay in a neuroscience intensive care unit (NICU).

Methods

We identified consecutive patients 18 years or older, admitted to the NICU between January 1 and July 31, 2009 with length of stay ≥ 5 days. We collected potassium, sodium, magnesium, ionized calcium, phosphorus laboratory measurements and hemoglobin levels, and recorded electrolyte replacement orders and red blood cell transfusions. Average laboratory costs were estimated.

Results

93 patients were included in the study (54 men, mean age 54 years, range 18–85 years). Mean length of stay was 10.4 days (range 5–36 days). Sodium and potassium were the electrolytes most frequently measured (averages of 14.1 and 13.1 per patient, respectively). More than 75% of the results were within normal range for all electrolytes measured and critical values were extremely uncommon. The number of phlebotomies for electrolyte measurements was strongly associated with the degree of hemoglobin drop (P < 0.0001). Electrolyte panels were ordered much more often than individual electrolytes with average cost exceeding $2200 per patient. Replacing half of these electrolyte panels with single sodium or potassium orders would have resulted in savings greater than $100,000 in our population.

Conclusions

Electrolytes measurements are very frequent in the NICU, but results are most often normal and only exceptionally critical. The phlebotomies required for these tests significantly worsen hemoglobin levels. A more conservative use of electrolyte measurements can result in reduction of blood loss and substantial cost savings.

### Sodium chloride, sodium acetate anhydrous, sodium gluconate, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride (normosol-R) [^116YQxQu]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

When administered intravenously, Normosol-R pH 7.4 provides water and electrolytes for replacement of acute extracellular fluid losses without disturbing normal electrolyte relationships. The electrolyte composition approaches that of the principal ions of normal plasma (extracellular fluid). The electrolyte concentration is approximately isotonic in relation to the extracellular fluid (approx. 280 mOsmol/liter) and provides a physiologic sodium to chloride ratio, normal plasma concentrations of potassium and magnesium and two bicarbonate alternates, acetate and gluconate.

Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl−) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.

Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy adult and child over 10 days old; 3.5 to 6.0 mEq/liter in a child less than 10 days old). Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance.

### Potassium chloride and dextrose monohydrate (potassium chloride in dextrose) [^1165dbzH]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

5.6 Fluid Overload

Depending on the volume and rate of infusion, the patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize dextrose, intravenous administration of Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema.

Avoid Potassium Chloride in Dextrose Injection in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading. If use cannot be avoided, monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance as needed and especially during prolonged use.

5.7 Refeeding Syndrome

Refeeding severely undernourished patients may result in the refeeding syndrome that is characterized by the shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium intracellularly as the patient becomes anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increasing nutrient intake.

Magnesium in human biology

'Magnesium is the seventh most abundant element in the Earth's crust by mass or molarity… In vertebrates, magnesium is extremely abundant and it is the second most common intracellular cation (potassium being the first). Extracellular magnesium accounts for only ∼1% of total body magnesium, which is found primarily in serum and red blood cells'.

Magnesium is the fourth most common cation in our body, the second most common intracellular cation and the most common intracellular divalent cation. The human body contains around 25 g of magnesium. Magnesium is necessary for the functioning of over 300 enzymes in human, with 90% of total body magnesium being contained in the muscles and bones (~27% and ~63%, respectively), 90% of which is bound and with only 10% being free. In the serum, 32% of magnesium is bound to albumin, whereas 55% is free.

Some of the main functions of magnesium in human biology include the maintenance of ionic gradients (keeping intracellular sodium and calcium low and potassium high), cellular and tissue integrity, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (ATP production and activation), and DNA, RNA and protein synthesis and integrity.

The elimination of magnesium is mainly controlled by the kidneys, increasing in the urine when there is magnesium surplus and falling to just 1 mEq of magnesium (~12 mg) during deficits. However, despite renal conservation, magnesium can be pulled from the bone (as well as muscles and internal organs) in order to maintain normal serum magnesium levels when intakes are low. Thus, a normal serum magnesium level does not rule out magnesium deficiency, which predisposes to osteopaenia, osteoporosis and fractures.

An excess of heavy metals due to soil contamination and a lack of minerals due to soil erosion also may predispose to micronutrient deficits. The importance of the mineral content of soil and water, once greatly appreciated, think low iodine levels in soil and the increased prevalence of goitre, has all but been forgotten. Furthermore, refined foods are depleted of magnesium during their processing. In order to prevent chronic diseases, we need to change our mindset away from exclusively treating acute illness and instead focus more on treating the underlying causes of chronic diseases, such as magnesium deficiency.

### Rethinking hypomagnesemia: diagnostic thresholds and metabolic implications in critical illness [^111qkvnm]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Taken together, these observations suggest that magnesium deficiency may not simply accompany metabolic failure but may actively contribute to it. Recognizing magnesium repletion as a fundamental element of metabolic support could help bridge the gap between biochemical correction and physiological recovery. A broader understanding of magnesium physiology, encompassing redistribution, diagnostic thresholds, and metabolic function, may facilitate earlier recognition and guide more context-sensitive supplementation. Timely magnesium replacement, even in patients with low-normal concentrations, could help restore mitochondrial efficiency, stabilize lactate dynamics, and support recovery from critical illness. A renewed focus on magnesium may therefore offer a simple and physiologically grounded opportunity worthy of further investigation to improve outcomes in the critically ill.

### Sodium chloride, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride (isolyte S) [^115bFNEa]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

General

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern, in this or an alternative solution.

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Solutions containing potassium or magnesium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease.

Parenteral magnesium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

Administration of barbiturates, narcotics, hypnotics or systemic anesthetics should be adjusted with caution in patients also receiving magnesium-containing solutions because of an additive central depressive effect.

Solutions containing gluconate or acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

### Cellular conditions of weakly chelated magnesium ions strongly promote RNA stability and catalysis [^116HNh8y]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

RNA molecules fold into unique three dimensional structures, which allow them to function as catalysts that perform biochemical reactions and regulators that control protein expression. Folding mechanisms, therefore, play significant roles in RNA function and related biological phenomena. In addition to primarily "classical standard in vitro conditions", which are high monovalent and divalent ion concentrations (e.g. ~1 M Na + and ~10 mM Mg 2+), the folding mechanisms of various RNA species have been studied in cellular mimicked conditions induced by cosolutes, and it is widely accepted that such crowding conditions increase ribozyme folding and activity –.

In a recent metalome studies in Escherichia coli, total concentrations of potassium and magnesium ions were found to be relatively high, at 140–160 mM and 54 mM, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1) –. However, free concentrations of magnesium, meaning fully hydrated by water at the inner-coordination sites on Mg 2+, are only ~0.5–1 mM in eukaryotic cells and ~1.5–3 mM in bacterial cells since most magnesium in the cytoplasm interacts with metabolites, proteins, and nucleic acids. Recent metabolome analyses report greater than one hundred millimolar of amino acids, which account for ~50% of all metabolites in E. coli (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 1). Thus, RNA is exposed to large amounts of amino acid-chelated magnesium in cells.

It also serves as a vehicle for drugs used for irrigation or other pharmaceutical preparations.

PhysioSol™ provides an isotonic calcium-free balanced electrolyte irrigation with the same ionic composition as Normosol™-R, a multiple electrolyte solution for I.V. replacement of acute extracellular fluid losses.

PhysioSol™ Irrigation is considered generally compatible with living tissues and organs.

Magnesium chloride in water dissociates to provide magnesium (Mg++) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0 mEq/liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.

Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy adult). Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance.

### Potassium phosphates [^114xZWQf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2	Important Administration Instructions

Check serum potassium and calcium concentrations prior to administration. Normalize the calcium before administering Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].
Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is only for administration to a patient with a serum potassium concentration less than 4 mEq/dL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, use an alternative source of phosphorus.
Do not infuse with calcium-containing intravenous fluids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
The 100 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol (phosphorus 0.15 mmol/mL) and potassium 22 mEq (potassium 0.22 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central vein.
The 250 mL ready-to-use container of this Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection product contains phosphorus 15 mmol and potassium 22 mEq (phosphorus 0.06 mmol/mL and potassium 0.088 mEq/mL) and is for intravenous infusion into a central OR peripheral vein.

2.3 Recommended Dosage

The phosphorus doses in Table 1 are general recommendations for an initial or single dose of potassium phosphates and are intended for most patients who weigh 40 kg or greater. Based upon clinical requirements, some patients may require a lower or higher dose.
The maximum initial or single dose of phosphorus is 45 mmol (potassium 66 mEq) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Consider overall volume status of the patient when determining whether Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection is an appropriate product for phosphorus replacement.
Monitor serum phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium concentrations.

Concentration and Intravenous Infusion Rate

Selection of the ready-to-use container solution concentration and the infusion rate is dependent upon whether administration will be through a peripheral or central venous catheter. The infusion rate may also be adjusted based on patient characteristics and the specific institution policy.

The maximum recommended concentration and infusion rates for Potassium Phosphates in Sodium Chloride Injection are shown in Table 2 for adults and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg or greater.

Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and infusion through a central venous catheter is recommended for infusion rates higher than potassium 10 mEq/hour.

Repeated Dosing

Additional dose(s) following the initial dose may be needed in some patients. Prior to administration of additional doses, assess the patient clinically, obtain serum phosphorus, calcium, and potassium concentrations and adjust the dose accordingly.

### Severe intracellular magnesium and potassium depletion in patients after treatment with cisplatin [^112WKgMF]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

Treatment of hypomagnesaemia related to treatment with cisplatin has been directed towards normalisation of P-Mg with the secondary intention to restore total body Mg. However, P-Mg is evidently not a reliable indicator of Mg depletion during cisplatin chemotherapy, and neither can Mg substitution be guided by this parameter alone. These arguments relate also to K. The approach towards substitution of the observed losses is therefore complicated, and it is not possible to develop simple guidelines for Mg or K substitution during treatment with cisplatin. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether Mg and K substitution is effective in increasing body Mg and K stores during cisplatin treatment, especially in the presence of a cisplatin-induced renal reabsorption defect.

In conclusion, cisplatin treatment caused significant Mg and K depletion in the majority of patients and, in most patients, this depletion was observed despite normal corresponding P values. Therefore, due to our inability to monitor these electrolytes during treatment, it should be considered whether routine Mg and K supplementation should be implemented in these patients from the start of treatment.

### Clinical consequences and management of hypomagnesemia [^111DRbce]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Magnesium deficiency and hypomagnesemia remain quite prevalent, particularly in patients in intensive care units, and may have important clinical consequences. Magnesium should be measured directly in clinical circumstances in which a risk for magnesium deficiency exists and appropriately corrected when found.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

End-stage renal failure — management of ventricular arrhythmias and epidemiology are specified as follows: The acute management of ventricular arrhythmias in end-stage renal failure should immediately address hemodynamic status and electrolyte (potassium, magnesium, and calcium) imbalance (Level of Evidence: C). Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, especially in patients awaiting renal transplantation, should be treated conventionally, including the use of ICD and pacemaker as required, in patients who are receiving chronic optimal medical therapy and who have reasonable expectation of survival with a good functional status for more than 1 y (Level of Evidence: C). Cardiovascular causes account for at least 40% of deaths in patients with end-stage renal failure and 20% of these are sudden; arrhythmias often occur during hemodialysis sessions and for at least 4 to 5 h afterward, and during this period hemodynamic status and fluctuations in electrolytes, especially potassium, magnesium, and calcium, are likely to play a crucial role and should be monitored carefully; risk factors predisposing to ventricular arrhythmias include LVH, hypertension, anemia, cardiac dysfunction, and underlying CHD.

Electrolyte disturbances — potassium and magnesium management in ventricular arrhythmias: Potassium (and magnesium) salts are useful in treating ventricular arrhythmias secondary to hypokalemia (or hypomagnesemia) resulting from diuretic use in patients with structurally normal hearts (Level of Evidence: B). Class IIa guidance states it is reasonable to maintain serum potassium levels above 4.0 mM/L in any patient with documented life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and a structurally normal heart (Level of Evidence: C) and to maintain serum potassium levels above 4.0 mM/L in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) (Level of Evidence: B). Magnesium salts can be beneficial in the management of ventricular tachycardia (VT) secondary to digoxin toxicity in patients with structurally normal hearts (Level of Evidence: B). Supporting context notes that hypokalemia (less than 3.5 mM) and hypomagnesemia are associated with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD), hypomagnesemia is classically associated with polymorphic VT or torsades de pointes and may respond to intravenous magnesium, and significant hypokalemia can prolong the QT interval.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^1177NjFD]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus definitions — refeeding syndrome (RS) is described "as a measurable reduction in levels of 1 or any combination of phosphorus, potassium, and/or magnesium, or the manifestation of thiamin deficiency, developing shortly (hours to days) after initiation of calorie provision to an individual who has been exposed to a substantial period of undernourishment". RS "may manifest in a wide variety of severities, from slight, clinically insignificant decrements in electrolyte levels to severe and sudden decreases, which lead to, or risk development of, end organ failure if not prevented or corrected".

### Structural basis for ion selectivity revealed by high-resolution crystal structure of Mg2 + channel mgtE [^114kThzt]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The magnesium ion, Mg 2+, is involved in many cellular functions, such as the formation of RNA and protein structures, genome stability and enzymatic catalysis, and thus is an essential cation for life. The intracellular homeostasis of the Mg 2+ concentration is important for these functions, and thus is maintained by Mg 2+ transporters and channels that translocate Mg 2+ across biological membranes. The cellular concentrations of other biological cations (that is, Na +, K + and Ca 2+) are strictly controlled, and thus the selective transport of Mg 2+ by these transporters and channels is of particular importance. The selective transport mechanism of monovalent cations has been well investigated, based on the crystal structures of Na + and K + channels. The atomic resolution crystal structures of KcsAand MthKrevealed that K + is dehydrated and directly recognized by the protein atoms in the selectivity filter. In contrast, the selective transport mechanism for divalent cations, such as Ca 2+ and Mg 2+, has remained elusive. The dehydration energies of divalent cations are much higher than those of monovalent cations, and thus their recognition mechanisms are attracting significant interest. The crystal structures of divalent cation channels, including CorA, Oraiand Ca 2+ conductive Na + channel, suggested that their selectivity filters consist of multiple acidic residues, with carboxylate groups that recognize the divalent cation. However, the medium-resolution structures of these channels limited the clear understanding of the ion recognition mechanism by the selective filters for divalent cations.

### Magnesium for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^1166Z4F5]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Hypertension

Hypertension is a complex, multifactorial, heterogeneous disorder for which the exact aetiology has yet to be elucidated. Clinical and experimental trials have suggested that magnesium may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension by affecting arterial smooth muscle contraction. Magnesium is found mainly at the inner surface of cell membranes. Therefore, it plays a role in cell membrane permeability for sodium and calcium. Magnesium activates the Na+–K+–ATPase pump, which plays a major role in regulating sodium and potassium transport by moving potassium into the cells and sodium out of the cells. Alterations in vascular membrane magnesium can also result in leaky arterial and arteriolar membranes, thus contributing to the intracellular reduction of potassium and the gain of calcium and sodium. Increased intracellular calcium can then lead to hypertension, vasospasm, as well as potentiation of vasoconstrictor agents.

### Dextrose monohydrate, sodium lactate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, potassium phosphate, monobasic, and sodium phosphate, monobasic, monohydrate (ionosol MB and dextrose) [^113tDHBr]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Magnesium chloride in water dissociates to provide magnesium (Mg++) and chloride (Cl‾) ions. Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0 mEq/liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.

Phosphate is one of the three major intracellular electrolytes (along with potassium and magnesium) and the largest anion component found within the cells. Its concentration and excretion are largely dependent on intake, acid-base balance and endocrine function. Its metabolism follows that of calcium in many respects. Phosphate anion in electrolyte solutions may help to repair phosphate deficiency.

Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl‾) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy adult and child over 10 days old; 3.5 to 6.0 mEq/liter in a child less than 10 days old). Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance. Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.

Management of torsades de pointes with QT-prolonging antiarrhythmics — monitoring high-risk patients during initiation and recognizing the syndrome early are emphasized; maintaining serum potassium between 4.5 and 5 mEq/L shortens QT, although no specific data are available on the efficacy of potassium repletion to prevent torsades de pointes; intravenous magnesium can suppress episodes even when serum magnesium is normal; magnesium toxicity can occur when concentrations reach 6 to 8 mEq/L but is a very small risk with doses usually used, 1 to 2 g intravenously; temporary pacing is highly effective for recurrent torsades after potassium repletion and magnesium supplementation, and isoproterenol can also be used to increase heart rate and abolish postectopic pauses; anecdotes have reported that lidocaine, verapamil, and even occasionally amiodarone have been effective, although amiodarone may itself cause torsades de pointes, albeit much less commonly than with other QT‑prolonging antiarrhythmics.

Hospital treatment of sustained torsade de pointes (TdP) — acute interventions and dosing: "For patients with TdP that does not terminate spontaneously or that degenerates into ventricular fibrillation, immediate direct-current cardioversion should be performed". For episodes in patients on QT‑prolonging drugs with prolonged QT, "intravenous magnesium sulfate is reasonable… (Class IIa, Level of Evidence: B)", with dosing that "Magnesium sulfate 2 g can be infused intravenously as a first-line agent… irrespective of the serum magnesium level", and "repeat infusions of magnesium sulfate 2 g" if needed. To prevent pause‑dependent triggers, temporary transvenous pacing may be used "at rates > 70 beats per minute". "Replacement of potassium to supratherapeutic levels of 4.5 to 5.0 mmol/L may also be considered", though evidence is limited "(Class IIb, Level of Evidence: C)".

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

This solution is for intravenous use only.

Dosage is to be directed by a physician and is dependent upon age, weight, clinical condition of the patient and laboratory determinations. Frequent laboratory determinations and clinical evaluation are essential to monitor changes in blood glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and fluid and electrolyte balance during prolonged parenteral therapy.

Fluid administration should be based on calculated maintenance or replacement fluid requirements for each patient.

Isolyte®S (Multi-Electrolyte Injection) contains no phosphate. It may be admixed with solutions which contain phosphate or which have been supplemented with phosphate. The presence of calcium and magnesium ions should be considered when phosphate is present in the additive solution, in order to avoid precipitation.

Some additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist. When introducing additives, use aseptic techniques. Mix thoroughly. Do not store.

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

### Importance of potassium ions for ribosome structure and function revealed by long-wavelength X-ray diffraction [^115ay13J]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Metal ions like Mg 2+ and K + are mostly known to interact with RNA components of the ribosome. However, we identified several K + ions associated with the following ribosomal proteins: bS6, bS20, uL2, uL3, uL4, uL5 and uL16 (Fig. 6). Most of these ions were found in local turning loops where the carbonyl oxygen atoms of the polypeptide backbone form a negatively charged pocket favorable for K + ions. Potassium ions that interact with proteins bS20 and uL2 are newly identified ions, and are not replacing previously assigned magnesium.

Fig. 6
Interaction of K + ions with the ribosomal proteins from 30S subunit and from 50S subunit. K + ions are shown as magenta spheres, 30S proteins in orange, 50S proteins in blue

Additionally, we have localized 12 K + ions that stabilize the binding of proteins to rRNAs. Of those, 5 K + atoms coordinate to the 16S rRNA and proteins uS11, uS13, uS14, bS20, and 7 K + atoms coordinate to the 23S rRNA and proteins uL2, uL4, uL15, bL28 (Supplementary Fig. 5).

### The effects of magnesium coadminstration during treatment of hypokalemia in the emergency department [^115MQkB5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypokalemia is a common disorder that can negatively affect organ function. Magnesium supplementation is frequently recommended despite limited evidence to support its use.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical effects of magnesium coadministration in patients treated for hypokalemia in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center study evaluated adults treated with intravenous (i.v.) potassium for hypokalemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mMol/L) in the ED between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2020. Patients given magnesium supplementation within 4 h of potassium administration (MG+) were compared with those not given concurrent magnesium (MG-). The primary outcome was time to potassium normalization (≥ 3.5 mMol/L). Secondary outcomes included clinical effects, adverse effects, and dosing of magnesium and potassium.

Results

Two hundred patients were included (MG+ = 100; MG- = 100). Patients in the MG- group more frequently had history of myocardial infarction (16% vs. 6%; p = 0.02) and alcoholism (16% vs. 6%; p = 0.02). Patients in the MG+ group had higher incidence of symptomatic hypokalemia (34% vs. 19%; p = 0.02) and severe hypokalemia (serum potassium < 2.5 mMol/L) (15% vs. 8%; p = 0.03). There were no differences in time to serum potassium normalization, change in serum potassium after treatment, or incidence of potassium normalization within 24 h of treatment. MG+ patients required more potassium within 24 h of treatment and more frequently developed hypermagnesemia (serum magnesium > 1.1 mMol/L).

Conclusions

Magnesium coadministration during hypokalemia treatment did not affect time to serum potassium normalization but was associated with more hypermagnesemia.

### Assessing the metabolic and clinical consequences of early enteral feeding in the malnourished patient [^112cX3em]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

It is often thought that enteral feeding should be initiated slowly in those who are severely malnourished. This descriptive study examined the effect of an enteral feeding protocol on the typical metabolic consequences seen in refeeding syndrome.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was conducted on 51 patients who had been placed on hospital-wide enteral feeding and electrolyte replacement protocols over a 9-month period to determine whether there were any negative clinical consequences to early feeding.

Results

Goal feeding rate was achieved within 17.6 ± 8.7 hours. Forty patients (80%) developed depletions in phosphate, magnesium, or potassium after initiation of enteral feeding, including 93% of those deemed "at risk" and 74% of those "not at risk". All patients received electrolyte replacement according to protocols, and no patients showed any negative clinical effect.

Conclusions

This study showed that malnourished patients at risk for refeeding syndrome can be fed early without observed negative clinical consequences. An electrolyte replacement protocol may be an effective means of minimizing the electrolyte imbalances associated with early feeding. It also demonstrated the significance of applying such protocols to all patients requiring enteral support, as current methods of assessing "risk"for refeeding syndrome may be inadequate.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^115qNq1M]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrolytes — potassium and magnesium management in ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) prevention: Hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia have been associated with VA during an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and can increase the risk of torsades de pointes in patients on QT‑prolonging regimens; in torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium is first‑line therapy, and when both deficiencies are present, magnesium should be replaced to facilitate replacement of potassium. For prevention, some recommend keeping the potassium level between 4.5 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L to prevent VA and SCD; in acute MI, the lowest rates of death were seen with potassium between 3.5 mmol/L and < 4.5 mmol/L, and VA rates did not rise unless potassium was < 3.5 mmol/L or ≥ 5 mmol/L. A double‑blind trial of intravenous magnesium in the post‑MI period demonstrated no benefit in 30‑day mortality, and it remains quite reasonable to monitor potassium and magnesium during aggressive diuresis and in the post‑MI period.

### Magnesium deficiency: does it have a role to play in cataractogenesis? [^117MqDTc]. Experimental Eye Research (2012). Low credibility.

Magnesium is one of the most important regulatory cation involved in several biological processes. It is important for maintaining the structural and functional integrity of vital ocular tissues such as lens. Presence of high magnesium content especially in the peripheral part of lens as compared to aqueous and vitreous humor has been observed. Magnesium plays significant role as a cofactor for more than 350 enzymes in the body especially those utilizing ATP. Membrane associated ATPase functions that are crucial in regulating the intracellular ionic environment, are magnesium-dependent. Moreover, the enzymes involved in ATP production and hydrolysis are also magnesium-dependent. Magnesium deficiency by interfering with ATPase functions causes increased intracellular calcium and sodium and decreases intracellular potassium concentration. Furthermore, magnesium deficiency is associated with increased oxidative stress secondary to increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and increased production of nitric oxide. Thus the alterations in lenticular redox status and ionic imbalances form the basis of the association of magnesium deficiency with cataract. In this paper we review the mechanisms involved in magnesium homeostasis and the role of magnesium deficiency in the pathogenesis of cataract.

### Adenosine, lidocaine, and Mg2 + (ALM): from cardiac surgery to combat casualty care – teaching old drugs new tricks [^115xzQxC]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

New frontline drugs and therapies are urgently required to protect the body from primary and secondary injuries. We review more than 10 years of work on adenosine, lidocaine, and magnesium (ALM) and its possible significance to civilian and military medicine. Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside involved in nucleotide production, adenosine triphosphate turnover, and restoration of supply and demand imbalances. Lidocaine is a local anesthetic and Class 1B antiarrhythmic, and magnesium is essential for ionic regulation and cellular bioenergetics. Individually, each plays important roles in metabolism, immunomodulation, inflammation, and coagulation. The original idea to combine all three was as a "polarizing" cardioplegia, an idea borrowed from natural hibernators. Two recent prospective, randomized human trials have demonstrated its safety and superiority in myocardial protection over high-potassium "depolarizing" solutions. The next idea came from witnessing how the human heart spontaneously reanimated after complex operations with little inotropic support. At high doses, ALM arrests the heart, and at lower doses, it resuscitates the heart. In rat and pig models, we have shown that ALM intravenous bolus and infusion "drip" protects against acute regional myocardial ischemia, lethal arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, compressible and noncompressible blood loss and shock, endotoxemia, and sepsis. Individually, adenosine, lidocaine, or magnesium fails to protect. Protection is afforded in part by reducing inflammation, correcting coagulopathy, and lowering energy demand. We propose a unifying hypothesis involving improved central, cardiovascular and endothelium coupling to maintain sufficient tissue oxygenation and reduce primary and secondary "hit" complications. As with any new drug innovation, translation into humans is challenging.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^111Dqbv2]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

Pathophysiology of refeeding syndrome outlines starvation‑related depletion and insulin‑mediated electrolyte shifts with critical consequences. As starvation becomes more profound, energy stores, vitamins, and intracellular electrolytes are depleted; when glucose appears in the bloodstream, insulin secretion rises, and in the presence of total‑body deficits of potassium, phosphorus, or magnesium, serum concentrations may drop as these minerals are drawn from serum into cells. These decreases may occur even if serum levels are initially normal, may be sudden and severe, and can be deadly in a starved or catabolic state. Phosphorus is the principal ion implicated in reports of RS, although potassium and magnesium may be equally important. Phosphate depletion can cause respiratory muscle dysfunction with progression to acute respiratory failure, decreased cardiac contractility, cardiac arrhythmias, and tissue hypoxia due to decreased 2,3‑diphosphoglycerate with increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity.

### Electrolyte disorders related emergencies in children [^111y82gd]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

A recent study indicates that infusing 1 mmol/kg of potassium chloride over 1–2 h is likely safe for young children in intensive care units with mild to moderate hypokalemia, however, those with severe hypokalemia may require additional supplementation. When administering potassium via peripheral veins, the concentration should not exceed 40 mmol/L to prevent phlebitis and pain. For higher concentrations, central venous lines are recommended, however, this does not apply to life-threatening conditions. Importantly, potassium dextrose-containing solutions must be avoided, as dextrose stimulates insulin secretion and can potentially worsen hypokalemia. Additionally, it is important when removing dextrose from intravenous fluids in ill children not eating as this can also increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels is necessary to manage potential hypoglycemia in these patients. Potassium replacement should be scaled back when the serum potassium concentration exceeds 3.5 mmol/L. During this replacement approach, serum potassium checks are recommended every 1–2 h. Continuous ECG monitoring is essential, along with regular monitoring of blood gases and potassium levels. Additionally, concurrent hypomagnesemia in children with hypokalemia requires attention as it contributes to potassium wasting and lowers tubular potassium reabsorption. Management should focus on correcting low magnesium levels since hypokalemia is refractory until magnesium levels are within the range of 0.7–1 mmol/L. In specific conditions such as correcting electrolyte imbalances or acid–base disorders, alternative forms of potassium supplementation may be considered. These scenarios include potassium phosphate in diabetic ketoacidosis or potassium citrate in renal tubular acidosis.

### Dust outpaces bedrock in nutrient supply to montane forest ecosystems [^116aFsNF]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Nutrients regulate the distribution of life across Earth's surface. Understanding the relative importance of different sources of nutrients, including underlying bedrockand aeolian dust, is therefore a fundamental problem in ecology, biogeochemistry and geobiology. Directly quantifying the importance of dust, which is sensitive to changes in climate and land use, is particularly crucial for predicting how ecosystems will respond to global warming and land-use intensification.

Although the mass flux of dust to soils is generally thought to be dwarfed by other fluxes, such as the conversion of bedrock to soil, dust can be the dominant source of nutrients to ecosystems where intensive chemical weathering and leaching have depleted underlying bedrock of life-sustaining elements, including phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). Little is known, however, about the role of dust in montane forest ecosystems, where weathered soil is removed from the surface by physical erosion and replaced with fresh minerals from below by the conversion of bedrock to soil. Modelling suggests that the role of dust is minimal at sites with substantial erosion rates, but this has not been demonstrated empirically because the relative flux of nutrients from dust and bedrock has never been directly quantified in montane ecosystems. To overcome this limitation, we quantified the relative importance of dust and bedrock in ecosystem nutrient supply across a suite of mountain sites by combining a new seasonal record of dust inputs with existing bulk geochemical and erosion rate data at the same location.

### Sodium chloride, sodium citrate (Regiocit) [^113fhywy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

2.1 Hypocalcemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no calcium, and may lead to systemic ionized hypocalcemia due to loss of calcium bound to citrate in the effluent and/or in the case of systemic citrate accumulation. Calcium

reinfusion is required during use of REGIOCIT and blood calcium concentrations (ionized and total) must be monitored.

2.3 Hypomagnesemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no magnesium. Use of the REGIOCIT solution may result in hypomagnesemia due to CRRT effluent losses. Magnesium levels must be monitored as infusion of magnesium may be necessary.

2.4 Hypoglycemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no dextrose. Administration of REGIOCIT solution may lead to hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels must be monitored regularly.

2.5 Hypokalemia

REGIOCIT solution contains no potassium. The serum potassium concentration must be monitored before and during CRRT.

2.6 Metabolic Alkalosis

REGIOCIT solution contains citrate, which contributes to the overall buffer load. Metabolization of 1 mol of citrate generates 3 mol of bicarbonate. Additional sodium bicarbonate (or buffer source) contained in the CRRT fluids or in other fluids administered during therapy may increase the risk of metabolic alkalosis. Metabolic alkalosis may occur if the net citrate administration rate exceeds that which is necessary to maintain acid–base balance. If metabolic alkalosis occurs, decrease the citrate dose, and/or increase the dialysate/replacement flow rate (when applicable) or change the composition of the CRRT solution.

2.7 Metabolic Acidosis

Metabolic acidosis may occur if metabolic clearance of citrate by the liver or skeletal muscle is impaired. If citrate accumulation develops and/or metabolic acidosis develops or worsens during therapy with REGIOCIT solution, the infusion rate may need to be decreased or its administration stopped.

2.8 Use in Patients with Mild to Moderate Hepatic Impairment

Metabolism of citrate (to bicarbonate) may be impaired in patients with hepatic impairment, resulting in accumulation of citrate. If REGIOCIT solution is administered to patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment, frequent monitoring of pH, electrolytes, total-to-ionized calcium ratio, and systemic ionized calcium is important to avoid electrolyte and/or acid–base imbalance.

2.9 Hypoosmolarity/Hypotonicity

REGIOCIT solution is hypoosmolar/hypotonic relative to standard CRRT replacement fluids and should be used with caution in patients with traumatic brain injury, cerebral edema, or increased intracranial pressure.

### Sodium chloride, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium phosphate, dibasic, and potassium phosphate (isolyte S pH 7.4) [^115rzb5H]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

General

This solution should be used with care in patients with hypervolemia, renal insufficiency, urinary tract obstruction, or impending or frank cardiac decompensation.

Extraordinary electrolyte losses such as may occur during protracted nasogastric suction, vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal fistula drainage may necessitate additional electrolyte supplementation.

Additional essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins should be supplied as needed.

Care should be exercised in administering solutions containing sodium or potassium to patients with renal or cardiovascular insufficiency, with or without congestive heart failure, particularly if they are postoperative or elderly.

Potassium therapy should be guided primarily by serial electrocardiograms, especially in patients receiving digitalis. Serum potassium levels are not necessarily indicative of tissue potassium levels.

Solutions containing potassium or magnesium should be used with caution in the presence of cardiac disease, particularly when accompanied by renal disease.

Solutions containing gluconate or acetate should be used with caution. Excess administration may result in metabolic alkalosis.

To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing this solution with other additives that may be prescribed, the final infusate should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration, and periodically during administration.

Do not use plastic containers in series connection.

If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. If administration is not controlled by a pumping device, refrain from applying excessive pressure (> 300mmHg) causing distortion to the container such as wringing or twisting. Such handling could result in breakage of the container.

This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.

Laboratory Tests

Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require tailoring of the electrolyte pattern, in this or an alternative solution.

Drug Interactions

Sodium-containing solutions should be administered with caution to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin, or to other salt-retaining patients.

Administration of barbiturates, narcotics, hypnotics or systemic anesthetics should be adjusted with caution in patients also receiving magnesium-containing solutions because of an additive central depressive effect.

Parenteral magnesium should be administered with extreme caution to patients receiving digitalis preparations.

### Combined calcium, magnesium and potassium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adults [^111FxDr4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research suggests that increasing dietary intakes of calcium, potassium or magnesium separately may reduce BP to a small degree over the short term. It is unclear whether increasing intakes of a combination of these minerals produces a larger reduction in BP.

Objectives

To evaluate the effects of combined mineral supplementation as a treatment for primary hypertension in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. The search was unrestricted by language or publication status.

Selection Criteria

Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral supplements comprising a combination of potassium, and/or calcium, and/or magnesium with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up ≥ 8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 85 mmHg with no known primary cause; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where participants were pregnant, or received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.

Main Results

We included three RCTs (n = 277) with between 24 and 28 weeks follow-up. Three combinations of minerals were investigated: potassium & magnesium, calcium & magnesium, and calcium & potassium. One trial investigated combinations of calcium & magnesium and of calcium & potassium, and for each found a statistically non-significant increase in both SBP and DBP. All three trials investigated the combination of potassium & magnesium. None of the trials provided data on mortality or morbidity. The combination of potassium & magnesium compared to control resulted in statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference = -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7) and DBP (mean difference = -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to 1.8), although the results were heterogeneous (I(2) = 68% and 85% for SBP and DBP respectively). A sensitivity analysis using alternative reported values which accounted for missing data had very little effect on DBP but resulted in a larger, statistically significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = -5.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.5 to -1.0). The quality of the trials was not well reported.

Authors' Conclusions

We found no robust evidence that supplements of any combination of potassium, magnesium or calcium reduce mortality, morbidity or BP in adults. More trials are needed to investigate whether the combination of potassium & magnesium is effective.

### Potassium bicarbonate (effer-K) [^113p34YW]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Precautions

The diagnosis of potassium depletion is ordinarily made by demonstrating hypokalemia in a patient with a clinical history suggesting some cause for potassium depletion. In interpreting the serum potassium level, the physician should bear in mind that acute alkalosis per se can produce hypokalemia in the absence of a deficit in total body potassium, while acute acidosis per se can increase the serum potassium concentration into the normal range even in the presence of a reduced total body potassium. The treatment of potassium depletion, particularly in the presence of cardiac disease, renal disease, or acidosis, requires careful attention to acid-base balance and appropriate monitoring of serum electrolytes, the electrocardiogram, and the clinical status of the patient.

Information for patients

To minimize the possibility of gastrointestinal irritation associated with the oral ingestion of concentrated potassium salt preparations, patients should be directed to dissolve each dose completely in the stated amount of water.

Each dose should be taken immediately after a meal or with food. Patients should avoid low-salt foods and salt substitutes, unless approved by physician. The patient should be cautioned to comply strictly with the regimen, particularly when taking diuretics or digitalis, to visit the physician regularly and to report at once any unusual symptoms (e.g. blackish stools, a sign of gastrointestinal bleeding). As with any other medicine, the patient should be counseled on this background information and advised to report to the physician any changes in routine (e.g. starting a fitness program). Proper storage and handling of the product is important. Tablets should not be removed from foil pouch until shortly before use.

Laboratory tests

Frequent clinical evaluation of the patient should include an ECG and a serum potassium level; also, as appropriate, renal function, serum magnesium and serum pH.

Drug Interactions

The simultaneous administration of potassium supplements and a potassium-sparing diuretic can produce severe hyperkalemia (see Contraindications). Potassium supplements should be used cautiously in patients who are using salt substitutes, because most of the latter contain substantial amounts of potassium. Such concomitant use could result in hyperkalemia.

Moreover, the following drugs may produce unfavorable interactions when used concomitantly with potassium supplements: angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, heparin, low-salt foods, other potassium containing medications, digitalis glycosides and others.

5.3 Hyperkalemia

POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION may increase the risk of hyperkalemia, including life-threatening cardiac events, especially when administered in excessive doses, undiluted or by rapid intravenous infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients with severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease are at increased risk of developing life-threatening hyperkalemia, when administered intravenous potassium [see Contraindications (4)]. Other patients at increased risk of hyperkalemia include those with severe adrenal insufficiency or treated concurrently with other drugs that cause or increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Patients with cardiac disease may be more susceptible to the effects of hyperkalemia.

Consider the amount of potassium from all sources when determining the dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION and do not exceed the maximum age-appropriate recommended daily amount of potassium. In patients with moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2), start at the low end of the dose range and monitor serum potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

When administering POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia, check the serum potassium concentration prior to administration. If the potassium concentration is 4 mEq/dL or more, do not administer POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION and use an alternative source of phosphate [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The maximum initial or single dose of POTASSIUM PHOSPHATES INJECTION in intravenous fluids to correct hypophosphatemia is phosphorus 45 mmol (potassium 71 mEq). The recommended infusion rate of potassium is 10 mEq/hour. Continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring is recommended for higher infusion rates of potassium [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

### Derangements of potassium [^115kCKyH]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Changes in potassium elimination, primarily due to the renal and GI systems, and shifting potassium between the intracellular and extracellular spaces cause potassium derangement. Symptoms are vague, but can be cardiac, musculoskeletal, or gastrointestinal. There are no absolute guidelines for when to treat, but it is generally recommended when the patient is symptomatic or has ECG changes. Treatment of hyperkalemia includes cardiac membrane stabilization with IV calcium, insulin and beta-antagonists to push potassium intracellularly, and dialysis. Neither sodium bicarbonate nor kayexelate are recommended. Treatment of symptomatic hypokalemia consists of PO or IV repletion with potassium chloride and magnesium sulfate.

### Association of intravenous potassium and magnesium administration with spontaneous conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in the emergency department [^1143ZTB9]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

The value of magnesium substitution for rhythm control in AF and AFL is likewise unclear. High-quality evidence from randomized clinical trials is lacking to support or oppose the administration of magnesium in nonpostoperative AF and AFL. Two previous meta-analyses yielded conflicting results. Whereas Onalan et alfound magnesium to be more effective than calcium channel blockers, Ho et alfound similar conversion rates between magnesium and placebo or antiarrhythmic drugs, including amiodarone or calcium channel blockers. The sample sizes and quality of the studies included in the 2 meta-analyses were limited.

In our study, we found a relatively constant association of potassium and magnesium administration with SCV across magnesium baseline levels. However, because hypomagnesemia may cause hypokalemia refractory to potassium substitution, coadministration of both electrolytes seems reasonable.

In patients with a known onset of AF, we observed that intravenous administration of potassium and magnesium was associated with SCV only in patients with symptom onset of less than 48 hours, suggesting a time-dependent outcome. However, because only a limited number of patients with SCV had symptom onset greater than or equal to 48 hours, this finding warrants further investigation. The odds for SCV after potassium and magnesium administration were similar for AF onset of less than 48 hours before the intervention and unknown onsets, suggesting that numerous patients with unknown symptom onset likely had AF onset of less than 48 hours.

In patients with AFL, potassium and magnesium were not associated with SCV probability, perhaps because AFL differs from AF in its pathomechanism. Whereas AF is sustained by a complex composite of ectopic activity and multiple small electrical reentry circuits, the pathophysiologic characteristics of AFL are typically based on a fixed macro reentry. Thus, maintenance of AFL is probably less dependent on arrhythmogenic triggers, such as early afterdepolarizations, and hence might be less vulnerable to changes in electrolyte homeostasis and correction of electrolyte imbalances. Our data suggest that AF and AFL should be handled as 2 distinct disorders from a mechanistic and a therapeutic perspective.

The results of our study have no direct implications for clinical practice in the management of care for patients with AF or AFL in the ED. The findings are purely exploratory and hypothesis-generating but could potentially provide a rationale for an appropriate prospective trial.

### Magnesium for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^115YdEe1]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiac arrhythmia

The importance of magnesium supplementation in preventing arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure has long been established. Magnesium deficiency can lead to QT interval prolongation, ST-segment depression and low amplitude T waves. Magnesium also influences the movement of other ions such as potassium, sodium and calcium across the cell membranes. The association between magnesium and potassium is probably best demonstrated in that magnesium deficiency is often accompanied by potassium deficiency. In patients with congestive heart failure, both magnesium and potassium are depleted with thiazide diuretics, particularly in patients requiring high doses of thiazide diuretics. It has been shown that the level of potassium in muscle will not normalise unless magnesium is replaced, even though serum potassium rises with repletion. The ominous role of magnesium depletion in predisposing to arrhythmias in patients with congestive heart failure is perhaps best demonstrated in a recent prospective study showing that among the 66% of patients with cardiac arrest who had magnesium abnormalities, none were successfully resuscitated.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112aXBHU]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Pooled results from 17 studies in participants with hypertension showed a −2.96/−2.10 mm Hg reduction in SBP and DBP. The results demonstrated that while untreated hypertensive participants achieved significant reductions in DBP (1.88 mm Hg), only those on BP-lowering medication achieved significant reductions in both SBP and DBP, with reductions of −7.68 and −2.96 mm Hg, respectively, at the magnesium dose provided. The reduction, particularly in SBP among this population, is clinically important, with a recent meta-analysis finding that a 5 mm Hg reduction in SBP reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by ≈10%.

Although the benefits of magnesium were demonstrated in participants with hypertension on BP-lowering medication, the meta-analysis found that magnesium intake was not effective at reducing SBP and DBP among participants with normotension. This builds on the categorization systematic review of 49 studies by Rosanoff et althat found similar results, including that magnesium therapy decreased BP in treated hypertensive participants, although no changes were observed in normotensive individuals. Unlike the current meta-analysis, the previous review did not quantifiably determine BP changes.

It is suggested that systemic magnesium depletion promotes increased BP in patients with hypertension through increasing vascular and sympathetic tone, altering sodium and potassium handling, enhancing the inflammatory process, and impairing vascular cell metabolism and dysfunction. Diuretics, prescribed as a first-line pharmacological therapy for hypertension, have been shown to exacerbate magnesium depletion among patients with hypertension through increased renal magnesium loss. Of the 6 studies included in this review that assessed patients with hypertension on BP-lowering medication, 4 studies (Paolisso et al, Saito et al, Guerrero-Romero et al, and Henderson et al) included participants on diuretics (n = 66). This may explain why participants with hypertension taking BP-lowering medication demonstrated greater BP benefits of −7.68/−2.96 mm Hg when receiving magnesium treatment.

### Refractory potassium repletion… [^115zSPas]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Experimental and clinical observations support the view that uncorrected magnesium deficiency impairs repletion of cellular potassium. This is consistent with the observed close association between K and Mg depletion. Concomitant Mg deficiency in K-depleted patients ranges from 38% to 42%. Refractory K repletion due to unrecognized concurrent Mg deficiency can be clinically perplexing. Refractory K repletion as a consequence of Mg deficiency may be operative in patients with congestive failure, digitalis toxicity, cisplatin therapy, and in patients receiving potent loop diuretics. Therefore, we recommend that: serum Mg be routinely assessed in any patients in whom serum electrolytes are necessary for clinical management and until serum Mg is routinely performed consideration should be given to treating hypokalemic patients with both Mg as well as K to avoid the problem of refractory K repletion due to coexisting Mg deficiency.

### Evolving concepts in epithelial magnesium transport [^111nknFz]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Magnesium is an important, predominantly intracellular cation that is required for a wide variety of cellular processes. The mammalian kidney plays a key role in whole-body magnesium homeostasis, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie renal epithelial magnesium reabsorption are poorly understood. Traditional physiologic approaches have been severely hampered by the lack of a useful radioisotope of magnesium that can be used for tracer flux studies. The present review discusses physiologic insights gained from recent reverse-genetic studies that have identified a plethora of genes involved in inherited renal magnesium wasting syndromes.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^112fF8mn]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Electrolyte management in ventricular arrhythmias — administration of potassium and magnesium has been proposed as helpful adjuncts in the prevention of VA; in patients with torsades de pointes, intravenous magnesium is first-line therapy, and when both potassium and magnesium are deficient, magnesium should be replaced to facilitate potassium repletion. For potassium targets, some recommend keeping the potassium level between 4.5 mmol/L and 5 mmol/L to prevent VA and SCD; in acute MI, the lowest death rates were seen with serum potassium between 3.5 mmol/L and < 4.5 mmol/L, and the rates of VA did not rise unless potassium was < 3.5 mmol/L or ≥ 5 mmol/L. A large randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous magnesium in the post-MI period demonstrated no benefit in 30-day mortality, and it remains quite reasonable to monitor potassium and magnesium during aggressive diuresis and in the post-MI period.

### The challenges of diagnosis and management of gitelman syndrome [^111QhkVk]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Gitelman syndrome is an inherited tubulopathy characterized by renal salt wasting from the distal convoluted tubule. Defects in the sodium chloride cotransporter (encoded by SLC12A3) underlie this autosomal recessive condition. This article focuses on the specific challenges of diagnosing and treating Gitelman syndrome, with use of an illustrative case report. Symptoms relate to decreased serum potassium and magnesium levels, which include muscle weakness, tetany, fatigue and palpitations. Sudden cardiac deaths have been reported. Making a diagnosis may be difficult given its rarity but is important. A knowledge of the serum and urine biochemical picture is vital to distinguish it from a broad differential diagnosis, and application of genetic testing can resolve difficult cases. There is a group of Gitelman syndrome heterozygous carriers that experience symptoms and electrolyte disturbance and these patients should be managed in a similar way, though here genetic investigations become key in securing a difficult diagnosis. Potassium and magnesium replacement is the cornerstone of treatment, though practically this can be hard for patients to manage and often does not fully relieve symptoms even when serum levels are normalized. Challenges arise due to the lack of randomized controlled trials focussing on treatment of this rare disease; hence, clinicians endorse strategies in line with correction of the underlying pathophysiology such as sodium loading or pharmacological treatments, which seem to help some patients. Focussed dietary advice and knowing the best tolerated preparations of potassium and magnesium medications are useful tools for the physician, as well as an awareness of the specific burdens that this patient group face in order to signpost appropriate support.

### Dextrose, sodium chloride, sodium acetate anhydrous, sodium gluconate, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride (normosol-R and dextrose) [^114KaqUz]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Potassium chloride in water dissociates to provide potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl‾) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter in a healthy adult and child over 10 days old; 3.5 to 6.0 mEq/liter in a child less than 10 days old). Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance.

Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.

Magnesium chloride in water dissociates to provide magnesium (Mg++) and chloride (Cl‾) ions. Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0 mEq per liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.

### How should hypomagnesaemia be investigated and treated? [^111VUBdM]. Clinical Endocrinology (2011). Low credibility.

Hypomagnesaemia is relatively common, with an estimated prevalence in the general population ranging from 2.5% to 15%. It may result from inadequate magnesium intake, increased gastrointestinal or renal loss or redistribution from extracellular to intracellular space. Drug-induced hypomagnesaemia, particularly related to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, is being increasingly recognized. Most patients with hypomagnesaemia are asymptomatic; symptomatic magnesium depletion is often associated with multiple other biochemical abnormalities, including hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia and metabolic acidosis. Manifestations of symptomatic hypomagnesaemia most often involve neuromuscular, cardiovascular and metabolic features. Patients with symptomatic hypomagnesaemia should be treated with intravenous magnesium, reserving oral replacement for asymptomatic patients.

### Effect of patiromer on reducing serum potassium and preventing recurrent hyperkalaemia in patients with heart failure and chronic kidney disease on RAAS inhibitors [^115t8vTS]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

During the initial treatment phase and its follow‐up period, hypokalaemia (serum K + < 3.5 mEq/L) occurred in 3% of patients with and without HF. These patients had serum K + in range of ≥ 3.2–3.4 mEq/L; hypokalaemia was most often transient after adjustment of the patiromer dose. During the randomized withdrawal phase and its follow‐up period, hypokalaemia requiring withdrawal from the study (serum K + < 3.8 mEq/L) occurred in 7% and 4% of patients with and without HF taking patiromer, respectively, in none of the patients with HF, and in 1 (3%) patient without HF taking placebo.

The mean serum magnesium level remained within normal range throughout both phases of the trial in patients with and without HF. Small mean decreases in serum magnesium were observed at the end of the initial treatment phase in patients with HF [−0.20 mg/dL (−0.16 mEq/L)] and without HF [−0.16 mg/dL (−0.13 mEq/L)], with no apparent dose effect. At the end of the randomized withdrawal phase, a small mean increase from baseline was observed in serum magnesium in placebo patients with HF (+0.19 mEq/L) and without HF (+0.05 mEq/L). There was no significant change in serum magnesium levels in patiromer patients with and without HF during the randomized withdrawal phase. A serum magnesium level of < 1.4 mg/dL was observed in 4 HF patients and 3 non‐HF patients during the initial treatment phase. During the randomized withdrawal phase, no patient (with or without HF) had a serum magnesium level of < 1.4 mg/dL. No patient (with or without HF) had serum magnesium levels < 1.2 mg/dL during either phase of the study. Magnesium replacement therapy was prescribed in 9 patients (3 with HF and 6 without HF) taking patiromer during the initial treatment phase. No clinically relevant changes in renal function or in levels of serum calcium, fluoride, or other electrolytes (e.g. bicarbonate) were observed in either phase of the study. Two patients in the initial treatment phase (1 with HF and 1 without HF) and 1 patient without HF on patiromer in the randomized withdrawal phase had electrocardiographic changes consistent with hyperkalaemia; none had changes consistent with hypokalaemia. No clinically relevant changes in renal function were observed (see the Supplementary material online, Table S4).

### Targeting the conserved active site of splicing machines with specific and selective small molecule modulators [^113K7ppg]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Principles of molecular recognition between the conserved group II intron active site and splicing modulators

To visualize the exact binding mode and characterize the inhibitory mechanism of intronistat B at high resolution, we first solved the co-crystal structure of intronistat B bound to a previously-described construct of the O. iheyensis I1 intron, which encompasses its structural domains 1–5 (OiD1–5), in the exon-free state and in the presence of Mg 2+ and K + ions.

Our structure, determined at a resolution of 3.0 Å, shows that in the presence of the compound, the intron maintains an overall folded structure, similar to that of the compound-free intron (PDB entry 4E8M), with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.5 Å between the two states (Supplementary Table S2). In the intronistat B-bound state the intron active site is intact and adopts the catalytically required triple helix conformation anchored to the M1/M2/K1 metal ion cluster. While the electron density around the metal cluster in the active site is weak, the interatomic distances and coordination spheres were compatible with magnesium ions at the M1 and M2 positions and with potassium ions at the K1 position (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S28). Importantly, we have modeled magnesium and potassium ions at the M1/M2 and at the K1 positions, respectively, because the identity of the ions that occupy these sites had been previously established based on metal-ion replacement and crystallographic anomalous scattering studies, (see also a stereo view of the electron density of the active site ions in Supplementary Fig. S28).

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^117PqpLC]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

5.3.2 Blood tests for specific nutritional deficiencies

Statement 102. We recommend that IBD patients who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition should have relevant screening blood tests to assess for macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies. This may include measurement of iron stores, vitamin B12, folate, vitamins A, C, D and E, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, zinc and selenium (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 93.6%).

Measurement of macronutrient and micronutrient status in IBD is important for ongoing monitoring in patients who have or are at risk of malnutrition; however, interpretation of results can be challenging. Some micronutrients are influenced by disease activity so serum levels should consider C-reactive protein (CRP) when interpreting these micronutrients. A reliable clinical interpretation can be made only if the CRP is < 20 mg/L (plasma zinc), < 10 mg/L (plasma selenium, vitamin A and vitamin D) or < 5 mg/L (vitamin B6 and vitamin C). Magnesium deficiency has been reported to occur in 13–88% of patients with IBD, but serum magnesium is not an accurate measurement of magnesium status because less than 1% of magnesium stores are in the blood. The remainder is in bone, soft tissue and muscle. Magnesium deficiency in IBD is likely to be caused by increased gastrointestinal losses. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency include abdominal cramps, impaired healing, fatigue and bone pain. Magnesium supplementation can be given orally or intravenously, although oral supplementation can worsen diarrhoea. Up to a third of patients with IBD fail to meet the recommended dietary intake for calcium and calcium supplementation should be considered alongside vitamin D supplementation (see Section 5.2.8.3: Common Disease Considerations, Calcium and vitamin D supplementation). Plasma potassium levels should be monitored and supplemented as required. There are existing ECCO guidelines for monitoring and management of iron, vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. General advice about iron replacement is shown in box 9.

### Magnesium supplementation and blood pressure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112MsKFt]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

NOVELTY AND RELEVANCE

Raised blood pressure (BP) is the leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and preventable deaths, contributing to 19.2% of all deaths in 2019. Lifestyle modification, including dietary interventions, is important for preventing raised BP and acting as the first line of treatment for hypertension.

Consistent evidence for dietary interventions to lower BP and prevent hypertension mostly focuses on decreasing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet centers on a more holistic approach through food intake that would increase potassium, calcium, and magnesium while lowering sodium. Despite the consistent evidence on the importance of sodium, and potassium, the evidence on the impact of magnesium alone on reducing BP has been inconsistent.

Magnesium may lower BP through several mechanisms. These include regulating cardiac rhythm, reducing vascular tone, inhibiting the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, increasing nitric oxide release and endothelial prostaglandin I 2 secretion, decreasing reabsorption of sodiumand enhancing the effect of BP-lowering medication. The potential benefits of magnesium on BP may also be greater among individuals with hypomagnesemia.

Despite these potential benefits, the latest evidence review by the United States Food and Drug Association in 2022 identified supportive yet inconclusive evidence that diets with adequate magnesium reduce hypertension. Of the meta-analyses conducted to date, 2 of those reviewing randomized controlled trials found small yet significant reductions in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), 1 found magnesium supplementation reduced DBP but not SBP among hypertensive individuals, and 1 review found no effect of oral magnesium supplementation on BP.

The latest meta-analysis conducted in 2017 by Dibaba et alassessed the effect of magnesium supplementation on BP in those with underlying preclinical conditions (insulin resistance, prediabetes, and noncommunicable chronic disease). Eleven randomized controlled trials, with a total of 543 participants and a mean follow-up of 3.6 months, were included, which found that magnesium supplementation reduced SBP by −4.18 mm Hg and DBP by −2.27 mm Hg compared with control groups.

Table 1 — Other recommendations for refeeding syndrome (RS) risk focus on electrolytes and fluids with specific cautions. Items include Restore circulatory volume, Check electrolyte levels with Electrolyte replacement to correct deficiencies and Monitor fluid balance, and Check potassium, magnesium, phosphorus. Guidance includes Do not discontinue feeding if electrolyte levels fall and When serum potassium, magnesium, or phosphorus levels are significantly low, feeding should not be advanced further until supplementation has occurred. Calculations should Consider all sources of calories and fluids in your calculations (including dextrose), and clinicians should Check baseline electrolytes (especially potassium, magnesium, phosphorus) and replace any low levels promptly. Fluid management notes Unless hemodynamically unstable, keep sodium-containing IV fluids to < 2 L/d initially in severely malnourished patients, such as those with anorexia nervosa, who may have a component of cardiomyopathy. Patients at high risk for RS should receive electrolytes substitution of lower than normal/in low normal range, and Prophylactic supplementation of electrolytes.

### Mechanism of hypokalemia in magnesium deficiency [^116iX746]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2007). Low credibility.

Magnesium deficiency is frequently associated with hypokalemia. Concomitant magnesium deficiency aggravates hypokalemia and renders it refractory to treatment by potassium. Herein is reviewed literature suggesting that magnesium deficiency exacerbates potassium wasting by increasing distal potassium secretion. A decrease in intracellular magnesium, caused by magnesium deficiency, releases the magnesium-mediated inhibition of ROMK channels and increases potassium secretion. Magnesium deficiency alone, however, does not necessarily cause hypokalemia. An increase in distal sodium delivery or elevated aldosterone levels may be required for exacerbating potassium wasting in magnesium deficiency.

### Intake of potassium-and magnesium-enriched salt improves functional outcome after stroke: a randomized, multicenter, double-blind controlled trial [^113s6mJm]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background: Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and neurologic deficits. Management measures to improve neurologic outcomes are in great need. Our previous intervention trial in elderly subjects successfully used salt as a carrier for potassium, demonstrating a 41% reduction in cardiovascular mortality by switching to potassium-enriched salt. Dietary magnesium has been associated with lowered diabetes and/or stroke risk in humans and with neuroprotection in animals. Objective: Because a large proportion of Taiwanese individuals are in marginal deficiency states for potassium and for magnesium and salt is a good carrier for minerals, it is justifiable to study whether further enriching salt with magnesium at an amount near the Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) amount may provide additional benefit for stroke recovery. Design: This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comprising 291 discharged stroke patients with modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≤ 4. There were 3 arms: 1) regular salt (Na salt) (n = 99), 2) potassium-enriched salt (K salt) (n = 97), and 3) potassium- and magnesium-enriched salt (K/Mg salt) (n = 95). The NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel Index (BI), and mRS were evaluated at discharge, at 3 mo, and at 6 mo. A good neurologic performance was defined by NIHSS = 0, BI = 100, and mRS ≤ 1. Results: After the 6-mo intervention, the proportion of patients with good neurologic performance increased in a greater magnitude in the K/Mg salt group than in the K salt group and the Na salt group, in that order. The K/Mg salt group had a significantly increased OR (2.25; 95% CI: 1.09, 4.67) of achieving good neurologic performance compared with the Na salt group. But the effect of K salt alone (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 0.77, 3.22) was not significant. Conclusions: This study suggests that providing the DRI amount of magnesium and potassium together long term is beneficial for stroke patient recovery from neurologic deficits. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02910427.

### Dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases [^115Q11TK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is designed to lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health by reducing sodium and unhealthy fats while increasing nutrients, including potassium, calcium, magnesium, and fibre. While evidence supports its benefits for managing cardiovascular risk factors, gaps remain in understanding its long-term impact on preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly in terms of hard clinical outcomes such as myocardial infarction and stroke.

Objectives

To assess the effects of the DASH diet for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases.

Search Methods

We used standard extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was in May 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a DASH diet intervention to no intervention (including usual care), minimal intervention, or other dietary interventions. In the context of this review, 'minimal intervention' includes brief dietary advice or informational leaflets provided during a medical consultation, without a structured dietary intervention. 'Other dietary interventions' include any other dietary programme besides the DASH diet. Participants were adults with or without CVD. The minimum duration of eligible interventions was eight weeks and the minimum follow-up was three months.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Primary outcomes were myocardial infarction, heart failure, and stroke. Secondary outcomes were the need for coronary revascularisation, carotid revascularisation, peripheral revascularisation, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, changes in blood pressure, blood lipids, the occurrence of type 2 diabetes, health-related quality of life, and adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

Five RCTs involving 1397 participants met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. All five trials contributed at least one intervention arm to one or more of the three prespecified comparisons. In total, 1075 participants across eligible arms were included in the meta-analyses. The difference reflects trial arms that did not meet our prespecified intervention and comparison definitions, and were therefore not analysed, though all participants were randomised within eligible trials and are accounted for in the review total. The trials assessed the DASH diet in a primary prevention setting; none evaluated its effects in secondary prevention. Participants were generally healthy adults aged 18 years or older, without diagnosed cardiovascular disease. The intervention duration ranged from 16 weeks to 12 months, with follow-up periods between 16 weeks and 18 months (medium- and long-term). The trials were conducted in the USA and Poland, with funding from public institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the Institute of Cardiology in Poland. DASH diet versus no intervention (including usual care) Myocardial infarction: one trial (144 participants) reported no myocardial infarctions in either group over a one-year follow-up. The GRADE certainty rating was low due to the high risk of performance bias and imprecision. Stroke: one trial (144 participants) reported no strokes in either group over the same follow-up period. The GRADE rating was low for similar reasons. All-cause mortality: one trial (90 participants) reported no deaths over a six-month follow-up. The GRADE rating was very low due to unclear risk of selection bias, high risk of performance bias, and imprecision. No data were available for heart failure or revascularisation needs (coronary, carotid, or peripheral) in this comparison. DASH diet versus minimal intervention Myocardial infarction: two trials (902 participants in total; 629 participants were in trial arms eligible for this comparison, based on our prespecified intervention and comparison definitions) reported limited events, with no clear differences between groups over one year (risk ratio (RR) 2.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 73.04). The GRADE rating was low due to high risk of performance bias and imprecision. Stroke: two trials (reporting on the same 629 participants) reported no strokes in either group over follow-up periods ranging from six months to one year. The GRADE rating was low due to similar concerns. No data were available for heart failure, revascularisation needs (coronary, carotid, or peripheral), or all-cause mortality in this comparison. DASH diet versus another dietary intervention All-cause mortality: one trial (261 participants) reported no clear difference between the groups over one year (RR 2.98, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.42). The GRADE rating was very low due to multiple risks of bias and imprecision. No data were available for myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, or revascularisation needs in this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

The effect of the DASH diet on major cardiovascular outcomes - including myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality - remains inconclusive due to a lack of robust long-term evidence. Additionally, no trials have assessed its impact on heart failure or the need for revascularisation procedures, such as coronary, carotid, or peripheral interventions. While the DASH diet may reduce blood pressure, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels while increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol compared to no intervention or usual care, it appears to have little to no effect on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Evidence comparing the DASH diet to a minimal intervention or alternative dietary approaches remains limited. Although the DASH diet has minimal reported adverse effects, the absence of long-term safety data prevents definitive conclusions on its use in individuals with or without cardiovascular disease. The certainty of evidence is low to very low, primarily due to design limitations such as high risk of bias, small sample sizes, and short follow-up periods in the included trials. Most studies focused on cardiovascular risk factors rather than long-term clinical outcomes, and all eligible trials assessed primary prevention, with no data on secondary prevention. Given these uncertainties, well-designed, long-term randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate the DASH diet's impact on major cardiovascular events, its effectiveness in secondary prevention, and its long-term safety.

### Importance of the renal ion channel TRPM6 in the circadian secretion of renin to raise blood pressure [^111si3Qz]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Approximately one billion people worldwide are estimated to have hypertension, which significantly increases the risk of various diseases, including potentially fatal diseases, such as ischemic heart disease and stroke. These hypertension-related fatal incidents are known to occur frequently in the early morning, the beginning of the active period when blood pressure rises sharply. Renin secretion triggered by renal sympathetic neurons is considered to play a crucial role in this blood pressure elevation, but its regulatory mechanism is not well understood.

It is widely accepted that some dietary minerals, particularly sodium and potassium, play important roles in the control of blood pressure. Magnesium is a major essential element involved in a variety of biological activities. Epidemiological studies have shown a significant inverse relationship between dietary magnesium levels and the risk of hypertension –. Moreover, urinary magnesium excretion, which is assumed to be in approximate equilibrium with intestinal magnesium absorption, is inversely correlated with the risk of hypertension. These findings suggest a close association between organismal magnesium homeostasis and blood pressure regulation, highlighting the importance of Mg 2+ channels and/or transporters in the regulation of blood pressure.

### Dextrose monohydrate, sodium chloride, potassium acetate, and magnesium acetate (Normosol-m and dextrose) [^115uDAmD]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Potassium acetate in water dissociates to provide potassium (K+) and acetate (CH3COO−) ions. Potassium is the chief cation of body cells (160 mEq/liter of intracellular water). It is found in low concentration in plasma and extracellular fluids (3.5 to 5.0 mEq/liter) in a healthy adult and child over 10 days old; 3.5 to 6.0 mEq/liter in a child less than 10 days old. Potassium plays an important role in electrolyte balance. Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.

Magnesium acetate in water dissociates to provide magnesium (Mg++) and acetate (CH3COO−) ions. Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0 mEq per liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.

Acetate anion (CH3COO−), a source of hydrogen ion acceptors, serves as an alternate source of bicarbonate (HCO3−) by metabolic conversion in the liver. This has been shown to proceed readily even in the presence of severe liver disease. Thus, acetate anion exerts a mild systemic antiacidotic action that may be advantageous during fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production). Average normal pediatric daily requirements are based on the child's weight as described in the table below:

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### Fluid overload in the ICU: evaluation and management [^113cWwBW]. BMC Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Since common electrolyte disturbances could be encountered during diuretic therapy, it is important to monitor electrolytes levels and also to assess acid-based status. In order to avoid hypokalemia, administration of oral potassium it is easy. Measuring urinary potassium concentration and calculating the daily losses of potassium, which require replacement is a strategy that can be used to estimate daily potassium requirements. Another strategy is the use of potassium-sparing diuretics like spironolactone. Hypomagnesemia is frequently found during diuretic therapy, magnesium replacement can be achieved either intravenously or orally, typically with 20–30 mmoL per day. Finally in some patients, chloride losses exceed sodium losses and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis develops; this is usually corrected with the administration of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride.

A recent comprehensive review have shown that torsemide and bumetanide have more favorable pharmacokinetic profiles than furosemide, and in the case of torsemide it could be more efficacious than furosemide in patients with heart failure (decreased mortality, decrease hospitalizations, and improved New York Heart Association functional classification). In AKI patients, as compared with torsemide the use of furosemide was associated with a significant improvement in urine output. Moreover, two trials comparing bumetanide with furosemide showed conflicting results.

Finally, in patients with AKI the response to furosemide may be reduced due to multiple mechanisms including a reduced tubular secretion of furosemide and blunted response of Na-K-2Cl co-transporters at the loop of Henle. This reduced response to furosemide in AKI patients often requires the use of higher doses that may increase the risk of ototoxicity, especially as the clearance of furosemide is severely reduced in AKI. High doses of furosemide may also result in myocardial dysfunction secondary to furosemide induced vasoconstriction.

5.18 Body Temperature Regulation

Although not reported with ziprasidone in premarketing trials, disruption of the body's ability to reduce core body temperature has been attributed to antipsychotic agents. Appropriate care is advised when prescribing ziprasidone for patients who will be experiencing conditions which may contribute to an elevation in core body temperature, e.g., exercising strenuously, exposure to extreme heat, receiving concomitant medication with anticholinergic activity, or being subject to dehydration.

5.19 Suicide

The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in psychotic illness or bipolar disorder, and close supervision of high-risk patients should accompany drug therapy. Prescriptions for ziprasidone should be written for the smallest quantity of capsules consistent with good patient management in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

5.20 Patients with Concomitant Illnesses

Clinical experience with ziprasidone in patients with certain concomitant systemic illnesses is limited [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), (8.7)].

Ziprasidone has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing clinical studies. Because of the risk of QTc prolongation and orthostatic hypotension with ziprasidone, caution should be observed in cardiac patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), (5.9)].

5.21 Laboratory Tests

Patients being considered for ziprasidone treatment that are at risk of significant electrolyte disturbances should have baseline serum potassium and magnesium measurements. Low serum potassium and magnesium should be replaced before proceeding with treatment. Patients who are started on diuretics during Ziprasidone therapy need periodic monitoring of serum potassium and magnesium. Ziprasidone should be discontinued in patients who are found to have persistent QTc measurements > 500 msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### New guidelines for potassium replacement in clinical practice… [^114tYe6C]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

The current lack of consensus on how to prevent and treat hypokalemia has led to the neglect of a wide range of situations in which increasing potassium intake might help prevent sequelae of cardiovascular disease. The multifactorial and interactive mechanisms that are stimulated by hypertension and even more so by heart failure, which mandate the introduction of drugs that disrupt electrolyte homeostasis, emphasize the serious role of potassium. This article reviews contemporary thinking on potassium in clinical practice. The results demonstrated that potassium supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The greatest effects were observed in participants who had a high concurrent sodium intake. This analysis suggests that low potassium intake may play an important role in the genesis of high blood pressure.

Potassium salts include potassium chloride, potassium phosphate, and potassium bicarbonate. Potassium phosphate is found primarily in food, and potassium bicarbonate is typically recommended when potassium depletion occurs in the setting of metabolic acidosis. In all other settings, potassium chloride should be used because of its unique effectiveness against the most common causes of potassium depletion. Magnesium is an important cofactor for potassium uptake and for the maintenance of intracellular potassium levels. Recent studies using cellular models confirm the critical role of magnesium in maintaining intracellular potassium and indicate that the mechanisms are multifactorial. 48 Whang and colleagues48 demonstrated that coexisting magnesium and potassium depletion could lead to refractory potassium repletion, which is the inability to replete potassium in the presence of unrecognized and continuing magnesium deficiency.

Routine determination of serum magnesium levels should be considered whenever the measurements of serum electrolytes are necessary in a patient. Whang et al48 recommend considering the repletion of both magnesium and potassium for patients with hypokalemia. Dietary sources of magnesium include whole-grain cereals, peas, beans, nuts, cocoa, seafood, and dark green vegetables.

1. Dietary consumption of potassium-rich foods should be supplemented with potassium replacement therapy. Often, increasing dietary potassium intake is not completely effective in replacing the potassium loss associated with chloride depletion because dietary potassium is almost entirely coupled with phosphate, rather than with chloride. In addition, the consumption of potassium-rich foods in amounts that are sufficient to increase the level of serum potassium level to acceptable concentrations may be c.

The rationale notes EN can be initiated at approximately 25% of the estimated goal and advanced cautiously over 3–5 days toward the goal rate, with serum electrolytes, volume status, clinical manifestations, and vital signs monitored carefully after EN is started.

### Sodium salt substitution for blood pressure in adults with diabetes [^115ymhUb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Why it is important to do this review

The reduction of dietary sodium intake in people with diabetes mellitus has a positive impact on outcomes such as renal dysfunction, cardiovascular disease onset, and premature death. While low levels of potassium is a risk factor for diabetes mellitus, the increased levels of urinary potassium excretion are associated with the low risk for renal and cardiovascular outcomes in people with diabetes mellitus.

Since both diabetes mellitus and hypertension can be managed with lifestyle modifications, strategies such as salt substitution to reduce the daily sodium intake can be useful to improve disease prognosis and reduce healthcare costs. Compliance to a sodium‐restricted diet is often difficult and salt substitution shows great potential as a lifestyle modification for the control of blood pressure in people with hypertension. Studies have found sodium salt substitution to be generally accepted by consumers in terms of taste rather than a salt‐restricted diet. The Dutch National Food Survey found that consumers were compliant with intake guidelines (European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)) when sodium chloride was replaced by potassium chloride. Evidence from one study conducted in Peru applying the triangle test found that salt (used during cooking and at the table) can also be replaced by 25% with a potassium‐enriched salt substitute without consumers being able to taste the difference. People with diabetes might benefit specifically from salt substitution as they have low levels of potassium and magnesium. Despite many guidelines recommending a reduction in dietary intake of sodium salt, a clear consensus on the efficacy and safety of salt substitution in people with diabetes mellitus is yet to be established. Hence, in this review, we will systematically assess the benefits and harms of dietary salt substitution with other edible salts (such as potassium or magnesium salt) in people with diabetes mellitus.

### Magnesium depletion and thiazide hypokalemia… [^1178PEza]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — In their article in the November 1985 issue of the Archives, Papademetriou et al1 consider several possible explanations for the failure of oral potassium chloride to correct diuretic-induced hypokalemia. An explanation not mentioned was the possibility of coexistent diuretic-induced magnesium depletion. Thiazide diuretics are magnesuric, 2 and, when accompanied by insufficient dietary intake, may create a negative magnesium balance. Magnesium is largely an intracellular cation, and serum magnesium concentrations correlate poorly with intracellular stores. Experimental magnesium deficiency in man has been associated with hypokalemia and negative total body potassium balance. 3 Enhanced urinary potassium excretion has been reported in experimental magnesium depletion. 4Hypokalemia refractory to oral potassium chloride supplements may have been due to coexistent diureticinduced magnesium depletion.

Magnesium depletion may be of additional importance in the pathogenesis of diuretic-induced ventricular arrhythmias that may also be refractory to potassium supplementation.

### Molecular mechanisms of renal magnesium reabsorption [^1136mQAy]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Magnesium is an essential cofactor in many cellular processes, and aberrations in magnesium homeostasis can have life-threatening consequences. The kidney plays a central role in maintaining serum magnesium within a narrow range (0.70–1.10 mmol/L). Along the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb, magnesium reabsorption occurs via paracellular pathways. Members of the claudin family form the magnesium pores in these segments, and also regulate magnesium reabsorption by adjusting the transepithelial voltage that drives it. Along the distal convoluted tubule transcellular reabsorption via heteromeric TRPM6/7 channels predominates, although paracellular reabsorption may also occur. In this segment, the NaCl cotransporter plays a critical role in determining transcellular magnesium reabsorption. Although the general machinery involved in renal magnesium reabsorption has been identified by studying genetic forms of magnesium imbalance, the mechanisms regulating it are poorly understood. This review discusses pathways of renal magnesium reabsorption by different segments of the nephron, emphasizing newer findings that provide insight into regulatory process, and outlining critical unanswered questions.

Nutrient supplementation and repletion after bariatric surgery — vitamin B1 (thiamine) — include preventive and therapeutic dosing. For prevention, ≥ 12 mg thiamine daily; preferably a 50–100 mg daily dose of thiamine from a B-complex supplement or high-potency multivitamin. Bariatric patients with suspected thiamine deficiency should be treated before or in the absence of laboratory confirmation and monitored/ evaluated for resolution of signs and symptoms. Repletion dosing varies by route: Oral therapy: 100 mg 2–3 times daily until symptoms resolve; IV therapy: 200 mg 3 times daily to 500 mg once or twice daily for 3–5 d, followed by 250 mg/d for 3–5 d or until symptoms resolve, then consider treatment with 100 mg/d orally, indefinitely, or until risk factors have been resolved; IM therapy: 250 mg once daily for 3–5 d or 100–250 mg monthly. Magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus should be given simultaneously to patients at risk for refeeding syndrome.

### Structural basis for ion selectivity revealed by high-resolution crystal structure of Mg2 + channel mgtE [^113q1XAj]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Magnesium is the most abundant divalent cation in living cells and is crucial to several biological processes. MgtE is a Mg(2+) channel distributed in all domains of life that contributes to the maintenance of cellular Mg(2+) homeostasis. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of the transmembrane domain of MgtE, bound to Mg(2+), Mn(2+) and Ca(2+). The high-resolution Mg(2+)-bound crystal structure clearly visualized the hydrated Mg(2+) ion within its selectivity filter. Based on those structures and biochemical analyses, we propose a cation selectivity mechanism for MgtE in which the geometry of the hydration shell of the fully hydrated Mg(2+) ion is recognized by the side-chain carboxylate groups in the selectivity filter. This is in contrast to the K(+)-selective filter of KcsA, which recognizes a dehydrated K(+) ion. Our results further revealed a cation-binding site on the periplasmic side, which regulate channel opening and prevents conduction of near-cognate cations.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Chronic heart failure — diuretic therapy management and risks: Electrolyte imbalances should be treated aggressively and the diuresis continued, and if hypotension or azotemia occurs the physician may elect to slow the rapidity of diuresis, but diuresis should nevertheless be maintained until fluid retention is eliminated, even if this strategy results in mild or moderate decreases in blood pressure or renal function, as long as the patient remains asymptomatic. Once fluid retention has resolved, treatment with the diuretic should be maintained to prevent the recurrence of volume overload, with dose adjustment often accomplished by having patients record their weight each day and make changes in their diuretic dosage if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range. Patients may become unresponsive to high doses if they consume large amounts of dietary sodium, are taking agents that can block the effects of diuretics (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including cyclo- oxygenase-2 inhibitors), or have a significant impairment of renal function or perfusion, but diuretic resistance can generally be overcome by the intravenous administration of diuretics (including the use of continuous infusions), the use of 2 or more diuretics in combination (e.g., furosemide and metolazone), or the use of diuretics together with drugs that increase renal blood flow (e.g., positive inotropic agents). Diuretics can cause the depletion of potassium and magnesium and can predispose patients to serious cardiac arrhythmias, particularly in the presence of digitalis therapy, and the risk of electrolyte depletion is markedly enhanced when 2 diuretics are used in combination; concomitant administration of ACEIs alone or in combination with potassium-retaining agents (such as spironolactone) can prevent electrolyte depletion in most patients with HF who are taking a loop diuretic, and when these drugs are prescribed, long-term oral potassium supplementation is generally not needed and may be deleterious. Excessive use of diuretics can decrease blood pressure and impair renal function and exercise tolerance; if there are no signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia are likely to be related to volume depletion and may resolve after a reduction in diuretic dose, whereas the signs of fluid retention, hypotension and azotemia, are likely to reflect worsening HF and a decline in effective peripheral perfusion, which is an ominous clinical scenario and necessitates considering the measures discussed under Stage D HF.

### Haemodynamic consequences of changing potassium concentrations in haemodialysis fluids [^11684Pv9]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Kidneys are responsible for long-term potassium homeostasis; this exposes patients with end-stage renal disease to a high risk of hyperkalaemia. Recovering potassium homeostasis is one of the important objective of dialysis. Considering that its location is mainly intracellular (98% of the pool), its potential removability during a haemodialysis session is quantitatively modest (between 40 and 80 mmol corresponding to 1–2% of total body potassium). As a consequence, even if, in order to be suitable, potassium removal during dialysis should be equal to the amount accumulated during the inter-dialytic phase, in clinical practice the potassium concentration in the dialysate is usually adjusted with the suboptimal goal of avoiding pre-dialysis hyperkalaemia.

The importance of the body content and serum concentration of potassium to control blood pressure remains controversial. Epidemiological data suggest a role for potassium depletion as a co-factor in the development and severity of hypertension, while dietary potassium inversely correlates with blood pressure. In animal models, an acute decrease in serum potassium concentration produces vasocostriction mediated by the vascular endothelium and an increase in myocardial contractility; the opposite effect is observed if it increases.

In haemodialysis nephrologists are faced with sudden changes in blood pressure and haemodynamic fragility phases that have a multi-factorial origin; ultrafiltration, decrease in osmolarity with imbalance and correction of metabolic acidosis play a predominant role. Despite this, and thanks to some strategies based on current practice, with particular reference to calcium and magnesium concentration in the dialysate, dialysate temperature and ultrafiltration and sodium concentration profiles, pressure stability is guaranteed as a general rule. Some electrolytes, particularly sodium and bicarbonate, can be modulated in profiles with the purpose of better respecting the gap in osmolarity or concentration that is established during the haemodialysis session, but their haemodynamic effect still remains controversial.

Serum potassium is an electrolyte whose concentration - in order to guarantee a negative balance - varies rapidly and significantly during dialysis, frequently resulting in going from pre-dialysis hyperpotassaemia to intra-dialysis hypopotassaemia. In a study performed by Dolson, designed to analyze the consequences of acute potassium changes on haemodynamics, differences in intra-dialytic blood pressure were not found between the groups treated with dialysates containing 1, 2 or 3 mmol/l of potassium. However, at the end of the dialysis session those patients treated with the lower potassium concentrations showed what was called a "rebound hypertension".

Summary — guidance for kidney care professionals emphasizes that potassium and phosphorus additive considerations are timely given the rapid expansion of processed foods and recommendations to use potassium-enriched salt substitutes to reduce sodium intake; potassium additives may be beneficial in patients at low risk for hyperkalemia, and when restriction of potassium-based additives is needed, interventions could range from basic to advanced depending on the level of hyperkalemia risk; phosphorus additives entail nonhealth benefits, and limiting their intake is recommended in all patients with CKD using a similar tiered approach.

Dialysate (Guidelines 5.1–5.4)

When the 2 nd edition of the RA Guidelines was published in 1997, the only recommendation relating to the composition of the dialysate was that renal units phase out the use of acetate in favour of bicarbonate buffering, since the improved efficiency of dialysis could overwhelm the capacity to metabolise acetate. The need to keep bicarbonate separate from divalent cations to prevent precipitation meant that dialysate had to be produced using two different concentrates, leading to the modern proportioning system in which sodium bicarbonate is mixed with an electrolyte concentrate ('acid concentrate') at the point of use, allowing independent control of most dialysate constituents. Some dialysate constituents have diversified whereas others have gradually become standardized.

Dialysate calcium was often supra-physiological in the 1990's (around 1.75mmol/L) to prevent hypocalcaemia, but this became unnecessary with increasing use of vitamin D analogues and calcium-containing phosphate binders, so that dialysate calcium has become reasonably standardized, usually in the range 1.25–1.50mmol/L. Non-standard dialysate calcium may sometimes be helpful, for example in the context of calciphylaxis, but this is usually driven by bone-mineral considerations and is outside the scope of this guideline.

In the 1990's, dialysate was usually glucose-free due to cost and microbiological concerns, and hypoglycaemia was often a problem for diabetic patients. Glucose containing dialysate was initially prescribed for diabetic patients, but extended to all as costs improved, so that a dialysate glucose of 5.5mmol/L is now standard in almost all UK dialysis units. The other constituent of dialysis that has become standardised is magnesium, with low (usually 0.25 or 0.375mmol/L) or high (usually 0.75mmol/L) magnesium being replaced by a dialysate magnesium of 0.5mmol/L, close to the lower end of the normal range.

Opposing these trends, there has been significant diversification in dialysate potassium, and similarly, buffer concentrations and practices vary between units and manufacturers, and are discussed below.

### Sodium salt substitution for blood pressure in adults with diabetes [^1169mFr3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Other minerals, such as potassium and magnesium, also have a role in blood pressure regulation. Substitution of edible salt with salt containing a higher concentration of potassium and other minerals (e.g. magnesium) to reduce daily sodium intake is a salt reduction strategy that significantly decreases both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the general population. People with diabetes have low levels of potassium and magnesium, which is thought to be a contributing factor for poor blood pressure control in this population. Furthermore, oral supplementation with potassium and magnesium reduce blood pressure in people with diabetes. Consequently, it is important to investigate the efficacy and safety of dietary sodium salt substitution with other edible salts, such as potassium or magnesium salts, in both hypertensive and normotensive diabetic populations.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^111Fi758]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — initiation of calories for avoidance and treatment of refeeding syndrome (RS) in at-risk adults — states to "Initiate with 100–150 g of dextrose or 10–20 kcal/kg for the first 24 hours; advance by 33% of goal every 1 to 2 days. This includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose". In patients "with moderate to high risk of RS with low electrolyte levels, holding the initiation or increase of calories until electrolytes are supplemented and/or normalized should be considered", and "Initiation of or increasing calories should be delayed in patients with severely low phosphorus, potassium, or magnesium levels until corrected". It adds that "Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications being infused in dextrose should be considered in the limits above and/or initiated with caution in patients at moderate to severe risk for RS", and if a patient has had "significant amounts of dextrose for several days" with stable electrolytes, "calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than recommended above".

### Evaluation of hypomagnesemia: lessons from disorders of tubular transport [^111GMS12]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Hypomagnesemia is a highly prevalent clinical condition affecting a large number of hospitalized patients. A decrease in systemic magnesium concentration may lead to impaired function of both neurologic and cardiovascular systems. The kidney has a pivotal role in magnesium handling by adjusting the urinary excretion of this ion in order to maintain systemic concentrations within a narrow range. As such, the cause of hypomagnesemia can be related to increments in the renal excretion of this cation. Many hypomagnesemic disorders also have characteristic changes in the renal reabsorptive capacity for other electrolytes, leading to symptoms that sometimes obscure the clinical presentation. For instance, changes in serum calcium concentration or its urinary excretion can aid in determining the underlying cause. Moreover, hypokalemia due to renal potassium losses often is associated with hypomagnesemia. Genetic defects in pathways controlling renal electrolyte transport impose the hypomagnesemic condition by facilitating renal losses. The discovery of the causative genes has greatly increased our understanding of how magnesium is transported by the kidney. Such knowledge is integral for the continued improvement of patient care with respect to bettering therapies and diagnosis.

### Magnesium – essentials for anesthesiologists [^111SRBpD]. Anesthesiology (2011). Low credibility.

Magnesium plays a fundamental role in many cellular functions, and thus there is increasing interest in its role in clinical medicine. Although numerous experimental studies indicate positive effects of magnesium in a variety of disease states, large clinical trials often give conflicting results. However, there is clear evidence for magnesium to benefit patients with eclampsia or torsades de pointes arrhythmias. In addition, magnesium seems to have antinociceptive and anesthetic as well as neuroprotective effects, yet well-designed large clinical trials are required to determine its actual efficacy in pain management or in the state of stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The current review aims to provide an overview of current knowledge and available evidence with respect to physiologic aspects of magnesium and proposed indications and recommendations for its use in the clinical setting.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^115Hr8wf]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — At-risk pediatric patients with refeeding syndrome (RS): Initiate nutrition at a maximum of 40%–50% goal, usually starting the glucose infusion rate around 4–6 mg/kg/min and advancing by 1–2 mg/kg/min as blood glucose levels allow until you reach a max of 14–18 mg/kg/min; this includes enteral as well as parenteral glucose. Calories from IV dextrose solutions and medications in dextrose should be considered within these limits and/or initiated with caution in moderate to severe risk; if already receiving IV dextrose for several days with stable electrolytes, calories from nutrition may be reintroduced at a higher amount than above. Fluid restriction — No recommendation; Sodium restriction — No recommendation; Protein restriction — No recommendation. For electrolytes, check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition, and monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients; replete low electrolytes per established standards of care, and no recommendation can be made for prophylactic dosing if prefeeding levels are normal. If electrolytes become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during initiation, decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation; recommendations may be changed based on practitioner judgment and clinical presentation, and cessation of nutrition support may be considered when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously. Thiamin 2 mg/kg to a max of 100–200 mg/d is advised before feeding commences or before initiating IV fluids containing dextrose in high-risk patients, and continue thiamin supplementation for 5–7 days or longer in severe starvation, chronic alcoholism, or other high risk conditions. Multivitamins: MVI is added to PN daily unless contraindicated, and for oral/enteral nourishment add a complete oral/enteral multivitamin once daily for 10 days or greater based on clinical status and mode of therapy. Monitoring and long-term care include vital signs every 4 hours for the first 24 hours after initiation in those at risk, cardiorespiratory monitoring for unstable patients or those with severe deficiencies, daily weights with monitored intake and output, estimation of energy requirements as needed for oral feeding patients, and evaluation of short- and long-term goals daily during the first several days until stabilized (eg, no requirement for electrolyte supplementation for 2 days) and then per institutional standards; once within adult weight ranges, refer to adult multivitamin recommendations.

### Refractory potassium repletion: a consequence of magnesium deficiency… [^117Q9pYU]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Whang R, Whang DD, Ryan MP. Refractory Potassium Repletion: A Consequence of Magnesium Deficiency. Arch Intern Med. 1992; 152: 40–45. doi: 10.1001/archinte.1992.00400130066006 Experimental and clinical observations support the view that uncorrected magnesium deficiency impairs repletion of cellular potassium. This is consistent with the observed close association between K and Mg depletion. Concomitant Mg deficiency in K-depleted patients ranges from 38% to 42%. Refractory K repletion due to unrecognized concurrent Mg deficiency can be clinically perplexing. Refractory K repletion as a consequence of Mg deficiency may be operative in patients with congestive failure, digitalis toxicity, cisplatin therapy, and in patients receiving potent loop diuretics.

Therefore, we recommend that: serum Mg be routinely assessed in any patients in whom serum electrolytes are necessary for clinical management and until serum Mg is routinely performed consideration should be given to treating hypokalemic patients with both Mg as well as K to avoid the problem of refractory K repletion due to coexisting Mg deficiency.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^116dywr1]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

A diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis requires the patient's plasma glucose concentration to be above 250 mg per dL (although it usually is much higher), the pH level to be less than 7.30, and the bicarbonate level to be 18 mEq per L or less. Beta-hydroxybutyrate is a better measurement of the degree of ketosis than serum ketones. Intravenous insulin and fluid replacement are the mainstays of therapy, with careful monitoring of potassium levels. Phosphorous and magnesium also may need to be replaced. Bicarbonate therapy rarely is needed. Infection, insulin omission, and other problems that may have precipitated ketoacidosis should be treated. Myocardial infarction is a precipitating cause of diabetic ketoacidosis that is especially important to look for in older patients with diabetes. Cerebral edema is a major complication that occurs primarily in children. Education to prevent recurrence should be offered to all patients, including how to manage sick days and when to call a physician.

### Sodium chloride, sodium acetate anhydrous, sodium gluconate, potassium chloride, and magnesium chloride (normosol-R) [^112jWgWp]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium-free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.

Magnesium chloride in water dissociates to provide magnesium (Mg++) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Magnesium is the second most plentiful cation of the intracellular fluids. It is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Normal plasma concentration ranges from 1.5 to 2.5 or 3.0 mEq per liter. Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the plasma concentration and glomerular filtration.

Sodium acetate provides sodium (Na+) and acetate (CH3COO−) ions, the latter anion (a source of hydrogen ion acceptors) serving as an alternate source of bicarbonate (HCO3−) by metabolic conversion in the liver. This has been shown to proceed readily even in the presence of severe liver disease. Thus, acetate anion exerts a mild systemic antiacidotic action that may be advantageous during fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy.

Sodium gluconate provides sodium (Na+) and gluconate (C6H11O7−) ions. Although gluconate is a theoretical alternate metabolic source of bicarbonate (HCO3−) anion, a significant antiacidotic action has not been established. Thus, the gluconate anion serves primarily to complete the cation-anion balance of the solutions.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Average normal pediatric daily requirements are based on the child's weight as described in the table below:

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### Prevention of torsade de pointes in hospital settings: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association and the American college of cardiology foundation [^113m8FBf]. Circulation (2010). Medium credibility.

Hospital prevention of torsade de pointes (TdP) — QTc monitoring thresholds, risk signs, and protocol: The guidelines "do recommend removal of the offending agent in patients with drug-induced LQTS (Class I, Level of Evidence: A); however, they do not define what QTc value should prompt discontinuation". After administration of an at‑risk drug, "if the QTc exceeds 500 ms or there has been an increase of at least 60 ms compared with the predrug baseline value… prompt action is indicated". ECG signs of risk "include an increase in QTc from predrug baseline of 60 ms, marked QTc interval prolongation > 500 ms", with additional features listed. For serial measurements, "a consistent method should be used (ie, same recording device, ECG lead, measurement tool [automated or manual], and heart rate-correction formula)". When impending signs develop, recommended actions are to "discontinue the offending drug, replace potassium, administer magnesium, consider temporary pacing… and transfer the patient to a hospital unit with the highest level of ECG monitoring surveillance where immediate defibrillation is available". Additionally, "Patients should not be transported from the unit… and they should be in a unit with the highest possible ECG monitoring surveillance".

### Why and how to implement sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium changes in food items and diets? [^116VqVT7]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

The present average sodium intakes, approximately 3000–4500 mg/day in various industrialised populations, are very high, that is, 2–3-fold in comparison with the current Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of 1500 mg. The sodium intakes markedly exceed even the level of 2500 mg, which has been recently given as the maximum level of daily intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects on blood pressure or otherwise. By contrast, the present average potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes are remarkably lower than the recommended intake levels (DRI). In USA, for example, the average intake of these mineral nutrients is only 35–50% of the recommended intakes. There is convincing evidence, which indicates that this imbalance, that is, the high intake of sodium on one hand and the low intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium on the other hand, produce and maintain elevated blood pressure in a big proportion of the population. Decreased intakes of sodium alone, and increased intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium each alone decrease elevated blood pressure. A combination of all these factors, that is, decrease of sodium, and increase of potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes, which are characteristic of the so-called Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets, has an excellent blood pressure lowering effect. For the prevention and basic treatment of elevated blood pressure, various methods to decrease the intake of sodium and to increase the intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be comprehensively applied in the communities. The so-called 'functional food/nutraceutical/food-ceutical' approach, which corrects the mineral nutrient composition of extensively used processed foods, is likely to be particularly effective in producing immediate beneficial effects. The European Union and various governments should promote the availability and use of such healthier food compositions by tax reductions and other policies, which make the healthier choices cheaper than the conventional ones. They should also introduce and promote the use of tempting nutrition and health claims on the packages of healthier food choices, which have an increased content of potassium, calcium, and/or magnesium and a lowered content of sodium. Such pricing and claim methods would help the consumers to choose healthier food alternatives, and make composition improvements tempting also for the food industry.

### Magnesium to prevent kidney disease-associated vascular calcification: crystal clear? [^11628vXY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypomagnesaemia is also common in dialysis patients. A relatively low dialysate Mg 2+ concentration of 0.5 mmol/L is most frequently used. In 34 Dutch haemodialysis patients, the mean plasma Mg 2+ concentration was 0.88 mmol/L prior to dialysis, which declined post-dialysis to a mean value of 0.78 mmol/L when the dialysate Mg 2+ was 0.5 mmol/L. The Mg 2+ concentration declined in most individuals. Obviously a dialysate concentration of 0.25 mmol/L Mg 2+ increases the risk for hypomagnesaemia even more. In CKD, blood Mg 2+ concentrations are further affected by the use of medication (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, thiazides and loop diuretics), the prescription of diets low in potassium (food products rich in potassium are generally also rich in Mg 2+) and the presence of diabetes. Monitoring and adjusting the blood Mg 2+ concentration in CKD patients might be relevant, as hypomagnesaemia is associated with progression to end-stage renal disease in diabetic nephropathy patients.

Bone serves as the body's Mg 2+ store. In total, 60% of the total body Mg 2+ is embedded at the surface of the hydroxyapatite crystals. In bone, Mg 2+ directly contributes to healthy bone growth. In animal models with Mg 2+ deficiency, hydroxyapatite crystals grow tighter and more brittle, resulting in less flexible bone that is more prone to fracture. Multiple studies suggest effects of Mg 2+ on bone cell function and fate. However, a consensus is lacking, as results have indicated that Mg 2+ both promotes and impairs osteoblastogenesis and osteoclastogenesis in different in vitro studies. A recent study showed that mild hypomagnesaemia is associated with a lower risk to bone fracture in late-stage CKD patients. However, too highly elevated blood Mg 2+ concentrations may compromise bone mineralization, as Mg 2+ is known to interfere with hydroxyapatite formation. Triggered by ageing and uraemia, bone abnormalities such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia and other mineralization defects are common in CKD. As such, properly maintaining Mg 2+ status may be important for the already compromised health of bones.

### Structural basis for ion selectivity revealed by high-resolution crystal structure of Mg2 + channel mgtE [^117Mu2R7]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Magnesium is the most abundant divalent cation in living cells and is crucial to several biological processes. MgtE is a Mg 2+ channel distributed in all domains of life that contributes to the maintenance of cellular Mg 2+ homeostasis. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structures of the transmembrane domain of MgtE, bound to Mg 2+, Mn 2+ and Ca 2+. The high-resolution Mg 2+ -bound crystal structure clearly visualized the hydrated Mg 2+ ion within its selectivity filter. Based on those structures and biochemical analyses, we propose a cation selectivity mechanism for MgtE in which the geometry of the hydration shell of the fully hydrated Mg 2+ ion is recognized by the side-chain carboxylate groups in the selectivity filter. This is in contrast to the K + -selective filter of KcsA, which recognizes a dehydrated K + ion. Our results further revealed a cation-binding site on the periplasmic side, which regulate channel opening and prevents conduction of near-cognate cations.

### Trace minerals in patients with end-stage renal disease [^113SQNT8]. Seminars in Dialysis (2010). Low credibility.

The kidneys are famously responsible for maintaining external balance of prevalent minerals, such as sodium, chloride, and potassium. The kidney's role in handling trace minerals is more obscure to most nephrologists. Similarly, the impact of kidney failure on trace mineral metabolism is difficult to anticipate. The associated dietary modifications and dialysis create the potential for trace mineral deficiencies and intoxications. Indeed, there are numerous reports of dialysis-associated mishaps causing mineral intoxication, notable for the challenge of assigning causation. Equally challenging has been the recognition of mineral deficiency syndromes, amid what is often a cacophony of multiple comorbidities that vie for the attention of clinicians who care for patients with chronic kidney disease. In this paper, I review a variety of minerals, some of which are required for maintenance of normal human physiology (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's list of essential minerals), and some that have attracted attention in the care of dialysis patients. For each mineral, I will discuss its role in normal physiology and will review reported deficiency and toxicity states. I will point out the interesting inter-relationships between several of the elements. Finally, I will address the special concerns of aluminum and magnesium as they pertain to the dialysis population.

Consequences of magnesium deficiency

Hypertension

'Magnesium status has a direct effect upon the relaxation capability of vascular smooth muscle cells and the regulation of the cellular placement of other cations important to blood pressure - cellular sodium:potassium (Na:K) ratio and intracellular calcium (iCa(2+)). As a result, nutritional magnesium has both direct and indirect impacts on the regulation of blood pressure and therefore on the occurrence of hypertension'.

It must be remembered that there is magnesium-ATP-driven sodium-potassium pump and calcium pump. Magnesium deficiency leads to dysfunction of the Na-K-ATPase depleting intracellular K and increasing intracellular sodium and calcium in cardiac and smooth muscle cells. This can cause vasoconstriction of venous smooth muscles and arteries causing hypertension. Magnesium deficiency may also predispose to an increased response to vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and catecholamines.

Many patients with hypertension are treated with thiazide and loop diuretics, both of which deplete the body of magnesium, and giving patients with hypertension who are receiving long-term thiazide diuretics oral magnesium supplementation significantly reduces blood pressure. In fact, the high intracellular calcium induced by magnesium deficiency may induce both insulin resistance and hypertension. A meta-analysis of randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in normotensive and hypertensive adults found that 368 mg/day of magnesium for a median of 3 months significantly reduces systolic blood pressure by 2.00 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 1.78 mm Hg. In fact, a meta-analysis of seven studies encompassing 135 patients with hypertension on antihypertensive medications with a mean starting blood pressure > 155 mm Hg found that magnesium supplementation reduced blood pressure by −18.7/–10.9 mm Hg. Another meta-analysis of 22 trials using a mean dose of 410 mg of magnesium found a significant reduction in systolic (3–4 mm Hg) and diastolic (2–3 mm Hg) blood pressure. The effect on blood pressure was greater when magnesium doses > 370 mg/day were used.

Low magnesium levels can promote endothelial cell dysfunction, potentially increasing the risk of thrombosis and atherosclerosis. Magnesium deficiency also promotes a proatherogenic phenotype in endothelial cells. Hypomagnesaemia can impair the release of nitric oxide from the coronary endothelium, while magnesium therapy can improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with coronary artery disease. Since nitric oxide is both a vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, this makes magnesium supplementation a promising therapy in the treatment of hypertension and coronary artery disease. Indeed, magnesium therapy may enhance prostacyclin release from the vascular wall.

### Potassium chloride, dextrose monohydrate (potassium chloride) [^1173UaL5]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.6 Fluid Overload

Depending on the volume and rate of infusion, the patient's underlying clinical condition and capability to metabolize dextrose, intravenous administration of Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema.

Avoid Potassium Chloride in 5% Dextrose Injection in patients with or at risk for fluid and/or solute overloading. If use cannot be avoided, monitor fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance as needed and especially during prolonged use.

5.7 Refeeding Syndrome

Refeeding severely undernourished patients may result in the refeeding syndrome that is characterized by the shift of potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium intracellularly as the patient becomes anabolic. Thiamine deficiency and fluid retention may also develop. To prevent these complications, monitor severely undernourished patients and slowly increasing nutrient intake.

### Mechanism of magnesium activation of calcium-activated potassium channels [^115gmd6v]. Nature (2002). Excellent credibility.

Large-conductance (BK type) Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels are essential for modulating muscle contraction and neuronal activities such as synaptic transmission and hearing. BK channels are activated by membrane depolarization and intracellular Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) (refs 6–10). The energy provided by voltage, Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) binding are additive in activating the channel, suggesting that these signals open the activation gate through independent pathways. Here we report a molecular investigation of a Mg(2+)-dependent activation mechanism. Using a combined site-directed mutagenesis and structural analysis, we demonstrate that a structurally new Mg(2+)-binding site in the RCK/Rossman fold domain — an intracellular structural motif that immediately follows the activation gate S6 helix — is responsible for Mg(2+)-dependent activation. Mutations that impair or abolish Mg(2+) sensitivity do not affect Ca(2+) sensitivity, and vice versa. These results indicate distinct structural pathways for Mg(2+)- and Ca(2+)-dependent activation and suggest a possible mechanism for the coupling between Mg(2+) binding and channel opening.

### ASPEN consensus recommendations for refeeding syndrome [^112fayVP]. Nutrition in Clinical Practice (2020). High credibility.

ASPEN consensus — electrolyte management during refeeding in at-risk adults — advises to "Check serum potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus before initiation of nutrition" and to "Monitor every 12 hours for the first 3 days in high-risk patients. May be more frequent based on clinical picture". It directs to "Replete low electrolytes based on established standards of care" and notes "No recommendation can be made for whether prophylactic dosing of electrolytes should be given if prefeeding levels are normal". If electrolytes "become difficult to correct or drop precipitously during the initiation of nutrition", it advises to "decrease calories/grams of dextrose by 50% and advance the dextrose/calories by approximately 33% of goal every 1–2 days based on clinical presentation", with the caveat that "cessation of nutrition support may be necessary when electrolyte levels are severely and/or life-threateningly low or dropping precipitously".
