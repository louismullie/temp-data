## Question

Can intravenous iron cure psoriatic arthritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether intravenous iron can cure psoriatic arthritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology and standard of care for psoriatic arthritis. Then, I should review the indications and mechanisms of intravenous iron therapy. Next, I will look for any direct clinical evidence linking IV iron to PsA outcomes. After that, I will consider indirect effects of correcting anemia on symptoms and disease activity. Finally, I will evaluate safety considerations and synthesize a conclusion with practical guidance [^111TVJJ9] [^115DLfwi].

> Let me first confirm the disease framework. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic, systemic immune-mediated inflammatory disease driven by dysregulated pathways such as IL-23/IL-17 and TNF, presenting across domains including peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, axial disease, and skin and nail involvement, and the therapeutic goal is remission or low disease activity rather than cure because no curative therapy exists for psoriatic disease [^117EdLDx] [^1119bSpp] [^116CkQQs].

> I need to check what IV iron is actually for. Intravenous iron is a hematinic used to correct iron deficiency anemia when oral iron is ineffective, poorly tolerated, or malabsorbed, and while it bypasses hepcidin-mediated gut blockade in inflammatory states, it is not an anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune diseases per se [^115DLfwi] [^114pzJko] [^111NSNPR].

> Next, I should review whether any guideline or trial supports IV iron as a PsA treatment. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify guideline-recommended PsA therapies first. Contemporary recommendations direct csDMARDs followed by biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs tailored to domains and severity, with options including TNF inhibitors, IL-17/IL-23 pathway inhibitors, JAK inhibitors, and CTLA-4Ig, none of which include iron therapy as disease-modifying treatment for PsA [^111TVJJ9] [^1123yynN] [^117LaPjv] [^114hvywP]. Let me also ensure I separate "intravenous" biologics from "intravenous iron"; effective IV agents for PsA include infliximab, IV golimumab, and IV abatacept, and model-informed bridging has supported an IV secukinumab regimen, but these are immunotherapies targeting pathogenic cytokine or co-stimulatory pathways, not iron replacement [^112Lb7hd] [^113tUj9c] [^117FafLR] [^115SMMs5].

> Now, I will examine whether there is direct evidence that IV iron modifies PsA. I should double-check the provided materials for trials of IV iron in PsA. I find no clinical trials or guideline endorsements evaluating IV iron to treat joint, enthesitis, dactylitis, axial, or skin domains of PsA, whereas multiple trials and labels support IV biologics for PsA, reinforcing that "intravenous" in PsA literature refers to biologic DMARDs rather than iron supplementation [^111WAH6p] [^112Lb7hd] [^113tUj9c] [^117FafLR]. Therefore, I should conclude there is no evidence base that IV iron treats the underlying immune drivers or halts structural progression in PsA [^111TVJJ9] [^1123yynN].

> Wait, let me verify a potential safety inference from an IV iron trial exclusion. One IBD anemia study excluded participants with rheumatoid arthritis with active joint inflammation, and my first thought is to interpret this as a safety signal for inflammatory arthritis, but hold on, I should verify whether that exclusion was for internal validity rather than proven harm in arthritis populations [^116AY8gc]. On reconsideration, that exclusion likely reduces confounding and standardizes the cohort, although regulatory safety communications do note rare but serious hypersensitivity with parenteral iron and highlight increased hypersensitivity risk in immune or inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, which suggests caution in analogous autoimmune settings such as PsA [^116rxGHx].

> Let me consider indirect effects. Correcting iron deficiency anemia can improve fatigue and vitality and may secondarily make inflammatory symptoms feel more manageable, and in RA, erythropoiesis-stimulating therapy plus IV iron improved hemoglobin and some clinical measures, but that does not prove IV iron directly suppresses synovitis in PsA, and the dominant pattern in spondyloarthritis is that controlling inflammation with biologics improves anemia rather than the other way around [^111aA4tD] [^112zcmwf]. I should confirm that these observations do not equate to disease modification of PsA by iron, which they do not [^111TVJJ9].

> I need to ensure I address safety pragmatically for PsA patients who are often on immunosuppressants. IV iron is generally effective for IDA but carries risks including rare anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity, potential hypophosphatemia with certain formulations like ferric carboxymaltose, and a small but measurable increase in infections across heterogeneous populations, so in immunomodulated PsA patients, these risks warrant deliberation and mitigation when IV iron is chosen for bona fide IDA [^116rxGHx] [^116A9uZu] [^111NSNPR].

> Synthesizing this, I should be clear and precise. No, intravenous iron does not cure psoriatic arthritis and is not indicated as a disease-modifying treatment for PsA; PsA management should follow guideline-directed immunomodulation to achieve remission or low disease activity, while IV iron should only be used for confirmed iron deficiency anemia when oral iron is unsuitable or ineffective [^111TVJJ9] [^1119bSpp] [^115DLfwi].

> Practically, if a person with PsA has suspected anemia, I will now examine iron studies to confirm iron deficiency, initiate oral iron with dose and absorption optimization when feasible, and reserve IV iron for intolerance, malabsorption, or need for rapid repletion, while concurrently optimizing PsA therapy with approved csDMARDs or biologic/targeted synthetic DMARDs per domain and severity; if an IV route is preferred for PsA control, that means selecting an appropriate IV biologic such as infliximab, IV golimumab, IV abatacept, or an FDA-accepted IV secukinumab regimen, not IV iron [^115DLfwi] [^112Lb7hd] [^113tUj9c] [^115SMMs5].

Intravenous iron **does not cure** psoriatic arthritis (PsA) [^116CkQQs]. PsA is a chronic immune-mediated disease driven by the IL-23/IL-17 and TNF pathways [^117EdLDx], which iron therapy does not target [^114pzJko]. Intravenous iron is used **only to correct iron-deficiency anemia** [^114pzJko] in patients with PsA, not to treat or cure the underlying arthritis [^115DLfwi]. Effective PsA management requires DMARDs or biologics [^111TVJJ9] to control inflammation and prevent joint damage [^1123yynN]. There is **no evidence** that intravenous iron improves PsA disease activity, and it should not be used as primary or adjunctive therapy for PsA [^111TVJJ9].

---

## Pathophysiology of psoriatic arthritis

PsA is a **chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder** characterized by immune dysregulation [^117EdLDx], particularly involving the IL-23/IL-17 axis and TNF-alpha pathways [^112eVFG8]. It manifests as joint inflammation, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin lesions, leading to progressive joint damage and disability if untreated [^111TVJJ9]. This reflects complex interactions among genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and immune cell activation, resulting in chronic inflammation and tissue damage [^117EdLDx].

---

## Role of intravenous iron in psoriatic arthritis

Intravenous iron therapy is **primarily indicated to treat iron-deficiency anemia** [^1115TFDF], a common comorbidity in chronic inflammatory conditions, including PsA [^114pzJko]. In PsA, anemia may result from chronic inflammation, gastrointestinal blood loss, or impaired iron absorption. Intravenous iron effectively replenishes iron stores [^1115TFDF], increases hemoglobin levels [^111NSNPR], and improves fatigue and quality of life in patients with anemia. However, it **does not address the underlying immune-mediated inflammation** characteristic of PsA [^117EdLDx]. Because PsA pathogenesis involves complex immune pathways — including cytokine dysregulation and immune cell activation — that are not influenced by iron supplementation, intravenous iron has no direct therapeutic effect on PsA disease activity or progression [^111TVJJ9].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding intravenous iron and psoriatic arthritis

Currently, there is **no clinical evidence** that intravenous iron therapy has any therapeutic effect on PsA disease activity, inflammation, or joint damage [^1123yynN]. It is not included in clinical guidelines or recommendations for PsA treatment [^111TVJJ9]. Its role in patients with PsA is limited to managing iron-deficiency anemia, not the underlying inflammatory disease [^115DLfwi].

---

## Recommended treatments for psoriatic arthritis

PsA management combines pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions to control inflammation, prevent joint damage, and improve quality of life [^1119bSpp]. Current clinical guidelines **recommend the following**:

- **Conventional synthetic DMARDs**: Methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide are recommended as first-line treatments, particularly in patients with polyarthritis or significant skin involvement [^111TVJJ9].

- **Biologic DMARDs**: TNF inhibitors (e.g. infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab) [^112Lb7hd], IL-17 inhibitors (e.g. secukinumab, ixekizumab), and IL-12/23 inhibitors (e.g. ustekinumab) are recommended for patients with inadequate response to conventional DMARDs or severe disease manifestations [^1123yynN] [^114hvywP].

- **Targeted synthetic DMARDs**: Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (e.g. upadacitinib) [^11235kNf] are recommended for patients with inadequate response to biologic therapies or specific disease phenotypes [^114hvywP].

- **Non-pharmacological interventions**: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and lifestyle modifications are essential components of comprehensive PsA management.

---

## Safety considerations of intravenous iron therapy

Intravenous iron therapy is generally well tolerated, but it carries **potential risks and side effects**, including [^114pzJko]:

- **Hypersensitivity reactions**: Rare but potentially severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis [^116rxGHx], particularly with certain iron formulations [^111NSNPR].

- **Infection risk**: Increased risk of infections due to transient immune modulation and oxidative stress [^114pzJko] associated with iron administration [^111NSNPR].

- **Hypophosphatemia**: Particularly associated with ferric carboxymaltose, potentially leading to bone metabolism disturbances [^116A9uZu].

- **Infusion reactions**: Mild to moderate infusion reactions, including flu-like symptoms, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^111NSNPR].

---

## Conclusion

Intravenous iron therapy **does not cure psoriatic arthritis** [^116CkQQs]. It is used primarily to manage iron-deficiency anemia in patients with PsA [^114pzJko] and does not address the disease's immune-mediated inflammation. Current clinical guidelines do not recommend intravenous iron for PsA treatment [^111TVJJ9]. Effective management requires DMARDs, biologic therapies, and targeted synthetic agents [^114hvywP] to control inflammation, prevent joint damage, and improve patient outcomes.

### Psoriasis: Immunopathogenesis and evolving immunomodulators and systemic therapies; U.S. experiences [^112eVFG8]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that currently lacks a permanent cure. Up to 40% of patients with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis. The main systemic treatments for psoriasis include methotrexate, cyclosporin, and oral retinoids, all of which have significant potential for toxicity and require close laboratory supervision. Although the exact mechanism of psoriasis remains unclear, the involvement of T-cell-mediated cytokine expression in its etiology is becoming more evident. Modern treatment aims to target these immune responses, leading to psoriatic plaque and arthritis formation, through selective immunomodulating pharmacotherapy. The advantages of these biological agents include less toxic systemic side-effect profiles, which improve the quality of life for patients with psoriasis.

- **Objectives**: This review article describes emerging selective immunotherapies and systemic therapies for the treatment of psoriasis and briefly discusses disease immunopathogenesis.

- **Methods**: Literature review.

- **Results and Conclusions**: Given the role of inflammatory immune responses in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, modern medicine and pharmacotherapy aim to design and use specific targets in cell-mediated immune reactions and modulate the expression of various inflammatory cytokines. The clinical evidence of efficacy for some of these new biological immunomodulatory agents, based on several U.S.-based research studies and clinical experiences, is convincing.

### Psoriatic arthritis: state of the art review [^117EdLDx]. Clinical Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on psoriatic arthritis:

- **Definition**: PsA is a chronic, systemic inflammatory disorder that occurs in patients with psoriasis and is associated with multiple musculoskeletal manifestations.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathogenesis of PsA is multifactorial and involves polygenic inheritance, environmental factors, and patient-specific risk factors, including obesity. These various factors initiate an auto-inflammatory loop with amplification of the IL-23/IL-17 pathway that leads to a diverse array of associated pathologies at distant body sites.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the prevalence of PsA is estimated at 50–250 persons per 100,000 population. PsA is prevalent in 6–41% of patients with psoriasis.

- **Disease course**: Key clinical manifestations include arthritis, enthesitis, spondylitis, nail disease, dactylitis, and uveitis. Five disease phenotypes have been described. The oligoarticular subtype affects ≤ 4 joints and typically occurs in an asymmetric distribution. The polyarticular subtype affects ≥ 5 joints; the involvement may be symmetric and resemble rheumatoid arthritis. The distal subtype affects distal interphalangeal joints of the hands, feet, or both. The axial or spondyloarthritis subtype primarily involves the spine and sacroiliac joints. Finally, a subtype known as arthritis mutilans is characterized by deforming and destructive arthritis that involves marked bone resorption or osteolysis, with telescoping and flail digits.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Articular damage develops in a large number of patients.

- **Dosage in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis**: The Simponi Aria dosage regimen is 2 mg per kg, given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Follow the dilution and administration instructions for Simponi Aria [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Simponi Aria should be given in combination with methotrexate. The efficacy and safety of switching between intravenous and subcutaneous formulations and routes of administration have not been established.

- **Dosage in pediatric patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis**: The Simponi Aria dosage regimen, based on body surface area (BSA), is 80 mg/m² given as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes at weeks 0 and 4, and every 8 weeks thereafter. Follow the dilution and administration instructions for Simponi Aria [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

- **Evaluation for tuberculosis and hepatitis B prior to dosage**: Prior to initiating Simponi Aria and periodically during therapy, evaluate patients for active tuberculosis and test for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Prior to initiating Simponi Aria, test patients for hepatitis B viral infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Remicade [^111xcHo7]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

- **Adverse reactions in adults**: The data described herein reflect exposure to Remicade in 4,779 adult patients (1,304 patients with RA, 1,106 patients with CD, 202 with AS, 293 with PsA, 484 with UC, 1,373 with Ps, and 17 patients with other conditions), including 2,625 patients exposed beyond 30 weeks and 374 exposed beyond 1 year. One of the most common reasons for discontinuation of treatment was infusion-related reactions (e.g. dyspnea, flushing, headache, and rash). For information on adverse reactions in pediatric patients, see Adverse Reactions.

### Renflexis [^112txEog]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

For the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, the recommended dose of Renflexis is 5 mg/kg, administered as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks. Renflexis can be used with or without methotrexate.

For chronic severe plaque psoriasis, the recommended dose of Renflexis is similar: 5 mg/kg administered intravenously at 0, 2, and 6 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose every 8 weeks.

Prior to initiating therapy with Renflexis and periodically during treatment, patients should be evaluated for active tuberculosis and tested for latent infections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Infusion reactions**: Adverse effects during administration of infliximab products have included flu-like symptoms, headache, dyspnea, hypotension, transient fever, chills, gastrointestinal symptoms, and skin rashes. Anaphylaxis might occur at any time during Renflexis infusion. Approximately 20% of patients in all clinical trials of infliximab experienced an infusion reaction compared with 10% of placebo-treated patients [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Prior to infusion with Renflexis, premedication may be administered at the physician's discretion. Premedication could include antihistamines (anti-H1 and/or anti-H2), acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids.

During infusion, mild to moderate infusion reactions may improve following the slowing or suspension of the infusion process.

### Recent advances in the management of psoriatic arthritis [^1163pF4y]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

The incidence of psoriatic arthritis is currently estimated at 7 to 42% of the population with active psoriasis, which is considered to affect 2 to 3% of the general population. Unmanaged psoriatic arthritis may result in progressive radiologic erosion, severe physical limitations, and disability. Newer trials in psoriatic arthritis therapy demonstrate the ongoing ability to control disease symptoms and signs, as well as significantly slow disease progression.

- **Recent findings**: Recognition of the immunopathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis, similar to rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, has prompted ongoing examination of the efficacy of several disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. A new generation of biologics and pharmaceuticals, with increased molecular specificity compared to traditional immunosuppressant disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, has been shown to be highly effective in inhibiting the symptoms and progression of psoriatic arthritis with fewer severe side effects.

- **Summary**: Therapies either recently approved or pending approval by the Food and Drug Administration for psoriatic arthritis management are safe and effective in treating symptoms. They significantly improve quality of life and prevent long-term progression of the disease.

### Psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis: Role of patient advocacy organisations in the twenty first century [^1161oSuL]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

All psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis patient advocacy organisations are devoted to promoting public awareness and patient education. They support access to effective treatments and physicians committed to the welfare of patients. Furthermore, they work with physicians and other organisations to facilitate the development of new treatments and support research for more effective treatments and a cure for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. These organisations participated in the remaking of health politics in the late twentieth century, an era in which small patient support and advocacy groups were transformed into sophisticated national health organisations integral to the formation of national health policy and research, treatment, and education funding by working with physicians, legislators, pharmaceutical companies, third-party payors, and the media.

As we enter the twenty-first century, some of these groups have conducted critical surveys of patients and physicians to discern needs, redirect their programming, and reshape directions in the field. Many national leagues have united to form international organisations. Although differences in national healthcare systems, the age of their organisations, and the diseases they cover are reflected in the focus of their individual activities, much unites them. Regardless of their size, as their roles have come to be recognised in the healthcare community, patient advocacy organisations welcome being invited to the decision-making table. This report describes a sampling of these organisations.

### Remicade [^117RAm7v]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

During the placebo-controlled portion across the three clinical trials up to Week 16, the proportion of patients who experienced at least one serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined as resulting in death, life-threatening conditions, requiring hospitalization, or resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg Remicade group, 1.9% in the placebo group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg Remicade group.

Among patients in the two Phase 3 studies:

- **In Study I**: 12.4% of patients receiving Remicade 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through one year of maintenance treatment experienced at least one SAE.
- **In Study II**: 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving Remicade 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks respectively, through one year of maintenance treatment, experienced at least one SAE.

One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg Remicade. Serious infections included sepsis and abscesses.

- **In Study I**: 2.7% of patients receiving Remicade 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through one year of maintenance treatment experienced at least one serious infection.
- **In Study II**: 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving Remicade 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through one year of treatment experienced at least one serious infection.

The most common serious infection, requiring hospitalization, was an abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal), reported by 0.7% of patients in the 5 mg/kg Remicade group. Two active cases of tuberculosis were reported, one 6 weeks and one 34 weeks after starting Remicade.

### Persistence and effectiveness of nonbiologic systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe psoriasis in adults: A systematic review [^1118oYkt]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The initial search produced 656 articles, with 411 remaining after deduplication (n = 245). After excluding 335 articles by title screening, 76 abstracts remained. Fifty-seven articles were excluded by abstract. Two additional articles were found through hand searching the reference lists of the included studies, with 21 articles read in full and assessed for eligibility. Of the 13 articles next excluded, three studies were removed by title or abstract due to having a cohort of fewer than 100 patients, and 10 articles were excluded for ineligibility. No studies were excluded based on outcome definition alone. The remaining eight articles were included in the systematic review.

- **Figure 1**: Flowchart of the article selection. Studies were identified by searching Embase, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library, then filtered according to title, abstract, and eligibility. Additional articles were identified by manually searching reference lists.

### Safety of intravenous iron use in chronic kidney disease [^116A9uZu]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2016). Low credibility.

Other unwanted effects of intravenous iron. Intravenous irons differ in their capability to induce medically significant hypophosphatemia. This has been reported most often with ferric carboxymaltose, arguing against a class effect; the mechanism is substance-specific via an increase in fibroblast growth factor 23. This area requires further study to clarify the significance of these variable effects of intravenous iron preparations.

### A randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study of intravenous iron isomaltoside 1,000 (Monofer) compared with oral iron for treatment of anemia in IBD (PROCEED) [^116AY8gc]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The study took place at 36 sites, including hospitals and private IBD clinics, distributed across several countries: 4 sites in Austria, 1 site in the United Kingdom, 5 sites each in Denmark and Hungary, and 21 sites in India.

Patients eligible to participate were those aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with IBD. They needed to have a score of ≤ 5 on the Harvey–Bradshaw index for Crohn's disease or a partial Mayo score of ≤ 6 for ulcerative colitis. Hemoglobin (Hb) levels had to be < 12 g/dl (7.45 mmol/l) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) < 20%. Participants were required to provide written informed consent.

Exclusion criteria included:

- **Iron-related conditions**: Intolerance to oral iron treatment, hypersensitivity to IV iron complexes or iron sulfate
- **Specific medical conditions**: Hemochromatosis, hemosiderosis, active intestinal tuberculosis/amoebic infections, liver cirrhosis, active hepatitis, acute infections, rheumatoid arthritis with symptoms or signs of active joint inflammation, untreated vitamin B12/folate deficiency
- **Reproductive and surgical factors**: Pregnancy, nursing, extensive active bleeding necessitating blood transfusion, planned elective surgery during the study
- **Recent treatments and study participation**: Participation in any other clinical study within the last 3 months, any other IV or oral iron treatment within 4 weeks, blood transfusion within 4 weeks, erythropoietin within 8 weeks before screening
- **Other considerations**: Other primary causes of anemia, a history of multiple allergies

Any other medical condition that, in the investigator's opinion, could have caused the patient to be unsuitable for the study or placed the patient at potential risk from participation also led to exclusion.

### Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for anemia in rheumatoid arthritis [^112hZurk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic and systemic inflammatory disorder that mainly affects the small joints of the hands and feet. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents have been used to treat anemia, one of the extra-articular manifestations of RA. Although anemia is less of a problem now because of the reduction in inflammation due to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), it could still be an issue in countries where DMARDs are not yet accessible.

- **Objectives**: We assessed the clinical benefits and harms of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents for anemia in rheumatoid arthritis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 7, 2012), Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (1948 to 7 August 2012), OVID EMBASE (1980 to 7 August 2012), LILACS (1982 to 7 August 2012), the Clinical Trials Search Portal of the World Health Organization, and reference lists of the retrieved publications and review articles. We did not apply any language restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients aged 16 years or over, with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis affected by anemia. We considered health-related quality of life, fatigue, and safety as the primary outcomes.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently performed trial selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. We estimated the difference in means with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous outcomes. We estimated risk ratios with 95% CIs.

### Solu-Cortef [^116j7yCV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When oral therapy is not feasible, and the strength, dosage form, and route of administration of the drug reasonably lend the preparation to the treatment of the condition, the intravenous or intramuscular use of Solu-Cortef sterile powder is indicated as follows:

- **Allergic states**: Control of severe or incapacitating allergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness, and transfusion reactions.

- **Dermatologic diseases**: Bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, exfoliative erythroderma, mycosis fungoides, pemphigus, severe erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

- **Endocrine disorders**: Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocortisone or cortisone is the drug of choice; synthetic analogs may be used in conjunction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy, mineralocorticoid supplementation is of particular importance), congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercalcemia associated with cancer, and nonsuppurative thyroiditis.

- **Gastrointestinal diseases**: To tide the patient over a critical period of the disease in regional enteritis (systemic therapy) and ulcerative colitis.

- **Hematologic disorders**: Acquired (autoimmune) hemolytic anemia, congenital (erythroid) hypoplastic anemia (Diamond-Blackfan anemia), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in adults (intravenous administration only; intramuscular administration is contraindicated), pure red cell aplasia, and select cases of secondary thrombocytopenia.

### Model-informed drug development-based bridging from subcutaneous to intravenous secukinumab dosing: Approval in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis [^115SMMs5]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this modeling and simulation analysis was to determine an intravenous (IV) secukinumab dosing regimen with steady-state exposure within the ranges of the approved subcutaneous (SC) regimens (300 and 150 mg every 4 weeks [q4w]) and to predict the efficacy and safety of this IV regimen for patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) or axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). This approach was suggested by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following review of the primary endpoint analysis results of secukinumab 3 mg/kg q4w IV in patients with PsA (INVIGORATE-2 study).

Noting the higher exposure of the investigated IV regimen compared to the approved SC regimens, the FDA considered that the INVIGORATE-2 data available through Week 16 only may not convey sufficient safety information to support the benefit-risk assessment of this IV regimen. A population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analysis was conducted on a pool of 15 PsA or axSpA clinical trials to identify 1.75 mg/kg IV secukinumab q4w (with or without a 6 mg/kg IV loading dose at Week 0) as a regimen with steady-state exposure within the ranges of the approved SC regimens.

This entitled its efficacy and safety to be assessed by full extrapolation from those of the approved SC regimens. This extrapolation was substantiated by the use of exposure-response analyses to predict the efficacy and safety of the IV regimen. Based on those analyses, this IV secukinumab regimen, not tested in clinical trials, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with PsA and axSpA.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) can be characterized by peripheral arthritis, axial arthritis/spondylitis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail psoriasis. The introduction of anti–tumor necrosis factor (anti‐TNF) therapies greatly improved clinical, radiographic, and quality‐of‐life outcomes for patients with moderate‐to‐severe PsA compared with earlier conventional therapies. Treatment recommendations for PsA generally advise treatment with biologic therapies, including anti‐TNF agents, for patients with active disease despite conventional therapy, such as disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

In the GO‐REVEAL trial, patients with PsA had significantly greater improvements in the signs and symptoms of PsA compared with placebo when treated with subcutaneous (SC) golimumab. Of note, golimumab is available as both SC and intravenous (IV) formulations. SC golimumab is approved for adults with PsA, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and ankylosing spondylitis. IV golimumab is currently approved for patients with RA in a number of countries worldwide. In the Multinational Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Survey, 26% of patients who had received biologic therapy expressed that they had experienced fear, anxiety, or inconvenience related to SC injections. Given the various biologic therapies available for patients with moderate‐to‐severe PsA, patient preference regarding mode and frequency of administration is an important factor to consider as part of shared decision-making when designing treatment plans.

Anemia

In placebo-controlled trials (RA-III, RA-IV, and RA-V) with background DMARDs for up to 12 or 14 weeks, hemoglobin decreases below 8 g/dL in at least one measurement occurred in less than 0.1% of patients in both the Rinvoq 15 mg and placebo groups. In RA-III and RA-V trials, hemoglobin decreases below 8 g/dL in at least one measurement were observed in 0.3% of patients treated with placebo, while no decreases were observed in patients treated with Rinvoq 15 mg and upadacitinib 30 mg.

- **Adverse reactions in patients with psoriatic arthritis**: A total of 1,827 adult patients with psoriatic arthritis were treated with Rinvoq 15 mg or upadacitinib 30 mg tablets once daily in clinical trials, representing 1,639.2 patient-years of exposure. Among these, 722 patients were exposed to upadacitinib for at least one year. In the two Phase 3 trials, 907 patients received at least one dose of Rinvoq 15 mg, with 359 of them being exposed for at least one year.

Two placebo-controlled trials were integrated to evaluate the safety of Rinvoq 15 mg in comparison to placebo. These trials included 640 patients on Rinvoq 15 mg once daily and 635 patients on placebo and assessed safety for up to 24 weeks after treatment initiation.

### Iron deficiency across chronic inflammatory conditions: International expert opinion on definition, diagnosis, and management [^1115TFDF]. American Journal of Hematology (2017). Low credibility.

The alternative solution, IV iron treatment, can deliver a larger iron supply, effectively replenishing iron stores more rapidly than oral iron and, due to the route of administration, bypass the risk of GI side effects. Many guidelines acknowledge the benefits of IV iron preparations as a valuable option for patients with chronic inflammatory diseases who lack a response to, are non-compliant with, or are intolerant of oral iron treatment. In addition, it is suitable for those who have severe iron deficiency and require rapid replenishment of available iron and Hb levels.

However, multiple IV iron preparations are available with varying dosing, infusion times, and efficacy and safety profiles. While some products have limited data published demonstrating their benefit-to-risk profile, other IV iron preparations, such as ferric carboxymaltose, have a wealth of clinical evidence. This includes studies in all three chronic inflammatory conditions within the scope of this review. There is a growing evidence base supporting its effectiveness and good tolerability across patient groups.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of iron deficiency anemia: Expert review [^115DLfwi]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Low credibility.

In this Clinical Practice Update (CPU), we will provide Best Practice Advice (BPA) guidance on the appropriate management of iron deficiency anemia.

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Since systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations.

- **Best practice advice 1**: No single formulation of oral iron has any advantages over any other. Ferrous sulfate is preferred as the least expensive iron formulation.
- **Best practice advice 2**: Give oral iron once a day at most. Every-other-day iron dosing may be better tolerated for some patients with similar or equal rates of iron absorption as daily dosing.
- **Best practice advice 3**: Add vitamin C to oral iron supplementation to improve absorption.
- **Best practice advice 4**: Intravenous iron should be used if the patient does not tolerate oral iron, ferritin levels do not improve with a trial of oral iron, or the patient has a condition in which oral iron is not likely to be absorbed.

### Avsola [^114dKQwt]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

During the placebo-controlled portion across the three clinical trials up to Week 16, the proportion of patients who experienced at least one serious adverse reaction (SAE; defined as resulting in death, life-threatening, requires hospitalization, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity) was 0.5% in the 3 mg/kg infliximab group, 1.9% in the placebo group, and 1.6% in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group.

Among patients in the two Phase 3 studies:

- **Infliximab treatments**:
	- 12.4% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment in Study I experienced at least one SAE. In Study II, 4.1% and 4.7% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively, through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least one SAE.

- **Serious infections**:
	- One death due to bacterial sepsis occurred 25 days after the second infusion of 5 mg/kg infliximab. Serious infections included sepsis and abscesses. In Study I, 2.7% of patients receiving infliximab 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks through 1 year of maintenance treatment experienced at least one serious infection. In Study II, 1.0% and 1.3% of patients receiving infliximab 3 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively, through 1 year of treatment experienced at least one serious infection.

	- The most common serious infection (requiring hospitalization) was abscess (skin, throat, and peri-rectal) reported by 5 (0.7%) patients in the 5 mg/kg infliximab group. Two active cases of tuberculosis were reported: 6 weeks and 34 weeks after starting infliximab.

### Safety and efficacy of intravenous golimumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis: Results through week twenty-four of the GO-VIBRANT study [^112auzu5]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The activity of peripheral arthritis was primarily evaluated using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for improvement in RA. Physical function was evaluated using the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (HAQ DI). Enthesitis was assessed with the Leeds Enthesitis Index, which was developed for patients with PsA and evaluates the presence or absence of tenderness in the following entheses (left and right): lateral elbow epicondyle, medial femoral condyle, and Achilles tendon insertion. The presence and severity of dactylitis were assessed in both hands and feet using a scoring system from 0 to 3 (0 = no dactylitis, 1 = mild dactylitis, 2 = moderate dactylitis, and 3 = severe dactylitis).

For patients with investigator-assessed spondylitis with peripheral arthritis of PsA (n = 118), spondylitis was also assessed using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI). Skin response was evaluated using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), which ranges from 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating more severe disease, among patients with ≥ 3% body surface area involvement at baseline.

Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated using the Short Form 36 health survey (SF-36) physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores. Minimal disease activity (MDA) was also evaluated as a composite measure, with patients classified as achieving MDA if they met 5 of the following 7 criteria: tender joint count ≤ 1; swollen joint count ≤ 1; PASI ≤ 1 or body surface area involvement ≤ 3…

### Model-informed drug development-based bridging from subcutaneous to intravenous secukinumab dosing: Approval in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis [^112QZ3QE]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

Study highlights:

- **What is the knowledge on the topic**: Secukinumab has been studied in PsA, AS, and nr-axSpA with intravenous and subcutaneous formulations but was only approved with two subcutaneous regimens.

- **What question did this study address**: Can a model-informed drug development (MIDD) approach be used to leverage the existing secukinumab clinical database to determine an intravenous regimen of secukinumab with similar efficacy and safety as the two approved subcutaneous regimens, thereby supporting its registration without the need for any phase III study utilizing this intravenous regimen?

- **What does this study add to our knowledge**: Based on modeling, intravenous secukinumab (1.75 mg/kg q4w with or without a loading dose) was estimated to have similar pharmacokinetic properties along with similar safety and efficacy profiles as the two approved subcutaneous secukinumab regimens for patients with PsA, AS, and nr-axSpA. The US FDA approved the use of this intravenous regimen in those indications.

- **How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science**: This analysis highlights the value of MIDD approaches for evaluating alternative dosing regimens without the need for additional clinical trials.

### Challenges and opportunities in psoriatic disease: An integrated view of the future [^116CkQQs]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Psoriatic disease (PsD), which includes cutaneous psoriasis (PsO) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), affects 2% of the global population. It results in the development of comorbidities that adversely affect quality of life (QOL) and physical function. Recent advances have allowed for earlier diagnosis of PsD and improved clinical strategies for care, including the use of innovative pathway-specific immune-targeted therapies. Despite these advances, there is no cure for PsD.

Ongoing challenges in disease management include the need for adequate treatment response, precision-based care for individual patients, and a better understanding of the interrelationship between the pathogenesis of cutaneous PsO and its comorbidities, including PsA. Future progress may arise from integrating clinical disciplines, harnessing artificial intelligence, using molecular dissection to map out the disease pathogenesis of PsA to identify more effective treatment strategies, and exploring the interplay between PsD and comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression.

These developments could lead to personalized treatment approaches and increase the efficacy of therapeutics for PsD, ultimately improving patient outcomes and QOL. This article highlights the presentation of this topic at the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) 2024 annual meeting.

### Infliximab maintains a high degree of clinical response in patients with active psoriatic arthritis through 1 year of treatment: results from the IMPACT 2 trial [^117GUtM5]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2007). High credibility.

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of infliximab through one year in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) enrolled in the IMPACT 2 trial, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III study was conducted. A total of 200 patients with active PsA were randomized to receive infusions of infliximab 5 mg/kg or placebo at weeks 0, 2, 6, and every 8 weeks thereafter through one year. Patients with persistent disease activity could enter early escape at week 16, and all remaining placebo patients crossed over to infliximab at week 24. Patients randomized to infliximab who had no response or who lost response could escalate their dose to 10 mg/kg starting at week 38. Clinical efficacy was assessed based on the proportion of patients achieving ACR 20 and PASI 75 responses. Major clinical response, meaning maintenance of ACR 70 response for 24 continuous weeks, was assessed for the first time in PsA.

Through one year of treatment, 58.9% and 61.4% of patients in the randomized infliximab and placebo/infliximab groups, respectively, achieved ACR 20; corresponding figures for PASI 75 were 50.0% and 60.3%. At week 54, major clinical response was achieved by 12.1% of patients in the infliximab group. The safety profile of infliximab through week 54 was consistent with that seen through week 24. Two malignancies occurred: basal cell skin cancer (placebo) and stage I Hodgkin's lymphoma (infliximab).

In conclusion, infliximab maintains a high degree of clinical efficacy and continues to be well tolerated in patients with PsA through one year of treatment.

### Interventions for treating iron deficiency anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease [^117FXsYc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease affects approximately seven million people globally. Iron deficiency anaemia can occur as a common systemic manifestation, with a prevalence of up to 90%, significantly affecting quality of life both during periods of active disease or in remission. It is important that iron deficiency anaemia is treated effectively and not assumed to be a normal finding of inflammatory bowel disease. The various routes of iron administration, doses, and preparations present varying advantages and disadvantages, and a significant proportion of people experience adverse effects with therapies. Currently, no consensus has been reached amongst physicians as to which treatment path is most beneficial.

- **Objectives**: The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the interventions for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in people with inflammatory bowel disease.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases on 21st November 2019. We also contacted experts in the field and searched references of trials for any additional trials.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials investigated the effectiveness and safety of iron administration interventions compared to other iron administration interventions or placebo in treating iron deficiency anaemia in inflammatory bowel disease. We considered both adults and children, with studies reporting outcomes of clinical, endoscopic, histologic, or surgical remission as defined by study authors.

### Intravenous versus oral iron for anaemia among pregnant women in Nigeria (IVON): an open-label, randomised controlled trial [^1135kbHY]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). High credibility.

The slope of the change in the mean Hb concentration between baseline and 4 weeks significantly differed in the intravenous and oral group (p interaction = 0.0003, figure 2). Intravenous iron was also more effective at reducing iron deficiency (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.17–0.42; p < 0.0001) and iron deficiency anaemia (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12–0.42; p < 0.0001) at 36 weeks. There was no significant difference between both groups in the prevalence of depression at any time point nor in the prevalence of moderate to severe anaemia at 36 weeks' gestation.

- **Treatment effect on the increase in maternal haemoglobin concentration**: Intravenous iron led to a higher mean Hb concentration from baseline to 4 weeks in both the iron-deficient (p = 0.023) and non-iron deficient subgroups (p = 0.0078). However, the slope of the treatment effect in both subgroups differed significantly (p interaction < 0.0001).

- **Subgroup analysis by baseline iron deficiency status**: In the subgroup analysis by baseline iron deficiency status at enrolment, intravenous iron was significantly more effective than oral iron in reducing the prevalence of maternal anaemia (Hb < 11 g/dL) at 36 weeks' gestation in the iron deficiency anaemia versus non-iron deficiency anaemia subgroup (p interaction = 0.039).

Data are presented as mean (95% CI). The p value was calculated from a likelihood ratio test comparing the model with the interaction term to the model without. The χ² value was 20.5 (df 4).

### Solu-Medrol [^1131F8bj]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

When oral therapy is not feasible, and the strength, dosage form, and route of administration of the drug reasonably lend the preparation to the treatment of the condition, the intravenous or intramuscular use of Solu-Medrol Sterile Powder is indicated as follows:

- **Allergic states**: Control of severe or incapacitating allergic conditions intractable to adequate trials of conventional treatment in asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, drug hypersensitivity reactions, serum sickness, and transfusion reactions.

- **Dermatologic diseases**: Bullous dermatitis herpetiformis, exfoliative erythroderma, mycosis fungoides, pemphigus, and severe erythema multiforme (Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

- **Endocrine disorders**: Primary or secondary adrenocortical insufficiency (hydrocortisone or cortisone is the drug of choice; synthetic analogs may be used in conjunction with mineralocorticoids where applicable; in infancy, mineralocorticoid supplementation is of particular importance), congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hypercalcemia associated with cancer, and nonsuppurative thyroiditis.

- **Gastrointestinal diseases**: To tide the patient over a critical period of the disease in regional enteritis (systemic therapy) and ulcerative colitis.

- **Hematologic disorders**: Acquired (autoimmune) hemolytic anemia, congenital (erythroid) hypoplastic anemia (Diamond-Blackfan anemia), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in adults (intravenous administration only; intramuscular administration is contraindicated), pure red cell aplasia, and selected cases of secondary thrombocytopenia.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116rxGHx]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

All forms of intravenous (IV) iron may be associated with acute adverse events (AEs). Immune mechanisms, including IgE-mediated responses or complement activation-related pseudo-allergy, may have a role in some cases. Anaphylactoid reactions appear to occur more frequently with high molecular weight iron dextran. Labile or free iron reactions occur more frequently with non-dextran forms of iron. The rate of life-threatening reactions to iron dextran administration is 0.6% to 0.7%.

In one study, a total of 2,534 haemodialysis patients were directly observed after double-blind exposure to intravenous sodium ferric gluconate (SFGC) or placebo. One patient in each of the SFGC and placebo groups experienced anaphylactoid reactions. Additional cases with characteristics possibly consistent with anaphylaxis occurred in 0.4% of intravenous SFGC-treated patients and 0.1% of placebo-treated patients. These results suggest that there is a relatively low rate of anaphylaxis with non-dextran irons and that the reactions are generally easily managed.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued updated guidance on the use of parenteral iron. This was in response to concerns raised as a result of serious and rarely fatal hypersensitivity reactions, particularly in pregnant women. These reactions can occur even when a previous administration has been tolerated, including a negative test dose. The risk of hypersensitivity is increased in patients with known allergies, including drug allergies, immune or inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.

### Oral iron supplementation: new formulations, old questions [^114pzJko]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

The goal of iron replacement therapy is to correct IDA or non-anemic ID and replete iron stores. Iron can be administered in oral or intravenous formulations. Oral iron is usually the first line of therapy due to its convenience, availability over the counter, and the low cost of its mainstream formulations. Effective iron repletion with oral supplements requires relatively high doses of 50–200 mg/day of elemental iron for 3–12 weeks. Only approximately 10–20% of it gets absorbed, resulting in the accumulation of excess iron in the digestive tract, which causes gastrointestinal side effects. Excess iron may also alter the microbiota diversity and composition, shifting the balance towards pathogenic bacteria. These responses are tightly linked to increased susceptibility to infections, intestinal inflammation, and metabolic syndrome pathologies.

Intravenous iron therapy is of paramount importance for the treatment of severe IDA when fast repletion of iron stores is desired (e.g. in patients awaiting surgery), or when intestinal iron absorption is impaired, making oral iron ineffective (e.g. in many patients with IBD or CKD). Candidates for intravenous iron also include iron-deficient patients with poor tolerance to oral iron and women with heavy menstrual bleeding or in late pregnancy. Compared to oral iron, intravenous iron increases hemoglobin levels and iron stores faster. Potential side effects are the risk of infections, hypophosphatemia, and acute hypersensitivity reactions, which can vary from mild itching and flushing to severe anaphylaxis.

### The effect of golimumab on haemoglobin levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis [^112zcmwf]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to evaluate the effect of golimumab on haemoglobin levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or ankylosing spondylitis (AS).

- **Methods**: A secondary analysis was conducted using integrated data from five randomized controlled studies, including three for RA, one for PsA, and one for AS (totaling 2,303 patients). Golimumab was administered at doses of 50 or 100 mg via subcutaneous injection every four weeks, with or without methotrexate (MTX). Control groups received placebo injections alongside MTX or other background therapies. Patients with haemoglobin levels below the age- and sex-specific normal ranges were classified as having anaemia. Ferritin levels helped distinguish anaemia of mixed aetiology (≥ 15 to < 60 ng/ml) from anaemia of inflammation (≥ 60 ng/ml). Changes in haemoglobin levels from baseline to weeks 14 and 24 were compared between treatment groups using an analysis of variance on van der Waerden normal scores.

- **Results**: At baseline, anaemia was present in 21% of RA patients, 9% of PsA patients, and 15% of AS patients. Among these, 24%, 57%, and 25%, respectively, had anaemia of inflammation. The median increase in haemoglobin level from baseline to week 14 for anaemic patients was 0.3 g/dl in the control group and 0.9 g/dl in the golimumab group (P < 0.001). Haemoglobin levels in patients with anaemia of mixed aetiology increased by 0.4 g/dl in the control group versus 0.7 g/dl in the golimumab group (P = 0.305). In patients with anaemia of inflammation, the increase was 0.2 vs 1.4 g/dl, respectively (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Compared to the control group, patients receiving golimumab treatment showed significantly improved haemoglobin levels, particularly among those with anaemia of inflammation.

### Proactive therapeutic drug monitoring of biologic drugs in adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, or psoriasis: a clinical practice guideline [^112xiKML]. BMJ (2024). High credibility.

In adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis (which includes rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, and psoriatic arthritis), or psoriasis taking biologic drugs, does proactive therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) improve outcomes as compared with standard care?

- **Context and practice**: Standard care for immune-mediated inflammatory diseases involves prescribing biologic drugs at pre-determined doses. These doses may be adjusted reactively with increased disease activity. Proactive TDM involves measuring serum drug levels and anti-drug antibodies regardless of disease activity, and adjusting drug dosing to achieve target serum levels within pre-specified therapeutic ranges. The role of proactive TDM in clinical practice remains unclear, with conflicting guideline recommendations and emerging evidence from randomized controlled trials.

- **The evidence**: A linked systematic review and pairwise meta-analysis identified 10 trials including 2,383 participants. Inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory arthritis, and psoriasis were grouped together as the best research evidence on proactive TDM did not suggest heterogeneity of effects on outcomes of interest. Proactive TDM of intravenous infliximab during maintenance treatment may increase the proportion of patients who experience sustained disease control or sustained remission without considerable additional harm. For adalimumab, it remains unclear if proactive TDM during maintenance treatment has an effect on sustained disease control or remission.

### Model-informed drug development-based bridging from subcutaneous to intravenous secukinumab dosing: Approval in psoriatic arthritis and axial spondyloarthritis [^116MyDja]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). High credibility.

At Week 52, patients with AS receiving 1.75 mg/kg IV, 150 mg SC, or 300 mg SC secukinumab were predicted to have similar achievement of ≥ 20% improvement in the Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis Response Criteria (ASAS20; 74%, 75%, and 80%, respectively) and ASAS40 (57%, 58%, and 64%, respectively). Achievement of all other efficacy endpoints was estimated to be similar between IV and SC dosing regimens for patients with AS at Week 52.

An efficacy analysis at Week 16 that excluded studies of SC secukinumab with an IV loading dose also showed that IV secukinumab (with or without a loading dose) was estimated to provide similar achievement of all of the efficacy endpoints as that of SC secukinumab for patients with PsA and AS. The estimated exposure‐response relationships at Week 16 are shown in Figures S6 and S7.

- **Figure 4**:
	- Treatment effects estimates for efficacy endpoints at Week 16 for patients with (a) PsA and (b) AS. The estimated efficacies for each endpoint were obtained by combining the estimated exposure‐response relationships (displayed in Figures S6 and S7) and distributions of exposure for each dosing regimen. Predicted means (closed circle) and 90% CIs (vertical bars) are shown. Patients with AS who received 300 mg SC secukinumab were excluded from the analyses at Week 16 because they also received an IV loading dose.

### Etanercept and methotrexate as monotherapy or in combination for psoriatic arthritis: Primary results from a randomized, controlled phase III trial [^115Cpjjv]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). High credibility.

Both patients and investigators were blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments. Original treatment assignments remained blinded until patients reached week 48 or had an early termination visit, whichever occurred first. Treatment assignment was only unblinded when knowledge of treatment was essential to further patient care. Blinding was achieved by using matching prefilled syringes for the etanercept and injectable placebo administrations and by using matching capsules for the methotrexate and oral placebo administrations.

Etanercept is a dimeric fusion protein comprising the extracellular ligand‐binding domain of the human TNF p75 receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1, which inhibits the activity of TNFα and TNFβ. For the SEAM‐PsA trial, etanercept was manufactured and provided by Immunex, a subsidiary of Amgen Inc, in single‐use, prefilled 1‐ml syringes. Etanercept was administered at a dosage of 50 mg/week by subcutaneous injection, as recommended in the US prescribing information for the use of etanercept in PsA.

The first dose of etanercept was administered at the study site, and subsequent injections were administered by the patient or a caregiver. Methotrexate, supplied as 2.5‐mg tablets in capsules for blinding purposes, was initiated at a dosage of 10 mg/week and titrated up to 20 mg/week over a 4‐week period. If patients developed a toxic reaction to methotrexate, the methotrexate dosage could be reduced to as low as 10 mg/week. Folic acid was administered at 5–7 mg/week.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous secukinumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis: Results from a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 study [^113yCavP]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal disease with a heterogeneous presentation involving the peripheral and axial joints, entheses, skin, and nails. Patients with PsA often experience reduced quality of life (QoL) due to chronic pain, reduced physical function and work capacity, extreme fatigue, and emotional and social impairment. In addition to QoL burdens, patients with PsA face high economic burdens and have higher health care costs and resource use than those without PsA.

Secukinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin‐17A. Subcutaneous (SC) secukinumab is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, axial spondyloarthritis, and PsA. In the phase 3 FUTURE 2 to 5 trials, SC secukinumab was effective at improving the signs and symptoms of psoriatic disease in adult patients with active PsA. Secukinumab also improved key clinical disease domains in patients with PsA in the FUTURE 1 trial when delivered as an intravenous (IV) treatment at weeks 0, 2, and 4, followed by SC treatment every four weeks thereafter. However, no study has evaluated the efficacy and safety of long‐term treatment with IV secukinumab. Because the majority of treatments approved for PsA are administered SC or orally, alternate routes of delivery for biologics with established efficacy in patients with PsA, such as secukinumab, could provide additional flexibility to accommodate individualized patient and physician options.

### Psoriasis: response to high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin in three patients [^114YVqKz]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Treatment of recalcitrant psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis can be challenging, with treatment options limited by drug intolerance or poor efficacy. High-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (hdIVIg) has been used successfully in Kawasaki disease and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, where it has become the standard treatment. The literature also suggests its positive effect in the treatment of dermatological conditions, such as autoimmune chronic urticaria, atopic dermatitis, scleromyxoedema, dermatomyositis, and autoimmune bullous disorders. We report three patients with treatment-resistant psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis who improved with hdIVIg.

### Avsola [^115tgrAF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Dosage in psoriatic arthritis**: The recommended dosage of Avsola is 5 mg/kg, given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. This is followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of PsA. Avsola can be used with or without methotrexate.

- **Dosage in plaque psoriasis**: The recommended dosage of Avsola in adult patients is 5 mg/kg, given as an intravenous induction regimen at 0, 2, and 6 weeks. This is followed by a maintenance regimen of 5 mg/kg every 8 weeks thereafter for the treatment of chronic severe (i.e. extensive and/or disabling) plaque psoriasis.

- **Assessment for latent and active tuberculosis**: Prior to initiating Avsola and periodically during therapy, patients should be evaluated for active tuberculosis and tested for latent infection [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Administration instructions regarding infusion reactions**: Prior to treatment, ensure appropriate personnel and medication are available to treat reactions (e.g. hypersensitivity, other reactions) that occur during and shortly after infusion. Prior to infusion with Avsola, patients may be premedicated with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].

	- For mild to moderate reactions during the infusion, consider slowing or stopping the infusion. Upon resolution of these reactions, reinitiate at a lower infusion rate and/or with histamine-1 receptor antagonists, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, acetaminophen, and/or corticosteroids.

### New generation biologics for the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. State of the art and considerations about the risk of infection [^115AV7iT]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Low credibility.

Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation of the skin (psoriasis), joints (psoriatic arthritis), or both, resulting from a dysregulation, particularly of the T helper (Th)17 functions. There is no available cure for psoriasis, and lifelong treatment is needed to control signs and symptoms. Research interest is high around the newest biological drugs approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, especially drugs blocking the IL-23/IL-17 axis. The aim is to review the new biological drugs for the treatment of psoriasis and their adverse effects, focusing on the risk of infections.

### Efficacy and safety of intravenous golimumab through one year in patients with active psoriatic arthritis [^112ZbUZw]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Low credibility.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is characterized by joint disease affecting either or both the peripheral joints and the axial skeleton along with psoriatic lesions. Progression of radiographic joint damage and the presence of enthesitis and dactylitis can lead to decreased physical function and disability. The totality of these symptoms contributes to the significant psychosocial burden of PsA.

- **Significance & innovations**: Intravenous golimumab 2 mg/kg was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with a robust response through 1 year of treatment. Improvements in health-related quality of life in adult patients treated with intravenous golimumab 2 mg/kg were maintained through 1 year. Patients who crossed over from placebo to golimumab 2 mg/kg at week 24 generally achieved efficacy responses similar to those of patients who received golimumab from baseline in this 1-year study. The safety profile observed in this study was consistent with the known safety profile of anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, including previous studies of golimumab.

In the phase III GO-VIBRANT study (A Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial of Golimumab, an Anti-TNFα Monoclonal Antibody, Administered Intravenously, in Subjects With Active Psoriatic Arthritis), adult patients with active PsA showed greater improvements in the signs and symptoms of PsA and less radiographic progression through week 24 when receiving intravenous (IV) golimumab compared with those who received placebo. Improvements in health-related quality of life were noted alongside the reduction in symptoms and slowed disease progression.

### Enbrel [^116vH7U2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Enbrel were assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving 205 patients with psoriatic arthritis.

Patients aged between 18 and 70 years had active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), characterized by ≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints. The forms of PsA included:

- **Distal interphalangeal (DIP) involvement**: 104 patients
- **Polyarticular arthritis**: 173 patients, characterized by the absence of rheumatoid nodules and presence of psoriasis
- **Arthritis mutilans**: 3 patients
- **Asymmetric psoriatic arthritis**: 81 patients
- **Ankylosing spondylitis-like**: 7 patients

Patients also presented with plaque psoriasis, having a qualifying target lesion ≥ 2 cm in diameter. Those on methotrexate (MTX) therapy at enrollment could continue at a stable dose if it had been maintained for ≥ 2 months and was ≤ 25 mg/week.

During the initial 6-month double-blind period, doses of 25 mg Enbrel or placebo were administered subcutaneously twice a week. Patients received blinded therapy in an up to 6-month maintenance period until the completion of the controlled period by all participants. Subsequently, patients were given open-label 25 mg Enbrel twice a week in a 12-month extension period.

### Management of iron deficiency anemia in inflammatory bowel disease - a practical approach [^1122PKte]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Although anemia is the most common systemic manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), among the broad spectrum of extraintestinal disease complications encountered in IBD, including arthritis and osteopathy, it has generally received little consideration. However, not only in terms of frequency but also with regard to its potential effect on hospitalization rates and on the quality of life and work, anemia is indeed a significant and costly complication of IBD. Anemia is multifactorial in nature, with the most prevalent etiological forms being iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and anemia of chronic disease. In a condition associated with inflammation, such as IBD, the determination of iron status using common biochemical parameters alone is inadequate. A more accurate assessment may be attained using new iron indices, including reticulocyte hemoglobin content, the percentage of hypochromic red cells, or zinc protoporphyrin.

While oral iron supplementation has traditionally been a mainstay of IDA treatment, it has also been linked to extensive gastrointestinal side effects and possible disease exacerbation. Many physicians are still reluctant to administer iron intravenously, despite the wide availability of various new IV preparations with improved safety profiles and the recommendations of international expert guidelines. This article discusses improved diagnostic and therapeutic strategies based on new clinical insights into the regulation of iron homeostasis.

### Efalizumab: Results of a 3-year continuous dosing study for the long-term control of psoriasis [^11421nNX]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

- **Arthritis-related adverse events**: Arthritis-related adverse events, including arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and osteoarthritis, were experienced by 45 patients over the 36-month period of the study; 16 of these patients reported new onset of psoriatic arthritis. Eighteen of the 45 patients withdrew from the study, including 15 patients who were treated with disallowed systemic agents for the management of their arthritis symptoms. The arthritis symptoms of the remaining 27 patients were managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Six patients (1.8%) experienced a serious arthritis adverse event during the study: three events were observed during the first 3-month treatment segment, and the other three events occurred during the subsequent 33 months.

- **Other adverse events**: There were 13 anemia-related adverse events, all nonserious, reported in seven patients: eight events of anemia in six patients, one event of iron-deficiency anemia in one patient, and four events of hypochromic anemia in two patients. There were no incidences of hemolytic anemia. Six adverse events of thrombocytopenia were reported in five patients, three of whom were discontinued. Two of the events were considered serious. One patient developed a serious event of thrombocytopenia approximately 17 months after initiating efalizumab. He was hospitalized for dehydration with a platelet count of 33 × 10⁹ L⁻¹ and treated with prednisone; 7 days later his count was 106 × 10⁹ L⁻¹. Prednisone was tapered, and the patient was discontinued from the study. The second patient developed a serious event of thrombocytopenia.

### Intravenous iron sucrose v/s oral ferrous fumarate for treatment of anemia in pregnancy. A randomized controlled trial [^113V63Jo]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2017). Low credibility.

In Fig. 3, a comparison of outcomes between oral iron and IV iron sucrose shows a difference in the degree of increase in serum ferritin (ng/ml).

In Group B, which was treated with IV iron sucrose, six patients experienced minor side effects, such as burning, pain, and swelling at the injection site. In Group A, treated with oral ferrous fumarate, 14 patients reported side effects: eight experienced nausea and vomiting, four had gastritis, and two had loose motion. Of these 14 patients, eight took their tablets irregularly; otherwise, compliance was excellent.

This study observed that parenterally administered iron sucrose elevates hemoglobin and restores iron stores better than oral ferrous fumarate during the treatment of iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy. The mean changes in hemoglobin and ferritin levels throughout the treatment were significantly higher in the intravenously administered iron group than in the orally administered iron group.

Oral iron is effective, safe, and low-cost; however, effectiveness may fail due to non-compliance, achlorhydria, inflammatory bowel diseases, or unrecognized bleeding. Non-compliance is largely related to side effects. Between 10% and 40% of patients suffer from adverse gastrointestinal effects, including constipation, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, nausea, severe abdominal pain, and vomiting. These can be decreased by food, but food decreases absorption by 10% to 40%.

Iron dextran compounds are stable, strong complexes with relatively high molecular weight, a long half-life, and relatively slow release. Life-threatening anaphylactic reactions can occur.

### Effect of recombinant human erythropoietin and intravenous iron on anemia and disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis [^111aA4tD]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

To investigate whether treatment of anemia of chronic disease (ACD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHu-Epo) in combination with intravenous (i.v.) iron influences health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and clinical outcomes, including disease activity, thirty patients with ACD and RA were treated with 150 IU/kg rHu-Epo twice weekly for 12 weeks. In cases of functional iron deficiency, 200 mg of iron-sucrose per week was given intravenously.

Vitality and fatigue, as dimensions of HRQoL, were evaluated using the vitality subscale of the Short Form-36 (SF-36-VT) and the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF). Muscle strength was measured by the Muscle Strength Index.

All 28 patients completing the study responded to treatment. Among these, 23 patients developed functional iron deficiency and received i.v. iron, with a mean absolute dose of 710 ± 560 mg. The average hemoglobin concentration increased from 10.7 ± 1.1 to 13.2 ± 1.0 g/dl following a mean treatment period of 8.7 ± 2.3 weeks. Muscle strength increased from 43.5 ± 11.2 to 49.1 ± 12.9, and SF-36-VT scores increased from 28.2% ± 14.3% to 47.1% ± 20.8%, while fatigue decreased (MAF from 34.7 ± 9.3 to 25.0 ± 11.3). Among the disease activity variables, the number of swollen/tender joints, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Disease Activity Score, and RA Disease Activity Index improved significantly during treatment.

In conclusion, treatment of ACD in RA patients with rHu-Epo and i.v. iron is safe and effective in correcting anemia and increasing muscle strength.

### Intravenous versus oral iron for anaemia among pregnant women in Nigeria (IVON): An open-label, randomised controlled trial [^117S8JTj]. The Lancet Global Health (2024). High credibility.

Our study was conducted in Nigeria, which has the highest annual number of pregnant women in Africa and a relatively high prevalence of anaemia among women of reproductive age. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of intravenous iron versus oral ferrous sulphate among pregnant women, the second in Africa, and the first in West Africa. We also evaluated the effect of ferric carboxymaltose treatment on postnatal maternal outcomes, including maternal depression, which contributes substantially to maternal morbidity, and breastfeeding and immunisation practices. Our study found that intravenous iron was more effective than oral iron in increasing mean haemoglobin concentrations at 4 weeks post-treatment, and nearly eliminated iron deficiency among treated women at 36 weeks' gestation.

- **Implications of all the available evidence**: Our trial provides further evidence to support existing data that, compared with oral iron, intravenous iron is more effective at reducing anaemia in those with anaemia deemed at high risk of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia. However, there is no evidence of an effect on anaemia in general. Intravenous iron should therefore be considered for women with confirmed iron deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia, or those at high risk of iron deficiency or iron deficiency anaemia. Further research on the degree of anaemia for which intravenous iron treatment (vs blood transfusion) will be effective is required. Available evidence also makes a case for…

### Polyarticular arthropathy and encephalopathy in a 70-year-old woman [^1164dBse]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old woman with a background of portopulmonary hypertension, managed with sildenafil and oral diuretics, and cirrhosis, presented with acute-on-chronic hemorrhoidal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, and worsening right heart failure. She presented in a normal conscious and cognitive state. Management involved intravenous diuresis with frusemide and blood transfusion. She quickly began to develop fever, severe polyarticular arthropathy, and progressive encephalopathy. Analgesia was started, and antibiotics were administered for potential septic sources.

Extensive investigations, including a full septic screen and neurological imaging, revealed no explainable etiology for her precipitous decline. She continued to have febrile episodes, worsening polyarticular arthropathy, and progressive encephalopathy, eventually becoming unresponsive. Given the severe polyarticular arthropathy, knee aspiration was performed. Urate crystals were identified, and intravenous hydrocortisone and colchicine were started. Within two days, she achieved full resolution of her systemic, musculoskeletal, and neurological symptoms. We propose this as a rare case of gout-induced encephalopathy.

### Safety and efficacy of intravenous iron therapy in reducing requirement for allogeneic blood transfusion: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials [^111NSNPR]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

In this large systematic review and meta-analysis assessing safety and efficacy in patients from many specialties, we have shown that intravenous iron is effective in increasing haemoglobin concentration and reducing the risk of allogeneic red blood cell transfusion, but it is associated with an increased risk of all-cause infection. Intravenous iron is increasingly advocated to treat anaemia with the aim of reducing the need for allogeneic red blood cell transfusion; however, the risks and benefits of intravenous iron remain uncertain.

- **Reducing requirement for allogeneic red blood cell transfusion**: Allogeneic red blood cell transfusion is associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events, including mortality. In this meta-analysis, we confirmed that intravenous iron is effective in reducing the requirement for red blood cell transfusion and thereby reducing the associated risk. This benefit seemed consistent across different categories of disease and formulations of intravenous iron and was present whether intravenous iron was compared with oral iron or no iron. These findings align with recent advances in the understanding of iron metabolism; intravenous iron is more effective than oral iron, particularly in the setting of acute or chronic inflammation, by bypassing the effects of hepcidin — an inhibitor of gastrointestinal iron absorption. As such, intravenous iron might have an important role in the management of patients as part of a strategy to reduce the requirement for allogeneic red blood cell transfusion for many hospital patients.
