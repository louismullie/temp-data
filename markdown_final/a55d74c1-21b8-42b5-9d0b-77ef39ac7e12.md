## Question

Treatment of covid brain fog

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating COVID-19 brain fog. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the clinical problem and its prevalence and impact. Then, I should verify the pathophysiological mechanisms that plausibly explain brain fog. Next, I will review the diagnostic approach, including screening tools, objective testing, and differential diagnosis. After that, I need to examine evidence-based treatment strategies, both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic, and consider special populations. Finally, I should assess prognosis, identify knowledge gaps, and synthesize a practical, stepwise clinical algorithm with appropriate cautions and follow-up plans [^113JDxja] [^115kna1r].

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct and its burden. COVID-19 brain fog is best understood as a post-acute neurocognitive syndrome characterized by slowed thinking, attention and memory problems, and mental fatigue that persist beyond three months in a subset of patients, with prevalence estimates ranging from roughly 10% to over 30% depending on cohorts and definitions, and with substantial functional impact on work and daily activities [^113JDxja] [^116VPfqi] [^116fKP5a] [^1143rfR3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mechanism before I verify the leading hypotheses. The weight of evidence supports a multifactorial model including systemic inflammation with blood–brain barrier disruption, microvascular injury and microthrombi, immune dysregulation with autoimmunity and microglial activation, and dysautonomia including POTS; convergent data show BBB breakdown correlating with cognitive symptoms, and acute-phase biomarker profiles linking fibrinogen and D-dimer to later cognitive deficits, while EEG and neuroimaging studies describe frontoparietal hypometabolism and network slowing that can persist months after infection [^115hcq3m] [^113Es4G9] [^112hfu1M] [^111rnvU4] [^114w2Fji] [^111V7H5A] [^1167Gz8k].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach because misclassification is common. Clinically, I should confirm persistence beyond three months, exclude alternative explanations, and screen for common triggers and comorbidities; the MoCA is widely used but has only modest accuracy for detecting mild deficits in this population, so a normal MoCA does not rule out impairment and formal neuropsychological testing is warranted when symptoms persist or functional impact is significant; I also need to check for dysautonomia, sleep disturbance, mood disorders, and medication effects that can mimic or worsen brain fog [^113vVPr9] [^111XR9Ur] [^113JDxja].

> I will now examine non-pharmacologic management, since this is where the most actionable evidence exists. Cognitive rehabilitation delivered by speech-language pathology or neuropsychology improves self-reported functional cognition even when objective memory tests do not change, and anxiety appears to blunt response, so I should integrate anxiety treatment into the plan; pacing and energy conservation with graded, symptom-guided return to activity are foundational; CBT-based approaches and mindfulness can help with coping and symptom management; and I should not overlook sleep optimization, hydration, and nutrition as supportive measures [^114LimDb] [^113JDxja] [^115FDzda] [^117TR6Df].

> Let me consider pharmacologic options carefully, because evidence is limited and heterogeneous. I should confirm that no medication is FDA-approved for long COVID brain fog; however, small studies and case series suggest potential benefit from low-dose naltrexone adapted from ME/CFS, and agents targeting dysautonomia such as fludrocortisone, midodrine, or beta-blockers may help when POTS or orthostatic intolerance coexists; immunomodulators like tocilizumab have case-level signals for neuroinflammation but remain investigational; and I need to ensure careful selection, shared decision-making, and close monitoring for adverse effects and off-label use [^113s4Wtc] [^114w2Fji] [^117T4of8] [^115kna1r].

> But wait, what if autonomic dysfunction is a primary driver in this patient. Cervical sympathetic blockade, including stellate ganglion block, has emerging case-series and scoping-review evidence of symptom improvement in fatigue, brain fog, and dysautonomia, though I should emphasize the preliminary nature and the need for randomized trials before routine use; if considered, it should be in specialized centers with appropriate expertise and safety protocols [^111aBYTt] [^111jhJ2j].

> Next, I should review special populations and settings. In pediatrics, brain fog is less common than in adults but still present, and multidisciplinary clinics often rely on physical therapy and psychological support given sparse evidence; in workers' compensation contexts, I need to ensure objective testing and address validity concerns while recognizing high rates of comorbid mood disorders; and in perioperative or critical care follow-up, I should screen for ICU-acquired cognitive impairment and tailor rehabilitation intensity to cardiopulmonary reserves [^114xMRzi] [^116rTZqg] [^1119NVuE] [^1155i31d].

> I should double-check prognosis and longitudinal trajectories. Many patients improve over 6 to 12 months, but a substantial minority have persistent deficits beyond a year; objective deficits on large-scale testing are small on average but can exceed half a standard deviation in those with unresolved symptoms, and hospitalization, ICU care, and earlier variants associate with larger deficits; importantly, subjective complaints may correlate more with fatigue and mood than with objective test performance, so I need to interpret test results in clinical context and avoid dismissing real functional impact when tests are "normal" [^116fKP5a] [^116MH3n9] [^111AtsXP].

> Hold on, I should verify key knowledge gaps to guide counseling and research referrals. We lack validated biomarkers for diagnosis or treatment response, though BBB markers and inflammatory profiles are promising; we need head-to-head trials of rehabilitation protocols and pharmacotherapies; and we must integrate psychosocial determinants and equity considerations into care pathways, as access and social determinants shape both risk and recovery trajectories [^115kna1r] [^111XR9Ur] [^115hcq3m].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic clinical algorithm, and I will keep checking each step against guidance. First, confirm post-acute status and exclude alternative diagnoses; second, screen with MoCA but refer for neuropsychological testing if symptoms persist or functional impact is high; third, assess for dysautonomia, sleep, mood, pain, and medication contributors; fourth, initiate non-pharmacologic care with cognitive rehabilitation, pacing, graded activity, sleep and lifestyle optimization, and CBT-based coping; fifth, consider pharmacologic adjuncts such as low-dose naltrexone or dysautonomia-directed therapy when indicated, documenting off-label rationale; sixth, embed mental health treatment and address anxiety that can limit rehabilitation gains; seventh, reassess at 3 to 6 month intervals and escalate intensity or add investigational options in refractory cases within appropriate programs [^111XR9Ur] [^113JDxja] [^114LimDb] [^1124jAAb].

> Finally, I need to ensure the care plan is equitable and patient-centered. I should screen for health disparities, language and literacy barriers, and occupational impacts; use shared decision-making for off-label medications; and align rehabilitation intensity with patient goals and comorbidities, recognizing that younger patients may prefer non-pharmacologic strategies while older adults may prioritize safety and tolerability, all within a multidisciplinary framework that can adapt as evidence evolves [^111XR9Ur] [^112w8k8P].

COVID brain fog is best managed with a **multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach** that combines cognitive rehabilitation, pacing, and symptom-targeted strategies [^114jBFDR] [^113JDxja]. Evidence supports **cognitive rehabilitation** to improve functional cognition [^114LimDb], and **CBT-based pacing** to reduce fatigue and cognitive overload [^113JDxja] [^115FDzda]. Pharmacologic options are limited; low-dose naltrexone may help some patients [^113s4Wtc], but most agents lack robust evidence [^113JDxja]. Address comorbidities (sleep, mood, autonomic dysfunction) [^113u2rQc] and use validated tools (e.g. MoCA, Neuro-QoL) to track progress [^1114EMqy] [^116SU8fu] [^1146YXdB]. Recovery is variable; many improve over 6–12 months, but some have persistent deficits, so ongoing support and follow-up are essential [^116fKP5a] [^113JDxja].

---

## Clinical features and prevalence

Brain fog is characterized by **difficulties with attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed** [^111AtsXP], often accompanied by mental fatigue and slowed thinking [^11188vgn]. Prevalence estimates vary: approximately 32% of patients report brain fog three months post-infection [^116VPfqi], and 28% report ongoing cognitive issues at six months [^notfound]. These symptoms significantly impair **daily functioning and quality of life** [^1143rfR3].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several mechanisms are implicated in COVID brain fog:

- **Neuroinflammation**: Persistent systemic inflammation and microglial activation [^114w2Fji] contribute to cognitive impairment [^112teohg].

- **Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption**: BBB dysfunction allows peripheral inflammatory mediators to enter the CNS, causing neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits [^115hcq3m] [^113Es4G9].

- **Microvascular injury**: Endothelial dysfunction and microthrombi [^112hfu1M] reduce cerebral perfusion, leading to hypoxia and cognitive impairment [^11595tKx].

- **Autonomic dysfunction**: Dysautonomia, including POTS, is common and contributes to cognitive symptoms [^113u2rQc].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A comprehensive evaluation is essential to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other conditions:

- **Clinical history**: Detailed history of COVID-19 infection, symptom onset, and progression [^notfound].

- **Neuropsychological testing**: Objective assessment of cognitive domains (attention, memory, executive function, processing speed) [^1138R7fU].

- **Screening tools**: MoCA and Neuro-QoL are useful for initial screening and tracking progress [^1114EMqy] [^114LimDb].

- **Laboratory tests**: Rule out metabolic, endocrine, and infectious causes.

- **Imaging**: MRI or CT may be considered to exclude structural brain lesions.

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions are the cornerstone of management:

| **Intervention** | **Description** | **Evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Cognitive rehabilitation | Structured programs targeting attention, memory, and executive function | Improves functional cognition and quality of life [^114LimDb] |
| Pacing and energy management | Balancing activity and rest to prevent symptom exacerbation | Reduces fatigue and cognitive overload [^notfound] |
| Sleep hygiene | Regular sleep schedule, avoidance of stimulants, relaxation techniques | Improves sleep quality and cognitive function [^notfound] |
| Stress management | Mindfulness, meditation, and stress reduction techniques | Reduces anxiety and improves cognitive symptoms [^114w2Fji] |
| Physical activity | Gradual, individualized exercise programs | Improves fatigue, mood, and cognitive function [^115FDzda] |

---

## Pharmacological interventions

Currently, there are **no FDA-approved medications** specifically for COVID brain fog. However, some medications have been explored:

- **Low-dose naltrexone (LDN)**: May reduce inflammation and improve symptoms in some patients [^113s4Wtc].

- **Stimulants (e.g. methylphenidate, modafinil)**: May improve attention and processing speed, but evidence is limited and mixed [^notfound].

- **Antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs)**: Useful for coexisting depression and anxiety, which can exacerbate cognitive symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Multidisciplinary care

A multidisciplinary approach involving neurology, psychiatry, psychology, rehabilitation medicine, and primary care is essential. This ensures **comprehensive assessment**, individualized treatment plans, and coordinated care [^112MJpdC] [^116BqNf2].

---

## Prognosis and recovery

Recovery from COVID brain fog is **highly variable**. Many patients experience gradual improvement over 6–12 months, but some have persistent symptoms beyond a year [^111V7H5A] [^111rsUHa]. Factors influencing recovery include illness severity, age, comorbidities, and access to care [^116VPfqi] [^111rsUHa] [^114tBMMg].

---

## Patient education and support

Education and support are **critical components of management**. Patients should be informed about the nature of their symptoms, potential triggers, and **self-management strategies**. Support groups and counseling can provide **emotional support** and improve coping [^113JDxja] [^116rTZqg].

---

## Current research and future directions

Ongoing research focuses on elucidating pathophysiological mechanisms, identifying biomarkers, and evaluating novel therapeutic interventions. Future directions include **targeted therapies** addressing neuroinflammation, BBB dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction [^112teohg] [^115hcq3m] [^111jhJ2j].

---

COVID brain fog is a common and debilitating symptom of long COVID. Management requires a **multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach**, with non-pharmacological interventions as the cornerstone of care. Recovery is variable, and ongoing research is needed to identify effective treatments and improve patient outcomes.

### Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome: brain fog phenotype, patient-centric understanding, and biopsychosocial-oriented treatment [^114jBFDR]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Post-Acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS), a term used to describe ongoing symptoms following SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) infection, includes prominent neuropsychological sequela, such as a subjective sense of brain fog. Brain fog can be persistent and interfere with quality of life and daily functioning across multiple domains. Rehabilitation professionals can comprehensively address PACS-related brain fog through a biopsychosocial framework of chronic illness. Through emphasizing a patient-centric perspective, rehabilitation practitioners can understand lifestyle protective factors, as well as the reciprocal relationships between emotional processing and behaviors that potentially maintain symptomology manifesting as brain fog. However, current practice models do not fully address the biopsychosocial components for adults suffering from PACS-related brain fog. To address gaps in the literature, we present a biopsychosocial framework for PACS-related brain fog and provide treatment strategies based on evidence from current literature of neuropsychiatric sequela of mild traumatic brain injury. These recommendations will provide practice guidance to rehabilitation professionals in 1) identifying common protective factors that can be optimized in the context of persistent PACS-related brain fog and 2) addressing these symptoms via integrative interventions considering the biopsychosocial presentation of brain fog.

### Long COVID: rapid evidence review [^113JDxja]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Postacute sequelae of COVID-19, also known as long COVID, affects approximately 10% to 30% of the hundreds of millions of people who have had acute COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines long COVID as the presence of new, returning, or ongoing symptoms associated with acute COVID-19 that persist beyond 28 days. The diagnosis of long COVID can be based on a previous clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 and does not require a prior positive polymerase chain reaction or antigen test result to confirm infection. Patients with long COVID report a broad range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anosmia, chest pain, cognitive impairment (brain fog), dizziness, dyspnea, fatigue, headache, insomnia, mood changes, palpitations, paresthesias, and postexertional malaise. The presentation is variable, and symptoms can fluctuate or persist and relapse and remit. The diagnostic approach is to differentiate long COVID from acute sequelae of COVID-19, previous comorbidities, unmasking of preexisting health conditions, reinfections, new acute concerns, and complications of prolonged illness, hospitalization, or isolation. Many presenting symptoms of long COVID are commonly seen in a primary care practice, and management can be improved by using established treatment paradigms and supportive care. Although several medications have been suggested for the treatment of fatigue related to long COVID, the evidence for their use is currently lacking. Holistic treatment strategies for long COVID include discussion of pacing and energy conservation; individualized, symptom-guided, phased return to activity programs; maintaining adequate hydration and a healthy diet; and treatment of underlying medical conditions.

### A multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach to chronic pain patients in the post-COVID-19 era [^112MJpdC]. Pain Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The global health care system has been shaken by the unprecedented pandemic. Chronic pain management has suffered through the pandemic due to lack of access and challenges in care delivery only to be faced by a new set of chronic pain conditions resulting from prolonged and persistent COVID-19 symptoms referred to as "long COVID syndrome".

Objectives

Long COVID is emerging as a complex and debilitating condition that occurs in a subpopulation of patients following acute COVID-19 infection. Our goals were to explore how to best treat and manage long COVID syndrome based on current experience.

Methods

This is a perspective rather than a systematic review. It is based on the limited available literature and current clinical experience.

Results

Although a few pharmacological agents have been proposed to mitigate symptoms, none have emerged to provide meaningful, long-term pain relief. Long COVID is associated with numerous and diverse symptoms. Risk factors for developing long COVID subsequent to acute COVID-19 remain unknown. Due to the multidimensional impact of long COVID chronic pain, a structured interdisciplinary rehabilitation model has been proposed to relieve pain, restore function, and maximize quality of life.

Limitations

This is a perspective with an editorial point of view rather than a systematic literature study. Long COVID syndrome is a new condition, with which no clinicians have extensive experience. This is not a systematic review so there is no Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses diagram. This is not a clinical study so there was no need for institutional review board approvals.

Conclusions

Treatment goals for the postviral syndrome of long COVID are multifaceted. In addition to pain control, patients may have functional deficits, cognitive issues, mental health issues, and reduced quality of life. Thus, a structured interdisciplinary rehabilitation model seems most appropriate to manage long COVID.

Key Words

Chronic pain, long COVID, pandemic, COVID-19, brain fog, fatigue, pain program, functional restoration, back pain, joint pain.

### Assessment of cognitive function in patients after COVID-19 infection [^116KbxpZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

People who have survived COVID-19 frequently complain of cognitive dysfunction, which has been described as brain fog. The prevalence of post–COVID-19 cognitive impairment and the association with disease severity are not well characterized. Previous studies on the topic have been limited by small sample sizes and suboptimal measurement of cognitive functioning. We investigated rates of cognitive impairment in survivors of COVID-19 who were treated in outpatient, emergency department (ED), or inpatient hospital settings.

### Diagnosing respiratory long COVID: a practical approach [^111QBRTP]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID or post-COVID Condition, defined as the persistence of symptoms at least three months post-acute COVID-19 infection, is a novel condition where a definitive diagnostic marker and treatment has yet to be found. This condition, which has been estimated to impact more than 65 million individuals worldwide, manifests with multisystem involvement, most commonly presenting with fatigue, brain fog, dyspnea and/or cough. The burden of these symptoms can range from mild to severe with many patients reporting an inability to return to usual activities. Here, we present several hypothetical but clinically representative cases to allow discussion around how we approach the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms of Long COVID in those with and without chronic lung disease.

### Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome negatively impacts physical function, cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation [^114tBMMg]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Several studies have documented the most common persistent symptoms after severe COVID-19 infection. These symptoms include fatigue, dyspnea, "brain fog"/various cognitive symptoms, pain, anxiety, depression, and gastrointestinal issues.– In these cohorts, the symptoms arising from COVID-19 increased disability and negatively impacted physical function and quality of life, and affected participation in general life activities and the ability to work. There is a critical need to classify the prevalence of specific persistent symptoms that follow acute COVID-19 infection and the impact of these symptoms on patient-reported outcomes that are well validated in other conditions. This will facilitate the establishment of diagnostic criteria for PACS and accurate tracking of responses to various prospective therapies.

It has been hypothesized that persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 infection result from an immune-mediated disruption to the autonomic nervous system. Similar to other postviral autoimmune conditions (such as Guillain-Barré syndrome), COVID-19 infection seems to act as an immune trigger. This immune response, coupled with a lack of access to acute COVID-19 treatments offered only in a hospital setting, may explain why even those with less severe acute infection are still experiencing persistent symptoms.

It is clear that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a second, longer-term public health emergency has emerged. It is imperative to understand the burden of this novel condition with millions Americans at risk of developing PACS by the end of the pandemic. This study describes the persistent symptoms reported by a cohort of patients with PACS, the majority of whom were infected with COVID-19 in early 2020 and not hospitalized. The impact of these symptoms on physical function, cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation is also reported.

### Acute blood biomarker profiles predict cognitive deficits 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 hospitalization [^112hfu1M]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Main

Many people develop neuropsychiatric symptoms in the weeks and months after SARS-CoV-2 infection –, in isolation or within a post-acute COVID-19 syndromealso known as long COVID. One in eight patients receives their first ever neurological or psychiatric diagnosis within 6 months following COVID-19. Among these symptoms, cognitive deficits (including 'brain fog') are particularly worrisome; they are common –, persistentand they affect the ability to work.

How post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits develop remains unknown. Elucidating the mechanisms is a critical step in identifying potential treatments and mitigating the burden of COVID-19. Several hypotheses have been formulated, including endothelial damage, neuroinflammation, thrombotic events, viral invasion and hypoxemia –. Some of these mechanisms might involve acute pathologies with persistent clinical manifestations, whereas others might only emerge in the post-acute phase. Recent animal studies – and in vitro analysesare providing insight into how COVID-19 might affect the brain. Post-COVID-19 autopsies have revealed multifocal vascular damage and microthrombi accompanied by endothelial cell activation.

### Diagnosing respiratory long COVID: a practical approach [^112yWRb2]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID or a post-COVID condition, defined as the persistence of symptoms at least 3 months after acute COVID-19 infection, is a novel condition in which a definitive diagnostic marker and treatment have yet to be found. This condition, which has been estimated to impact > 65 million individuals worldwide, manifests with multisystem involvement, most commonly presenting with fatigue, brain fog, dyspnea, cough, or a combination thereof. The burden of these symptoms can range from mild to severe, with many patients reporting an inability to return to usual activities. Herein, we present several hypothetical but clinically representative case reports to allow discussion around how we approach the diagnosis of respiratory symptoms of long COVID in those with and without chronic lung disease.

### Interventions for the management of long COVID (post-covid condition): living systematic review [^115kna1r]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Long covid can comprise several distinct phenotypes, and we anticipated that the effects of interventions might differ based on the predominant symptoms patients experience. Accordingly, based on previous classifications of long covid and the eligibility criteria of trials, we categorised trials as including patients with either general symptoms such as fatigability and an impairment in functional capacity to perform routine activities of daily living, primarily respiratory sequelae characterized by dyspnoea, or primarily neurological or cognitive sequelae characterized by cognitive impairments and brain fog.

We also anticipated that the effects of interventions might depend on diagnostic criteria for long covid, severity of acute covid-19 infection, time since infection, number of infections, vaccination status, and SARS-CoV-2 variant. When reported, we extracted stratified data based on these factors for subgroup analyses.

In response to growing concerns about untrustworthy trial publications, reviewers applied the trustworthiness in randomised controlled trials (TRACT) checklist to assess each trial for signs of data fabrication, data falsification (manipulation of data or results), and errors in the conduct of the trial or analysis of data that could undermine the conclusions, such as confusing standard errors with standard deviations and misclassification of intervention and control groups. This checklist includes 19 items in seven domains: governance, author group, plausibility of intervention, timeframe, dropouts, baseline characteristics, and outcomes. The checklist does not include a cut-off at which a trial is considered suspicious, and experience in applying the checklist to systematic reviews is currently limited. Therefore, the core authorship group reviewed all trials flagged as having potential concerns in one or more domain and identified those they considered untrustworthy by consensus.

### Cognitive symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition and daily functioning [^1143rfR3]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

The results of this survey study suggest that cognitive symptoms represent common features of post–COVID-19 condition, encompassing impairments often characterized by the widely used lay term brain fog. In light of their marked association with poorer functioning and quality of life, these symptoms represent important targets for assessment and identifying scalable interventions to remediate cognitive dysfunction in post–COVID-19 condition.

### Assessment of psychosocial aspects in adults in post-COVID-19 condition: the EURONET-SOMA recommendations on core outcome domains for clinical and research use [^111rsUHa]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Post-COVID-19 condition or syndrome (often referred to as Long COVID) is the term coined by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the development or continuation of new symptoms 12 weeks after an acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, with these symptoms lasting for more than 2 months and not explained by an alternative diagnosis. With 6–10% of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals reporting long-lasting symptoms, at least 75 million people are affected globally. With a wide variety of more than 200 symptoms reported, post-COVID-19 condition seems an urgent, complex, and massive healthcare problem. Recent studies on post-COVID-19 have identified several prevalent symptoms that persist for up to 2 years after infection: Commonly reported symptoms include fatigue, observed in approximately 28% of cases, and neurocognitive issues such as memory difficulties, dizziness, and brain fog, affecting around 28% of patients. Other symptoms like sleep disturbances (21%), depression (18%), anxiety (13%), and pain (8%) have also been frequently documented among COVID-19 survivors. Given the high variability in these estimates, which reflect diverse populations and study methodologies, we refer readers to recent meta-analyses such as Fernández-de-las-Peñas et al. for a detailed prevalence breakdown of post-COVID-19 symptoms. These symptoms significantly reduce health recovery, everyday functioning, and work capacity 6–12 months post-infection, even in young people with initially mild disease. Since our understanding of and existing treatment options for post-COVID-19 condition are limited, further research and new approaches are necessary. While the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically described with a focus on the immunological processes and growing evidence shows the relevance of biological changes, such as persistent alterations in the brainstem of post-COVID-19 patients, the chronic course of post-COVID-19 condition requires a broad biopsychosocial perspective that considers the biological (e.g. immunological) and the psychosocial factors that can contribute to or result from the clinical condition. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis has confirmed the relevance of depression and anxiety as co-occurring phenomena and predictive factors of post-COVID-19, but has dramatically shown the scarcity of available evidence on broader psychosocial predictors.

### Current concepts in long COVID-19 brain fog and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^114w2Fji]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Neurologic complications of long COVID-19 syndrome are one of the leading causes of global disability. In particular, post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction and dysautonomia in the form of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) markedly affect patient quality of life and ability to return to work. The underlying pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurologic complications is unknown but is likely multifactorial with immune dysregulation and microvascular dysfunction playing central roles. Specific pathogenic factors with supportive evidence to date include cytokine-mediated inflammation, autoantibodies, immune exhaustion, disruption of the renin-angiotensin system, reduced serotonin levels, and microglial activation. The prevalence of post-COVID-19 cognitive dysfunction ranges from 10% to 88% and is affected by viral variant and hospitalization status among other factors, whereas that of long COVID-19 POTS is unknown due to referral bias and varying definitions. Treatment is largely supportive and often incorporates combined modalities. Marginal benefits with cognitive behavioral therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and supplements have been found for post-COVID-19 brain fog, whereas established POTS therapies aimed at improving venous return and reducing heart rate may reduce symptoms of long COVID-19 POTS. Although significant recovery has been noted for many cases of post-COVID-19 brain fog and POTS, prospective studies have revealed evidence of persistent symptoms and neurologic deficits a year after infection in some patients. Further studies that provide insight into the underlying pathophysiology of long COVID-19 are needed for development of target directed therapy.

### Prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog in people with long COVID: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111doeeq]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Long COVID can include impaired cognition ('brain fog'; a term encompassing multiple symptoms) and mental health conditions. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate their prevalence and to explore relevant factors associated with the incidence of impaired cognition and mental health conditions.

Methods

Searches were conducted in Medline and PsycINFO to cover the start of the pandemic until August 2023. Included studies reported prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog in adults with long COVID after clinically-diagnosed or PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Findings

17 studies were included, reporting 41,249 long COVID patients. Across all timepoints (3–24 months), the combined prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog was 20·4% (95% CI 11·1%-34·4%), being lower among those previously hospitalised than in community-managed patients(19·5 vs 29·7% respectively; p = 0·047). The odds of mental health conditions and brain fog increased over time and when validated instruments were used. Odds of brain fog significantly decreased with increasing vaccination rates (p = ·000).

Conclusions

Given the increasing prevalence of mental health conditions and brain fog over time, preventive interventions and treatments are needed. Research is needed to explore underlying mechanisms that could inform further research in development of effective treatments. The reduced risk of brain fog associated with vaccination emphasizes the need for ongoing vaccination programs.

### Treatment experiences, preferences, and expectations for cognitive impairments in long COVID among Chinese young and older adults: a constructivist grounded theory study [^115t1NXu]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Semi-structured interviews

Given the complexity and diversity of experiences among individuals with long COVID, this study employed semi-structured interviews as the primary method for collecting detailed and personal insights. This approach ensured both consistency and flexibility: while predefined domains and guiding questions structured the interviews, the interviewer also used probing and follow-up questions to allow participants to elaborate freely on their experiences. The structured component of the interview guide covered five domains: (1) experiences with cognitive impairments (e.g. "Can you describe your experiences with any cognitive symptoms since having long COVID, such as brain fog?" and "Have you ever received a formal diagnosis of long-term COVID, or were your symptoms fully self-perceived?"), (2) treatment experiences (e.g. "What approaches have you tried to manage your symptoms, and what motivated these choices?"), (3) preferences and expectations (e.g. "What factors are most important to you when choosing how to manage your symptoms?"), (4) comparative perspectives across age (e.g. "Do you feel that age shapes the way you or others in your community handle these health challenges?"), and (5) future expectations (e.g. "What are your hopes or concerns regarding future strategies for managing symptoms like yours?"). The interview guide was iteratively refined based on early findings to address emerging themes and gaps in understanding.

### Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome for anesthesiologists: a narrative review and a pragmatic approach to clinical care [^1155i31d]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Post-acute coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome is a novel, poorly understood clinical entity with life-impacting ramifications. Patients with this syndrome, also known as "COVID-19 long-haulers", often present with nonspecific ailments involving more than one body system. The most common complaints include dyspnea, fatigue, brain fog, and chest pain. There currently is no single agreed-upon definition for post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, but most agree that criterion for this syndrome is the persistence of mental and physical health consequences after initial infection. Given the millions of acute infections in the United States over the course of the pandemic, perioperative providers will encounter these patients in clinical practice in growing numbers. Symptoms of the COVID-19 long-haulers should not be minimized, as these patients are at higher risk for postoperative respiratory complications and perioperative mortality for up to seven weeks after initial illness. Instead, a cautious multidisciplinary preoperative evaluation should be performed. Perioperative care should be viewed through the prism of best practices already in use, such as avoidance of benzodiazepines in patients with cognitive impairment and use of lung-protective ventilation. Recommendations especially relevant to the COVID-19 long-haulers include assessment of critical care myopathies and neuropathies to determine suitable neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal, preoperative workup of insidious cardiac or pulmonary pathologies in previously healthy patients, and, thorough medication review, particularly of anticoagulation regimens and chronic steroid use. In this article, the authors define the syndrome, synthesize the available scientific evidence, and make pragmatic suggestions regarding the perioperative clinical care of COVID-19 long-haulers.

### International care programs for pediatric post-COVID condition (long COVID) and the way forward [^116rTZqg]. Pediatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric Post-COVID-Condition (PPCC) clinics treat children despite limited scientific substantiation. By exploring real-life management of children diagnosed with PPCC, the International Post-COVID-Condition in Children Collaboration (IP4C) aimed to provide guidance for future PPCC care.

Methods

We performed a cross-sectional international, multicenter study on used PPCC definitions; the organization of PPCC care programs and patients characteristics. We compared aggregated data from PPCC cohorts and identified priorities to improve PPCC care.

Results

Ten PPCC care programs and six COVID-19 follow-up research cohorts participated. Aggregated data from 584 PPCC patients was analyzed. The most common symptoms included fatigue (71%), headache (55%), concentration difficulties (53%), and brain fog (48%). Severe limitations in daily life were reported in 31% of patients. Most PPCC care programs organized in-person visits with multidisciplinary teams. Diagnostic testing for respiratory and cardiac morbidity was most frequently performed and seldom abnormal. Treatment was often limited to physical therapy and psychological support.

Conclusions

We found substantial heterogeneity in both the diagnostics and management of PPCC, possibly explained by scarce scientific evidence and lack of standardized care. We present a list of components which future guidelines should address, and outline priorities concerning PPCC care pathways, research and international collaboration.

Impact

Pediatric Post-COVID Condition (PPCC) Care programs have been initiated in many countries. Children with PPCC in different countries are affected by similar symptoms, limiting many to participate in daily life. There is substantial heterogeneity in diagnostic testing. Access to specific diagnostic tests is required to identify some long-term COVID-19 sequelae. Treatments provided were limited to physical therapy and psychological support. This study emphasizes the need for evidence-based diagnostics and treatment of PPCC. The International Post-COVID Collaboration for Children (IP4C) provides guidance for guideline development and introduces a framework of priorities for PPCC care and research, to improve PPCC outcomes.

### Brief outpatient rehabilitation program for post-COVID-19 condition: a randomized clinical trial [^115FDzda]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Post–COVID-19 condition and PIFS are phenotypically similar to chronic fatigue syndrome, and a recent meta-analysis reported high acceptance of CBT for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, with low rates of noncompletion, drop out, and treatment refusal. Even though 35% of patients in this study had incomplete data, active treatment withdrawal in the intervention group was 6%, and only 2 of the 9 participants who withdrew actively reported the treatment as the reason for dropping out.

The pragmatic design of the present study, including the wide inclusion criteria, makes it relevant for general practitioners. A recent study of a very similar intervention in a primary health care context showed beneficial effects for people with persistent physical symptoms, including fatigue, pain, and brain fog.

Strengths and Limitations

Strengths of the study include the pragmatic approach where the intervention was fully embedded in the daily work and routines of an outpatient clinic. This increases external validityand makes the results applicable to a general population with PCC in need of rehabilitation. Furthermore, the sample size was larger than similar intervention studies on PCC and PIFS, and the primary outcome measure (SF-36-PFS) is generally recognized as a valid and reliable outcome measure for intervention trials in the field.

Limitations include the single-center approach and the lack of blinding for group allocation due to the nature of the intervention, which implies that the placebo effect cannot be controlled for. Furthermore, patients were moderately impaired and almost exclusively nonhospitalized, and the results may thus not be generalizable to patients with more disabling sequelae following severe, acute COVID-19. Similarly, current definitions of PCC are broad and based on clinical attributes alone; future identification of subgroups might elucidate which groups the current treatment is most relevant for, either alone or with treatments targeting core pathophysiologic mechanisms. The attention given to patients in the intervention group was not matched with that of the CAU group; still, most patients in the CAU group received medical care that can affect patient-reported outcome measures, conceivably reducing the impact of not including a sham intervention in the control group. Although no statistical evidence indicates nonrandom missingness, the possibility cannot be ruled out, particularly given the noticeable differences in missing data proportions between the intervention and CAU groups. Objective measures of physical and social function (eg, steps per day and work attendance) were not included but could have yielded valuable information; however, as the diagnosis of PCC is based on patients' self-report, patient-reported outcomes appear to be most relevant for evaluation of a rehabilitation program.

### Blood-brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment [^115hcq3m]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Several lines of research suggested that breakdown to the integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and subsequent brain penetration of serum components and cytokines is responsible for the neurological manifestations after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The BBB is formed by endothelial cells lining cerebral blood vessels and supported by surrounding cells including astrocytes, pericytes, microglia, neurons and the acellular basement membrane. The barrier is characterized by an enrichment of interendothelial tight junction proteins, several luminal and abluminal transporters, and luminal efflux transporters, which together maintain separation of the blood and brain and tightly regulate molecular trafficking between the blood and brain and vice versa.

There is clear evidence of microvascular injury in the brains of deceased patients with COVID-19, including fibrinogen leakage and thinning of the endothelial cell basal laminae in the olfactory bulb. A more comprehensive evaluation of the same cohort using spatial transcriptomics revealed more detailed vascular and immunological features of microvessels in the brain, including serum protein extravasation, platelet accumulation and coagulation system activation. Numerous studies also examined BBB-related changes and responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection or spike (S) protein treatment in postmortem tissue and animal models. However, the cerebrovascular pathology in patients and the underlying mechanisms of pathology are still unclear, especially in individuals with long COVID.

The lack of a specific neurological signature of the disease is interesting because other zoonotic betacoronaviruses often produce robust and predictable neurological injury. In humans, data from SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome also showed that neurological injury in humans is rare, strongly suggesting that, normally, the BBB provides robust neuroprotection from viral CNS invasion in most patients. The clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV2-induced BBB alterations in patients has not yet been reported.

In this study, we hypothesized that the neurological response to COVID may be due to BBB breakdown and subsequent extravasation of serum components. We show that BBB disruption is evident in patients with acute COVID with brain fog and a cohort of patients with persistent long COVID-associated brain fog. We suggest that measurement of BBB integrity may be a clinically useful biomarker of the neurological sequelae associated with COVID-19 in some patients. Added to this, targeted regulation of BBB integrity may also represent a new method of clinically managing patients with long COVID.

### Mid and long-term neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of post-COVID-19 syndrome: a meta-analysis [^116VPfqi]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Importance

Neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms that persist or develop three months after the onset of COVID-19 pose a significant threat to the global healthcare system. These symptoms are yet to be synthesized and quantified via meta-analysis.

Objective

To determine the prevalence of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported 12 weeks (3 months) or more after acute COVID-19 onset in adults.

Data Sources

A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Scopus was conducted for studies published between January 1st, 2020 and August 1st, 2021. The systematic review was guided by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses.

Study Selection

Studies were included if the length of follow-up satisfied the National Institute for Healthcare Excellence (NICE) definition of post-COVID-19 syndrome (symptoms that develop or persist ≥ 3 months after the onset of COVID-19). Additional criteria included the reporting of neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently extracted data on patient characteristics, hospital and/or ICU admission, acute-phase COVID-19 symptoms, length of follow-up, and neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Main Outcome(S) and Measure(S)

The primary outcome was the prevalence of neurological and neuropsychiatric symptoms reported ≥ 3 months post onset of COVID-19. We also compared post-COVID-19 syndrome in hospitalised vs. non-hospitalised patients, with vs. without ICU admission during the acute phase of infection, and with mid-term (3 to 6 months) and long-term (> 6 months) follow-up.

Results

Of 1458 articles, 19 studies, encompassing a total of 11,324 patients, were analysed. Overall prevalence for neurological post-COVID-19 symptoms were: fatigue (37%, 95% CI: 24%-50%), brain fog (32%, 9%-55%), memory issues (27%, 18%-36%), attention disorder (22%, 10%-34%), myalgia (18%, 4%-32%), anosmia (12%, 7%-17%), dysgeusia (11%, 4%-17%) and headache (10%, 1%-21%). Neuropsychiatric conditions included sleep disturbances (31%, 18%-43%), anxiety (23%, 13%-33%) and depression (12%, 7%-21%). Neuropsychiatric symptoms substantially increased in prevalence between mid- and long-term follow-up. Compared to non-hospitalised patients, patients hospitalised for acute COVID-19 had reduced frequency of anosmia, anxiety, depression, dysgeusia, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and sleep disturbance at three (or more) months post-infection. Conversely, hospital admission was associated with higher frequency of memory issues (OR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.4–2.3). Cohorts with > 20% of patients admitted to the ICU during acute COVID-19 experienced higher prevalence of fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances than cohorts with < 20% of ICU admission.

Conclusions and Relevance

Fatigue, cognitive dysfunction (brain fog, memory issues, attention disorder) and sleep disturbances appear to be key features of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Psychiatric manifestations (sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression) are common and increase significantly in prevalence over time. Randomised controlled trials are necessary to develop intervention strategy to reduce disease burden.

### Long COVID-ACOEM guidance statement [^116MH3n9]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Long COVID — "brain fog", neurologic symptoms, and cognitive impairment show that persistent cognitive dysfunction after acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is more likely in those with severe illness or who were admitted to the ICU; among those hospitalized, moderate or severe cognitive deficits were associated with elevated inflammatory markers 5 months after the acute illness, and cognitive changes in those who did not feel recovered persisted through almost 2 years of follow-up; in a small study involving 29 patients with persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19, including 79% reporting problems with memory and 93% with concentration complaints, symptomatic patients had similar performance on the NIH Toolbox battery as controls; in a study of 200 patients, an average of 125 days since a positive COVID-19 test, self-reported neurocognitive dysfunction did not correlate with quantitative testing, although self-reported cognitive symptoms were associated with depression and anxiety.

### COVID-19 severity is related to poor executive function in people with post-COVID conditions [^111AtsXP]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) condition (PCC) manifests 3 months after the onset of the disease, and presents with symptoms that remain for at least 2 months and cannot be explained by other diseases. PCC is characterized by a wide variety of fixed or fluctuating symptoms, including cognitive complaints. While 60%-80% of patients with PCC report experiencing brain fog, memory, loss of attentional focus, and language disturbances, objective evaluations of people with PCC have shown impairments in attention, processing speed, memory, and executive functions.

The severity of COVID-19 and post-COVID cognitive impairment assessed through systematic neuropsychological assessments was first shown to be related in hospitalized patients with acute disease. Intensive care unit (ICU) stay has been linked to reduced executive function, and the need for oxygen therapy has been linked to reduced performance in several cognitive measures 10–40 days after hospital discharge. Over the medium-long term, the general severity of acute illness has been related to residual cognitive deficits, treatment required for respiratory symptoms has been related to worse global cognitive performance, respiratory distress to lower processing speed, and hypoxemia to impaired long-term memory and visuospatial learning at five months but not at the one-year evolution.

Additional evidence has been obtained from studies comparing hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. In comparison with non-hospitalized patients, hospitalized individuals are more likely to have impairments in attention, executive functioning, category fluency, and verbal memory or slower processing speed. Post-ICU patients showed a lower cognitive composite score than non-ICU patients. However, among non-ICU patients, the cognitive composite score did not differ between those who were hospitalized and those who were not. In a similar study performed with a healthy control (HC) group, patients with severe PCC showed lower processing speed than those with mild-moderate PCC and healthy control participants. In a Finnish study, both ICU and hospitalized patients underperformed patients treated at home in the total cognitive score at 6 months post-COVID. Moreover, ICU participants underperformed hospitalized patients and HCs in the attention domain.

### Autonomic dysfunction related to postacute SARS-CoV-2 syndrome [^113u2rQc]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Persistence of symptoms beyond the initial acute phase of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is termed postacute SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) and includes neurologic, autonomic, pulmonary, cardiac, psychiatric, gastrointestinal, and functional impairment. PASC autonomic dysfunction can present with dizziness, tachycardia, sweating, headache, syncope, labile blood pressure, exercise intolerance, and "brain fog". A multidisciplinary team can help manage this complex syndrome with nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions.

### Alzheimer' s-like signaling in brains of COVID-19 patients [^111S3cyg]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

The present study was limited to the use of existing autopsy brain tissues at the Columbia University Biobank from SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients. The number of subjects is small and information on their cognitive function as well as their brain histopathology and levels of Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma are lacking. Furthermore, we did not have access to a suitable animal model of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in which to test whether the observed biochemical changes in COVID‐19 brains and potential cognitive and behavioral deficits associated with the brain fog of long COVID could be reversed or attenuated by therapeutic interventions. The design of future studies should include larger numbers of subjects that are age‐ and sex‐matched. The cognitive function of SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients who presented cognitive symptoms should be assessed and regularly monitored. Moreover, it is important to know whether the observed neuropathological signaling is unique to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or are common to all other viral infections. Previous studies have reported cognitive impairment in Middle East respiratory syndromeas well as Ebola, patients. Retrospective studies comparing the incidence and the magnitude of cognitive impairments caused by these different viral infections would improve our understanding of these neurological complications of viral infections.

### Systematic review of interventions for mental health, cognition and psychological well-being in long COVID [^117TR6Df]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Although acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 can be mild and time limited, with recovery over days or weeks, a subset of patients experience long-term symptoms, which can persist for months or years after the acute infection. This is referred to as long COVID or post-COVID-19 condition, among other terms.WHO defines long COVID as 'the continuation or development of new symptoms three months after the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with these symptoms lasting for at least 2 months with no other explanation'. Long COVID is associated with a wide range of enduring symptoms that appear to be similar to other postviral syndromes, and which can have substantial impacts on patient well-being.

The prevalence of long COVID appears to be around 13.9% among adults who experience an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, long COVID can affect patients with SARS-CoV-2 regardless of hospitalisation status or the severity of initial infection. Symptoms of long COVID appear to be multisystemic and include neuropsychiatric symptoms. Some of the most common symptoms include fatigue, dyspnoea, 'brain fog' or cognitive dysfunction, headache, attention problems. Mental health symptoms and conditions are associated with long COVID, including generalised anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and post-traumatic stress disorder. Substantial impacts on mental health, well-being and coping with the challenges of everyday life have been noted by patients.

### Long COVID: post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 with a cardiovascular focus [^116Nfrrg]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Long COVID and epidemiology of cardiac symptoms

The term 'long COVID' was originally coined by a patient, and asserts the notion that suffering does not stop with resolution of acute infection. While there is no universally accepted definition, in December 2020 the United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelinesdefined long COVID as persistence of symptoms beyond 4 weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This term comprises two phases: ongoing symptomatic phase (4–12 weeks) and post-COVID-19 syndrome (> 12 weeks) based on the duration of symptoms. More recently, the World Health Organization provided a case definition for post-COVID-19 condition, a term used to refer to persistence of symptoms beyond 3 months of SARS-CoV-2 infection, lasting for at least 2 months and not explained by any other illness. Other terms used to describe long COVID include post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, and long-haul COVID.

Long COVID is a vacillating disease, characterized by a diverse range of symptoms spanning multiple organ systems, as depicted in Figure 1 and Graphical Abstract, and commonly includes fatigue, breathlessness, post-exertional malaise (PEM), brain fog, headaches, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, depression, skin rash, joint pain, and palpitations. Patient advocacy groups(e.g. long COVID SOS, COVID Advocacy Exchange, the National Patient Advocate Foundation COVID Care Resource Center, long-haul COVID fighters, Body Politic COVID-19 Support Group) have enhanced our understanding of this disease by drawing our attention to its multifaceted nature. Several experts, have noted its marked similarities with other post-viral symptoms (e.g. Epstein-Barr, human herpesvirus, influenza, SARS, and Ebola viruses), although few options exist for the management of such syndromes.

### Inflammatory pathways in patients with post-acute sequelae of COVID-19: the role of the clinical immunologist [^1159XGCs]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progressed, some survivors noted prolonged symptoms after acute infection, termed post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or "long COVID". PASC is a significant clinical and public health concern that adversely affects patients' quality of life, income, and health care expenses. Moreover, PASC symptoms are highly heterogeneous, the most common being fatigue and cognitive impairment, and they likely reflect a spectrum of clinical phenotypes. The proposed role of persistent inflammation is one of leading pathophysiological theories. This review article addresses these proposed mechanisms of persistent and aberrant inflammation, their clinical evaluation, and theoretical approaches to management. A review of public databases was used to collect literature for the review. The literature supports a prominent role of persistent and aberrant inflammation as a major contributor to the symptoms of PASC. Proposed mechanisms for persistent inflammation include reactivation of latent viruses, viral persistence, loss of immunoregulatory pathways, autoimmune mechanisms, and/or mast cell dysregulation. Persistent inflammation may result in constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, body aches, and/or organ-specific dysfunction, such as gastrointestinal dysregulation and myocardial inflammation. There are no approved or even proven therapies for PASC at this time, but some studies have identified therapeutic options that may either reduce the risk for progression to PASC or decrease symptom burden. Laboratory evaluation and therapeutic options are limited and require further investigation to establish their clinical value. A more refined definition of PASC is needed to address the wide variety of clinical presentations, pathophysiology, and therapeutic options.

### Neurological implications of COVID-19: a review of the science and clinical guidance [^116BQSbe]. BMJ Neurology Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion of neurological manifestations of COVID-19

From our review of the literature, it is evident that the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are common, varied and contribute significantly to the morbidity of the disease. While complications such as encephalopathy predictably affect the older population, inflammatory and thromboembolic complications affects younger patients and do not completely correlate with the severity of disease.

In addition to the immediate neurological manifestations of the disease, there are increasing reports of postinfectious fatigue and cognitive 'fog'. Postviral fatigue has been reported in other viral infections, including the coronaviridae such as SARS. In a pandemic, this illness may contribute to significant morbidity and economic burden. Ongoing international collaboration to characterise the extrapulmonary manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are required in order to best frame the long-term care of patients as we recover from the pandemic.

Indirect implications of the pandemic for neurologists

To quote Charles Hummel, ' your greatest danger is letting the urgent things crowd out the important '. As neurologists, especially in Australia, we have played a minor direct role in front-line patient care. However, the indirect effect on the management of chronic disease is also profound, with significant reallocation of healthcare resources and altered patient consulting patterns. This section summarises the current guidance of management of neurological disease in the era of the pandemic.

In considering the management of chronic disease, individual patient preferences and circumstances must take precedence. As such, the following sections should be considered as general guidelines only. In all patients with chronic neurological conditions, an adequate supply of regular and rescue medications should be maintained, and telehealth consultations considered where appropriate. In-person visits and elective hospitalisation should be reduced and deferred whenever possible. As the primary treating clinicians, advanced care planning should be discussed with patients and their families and clearly communicated with all care providers.

The most significant change in providing neurological care has been the widespread adoption of telemedicine. The American Academy of Neurology has resources available fromand comprehensive advice on conducting remote neurological examinations can be found at.

Specific considerations including suggestions from The Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand and Australian and New Zealand Society of Respiratory Sciences and The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists in investigation of neurological patients during the pandemic are addressed in table 2. The investigation of neurology patients will vary depending on the rate of community transmission, risk and yield of the test for an individual patient, however general recommendations are summarised in table 2.

### Long COVID syndrome-associated brain fog [^116cxB4Y]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

We investigated the frequency of brain fog in a large cohort of patients with documented coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) who have survived the illness. We also scrutinized the potential risk factors associated with the development of brain fog. Adult patients (18–55 years of age), who were referred to the healthcare facilities anywhere in Fars province from February 19, 2020 to November 20, 2020 were included. All patients had a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. In a phone call, at least 3 months after their discharge from the hospital, we obtained their current information. A questionnaire was specifically designed for data collection. In total, 2696 patients had the inclusion criteria; 1680 (62.3%) people reported long COVID syndrome (LCS). LCS-associated brain fog was reported by 194 (7.2%) patients. Female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 1.4), respiratory problems at the onset (OR: 1.9), and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR: 1.7) were significantly associated with reporting chronic post-COVID "brain fog" by the patients. In this large population-based study, we report that chronic post-COVID "brain fog" has significant associations with sex (female), respiratory symptoms at the onset, and the severity of the illness (ICU admission).

### Characterizing predictors and chronicity of brain fog in long COVID [^113ggo62]. Psychiatry Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Long COVID is a chronic illness that persists following COVID-19 infection, with fatigue and brain fog as the most frequent complaints. However, there is no objective case definition for brain fog in long COVID and chronicity of symptoms remains unclear. This study recruited two waves of participants: those with a history of COVID-19, who participated in 2023 (N = 793, age = 38.5 ± 13.2, 44% female, 35.1% long COVID) and a follow up cohort collected in 2024 of participants who qualified as having long COVID at time point 1 (N = 119, 61 female, 58 male). Participants completed questionnaires and cognitive tasks from home. We trained a binary classification model for long COVID diagnosis (73% accuracy) and a linear regression model for cognitive complaints (RMS error 5.8). A long COVID diagnosis at timepoint 1 was classified by biopsychosocial variables including stress, social support, and sex (women more likely). Symptom clustering revealed that phenotypes with both mental and physical health symptoms were predictive of brain fog, but not phenotypes with only sleep-related or physical symptoms. Markers of brain fog included slower reading and typing, slower reaction times in cognitive tasks, and changes in information processing speed and thresholds for making choices. Timepoint 2 data showed that the majority (82.4%) of participants did not remit from long COVID. These findings highlight the complex biopsychosocial factors that predict having long COVID with brain fog, and the need for interventions to improve remission rates.

### Post-COVID-19 vaccination (or long vax) syndrome: putative manifestation, pathophysiology, and therapeutic options [^114u2ntB]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2025). Medium credibility.

With the global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, vaccine safety remains a priority. Emerging concerns have raised the potential risk of a long COVID-like syndrome following vaccination, informally called long Vax and provisionally termed post-COVID-19 vaccination syndrome (PCVS). Our narrative review describes the putative manifestation, pathophysiology, and therapeutic approaches of PCVS based on the available evidence, mostly from case reports/series and observational studies. Our review noted that PCVS typically manifests within days to weeks post-vaccination, with symptoms lasting months to years. PCVS may present as recognized diagnoses such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), small-fibre neuropathy (SFN), myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), or as long-term sequelae of myocarditis, vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopaenia (VITT), or immune thrombocytopaenia purpura (ITP). Symptomatically, PCVS overlaps with long COVID, such as fatigue and brain fog, but PCVS may involve more frequent paraesthesia and less dyspnoea. We also review pathophysiological hypotheses of PCVS, focussing on the vaccine-derived spike protein and related immune responses. Finally, we discuss potential therapies used to treat patients with PCVS or related conditions, primarily documented in case reports/series, which could guide future clinical research. Overall, PCVS remains a poorly understood condition that requires more research to elucidate its prevalence, prognosis, risk factors, and treatments.

### Blood-brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment [^113Es4G9]. Nature Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Long COVID is a substantial burden in many patients after recovery from COVID-19. Patients describe fatigue, memory loss and dyspnea as some of the key symptoms of long COVID, while another subset of patients describe 'brain fog' like the one commonly reported in postconcussive syndrome and chronic fatigue syndrome. Our data suggest that BBB disruption occurs during acute infection and long COVID, where it is strongly associated with cognitive impairment. Our work provides objective evidence for a link between BBB disruption and cognitive impairment within a cohort of patients with long COVID. Further longitudinal studies are required to examine changes in BBB permeability over time and in other postviral illnesses; however, targeted regulation of BBB integrity could now potentially be considered for the treatment of patients with brain fog associated with long COVID.

Our study has some limitations. First, we did not have access to CSF samples from our cohort to confirm molecular BBB breakdown in those with brain fog. However, other studies found increased CSF permeability and BBB disruption in a subset of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with elevated Q-albumin ratios that correlated with markers of inflammation. Patients with severe neurological complications from SARS-CoV-2 infection have an increased CSF Q-albumin ratio indicating BBB disruption, coupled with elevated CSF proteins, such as IL-8, which are associated with BBB disruption. Blood–CSF barrier breakdown was the most frequent pathological finding in a multicenter study of 127 patients with COVID-19 with neurological impairment.

Second, we did not examine longitudinal changes in BBB function in our cohort with long COVID; it will be important to determine how long it takes for individuals to recover and if there is resolution of BBB function and prolonged inflammation. As many as half of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported no, or incomplete, recovery between 6 and 18 months after infection with 11% reporting deterioration in symptoms. Understanding the long-term outcome of long COVID will be critical to develop treatment options for this large group of individuals.

Our study is also limited by a small sample size. Future studies with larger patient cohorts should perform unbiased proteome profiling on blood and CSF samples. In agreement with our study, another study also found elevated levels of markers of neurological injury and BBB disruption, such as GFAP, in individuals with long COVID with self-reported neurological symptoms. Ultimately, expanding the use of clinical tools focused on understanding the role of the BBB in postviral illnesses may lead to better treatment and management strategies for patients in the future.

Regarding medical management for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to management of neuropsychiatric and neurological complications, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients as soon as possible when presenting with rapidly developing neurological symptoms suggestive of stroke, and follow standard stroke protocols including systemic thrombolysis and/or intra-arterial thrombectomy, if indicated. Signs and symptoms of stroke can include weakness of limbs or face, sensory loss, speech difficulties, impairment of vision, ataxia, confusion, or decreased consciousness. Follow standard infection prevention and control measures during the clinical evaluation, neuroimaging or procedures for patients with stroke.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

PASC-CVS — definition, symptoms, diagnostic timing, and management: PASC-CVS is a heterogeneous disorder that includes widely ranging cardiovascular symptoms without objective evidence of cardiovascular disease using standard diagnostic tests, with exercise intolerance and tachycardia commonly reported along with chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, cognitive complaints (memory impairment, attention deficit, poor executive function/brain fog), sleep disturbance or nonrestorative sleep, and postexertional malaise. There are no established timelines for diagnosis; PASC-CVS should be considered when cardiovascular symptoms persist beyond a timeframe typical for the severity of acute infection and projected recovery based on a person's age and underlying health status, and it may be reasonable to consider PASC when symptoms persist beyond 4 weeks after mild acute infection, as opposed to waiting more than 12 weeks as suggested in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and World Health Organization definitions. Where possible, evaluation and management strategies for the most common PASC-CVD entities should follow existing guideline recommendations.

### Cognitive domains affected post-COVID-19; a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1138R7fU]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

As seen in previous coronavirus epidemics, a significant proportion of patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 develop cognitive (neuropsychological) sequelae from the infection, and a significant proportion of these persist long term. Post‐COVID‐19 condition is defined by National Institutes of Health guidance as symptoms present 3 months from the onset of COVID‐19 with symptoms that have lasted at least 2 months and cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. Cognitive impairment appears to be common after recovering from COVID‐19 disease, with an estimated 18%–36% of people affected depending on whether subjective or objective measures are used, and 32% of patients reporting subjective 'brain fog' over 3 months after the initial infection.

Meta‐analysis demonstrates a prevalence of objectively measured global cognitive impairment of 22% at 12 weeks or more following COVID‐19 infection, compared to infected controls, and similar persistent cognitive impairment can be seen in formal testing even in those without persistent COVID‐19 symptomology. Early reports suggested that COVID‐19 patients suffered from a dysexecutive syndrome during acute infection; however, a detailed, domain‐specific phenotype of cognitive impairment occurring in individuals in this post‐acute phase is yet to be established.

An acute‐phase dysexecutive syndrome may suggest frontal lobe pathology, but the neurobiological basis of post‐COVID‐19 cognitive impairment remains unclear, with multiple and multifactorial aetiologies being proposed. Likely mediators include the well‐established cognitive sequelae of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, acute respiratory distress syndrome and delirium. The medium‐ and long‐term cognitive symptoms experienced by those with asymptomatic or mild effects from the initial infection suggest a separate aetiology to those seen in patients with more direct effects such as stroke or encephalitis. Although there is literature on how general severity of COVID‐19 illness may affect cognitive symptoms, fewer studies have explored how the presence of neurological sequelae in this context might affect outcomes.

Elucidating the pattern of cognitive impairment is key to understanding this pathophysiology, improving diagnosis and formulating management options for a condition that is likely to have an impact on quality of life, economic output and societal engagement.

The aims of this review were therefore (1) to identify which primary cognitive domains are impaired in this population and, if present, whether these change over time, (2) to identify which neuropsychological tasks were used and how impairment was defined and (3) to establish whether any demographic or clinical factors predict the presence, and/or severity, of this impairment.

### Persistent COVID-19 symptoms in a community study of 606, 434 people in england [^116gqhqa]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The UK has experienced one of the largest epidemics of COVID-19 in Europe. As a new disease, the natural history beyond the immediate illness and the possible long-term sequelae remain largely unknown. As well as the acute risk of hospitalisation and death from COVID-19, some people who develop symptoms have a prolonged and debilitating illness that may continue for weeks or months –. This has been called post-COVID syndromeor Long COVID, a term first coined by people sharing their experience of ongoing symptoms on social media and establishing support groups.

The frequency, nature and duration of persistent symptoms from COVID-19 are poorly understood and represent a major knowledge gap if effective treatments and management strategies are to be developed. Reported symptoms include severe fatigue, breathlessness, chest pain or heaviness, fever, palpitations, cognitive impairment ('brain fog'), loss of sense of smell (anosmia), loss of sense of taste (ageusia), skin rash and joint pain or swelling –. Estimates of symptom prevalence and persistence vary substantially, arguably due to heterogeneous study designs and syndrome definitions –. It has been suggested that Long COVID describes a group of disparate conditions, including post-viral syndromes, long-term tissue or organ damage and ongoing inflammation.

Occurrence of Long COVID appears to be associated with the severity of COVID-19; for example, high prevalence of persistent symptoms has been reported among people hospitalised with COVID-19 –. The number of acute symptoms has also been associated with risk of Long COVID, alongside older age and female sex.

While many Long COVID studies so far have focused on hospitalised COVID-19 cases –, here we report data from random community-based samples of the population in England. These involved more than 600,000 people who took part in rounds three to five (main analysis) and round six (replication) of the Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission-2 (REACT-2) study between September 2020 and May 2021. Among participants reporting symptoms lasting 12 weeks or more following suspected or confirmed COVID-19, we estimate symptom prevalence, investigate co-occurrence of symptoms and assess risk factors for persistence of symptoms.

### Neuropsychiatric disorders following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^116epjQ7]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Several large-scale electronic health records studies have reported increased diagnostic rates for neuropsychiatric disorders following Coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19 or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 infection)], but many questions remain. To highlight the issues, we selectively review this literature, focusing on mood disorder, anxiety disorder, psychotic disorder, and cognitive impairment ('brain fog'). Eight key questions are addressed, comprising: (i) the nature and magnitude of the risks; (ii) their association with severity of infection; (iii) their duration; (iv) whether the risks differ between adults and children, or between men and women; (v) whether prior vaccination protects against them; (vi) the risk profile associated with different SARS-CoV-2 strains; (vii) what the underlying mechanisms might be; and (viii) whether the sequelae can be predicted. We consider the major unknowns, the limitations of electronic health records for research in this area, and the use of additional approaches to help characterize and understand the neuropsychiatric burden of COVID-19.

### The modified COVID-19 yorkshire rehabilitation scale (C19-YRSm) patient-reported outcome measure for long COVID or post-COVID-19 syndrome [^1146YXdB]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Long Covid (LC) is a term coined by patients. It refers to persistent symptoms 4 weeks after contracting COVID‐19. Ongoing symptomatic COVID‐19 and post‐COVID‐19 syndrome (PCS) are the scientific terms for symptoms 4–12 and > 12 weeks after the illness, respectively.PCS affects more than two million individuals in the UK alone and more than 50 million cases worldwide. More than 200 symptoms across 10 organ systems have been reported. The most common symptoms are breathlessness, fatigue, palpitations, dizziness, pain, brain fog (cognitive problems), anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, skin rash, and allergic reactions. It can be a remitting and relapsing condition with a prolonged course causing significant distress and disability in some individuals.

A multidisciplinary team (MDT) of rehabilitation professionals working with patients recovering from COVID‐19 during the first wave of the pandemic developed the original version of C19‐YRS. The content was based on staff experience in managing these patients, knowledge from our systematic review of previous outbreaks, and feedback on the scale from patients and healthcare professionals. The content was decided using a consensus method. The scale was kept balanced in terms of questions spanning all aspects of 2001 WHO International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) framework. The scale's content validity was supported by studies, using the scale, which revealed symptoms and functional problems similar to other PCS studies reported in the literature.

C‐19 YRS was the first validated scale reported in the literature to capture PCS symptoms and grade the severity of symptoms and functional disability in PCS. The scale has been recommended in the NHS England Clinical Guidance for PCS services and NICE rapid guidelines. The scale has been translated to numerous international languages and is currently used in many PCS studies worldwide. There is also a digital format of the scale available where the patient can complete the questionnaire on a smartphone application; the clinician can access the results on a web portal; both the patient and the clinician can use the system to monitor progress and response to ongoing treatments for PCS.

Therapeutic options for long COVID‐related symptoms

2.3 Outcomes

Primary outcomes were the clinical course with a futuristic overview, evaluation of the effectiveness of treatment for each manifestation, and risk factors affecting the recovery period of long COVID. Fatigue, smell disturbance, fever, headache/arthralgia, respiratory manifestations, digestive symptoms, circulatory disturbance, sleep disorder, hair loss, brain fog, and dizziness were separately assessed as distinct manifestations of long COVID in the analysis. For the validation of the recovery period, the clinical courses were divided into four groups: good (within a month or less), moderate (within 2 months), slow (within 3 months), and resistance (3 months or more). Clinical outcomes were measured at more than 3 months of follow‐up, depending on the condition. The secondary outcome was the relationship between serum transaminase levels and fatigue determined by measuring blood samples from 164 selected patients.

2.4 Statistical analysis

Demographic and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). The χ 2 test was used to compare distributions of categorical variables in Tables 3, 4, 5, 6. Significant levels were set at p < 0.05. In the comparison of improvement of complaints after treatment, Bonferroni adjustment was conducted for each test separately to consider the number of significant tests undertaken.

### Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome negatively impacts physical function, cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation [^116SU8fu]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This report describes persistent symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS) and the impact of these symptoms on physical function, cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation.

Design

This study used a cross-sectional observational study design. Patients attending Mount Sinai's post-acute COVID-19 syndrome clinic completed surveys containing patient-reported outcomes.

Results

A total of 156 patients completed the survey, at a median (range) time of 351 days (82–457 days) after COVID-19 infection. All patients were prevaccination. The most common persistent symptoms reported were fatigue (n = 128, 82%), brain fog (n = 105, 67%), and headache (n = 94, 60%). The most common triggers of symptom exacerbation were physical exertion (n = 134, 86%), stress (n = 107, 69%), and dehydration (n = 77, 49%). Increased levels of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) and dyspnea (Medical Research Council) were reported, alongside reductions in levels of regularly completed physical activity. Ninety-eight patients (63%) scored for at least mild cognitive impairment (Neuro-Qol), and the domain of the EuroQol: 5 dimension, 5 level most impacted was Self-care, Anxiety/Depression and Usual Activities.

Conclusions

Persistent symptoms associated with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome seem to impact physical and cognitive function, health-related quality of life, and participation in society. More research is needed to further clarify the relationship between COVID-19 infection and post-acute COVID-19 syndrome symptoms, the underlying mechanisms, and treatment options.

### Background to new treatments for COVID-19, including its chronicity, through altering elements of the cytokine storm [^116YNuwf]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

One predictable consequence of chronically increased brain TNF is the continuing loss of the subtle TNF homeostasis we all depend on for learning, memory, and normal behaviour, becoming disrupted in the chronic neurodegenerative states associated with excessive CNS TNF. Persistent aspects of COVID‐19 include fatigue, cognition and memory failure, myalgia, dysgeusia, anosmia. Poor cognitive and memory function are often mentioned, along with 'brain fog'. These changes are consistent with those recorded as having been ameliorated by perispinally administered etanercept in post‐stroke syndromes. This is not surprising, since apart from the sources of excess cerebral TNF in COVID‐19, cerebral hypoxia is an obvious outcome of stroke caused by the TNF‐induced disseminated coagulopathy noted in Section 1. Clearly, a trial of perispinal etanercept in patients with post‐COVID‐19 neurological changes is of interest. Other manifestation of random excessive cerebral TNF levels are likely to be observed in post‐COVID‐19 neuropsychiatric syndromes. These can begin during the acute phase, and often persist. As Troyersummarises, SARS and MERS present a similar picture. The neuropsychiatric literature has discussed a role for cerebral TNF in the pathogenesis of these conditions for some years.

### Treatment experiences, preferences, and expectations for cognitive impairments in long COVID among Chinese young and older adults: a constructivist grounded theory study [^111cGo9f]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Young adults in our study demonstrated a preference for non-pharmacological interventions to manage cognitive symptoms, while older adults tended towards a balanced approach combining pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies. Both groups emphasised the importance of addressing psychological well-being, although older adults also expressed concerns about physical symptoms, which some attributed to age-related health decline or overall physical condition. For example, a young participant stated, "But what I feel is that the older generation, and even society as a whole, don't seem to care much about younger people dealing with symptoms like brain fog. So, I really hope that the mental health of young people like us, who are going through long COVID, can get the attention it truly deserves" (man, 20 s). An older participant shared, "I feel like it's not just about the brain symptoms. I really hope the physical symptoms can improve as well. After all, as we get older, our overall health tends to decline, and many symptoms often occur together. So for someone like me, as an older adult, I just hope to achieve a full recovery for my body, and of course, that includes mental health too" (man, 70 s).

### Post-COVID-19 condition: clinical phenotypes, pathophysiological mechanisms, pathology, and management strategies [^116Xm4ZV]. The Journal of Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19), driven by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), has had a lasting impact on human well‐being and global healthcare over the past years. Although significant strides have been made to combat acute COVID‐19, now considered endemic, some survivors go on to develop lingering symptoms long after acute infection, a condition widely known as 'Post‐COVID‐19 condition' (PCC) or 'long COVID'. Other common terms used to describe long‐term health effects of COVID‐19 include 'post‐acute sequelae of SARS‐CoV‐2 (PASC)', 'post‐acute COVID‐19 syndrome (PCS)', or 'long haulers syndrome'. The definitions of PCC are broad, complicating efforts to capture the diverse manifestations of the condition comprehensively. Referring to specific syndromes rather than the general term PCC would likely improve its understandibility. The World Health Organization adopted the term PCC to describe long‐term symptoms persisting or newly emerging at least 3 months following acute SARS‐CoV‐2 infection that continue for at least 2 months without any other identifiable cause. The condition is a clinical diagnosis due to the lack of definitive laboratory tests or established biomarkers.

PCC can present with a wide range of symptoms – over 200 have been identified – that are multiple organ system‐specific, affecting, among others, the nervous, respiratory, cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and urinary organ systems. Common clinical symptoms include dyspnoea, fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction (also known as 'brain fog'). These symptoms can fluctuate over time, but often disrupt daily life. Individuals particularly at risk of developing PCC include the elderly, females, those who are not (or insufficiently) vaccinated, individuals who experienced severe acute COVID‐19 requiring hospitalisation, and those with (multiple) comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, and obesity. These comorbidities can, individually or in combination, exacerbate or be exacerbated by PCC. However, PCC can affect individuals of all ages, genders, and ethnicities, including those who were previously healthy, vaccinated, and had only mild initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infections. In fact, since the majority of individuals with acute COVID‐19 were not hospitalised, most people with PCC had only mild initial illness. The reasons why some people fully recover from COVID‐19 while others develop PCC remain unclear.

### Cognitive rehabilitation improved self-reported cognitive skills in individuals with long COVID: an observational study [^114LimDb]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the effects of cognitive rehabilitation provided to patients with lingering cognitive difficulties or "brain fog" after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Outpatient rehabilitation setting.

Participants

Seventy consecutive patients with Long COVID who were referred from a Neuro-COVID clinic and evaluated and treated by speech-language pathologists.

Interventions

Usual care cognitive rehabilitation.

Main Outcome Measures

Patients completed the Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Cognition Function Short Form and the Rivermead Behavioral Memory Test Story Recall assessments before and after treatment. Demographics, goals, treatment frequency/duration, and interventions were analyzed to determine treatment outcomes and patterns of care.

Results

Of 70 patients, 83% were never hospitalized for COVID-19, the average age was 46.5 years, 77% were women, and 69% were White. There were no differences in demographics, race, ethnicity, or objective cognitive measures before starting treatment between the 50 individuals who completed their plan of care (POC) versus the 20 who did not. However, patients who did not complete their POC reported higher anxiety before treatment. Patients with higher anxiety before treatment demonstrated less improvement in cognitive quality of life measures after treatment. Of the 50 patients who completed their POC, 45 (90%) met all short-term goals. There was a significant increase in Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders Cognition Function scores from pre- to post- cognitive rehabilitation in 36 patients tested, but no significant differences in objective measures of memory in 23 patients tested.

Conclusions

Cognitive rehabilitation resulted in self-reported improvement in functional cognition. However, anxiety limited the favorable effect of treatment and should be addressed in conjunction with cognitive therapy to maximize outcomes.

### Stellate ganglion block reduces symptoms of long COVID: a case series [^111aBYTt]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2022). Medium credibility.

After recovering from COVID-19, a significant proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals develop Long COVID. Fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, brain fog, anosmia, and ageusia/dysgeusia in Long COVID resemble "sickness behavior", the autonomic nervous system response to pro-inflammatory cytokines (Dantzer et al., 2008). Aberrant network adaptation to sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance is expected to produce long-standing dysautonomia. Cervical sympathetic chain activity can be blocked with local anesthetic, allowing the regional autonomic nervous system to "reboot". In this case series, we successfully treated two Long COVID patients using stellate ganglion block, implicating dysautonomia in the pathophysiology of Long COVID and suggesting a novel treatment.

### Low-dose naltrexone improves post-COVID-19 condition symptoms [^113s4Wtc]. Clinical Therapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome can be adapted for post-COVID-19 condition. Our aim was to compare treatments in patients from our post-COVID-19 clinic.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study and included consecutive patients enrolled in our post-COVID-19 clinic. We included patients who received low-dose naltrexone, amitriptyline, duloxetine, and physical therapy, and evaluated improvements in fatigue, pain, dyspnea, and brain fog recorded in the electronic health record. We calculated the adjusted relative hazard of improvement using Cox proportional models. We adjusted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and prior COVID-19 hospitalization.

Findings

We included the first 108 patients with post-COVID-19 enrolled in the clinic. Most of the patients received amitriptyline. The relative hazard of improvement for those taking low-dose naltrexone was 5.04 (95% CI, 1.22–20.77; P = 0.02) compared with physical therapy alone. Both fatigue and pain were improved in patients taking low-dose naltrexone; only fatigue was improved in patients taking amitriptyline.

Implications

Post-COVID-19 condition symptoms may improve in patients taking medications adapted from myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome. Randomized controlled trials should evaluate these medications and translational studies should further evaluate their mechanisms of action.

### Interventions for mental health, cognition, and psychological wellbeing in long COVID: a systematic review of registered trials [^1145jMDJ]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

While COVID-19 infection is usually associated with a brief illness followed by recovery within weeks, many people experience prolonged symptoms months after acute infection (Liu et al.). Prolonged symptoms after an acute COVID-19 infection have been given a number of names, including long COVID, post-COVID syndrome, and COVID long haulers (Raveendran, Jayadevan, & Sashidharan). Long COVID is associated with a wide variety of symptoms, including fatigue, headaches, shortness of breath, loss of sense of smell, 'brain fog', cognitive impairment, neuropathy, muscle pain, sleep disturbance, and other multi-system symptoms, along with reduced mental health and impaired quality of life (Crook, Raza, Nowell, Young, & Edison; Malik et al; Maury, Lyoubi, Peiffer-Smadja, de Broucker, & Meppiel; Sudre et al.).

A meta-analytic estimate of the pooled prevalence of long COVID indicates that, around the world, some 43% of those who contract COVID-19 experience long-term symptoms (Chen et al.). Risk factors include female sex, pre-existing asthma, older age, obesity, comorbidities, and more severe acute COVID-19 symptoms (Cabrera Martimbianco, Pacheco, Bagattini, & Riera; Chen et al; Sudre et al.). Social isolation, decreased physical activity, changed lifestyles, and pandemic-related social and economic insecurities may contribute to developing the physical and psychological symptoms of long COVID (Cabrera Martimbianco et al; Marshall, Bibby, & Abbs). For some, long COVID may become a protracted, debilitating, multi-systemic disability (Alwan; Brown & O'Brien).

### Evaluation and treatment approaches for neurological post-acute sequelae of COVID-19: a consensus statement and scoping review from the global COVID-19 neuro research coalition [^116BqNf2]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Post-acute neurological sequelae of COVID-19 affect millions of people worldwide, yet little data is available to guide treatment strategies for the most common symptoms. We conducted a scoping review of PubMed/Medline from 1/1/2020–4/1/2023 to identify studies addressing diagnosis and treatment of the most common post-acute neurological sequelae of COVID-19 including: cognitive impairment, sleep disorders, headache, dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue, weakness, numbness/pain, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Utilizing the available literature and international disease-specific society guidelines, we constructed symptom-based differential diagnoses, evaluation and management paradigms. This pragmatic, evidence-based consensus document may serve as a guide for a holistic approach to post-COVID neurological care and will complement future clinical trials by outlining best practices in the evaluation and treatment of post-acute neurological signs/symptoms.

### Cognition and memory after COVID-19 in a large community sample [^116fKP5a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Cognitive symptoms after coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), are well-recognized. Whether objectively measurable cognitive deficits exist and how long they persist are unclear.

Methods

We invited 800,000 adults in a study in England to complete an online assessment of cognitive function. We estimated a global cognitive score across eight tasks. We hypothesized that participants with persistent symptoms (lasting ≥ 12 weeks) after infection onset would have objectively measurable global cognitive deficits and that impairments in executive functioning and memory would be observed in such participants, especially in those who reported recent poor memory or difficulty thinking or concentrating ("brain fog").

Results

Of the 141,583 participants who started the online cognitive assessment, 112,964 completed it. In a multiple regression analysis, participants who had recovered from Covid-19 in whom symptoms had resolved in less than 4 weeks or at least 12 weeks had similar small deficits in global cognition as compared with those in the no-Covid-19 group, who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 or had unconfirmed infection (-0.23 SD [95% confidence interval {CI}, -0.33 to -0.13] and -0.24 SD [95% CI, -0.36 to -0.12], respectively); larger deficits as compared with the no-Covid-19 group were seen in participants with unresolved persistent symptoms (-0.42 SD; 95% CI, -0.53 to -0.31). Larger deficits were seen in participants who had SARS-CoV-2 infection during periods in which the original virus or the B.1.1.7 variant was predominant than in those infected with later variants (e.g., -0.17 SD for the B.1.1.7 variant vs. the B.1.1.529 variant; 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.13) and in participants who had been hospitalized than in those who had not been hospitalized (e.g., intensive care unit admission, -0.35 SD; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.20). Results of the analyses were similar to those of propensity-score-matching analyses. In a comparison of the group that had unresolved persistent symptoms with the no-Covid-19 group, memory, reasoning, and executive function tasks were associated with the largest deficits (-0.33 to -0.20 SD); these tasks correlated weakly with recent symptoms, including poor memory and brain fog. No adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

Participants with resolved persistent symptoms after Covid-19 had objectively measured cognitive function similar to that in participants with shorter-duration symptoms, although short-duration Covid-19 was still associated with small cognitive deficits after recovery. Longer-term persistence of cognitive deficits and any clinical implications remain uncertain. (Funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research and others.).

### A cross-sectional study on the impact of unfair treatment associated with COVID-19 infection and psychological distress in Japanese workers [^112J2e5B]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Concerning biological mechanisms, symptoms of long COVID, including reduced ability to speak, remember, or concentrate, have been reported after infection. These cognitive sequelae are referred to as "brain fog" and recently proposed to be related to brain inflammation in depression. Activation of antibodies and deposition of amyloid aggregates are among the possible underlying mechanisms. – It has also been noted that the symptoms of long COVID are similar to those experienced by patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy and those with myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and mast cell activation syndrome. It has been suggested that mast cells stimulated by pathogenic viruses or stress stimuli may activate microglia and induce hypothalamic inflammation. Although we have referred to the biological effects of long COVID, our study did not examine biological aspects. The association between a history of COVID-19 infection and psychological distress was maintained even when unfair treatment was added as an adjustment factor in this study, indicating the need to study not only psychosocial aspects but also biological mechanisms.

Concerning socio-psychological factors, people in Japan with COVID-19 were originally required by law to be isolated for approximately 2 weeks in a hospital, convalescent hotel, or at home. Restrictions on home life and employment due to isolation are known to have psychological consequences. A study of Chinese youths reported increased suicidal ideation and self-harm after the strict COVID-19 social isolation policy was enforced. Moreover, the recommendation of social distancing as a countermeasure against the spread of COVID-19 led to spread of other problems worldwide, such as loneliness and isolation. Whereas spending time with family members during a pandemic reduces loneliness, social distancing among family members may exacerbate feeling of loneliness. In addition, the increasing number of infected persons in Japan resulted in scattered cases of infection within families. Fear that family members may become infected is associated with psychological distress. During a pandemic the family serves as a buffer, while the endangerment of family well-being can alter resilience. We mentioned the issues of loneliness and family relationships as one of the psychosocial factors. Although this study did not directly assess these factors, they may also be relevant to unfair treatment.

Post-acute manifestations after pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection include multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) and post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC), with "PASC… described in 4% to 66% of children after acute COVID-19". The post–COVID-19 period has also seen "an increased rate of some autoimmune complications, such as new-onset type 1 diabetes". PASC symptoms may involve multiple systems, including neurologic ("fatigue, sleep disorders, attention disorders, 'brain fog', headaches"), psychiatric ("anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder"), and pulmonary ("cough, dyspnea").

### Screening for brain fog: is the Montreal cognitive assessment an effective screening tool for neurocognitive complaints post-COVID-19? [^113vVPr9]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cognitive complaints are one of the most frequent symptoms reported in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC). The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been used to estimate prevalence of cognitive impairment in many studies of PASC, and is commonly employed as a screening test in this population, however, its validity has not been established.

Objective

To determine the utility of the MoCA to screen for cognitive impairment in PASC.

Methods

Sixty participants underwent neuropsychological, psychiatric, and medical assessments, as well as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, 6–8 months after acute COVID-19 infection.

Results

The overall sample had a mean score of 26.1 on the MoCA, with approximately one third screening below the cutoff score of 26, similar to the rate of extremely low NP test performance. MoCA score was inversely correlated with fatigue and depression measures and ethnic minority participants scored on average lower, despite similar education and estimated premorbid function. The MoCA had an accuracy of 63.3% at detecting any degree of diminished NP performance, and an accuracy of 73.3% at detecting extremely low NP performance.

Discussion/Conclusion

The MoCA may not be accurate for detecting neither mild nor more severe degrees of diminished NP test performance in PASC. Therefore, patients with persistent cognitive complaints in the setting of PASC who score in the normal range on the MoCA should be referred for formal NP assessment.

### Focused management of patients with severe acute brain injury and ARDS [^113CesUH]. Chest (2022). Medium credibility.

Considering the COVID-19 pandemic where concomitant occurrence of ARDS and severe acute brain injury (sABI) has increasingly coemerged, we synthesize existing data regarding the simultaneous management of both conditions. Our aim is to provide readers with fundamental principles and concepts for the management of sABI and ARDS, and highlight challenges and conflicts encountered while managing concurrent disease. Up to 40% of patients with sABI can develop ARDS. Although there are trials and guidelines to support the mainstays of treatment for ARDS and sABI independently, guidance on concomitant management is limited. Treatment strategies aimed at managing severe ARDS may at times conflict with the management of sABI. In this narrative review, we discuss the physiological basis and risks involved during simultaneous management of ARDS and sABI, summarize evidence for treatment decisions, and demonstrate these principles using hypothetical case scenarios. Use of invasive or noninvasive monitoring to assess brain and lung physiology may facilitate goal-directed treatment strategies with the potential to improve outcome. Understanding the pathophysiology and key treatment concepts for comanagement of these conditions is critical to optimizing care in this high-acuity patient population.

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were formulated using the Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome (PICO) principle:
Population: Adults (> 18 years) infected by SARS-CoV-2 and diagnosed with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Individuals could have been hospitalised or not by SARS-CoV-2 acute infection.
Intervention: Any type of COVID-19 vaccine. We included the following types of COVID-19 vaccines: BNT162b2 ("Pfizer/BioNTech"), AZD1222 ("Oxford-AstraZeneca"), mRNA-1273 ("Moderna"), and Ad26.COV2.S ("Janssen"). Vaccine doses can be administered before or after SARS-CoV-2 acute infection.
Comparison: Individuals not receiving any COVID-19 vaccine.
Outcome: Collection of multiple symptoms (post-COVID-19 or long-COVID) developed after a SARS-CoV-2 acute infection by personal, telephone, or electronic interviews. We included any type of symptom appearing after the infection e.g. physical (fatigue, pain), cognitive (brain fog, memory loss), respiratory (dyspnea, palpitations, cough), gastrointestinal (diarrhoea, stomachache, vomiting) or mental problems (depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances). Due to the different definitions of long-COVID, no specific follow-up period for the presence of symptoms after the acute infection was determined. Studies monitoring solely changes in immunologic or serologic biomarkers without assessment of post-COVID symptoms were excluded.

This review included observational cohort, cross-sectional, and case-control studies where samples of COVID-19 survivors, either hospitalised or non-hospitalised, were followed for presence of symptoms appearing after a SARS-CoV-2 acute infection before or after COVID-19 vaccination. Editorials, opinion, and correspondence articles were excluded.

Two authors reviewed the title and abstract of those publications identified in the databases. Duplicates were then removed. The title and abstract were screened for eligibility and posterior full-read text. Data including authors, country, sample size, setting, vaccination status, type of vaccine, clinical data, and post-COVID symptoms before and after vaccination were extracted from each study. Authors had to reach consensus on data extraction. Discrepancies between reviewers at any stage of screening process were resolved by asking a third author, when necessary.

### Neurocognitive and symptom validity testing for post-COVID-19 condition in a workers compensation context [^1119NVuE]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnoses

As mentioned previously, all claimants included in this study were diagnosed with COVID-19 followed by PCC and were referred for mental health evaluation and treatment to address neuropsychiatric features including complaints of cognitive deficits ("brain fog"). To clarify their mental health status, they were evaluated by clinical psychologists using the NCSE protocol. Almost half of the overall sample of claimants referred for NCSEs were diagnosed with mental health conditions, which were determined to be due to COVID-19 and PCC (n = 30, 46.9%), while slightly more claimants were not diagnosed with either a psychiatric or neurocognitive condition (n = 34, 53.1%). Of the mental health diagnoses offered, the most common was adjustment disorder (n = 13, 20.3%), followed by major depression (n = 8, 12.5%). The other diagnoses included posttraumatic stress disorder, somatoform disorder, and mild cognitive disorder. All but one of the claimants given a mental health diagnosis were referred for work-related mental health treatment (n = 29). One claimant, a first responder who was given a diagnosis (mild cognitive disorder), asked not to have mental health treatment recommended in the NCSE report.

Despite being determined to have provided invalid responses on the cognitive and psychological testing, 11 claimants in the invalid group (35.5%) were given a mental health diagnosis and 10 of them received treatment recommendations. Of those in the invalid group who were diagnosed with a mental disorder and offered treatment, three attended at least one therapy session. One claimant was seen for three sessions and then discharged; another was seen for 18 therapy sessions; and the third was seen for 33 therapy sessions by three different psychologists and a psychiatrist over a period of 9 months.

In the valid group, 17 claimants received an industrial mental health diagnosis (51.5%), and all 17 were given treatment recommendations. An additional four were diagnosed with nonindustrial mental health conditions, that is, nonwork-related premorbid or comorbid conditions. Of those who received work-related mental health diagnoses and treatment recommendations, eight attended at least one therapy session, and nine declined mental health treatment. For the full sample, the mean number of therapy sessions attended was 2.41, with a range of 0 to 42, and a mode of zero sessions.

2 LONG COVID, NEUROLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, AND EEG SIGNATURES

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) infection can induce "Long COVID", a postacute sequela of COVID‐19 that refers to persistent symptoms continuing for months or longer after the initial SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. The persistent symptoms affect multiple physiological systems with respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and psychological symptoms. One study found that 76% of individuals with mild‐to‐moderate COVID‐19 experienced at least one persistent symptom 6 months after their initial infection. Another study found that 52% of COVID‐19 survivors experienced persistent symptoms 3 months after infection. These persistent symptoms can significantly impair individuals' quality of life and result in higher healthcare costs.

2.1 Neurological and cognitive symptoms of Long COVID

Neurological symptoms are a significant part of Long COVID, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for better diagnosis and treatment. In a meta‐analysis of 18 studies on 10,530 patients 3 months after COVID‐19 onset, overall prevalence of neurological symptoms was 32% for brain fog, 28% for memory problems, and 22% for attention disorder. Another report with clinical observations of neurological complications in 236,379 patients in the 6 months after a COVID‐19 diagnosis found that 33.62% of patients had demonstrated clinically significant neurological or psychiatric dysfunction.

Neurological symptoms of Long COVID reflect the COVID‐19 neuroinvasion and include headache, tremors, problems with attention and concentration, sluggish cognitive function, dysfunction in the peripheral nerves, and mental health problems. Beyond these typical brain fog symptoms, systematic evidence suggests frequent associations with depressionand post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Together, these symptoms can be characterized as "brain fog". The American Medical Association defines brain fog as some persistent neurological symptoms, including slowed cognition, concentration difficulties, confusion, and forgetfulness. Most people with Long COVID report instances of severe fatigue and brain fog several months after their initial infection. Those symptoms may fluctuate or relapse over time.

### Long-term neuropsychological consequences of severe COVID-19 infection: the NEUROCOG-COVID study [^115QUVf7]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

As early as 2020, numerous international scientific articles reported the possible presence of cognitive disorders in patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The onset of cognitive complaints is said to be very frequent in the aftermath of COVID-19 infection, particularly in patients who have experienced severe infection. In general, "brain fog" is often described as slowed thinking, difficulties with focused attention, forgetfulness, and a subjective sense of confusion. Most often, the presence of a cognitive complaint is associated with the presence of cognitive disorders on neuropsychological assessment, particularly executive dysfunction. However, cognitive complaints do not correlate with the severity of objective cognitive impairment on neuropsychological assessment, and can persist over time.

While some articles testify to the absence of neuropsychological consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, a growing number of studies seem to validate a causal effect of COVID-19 on the central nervous system, possibly manifesting as neuropsychiatric disorders, both in the acute and long-term phases. Studies seem to consistently show that the development of neuropsychological disorders after COVID-19 infection is independent of the severity of the infection, i.e. mild infection requiring no respiratory assistance and hospitalization versus severe infection with respiratory distress requiring intensive care. Although cognitive impairment may be more pronounced in patients with severe infections, it also seems possible in asymptomatic patients. The long-term course of cognitive impairment is again variable; while it tends to persist after onset, it may increase over time, particularly in patients with moderate or severe infection, or, conversely, gradually improves in patients with mild infection. As in other neurological pathologies, functional cognitive disorders could be present in association with the organic consequences of COVID-19 infection.

### Brain hypoxia, neurocognitive impairment, and quality of life in people post-COVID-19 [^112rTazY]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Systemic hypoxia occurs in COVID-19 infection; however, it is unknown if cerebral hypoxia occurs in convalescent individuals. We have evidence from other conditions associated with central nervous system inflammation that hypoxia may occur in the brain. If so, hypoxia could reduce the quality of life and brain function. This study was undertaken to assess if brain hypoxia occurs in individuals after recovery from acute COVID-19 infection and if this hypoxia is associated with neurocognitive impairment and reduced quality of life.

Methods

Using frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy (fdNIRS), we measured cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (S t O 2) (a measure of hypoxia) in participants who had contracted COVID-19 at least 8 weeks prior to the study visit and healthy controls. We also conducted neuropsychological assessments and health-related quality of life assessments, fatigue, and depression.

Results

Fifty-six percent of the post-COVID-19 participants self-reported having persistent symptoms (from a list of 18), with the most reported symptom being fatigue and brain fog. There was a gradation in the decrease of oxyhemoglobin between controls, and normoxic and hypoxic post-COVID-19 groups (31.7 ± 8.3 μM, 27.8 ± 7.0 μM and 21.1 ± 7.2 μM, respectively, p = 0.028, p = 0.005, and p = 0.081). We detected that 24% of convalescent individuals' post-COVID-19 infection had reduced S t O 2 in the brain and that this relates to reduced neurological function and quality of life.

Interpretation

We believe that the hypoxia reported here will have health consequences for these individuals, and this is reflected in the correlation of hypoxia with greater symptomology. With the fdNIRS technology, combined with neuropsychological assessment, we may be able to identify individuals at risk of hypoxia-related symptomology and target individuals that are likely to respond to treatments aimed at improving cerebral oxygenation.

### Acute blood biomarker profiles predict cognitive deficits 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 hospitalization [^111rnvU4]. Nature Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Post-COVID cognitive deficits, including 'brain fog', are clinically complex, with both objective and subjective components. They are common and debilitating, and can affect the ability to work, yet their biological underpinnings remain unknown. In this prospective cohort study of 1,837 adults hospitalized with COVID-19, we identified two distinct biomarker profiles measured during the acute admission, which predict cognitive outcomes 6 and 12 months after COVID-19. A first profile links elevated fibrinogen relative to C-reactive protein with both objective and subjective cognitive deficits. A second profile links elevated D-dimer relative to C-reactive protein with subjective cognitive deficits and occupational impact. This second profile was mediated by fatigue and shortness of breath. Neither profile was significantly mediated by depression or anxiety. Results were robust across secondary analyses. They were replicated, and their specificity to COVID-19 tested, in a large-scale electronic health records dataset. These findings provide insights into the heterogeneous biology of post-COVID cognitive deficits.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^113FjQVZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

How to approach a patient when considering pharmacologic treatments for COVID-19 — this section discusses how to approach a patient suspected to have COVID-19 and how to apply the IDSA COVID-19 treatment guidelines to specific clinical syndromes. The guideline notes that the certainty of supporting evidence is low to moderate for most recommendations and that the panel made conditional suggestions rather than strong recommendations for or against most of the agents. It further states that though substantial progress was made with COVID-19 therapies, there remain many unanswered questions in the management of COVID-19, and that despite limited evidence, to give actionable and timely guidance to frontline clinicians, it provides recommendations for use of combinations of agents, recommends some agents over others, or extrapolates to sub populations not evaluated in trials. Critical unanswered questions identified include which sub-populations or specific clinical types of patients benefit most from specific therapeutic agents, what the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 therapies are in populations immune from prior SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccination, what the efficacy and safety of treatments are in infections with specific SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants, and how therapeutic agents perform when compared to each other to allow a tiered approach to treating patients with COVID-19.

### Impact of COVID-19 on the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias: a roadmap for future research [^111HU4vJ]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Indeed, anecdotal and literature reports are emerging of cognitive and psychological symptoms after COVID‐19. Four months after COVID‐19 hospitalization, 30‐40% of patients report problems with memory, attention and sleep, while 10‐15% of patients report loss of taste and/or smell. Increasing media attention is devoted to "COVID‐19 fog", a nonspecific mental syndrome after COVID‐19 infection which can include fatigue, inattention, poor concentration, memory complaints, lack of motivation and difficulty working long hours. Younger people are also at risk for COVID‐19 related cognitive symptoms, even in the absence of serious disease. Although recent reviews have described the constellation of cognitive symptoms associated with COVID‐19, and what is known about their molecular underpinnings, a central question that remains is whether the neurological symptoms observed in people with COVID‐19 can be long‐lasting (> 6 mo) or even progressive, possibly increasing risk of cognitive impairment or dementia. A related question is, in people living with dementia, does infection with COVID‐19 accelerate or aggravate the course of the existing disease? One mechanism by which SARS CoV‐2 could impact cognitive function is by direct infection of the brain. The olfactory tract showed the highest concentration of ACE2 enzymes, the cell surface receptor for SARS CoV‐2. Further the brains of AD patients have elevated levels of ACE2.

### The neurobiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113H7fiq]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2024). High credibility.

Worldwide, over 694 million people have been infected with SARS-CoV-2, with an estimated 55–60% of those infected developing COVID-19. Since the beginning of the pandemic in December 2019, different variants of concern have appeared and continue to occur. With the emergence of different variants, an increasing rate of vaccination and previous infections, the acute neurological symptomatology of COVID-19 changed. Moreover, 10–45% of individuals with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection experience symptoms even 3 months after disease onset, a condition that has been defined as 'post-COVID-19' by the World Health Organization and that occurs independently of the virus variant. The pathomechanisms of COVID-19-related neurological complaints have become clearer during the past 3 years. To date, there is no overt - that is, truly convincing - evidence for SARS-CoV-2 particles in the brain. In this Review, we put special emphasis on discussing the methodological difficulties of viral detection in CNS tissue and discuss immune-based (systemic and central) effects contributing to COVID-19-related CNS affection. We sequentially review the reported changes to CNS cells in COVID-19, starting with the blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier - as systemic factors from the periphery appear to primarily influence barriers and conduits - before we describe changes in brain parenchymal cells, including microglia, astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes as well as cerebral lymphocytes. These findings are critical to understanding CNS affection in acute COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 in order to translate these findings into treatment options, which are still very limited.

### Long COVID in children and young people: then and now [^114xMRzi]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

On 11 March 2020, the WHO characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. A clinical case definition for post-COVID-19 condition in children and adolescents by expert consensus was agreed by the WHO in 2023. It is now 5years since the WHO declared a pandemic, and this review aims to summarize key advances in our understanding of long COVID over those 5 years.

Recent Findings

That symptoms could persist in adults and CYP for months after initial infection was first reported in Autumn 2020. Long COVID in adults is frequently characterized by symptoms of fatigue and breathlessness but brain-fog, joint and muscle pain have been reported much more commonly in adult follow-up than CYP. The most common persisting symptoms experienced by CYP after COVID-19 infection in initial studies, often with less than a year of follow-up, were fatigue, headache, shortness of breath and persisting loss of smell and taste. With longer follow-up, up to 2years, the commonest symptoms still include not only fatigue, headache and shortness of breath but also sleep difficulties, whereas loss of smell and taste persisted only in a minority. However, many symptoms were almost as common in test-negative controls, raising questions about the causal role of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Predictors of long COVID, as defined, were female sex, history of asthma, allergy problems, learning difficulties at school and family history of ongoing COVID-19 problems.

Summary

The implications of the findings for clinical practice and research are that long COVID is not the same in CYP as adults; both their physical and mental health should be studied; and intervention trials are needed.

### Detrimental effects of COVID-19 in the brain and therapeutic options for long COVID: the role of Epstein-Barr virus and the gut-brain axis [^117Ev8Xq]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), continues to threaten public health worldwide. COVID-19 patients frequently experience sequelae such as shortness of breath or dyspnea, and fatigue or exhaustion. A number of neurological and psychiatric symptoms have also been linked to COVID-19, including anosmia (or loss of smell), ageusia (or loss of taste), cognitive impairment, depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. Long-lasting symptoms following SARS-CoV-2 infection are known as long COVID or post-COVID conditions. The World Health Organization reported that long COVID is defined as the symptoms that usually occur 3 months after infection of SARS-CoV-2, with symptoms lasting for at least 2 months. Long COVID has impacts on multiple tissues, including respiratory and non-respiratory organs such as the heart, kidney, immune system, pancreas, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and brain (Fig. 1). However, the precise biological mechanisms underlying long COVID remain elusive. At present, there are several hypothesized mechanisms, including immune dysregulation, dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, autoimmunity, clotting and endothelial abnormalities, and altered neurological signaling. Unfortunately, current diagnostic and treatment options are insufficient.

3.2 Chief complaints may change in the clinical course of long COVID

According to the χ 2 test, respiratory symptoms tended to be a major complaint in the initial phase, followed by fatigue, fever, and headache/joint pain, whereas hair loss was the major complaint in the late phase (Table 3). Thus, our clinicians treating patients with long COVID should understand that the chief complaint of the patients may vary over time. Additionally, our data revealed no significant relationship between COVID‐19 severity and the number of symptoms of long COVID (data not shown).

3.3 Variation in therapeutic efficacy among long COVID‐related symptoms

Compared with previous studies, our data showed that the recovery period of pulmonary manifestations in patients with long COVID was undoubtedly shortened if they used inhaled budesonide. Using fatigue symptoms as the basis for comparison of the recovery period, pulmonary symptoms presented both a tendency towards early recovery and better therapeutic effect in most patients; subsequently, fever and headache/joint pain were comparatively well managed based on the rapid recovery in more patients (Figure 1). Conversely, hair loss was the worst symptom, with less quick recovery and more refractory cases, although hair loss tended to occur in the later phase. Brain fog, which has no effective therapeutic intervention, and smell disorder took second place in slow recovery (Figure 1).

Using fatigue symptoms as the basis for the recovery period, respiratory symptoms presented both a tendency towards early recovery and no treatment resistance in most patients; subsequently, fever and headache/arthralgia were comparatively better managed based on the rapid recovery in more patients. Conversely, hair loss was the worst symptom, with less quick recovery and more refractory cases, although hair loss tended to occur in the later phase. Brain fog and smell disorder took second place in slow recovery.

### Tumor size, treatment patterns, and survival in neuro-oncology patients before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^1158YTrd]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted healthcare delivery worldwide, leading to significant delays in cancer diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of malignant brain tumors, specifically glioblastoma (GBM) and cerebral metastasis (CM), in a specialized neuro-oncology center. We analyzed data from 236 patients diagnosed with previously unknown malignant brain tumors between January 2018 and December 2021. Patients were classified into two groups: pre-COVID (January 2018 to December 2019) and COVID (January 2020 to December 2021). Tumor volumes were compared between the two groups and factors affecting tumor volumes were studied. Of 236 patients diagnosed with previously unknown malignant brain tumors, 114 were in the pre-COVID group and 122 were in the COVID group. Median tumor volumes at first diagnosis were significantly larger in the COVID group compared to the pre-COVID group (21.7 vs 15.7 cm 3; p < 0.05). The survival times for the overall cohort and the GBM and CM subgroups did not differ significantly between the pre-COVID and COVID periods. Delays in diagnosis and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic led to larger tumor volumes at diagnosis for patients with malignant brain tumors. However, these larger tumors did not result in worse survival outcomes. This counterintuitive finding highlights the crucial role of specialized neuro-oncological centers in mitigating the potential negative impact of delayed treatment and emphasizes the need for continued access to specialized care during times of crisis.

RESULTS

The survey was sent to 386 patients, with 156 (48%) responding. The median (range) time to follow-up time since the onset of COVID-19 infection was 351 days (82–457 days; Table 1). The most common symptoms reported were fatigue (n = 128, 82%), brain fog (n = 105, 67%), headache (n = 94, 60%), sleep disturbance (n = 92, 59%), and dizziness (n = 85, 54%; Fig. 1). The most common triggers of symptom exacerbation reported were physical exertion (n = 134, 86%), stress (n = 107, 69%), dehydration (n = 77, 49%), weather changes (n = 58, 37%), consuming large meals (n = 44, 28%), premenstrual period (n = 34, 22%), and alcohol consumption (n = 34, 22%).

### Prevalence of depression, anxiety, fatigue, and headache before and after long COVID onset: a case-control study in the total population of region stockholm [^113RSaoh]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in a global health crisis with profound and long-lasting effects on individuals and healthcare systems. While most patients recover from the acute COVID-19 infection, a significant number of individuals experience symptoms that persist for months or years, described as post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or long COVID. Long COVID is defined as having persistent symptoms > 12 weeks after the acute infection, which cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis. The range of symptoms often experienced by patients includes fatigue, post-exertional malaise, brain fog, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety and depressive symptoms, dizziness, sensorimotor symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, palpitations, dyspnea, chronic cough, and chest pain, ultimately impacting the overall health-related quality of life.

It is estimated that around 10–30% of people previously infected by SARS-CoV-2 are affected by long COVID, with the frequency appearing to have decreased in more recent times. However, longitudinal studies have reported numbers as high as 46% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 still having persistent symptoms after 12 months. The variation in numbers is linked to the uncertainties and complexity surrounding the precise diagnostics of long COVID. While long COVID today is recognized as a single condition with multiple distinct phenotypes, its pathophysiology remains unclear. Evidence points to a multifactorial explanation as multiple organs are involved, and a combination of direct viral-specific pathophysiological damage, immune dysregulation, microvascular injury, and inflammation in response to acute infection, which may persist and lead to chronic inflammation, exacerbating long-term symptoms. Further, persistent viral reservoirs, aberrant immune responses, and post-viral autonomic dysfunction have all been hypothesized as contributing factors. Importantly, persistent symptoms are not unique to COVID-19 but have also been observed across a wide range of medical conditions, suggesting the involvement of potential transdiagnostic mechanisms. Finally, researchers have argued that different mechanisms may underlie persistent symptoms in individuals with varying infection severity, even though current long COVID criteria do not distinguish between mild and severe cases. Conversely, given that functional neurological disorder often begins after a noxious sensory event, it is expected that some individuals develop functional symptoms following COVID-19 infection. The association between long COVID and functional disorders remains a topic of ongoing debate.

### Treatment experiences, preferences, and expectations for cognitive impairments in long COVID among Chinese young and older adults: a constructivist grounded theory study [^112w8k8P]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Patient-led research initiatives emphasize the value of incorporating real-world experiences to address the complexities of long COVID. For instance, surveys conducted by the Patient-led research collaborative (PLRC) identified over 200 symptoms, including cognitive impairments such as brain fog, and underscored the need for targeted interventions informed by patient perspectives. These efforts have also encouraged investigations into potential treatments for long COVID, such as low-dose naltrexone, which some individuals report as alleviating symptoms, possibly due to its anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving effects. Such collaborations highlight the importance of patient involvement in shaping effective, personalised strategies for managing long COVID symptoms. Qualitative research that explores patients' lived experiences and treatment preferences is crucial for designing interventions that genuinely address their actual needs. This patient-centred approach ensures holistic care and aligns treatments with individual priorities, enhancing both clinical efficacy and patient satisfaction.

Health-related factors, particularly ageing, may influence the preferred approaches to cognitive care in long COVID. Variations in residual physiological capacity, baseline health status, disrupted activities of daily living, recovery expectations, and personal needs between younger and older adult patients suggest that treatment preferences may differ across age groups. Both younger and older age groups might, for certain reasons, avoid specific rehabilitation paths even when such methods show potential for alleviating persistent cognitive symptoms. For instance, younger adults, often possessing greater baseline endurance and cognitive resilience, might prefer non-pharmacological options such as CBT and aerobic exercise, particularly if they do not experience post-exertional malaise, and might be wary of long-term medication use due to potential side effects. In contrast, older adults, who usually have lower physiological reserves and more comorbidities, might prefer approaches that minimise physical and cognitive strain, such as low-intensity cognitive exercises or carefully monitored pharmacological options, prioritising safety and tolerability. These differences also underscore the need for patient-centred care that aligns therapeutic strategies with individual preferences and expectations. Evidence indicates that active patient participation in decision-making enhances compliance, satisfaction, and treatment effectiveness.

### Parallel electrophysiological abnormalities due to COVID-19 infection and to Alzheimer's disease and related dementia [^1167Gz8k]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Many coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive individuals exhibit abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) activity reflecting "brain fog" and mild cognitive impairments even months after the acute phase of infection. Resting-state EEG abnormalities include EEG slowing (reduced alpha rhythm; increased slow waves) and epileptiform activity. An expert panel conducted a systematic review to present compelling evidence that cognitive deficits due to COVID-19 and to Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) are driven by overlapping pathologies and neurophysiological abnormalities. EEG abnormalities seen in COVID-19 patients resemble those observed in early stages of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly ADRD. It is proposed that similar EEG abnormalities in Long COVID and ADRD are due to parallel neuroinflammation, astrocyte reactivity, hypoxia, and neurovascular injury. These neurophysiological abnormalities underpinning cognitive decline in COVID-19 can be detected by routine EEG exams. Future research will explore the value of EEG monitoring of COVID-19 patients for predicting long-term outcomes and monitoring efficacy of therapeutic interventions. HIGHLIGHTS: Abnormal intrinsic electrophysiological brain activity, such as slowing of EEG, reduced alpha wave, and epileptiform are characteristic findings in COVID-19 patients. EEG abnormalities have the potential as neural biomarkers to identify neurological complications at the early stage of the disease, to assist clinical assessment, and to assess cognitive decline risk in Long COVID patients. Similar slowing of intrinsic brain activity to that of COVID-19 patients is typically seen in patients with mild cognitive impairments, ADRD. Evidence presented supports the idea that cognitive deficits in Long COVID and ADRD are driven by overlapping neurophysiological abnormalities resulting, at least in part, from neuroinflammatory mechanisms and astrocyte reactivity. Identifying common biological mechanisms in Long COVID-19 and ADRD can highlight critical pathologies underlying brain disorders and cognitive decline. It elucidates research questions regarding cognitive EEG and mild cognitive impairment in Long COVID that have not yet been adequately investigated.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary brain tumor incidence and management: decisions that went right [^116u9A4h]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered cancer care. Prior reports demonstrated reduced screenings, diagnoses, and disrupted treatment regimens due to multifactorial reasons. We aim to analyze whether the same effects occurred within neuro-oncology.

Methods

This analysis included 70131 patients with primary brain tumors from the SEER database from 2016 to 2021 identified via ICD10 code. The pre-COVID era was 2016–2019, peak-COVID was 2020, and post-COVID was 2021. Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression for binary variables and linear regression for continuous. Covariates controlled for were age at diagnosis, sex, and race. NCI SEER*Stat version 8.4.0 was used to calculate incidence rates age-adjusted to the 2000 US standard population and reported per 100000 persons.

Results

Although there was a decrease in the age-adjusted incidence of primary brain tumors between 2016 and 2021, the number of malignant brain tumors remained stable, and this change was likely driven by a reduction in benign tumor incidence. Regarding treatment, in 2020 and 2021 all malignant brain tumors (2020 OR[95%CI]: 1.11[1.02–1.22], 2021: 1.10[1.01–1.020]) and glioblastoma patients (2020 OR[95%CI]: 1.12[1.01–1.26], 2021: 1.13[1.01–1.27]) underwent increased surgical resections, compared to pre-COVID years. Time from diagnosis to treatment decreased for glioblastoma patients in 2020, compared to pre-COVID (Estimate [95%CI]: -1.25 [-1.71 to -0.78]). No treatment changes were noted for benign brain tumors.

Conclusion

Malignant tumors, like glioblastoma, maintained a stable incidence due to their aggressive symptoms, though treatment patterns shifted. These findings reveal that the management of malignant brain tumors during the COVID-19 pandemic was effectively prioritized while maintaining quality of care.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for COVID-19 infection, more specifically with respect to rehabilitation, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to screen patients for physical, cognitive and mental impairments who have been discharged from the hospital or have been managed at home and experience persistent symptoms and/or limitations in functioning, and manage accordingly.

Innate immune system

The severity of COVID‐19 is closely linked to the function and regulation of the innate immune system, which plays a crucial role in the body's defence against SARS‐CoV‐2 infection by: (1) restricting virus replication in infected cells; (2) recruiting innate immune cells to create an antiviral environment at the site of infection; and (3) activating the adaptive immune response. The efficacy of these responses depends on innate immune cells, particularly myeloid cells and neutrophils. Myeloid cells are key producers of proinflammatory cytokines and exhibit various functional and epigenetic differences post‐COVID‐19. For instance, in severe COVID‐19, hyperresponsive myeloid cells with distinct epigenetic signatures have been observed 1 year postinfection. These epigenetic changes likely contribute to a heightened proinflammatory state, with sustained expression of cytokines and chemokines exacerbating tissue inflammation and impairing resolution of the immune response. Perturbations in myeloid progenitors can contribute to PCC. Specifically, an increase in precursors of the macrophage lineage (CD14 + CD16 + intermediate monocytes) associates with PCC, particularly in cases defined by postacute pulmonary injury. Myeloid cells may also be linked to neurological complications. For example, plasma CCL11 (also known as eotaxin‐1), a chemokine that activates microglia and attracts eosinophils, is elevated in PCC patients suffering from brain fog. Analysis of 657 participants > 3 months following hospitalisation with acute COVID‐19 observed elevated myeloid inflammation markers (IL‐1R2, MATN2, CSF3) in PCC patients. In contrast, suppression of myeloid inflammation evidenced by reduced IL‐2 and elevated sCD58 (which is shed by activated myeloid cell during inflammation, thereby disrupting monocyte–lymphocyte interactions) and enhanced tissue repair indicated by elevated markers such as IDS and DNER were associated with fully recovered individuals. These observations suggest that myeloid inflammation and dysfunctional tissue repair mechanisms are key to developing PCC, underscoring the potential of immunomodulatory agents as a promising approach in therapeutic trials (see below).

7.2 EEG monitoring in COVID‐19 recovery and treatment

There are various methods of treatment for COVID‐19. Many of the remedies for COVID‐19 include antiviral medications or a monoclonal antibody intravenous treatment. More serious cases of individuals hospitalized with COVID‐19 warrant treatment focused on different elements of the virus, including immunotherapy drugs like tocilizumab. In the case of an individual hospitalized with COVID‐19, presenting with excessive aphasia and inattentiveness, progressing to severe encephalopathy, treatment with tocilizumab resolved neurological symptoms within 2 days. Initial EEG after hospitalization revealed background slowing and sharp frontal waves, while the 2‐month follow‐up EEG post‐treatment with tocilizumab showed no remarkable abnormalities. The fact that tocilizumab disrupts the inflammatory cytokine storm response demonstrates a potential treatment for neurological symptoms of COVID‐19. In the case of a 77‐year‐old female presenting with neurological deficits following COVID‐19 infection, intravenous methylprednisolone treatment resulted in a gradual improvement of speech and cognition as well as a reduction of the background slowing of the EEG signal. These cases of COVID‐19 successfully treated using drugs offer hope.

Pharmacological treatments of COVID‐19 tend to be a broad approach to treat the illness rather than specifically targeting the cognitive symptoms that result from the infection. Though not in broad clinical practice, a proposed method of treatment to specifically target these neurological deficits is quantitative EEG (QEEG) neurofeedback therapy. This method of coaching individuals to influence their own EEG frequencies has been utilized to mitigate some behavioral symptoms of other conditions.QEEG may be a useful tool to monitor the recovery of brain functioning as it is easily applicable and repeatable over time, even in large cohorts of subjects with COVID‐19, from asymptomatic to critical illness. In using a treatment method that specifically targets cognitive function, there may be greater potential to remedy neurological symptoms of COVID‐19 and ameliorate the effects of long‐term brain fog. However, research is needed to directly test this hypothesis, and EEG studies could provide objective measurements of the integrative functional state of the brain.

### COVID-19 recovery: consistent absence of cerebrospinal fluid biomarker abnormalities in patients with neurocognitive post-COVID complications [^111nEqVq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Following the initial wave of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, reports indicated that a number of heterogeneous symptoms persisted or emerged weeks to months after the acute phase of the infection in a subset of individuals recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Residual symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, anosmia, dysgeusia, paresthesia, and cognitive impairment, collectively referred to as long-COVID, has subsequently been named post-COVID condition (PCC) and has emerged as a major public health concern.

Epidemiological studies have estimated that up to one-third of patients may present with symptoms of PCC as they recuperate from their primary SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neurological or neurocognitive symptoms such as fatigue, "brain fog", headaches, and cognitive changes, including memory or concentration, are integral parts of PCC and have been reported in up to two-thirds of patients.

The specific risk factors for developing PCC are still largely unknown. Although postinfectious outcomes are commonly observed in patients requiring intensive care due to other acute infections or other conditions, PCC is not limited to individuals with severe COVID-19 and has been described in patients with mild as well as moderate COVID-19.

The underlying pathogenesis of PCC is under intense investigation but to a large extent is still not understood. Consequently, it is unclear whether PCC is attributable to processes uniquely associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or from host responses to infection of a more universal character. The heterogeneity of PCC symptoms suggests that multiple mechanisms are separately or collaboratively involved in different individuals.

Various factors, such as direct central nervous system (CNS) damage caused by viral neuroinvasion, indirect outcomes of systemic or intrathecal inflammatory responses, microvascular injuries and/or thromboembolic events, and misguided host immunological response, have been identified as potential contributors to CNS pathogenesis during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it remains unclear whether neurological or neurocognitive sequelae in PCC represent an ongoing infectious or inflammatory process within the CNS or are consequences of earlier events triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

7 UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND POTENTIAL EEG NEURAL BIOMARKERS FOR INTERVENTION

Some substantial open questions remain. One question is whether there is converging evidence on spatial and frequency features of abnormal rsEEG rhythms in Long COVID patients. Another question is whether these abnormal features are specific to Long COVID patients or reminiscent of those with vigilance and cognitive deficits due to other pathological processes. Indeed, some abnormalities in rsEEG delta, theta, and alpha rhythms have been reported in patients with cognitive deficits due to AD or cerebrovascular diseases. The cause of brain fog in Long COVID has not been fully understood. Similar symptoms have been observed in people living with other brain conditions (e.g. stroke, epilepsy) without previous COVID‐19 infection. Several important issues are currently unresolved or understudied in COVID‐19 related EEG indicators.

### Updates on the neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^115nvaHU]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Since its emergence in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a global surge of survivors experiencing neurologic effects from SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review aims to provide an updated synthesis of the acute and chronic neurological manifestations of COVID-19, and to outline the current therapeutic strategies for these conditions.

Recent Findings

Epidemiological studies have shown that COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms during acute infection tend to have poorer hospital and functional outcomes. While the risk of adverse neurologic symptoms including cognitive dysfunction, headache, autonomic dysfunction, and chronic fatigue are thought to be greatest following infection with the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and its alpha variant, they remain prevalent after infection with subsequent less virulent strains as well. Some recent work has also found a link between SARS-CoV-2 and structural brain changes. However, ongoing trials show promising results for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments targeting the postacute neurological sequelae of COVID-19.

Summary

Lingering neurological manifestations after COVID-19 still pose considerable individual, healthcare system, and socioeconomic repercussions. Both preventive and multimodal treatment approaches are necessary to address these conditions. Further research is required to assess the lasting impacts of SARS-CoV-2 on the nervous system, particularly its potential contribution to the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

### Perceived cognitive deficits in patients with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and their association with post-COVID-19 condition [^11647YKQ]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The world continues to grapple with the diverse clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and patients who have persistent symptoms. A key question is why some patients with SARS-CoV-2 have persistent symptoms, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines as symptoms that extend beyond 4 weeks after the initial infection. Post–COVID-19 condition (PCC; colloquially known as long COVID) is characterized by many symptoms, of which cognitive impairment is a frequent complaint. – So-called brain fog in particular has been a common and debilitating symptomaffecting all age groups. Other neurocognitive symptoms associated with PCC include memory problems, difficulty concentrating, trouble focusing, and posttraumatic stress disorder. – Furthermore, anxiety and depression are commonly reported alongside PCC. –

Most studies evaluating cognitive dysfunction in patients with SARS-CoV-2 have focused on the clinical characterization of cognitive symptoms associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 and PCC. With respect to both the acute and postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, few studies have examined potential factors associated with the development of cognitive dysfunction. Given the potential long-term impact of neurocognitive deficits on quality of life and productivity, it is important to understand potential factors associated with cognitive dysfunction during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, some retrospective studies – and a 2022 prospective analysisdemonstrate that premorbid distress is associated with PCC symptoms at 4 weeks after initial infection or later, yet the association between early development of cognitive symptoms and the development of PCC is not understood. In this cohort study, we evaluated data from a clinical cohort of patients with SARS-CoV-2 who were surveyed concerning perceived cognitive deficits. We explored the perceived level of cognitive deficit, factors associated with those deficits in the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the association of those deficits with the development of PCC.

Nervous system

Neurological manifestations have frequently been described in patients suffering from COVID‐19, ranging from anosmia, dysgeusia, headache, and 'brain‐fog' to severe conditions including ischaemic stroke and encephalopathy/encephalitis. Furthermore, cognitive deficits have been reported even after recovery, which is probably partly related to incident delirium in many cases. The neurological manifestations may result from direct cytopathic effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection or from superimposed disease factors, including hypoxia‐induced damage, drug‐related changes, and harmful immune responses. The presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 has been demonstrated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and post‐mortem brain tissues from COVID‐19 patients, indicating its neurotropic potential. The virus may enter the central nervous system (CNS) via the haematogenous pathway – involving immune cell transmigration or penetration of the blood–brain barrier – as well as via the neuronal pathway. The identification of viral particles in the olfactory bulb, together with the common occurrence of anosmia, point to the olfactory pathway as a plausible route of neuroinvasion by SARS‐CoV‐2. On the other hand, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have been found in microvillar cells, olfactory horizontal basal cells, and olfactory sustentacular cells but not in olfactory neuronal extensions. Therefore, the olfactory entry route into the CNS remains a conundrum. Next to nervous and olfactory involvement, SARS‐CoV‐2 protein has recently been demonstrated intracellularly in the ocular tissues of a patient previously infected with this virus.

### Acute and chronic neurological disorders in COVID-19: potential mechanisms of disease [^1114EMqy]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic neurological sequelae

The long-term neurological impact of COVID-19 is uncertain, but it is already apparent that a range of signs and symptoms emerge among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 while non-hospitalized patients also exhibit neurological disorders that arise after the acute COVID-19 illness phase (Fig. 3). The lingering or delayed neurological syndromes have been termed long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC)and are composed of a wide range of symptoms and signs including neurocognitive symptoms with associated impaired performance on neuropsychological testing. Of note, neurocognitive and mood alterations among ICU survivors are well recognized phenomena, often attributed to sedating medications as well as systemic inflammation and neuronal injury. Notably, these ICU-related effects can confound the evaluation of chronic sequelae among survivors of severe acute COVID-19. A study evaluating patients with COVID-19 at 2–3 months post-hospitalization (approximately a third of patients required ICU) reported that those patients reported significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms and decreased quality of life compared to age- and comorbidity-matched controls. Moreover, abnormalities in visuospatial and executive function were detected among COVID-19 survivors compared to controls when assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment tool (MoCA), recapitulating clinical experience of patients with post-COVID-19 who report apathy, short-term/working memory difficulties and 'brain fog' after SARS-CoV-2 infection. A recent study of patients post-COVID-19 without hospitalization reported 'brain fog', headache, anosmia, dysgeusia and myalgia as the predominant persisting symptoms. Over half of hospitalized COVID-19 patients report significant fatigue months after discharge, particularly among those who required admission to the ICU. Similarly, persistent psychological distress is reported by half of hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related ICU admission as well as those COVID-19 patients not requiring the ICU. A retrospective cohort analysis of over 200 000 patients in the UK found that 12.8% of patients with COVID-19 received a new neurological or psychiatric diagnosis in the 6 months after initial infection. In the same study, nearly half of ICU-COVID-19 survivors had a neurological or psychiatric illness at 6-month follow-up, of which half were new diagnoses. Of note, frontotemporal FDG hypometabolism reported for acute COVID-19, discussed previously, was also observed among COVID-19 patients with cognitive symptoms > 3 weeks after initial illness, accompanied by brainstem and thalamus hypometabolism in 'long COVID' patients, compared to controls. A separate study of eight patients in the subacute and chronic stages of recovery from COVID-19 observed a similar pattern of bilateral frontoparietal hypometabolism, which resolved at the 6-month follow-up assessment and was accompanied by improved MoCA scores.FDG-PET imaging is a potentially useful research tool although it is not validated for diagnosis of COVID-19 related neurocognitive impairments, which require clinical evaluation. Future studies of cognitive impairment in COVID-19 survivors must take into account the fact that hospitalization for any infection is associated with an increased 10-year risk of dementia, particularly vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

BBB dysfunction is associated with long COVID-induced cognitive impairment

Given the significantly increased serum concentrations of S100β, our data indicated that active and acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with potential BBB dysfunction in individuals with neurological impairment. However, to directly visualize BBB function, we recruited ten recovered participants, 11 with long COVID and 11 with long COVID with brain fog who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the first outbreak of disease in Ireland in April 2020 (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 2). All participants were recruited from St James Hospital Dublin and were PCR-confirmed cases of COVID-19. None of the patients in this cohort had received a vaccine and all had an initially mild course of disease that did not require hospitalization or antiviral treatment. We used a quick smell identification test (Q-SIT)-based method to determine objective anosmia status in participants and determined a strong correlation of reported anosmia status and Q-SIT score, providing an excellent readout of the utility of objective anosmia measurement in prolonged anosmia after COVID-19. Participants were grouped according to the presence or absence of self-reported cognitive issues termed 'brain fog' (brain fog (−) or brain fog (+)). Participants were considered as recovered when they reported no recurring symptoms following recovery from active SARS-CoV-2 infection. We hypothesized that COVID-19-associated cognitive impairment may be a strong predictor of BBB disruption in patients with COVID-19. There were no differences in age between each group (Fig. 2b). Imaging took place at a median time of 46, 175 and 211 days after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection for the recovered, long COVID and brain fog cohorts, respectively (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Table 2). Sixteen (50%) participants reported anosmia, which was confirmed using Q-SIT testing (average score 1 out of 3; 159 ± 88 days duration) at the time of scanning. Six participants with brain fog showed mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test (score 18–25) along with deficits in recall, executive functioning and word finding (Supplementary Table 2).

### Variant connective tissue as a risk factor for long COVID: a case-control study of data from a retrospective online survey of adults in the United States and UK [^1114d51c]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Background

Long COVID (also known as 'post-acute sequelae of COVID-19' (PASC), 'post-acute COVID-19 syndrome' and 'post-COVID conditions') is a condition characterised by long-lasting persistent or newly emerging symptoms following a COVID-19 infection (see information from the WHOand National Academies for Sciencefor more background on the definition of this condition). This infection-associated chronic condition has emerged as a significant public health challenge. The most common among hundreds of documented symptoms are fatigue, postexertional symptom exacerbation/malaise, brain fog/cognitive dysfunction and shortness of breath. Symptoms may be new onset following initial recovery from an acute COVID-19 episode or persist from the initial illness without a gap, and they may fluctuate or exhibit a relapse/recovery pattern over time. Severity varies; some symptoms are mild, but the daily activities of around a quarter of people with long COVID are significantly limited by their symptoms, and many people with long COVID are completely bedbound. The burden of long COVID is considerable, affecting an estimated 400 million people globally and costing the global economy an estimated US$1 trillion every year. Understanding the factors that may predispose individuals to long COVID is crucial for preventing future cases, developing effective healthcare interventions and improving the quality of life for millions affected worldwide.

### COVID-19: brain effects [^114Nav92]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), affects the brain. Neurologic and neuropsychiatric symptoms may manifest in the acute and post-acute phases of illness. The vulnerability of the brain with aging further increases the burden of disease in the elderly, who are at the highest risk of complications and death from COVID-19. The mechanisms underlying the effects of COVID-19 on the brain are not fully known. Emerging evidence vis-à-vis pathogenesis and etiologies of COVID-19 brain effects is promising and may pave the way for future research and development of interventions.

Ensure immediate evaluation by a clinician, if detected, to address any underlying cause of delirium and treat appropriately.

### Neuropsychiatric disorders following SARS-CoV-2 infection [^113uAwa3]. Brain (2023). Medium credibility.

Do age or gender influence the neuropsychiatric risks?

The results in Table 1 are pooled estimates across the lifespan, and most other large-scale studies have either been restricted to adults or a specific age group (e.g. the over-65s). In a recent study, analyses were conducted in children, adults and older adults, revealing age-related differences as well as similarities in the relationship between COVID-19 and psychiatric disorders (Table 3). In contrast to adults, children were not found to be at greater risk of mood and anxiety disorders after COVID-19, and though children are at greater risk of psychotic disorders and brain fog, the risk horizons are shorter than for adults and older adults. For brain fog, a time to equal incidence is reached (after about 16 months), indicating that the total number of cases is ultimately equal between children diagnosed with COVID-19 and those with another respiratory infection. These findings in children are largely reassuring, especially since the incidence of each disorder is much lower than in adults, but equally, they show that children are not immune to neuropsychiatric consequences of COVID-19. Moreover, children are at greater risk than adults of seizures and epilepsy following COVID-19. Adults and older adults were similar in most respects, although the latter group tended to have higher incidences and HRs, particularly for cognitive impairment.

Table 3
Risks of neuropsychiatric disorders after COVID-19 across the lifespan

Only a few studies have investigated whether men and women differ in their risks of neuropsychiatric disorders after COVID-19, and results are unclear. In a predominantly male Veterans Administration dataset, the HR for mental health disorders between patients with COVID-19 and the rest of the population was greater in males than females. Another study directly comparing matched females and males who had had COVID-19 found that women were at a higher relative risk of anxiety/depression than men, but at a lower risk of brain fog. In contrast, another study of COVID-19 patients reported no gender difference in risk for mental health disorders or memory difficulties. Gender, like race and ethnicity, deserves greater attention in future studies of neuropsychiatric disorders after COVID-19.

### Specifically decreased thalamic blood flow following COVID-19 infection [^113Ub6Yo]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Although long COVID refers to numerous COVID-19-related symptoms after infection, including depression, fatigue, anosmia, sleep disturbances, and brain fog, the etiology of long COVID remains largely unknown. A 41-year-old woman presented with a 3-week history of complete insomnia without drowsiness throughout the day after contracting COVID-19. SPECT using N -isopropyl-p-[123 I] iodoamphetamine showed a significant regional cerebral blood flow reduction in the bilateral thalamus. We diagnosed her as having insomnia accompanied by thalamic hypoperfusion related to COVID-19 infection. To our knowledge, this is the first case of reduced regional cerebral blood flow specifically confined to the thalamus.

### Cervical sympathetic block to treat long COVID: a scoping review [^111jhJ2j]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Long COVID is a complex and poorly understood condition characterized by persistent symptoms such as autonomic dysfunction, fatigue, neurocognitive impairment, and olfactory disturbances. Current treatments offer limited and inconsistent benefits. Dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system is increasingly recognized as a contributor to Long COVID pathophysiology. Cervical sympathetic block (CSB), a procedure that modulates sympathetic tone, has emerged as a potential therapeutic approach.

Objective

To review the existing literature on CSB, for Long COVID, focusing on symptom outcomes, proposed mechanisms, and procedural considerations.

Evidence Review

A structured literature search across PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science identified studies published between 2022 and March 2025 reporting on CSB in adults with Long COVID. Eligible articles included case reports, case series, observational studies, and one randomized controlled trial evaluating symptom outcomes after the procedure.

Findings

Sixteen studies involving 224 patients were included. Most reported improvement in fatigue, brain fog, and autonomic symptoms, including reduced heart rate and enhanced orthostatic tolerance. Cognitive and psychiatric symptoms such as memory impairment, anxiety, and depression showed variable improvement. Olfactory recovery was inconsistent and appeared to depend on symptom severity. Symptom relief was observed after both unilateral and bilateral blocks, with some responses lasting up to 1 year. No serious complications were reported.

Conclusions

CSB may offer symptom relief in Long COVID, particularly for fatigue, brain fog, and dysautonomia. However, the evidence remains preliminary and limited by small sample sizes and methodological heterogeneity. Controlled trials are needed to establish efficacy and patient selection criteria.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary brain tumor incidence and management: decisions that went right [^114nyEqo]. Neuro-Oncology Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were significant alterations in the diagnoses and treatments for all neoplasms due to drastic changes in healthcare system priorities, quarantine restrictions, and patient behavior, among other systemic factors. Overwhelmed with the influx of COVID-19 patients, many hospitals postponed or cancelled elective procedures, including routine screenings and nonurgent surgeries. Moreover, fewer patients sought medical care for early and nonspecific symptoms, such as headaches, nausea, and neurological changes.

These disruptions are echoed through a significantly altered ability to diagnose and treat all primary brain tumor patients. Although our results showed a decrease in the age-adjusted incidence of all primary brain tumors between 2016 and 2021, we found no significant change in the relative incidence of primary malignant brain tumor diagnosed from before and after the peak COVID-19 pandemic. This trend was most likely propelled by a decrease in the number of primary benign brain tumors diagnosed during this time period, though statistically insignificant. The malignant brain tumor patient population underwent a quicker time to treatment from diagnosis and were more likely to receive chemotherapy over radiation, the latter likely to mitigate COVID-19 exposure. Overall, this constellation of findings undercovers new trends with regards to behavior and healthcare delivery in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic where the incidence and treatment of primary brain tumor, especially malignant tumors, were not severely affected as these tumors were more likely to be prioritized during COVID-19.

### Multivariate profile and acute-phase correlates of cognitive deficits in a COVID-19 hospitalised cohort [^117KLyeG]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

There is growing evidence that COVID-19 can cause lasting cognitive and mental health problems. Recovered patients reporting psychological symptoms including fatigue, cognitive difficulties ("brain fog" and "problems finding the words"), sleep disturbances breathlessness and psychiatric disorders months after infection. In the UK alone, 13.7% of 20,000 individuals reported having symptoms inclusive of cognitive difficulties 12 weeks after a positive COVID-19 test (UK Office for National Statistics, April 2021). Mild cases can report persistent cognitive symptoms; however, prevalence is higher in severe cases, with ∼33–76% of patients suffering cognitive symptoms 3–6 months post hospitalisation.

The neurobiological and psychological bases of these deficits remain unclear. Imaging biomarker studies indicate multiple likely candidates. Indeed, drawing parallels with serious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), middle eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) and post-critical illness/intensive care syndrome, a range of neurological/ central nervous system (CNS) complications can arise from infection. Most notably, encephalitis, ischaemia, haemorrhage, microstructural and functional changes and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) have been observed in COVID-19 patients, and more recently, evidence of brainstem inflammation using 7 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported. There has been concern regarding whether cognitive deficits will remain for years as a chronic syndrome, and whether patients who develop CVD as a result of infection will experience neurodegeneration and dementia in the long-term, despite recovery of other acute and sub-acute symptoms.

### Neuropsychologic profiles and cerebral glucose metabolism in neurocognitive long COVID syndrome [^111V7H5A]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic proceeds, the long-term consequences such as chronic neurocognitive symptoms after infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are an increasingly recognized problem. A multitude of previously healthy patients self-report symptoms such as brain-fog, memory loss (18%–40%), attentional problems (16%–34%), and fatigue (60%–70%) months after the acute infection has long subsided. The label "long COVID syndrome" has recently been established for these symptoms in the aftermath of an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, the underlying pathophysiology remains unclear.

We described impaired cognitive functions associated with frontoparietal hypometabolism (indicating cortical dysfunction) on 18 F-FDG PET in COVID-19 patients approximately 1 mo after the acute infection. When voxelwise principal components analysis is used, a COVID-19–related spatial covariance pattern has emerged, the expression of which tightly correlates with performance in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). In a subgroup of these patients, a long-term follow-up (6–7 mo after infection) revealed a substantial but still incomplete recovery of cognitive deficits and cortical dysfunction on 18 F-FDG PET. Likewise, a predominantly frontal cortical hypometabolism, which improved during follow-up after 6 mo, was detected in patients with COVID-19–related encephalopathy. Deviating from these findings, regional hypometabolism of limbic and paralimbic regions extending to the brain stem and cerebellum or hypometabolism of the right parahippocampal gyrus and thalamus has been described in COVID-19 patients examined at 3–4 mo after symptom onset.

### What is brain fog? [^11188vgn]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The term 'brain fog' is increasingly used colloquially to describe difficulties in the cognitive realm. But what is brain fog? What sort of experiences do people talk about when they talk about brain fog? And, in turn, what might this tell us about potential underlying pathophysiological mechanisms? This study examined first-person descriptions in order to better understand the phenomenology of brain fog.

Methods

Posts containing 'brain fog' were scraped from the social media platform Reddit, using python, over a week in October 2021. We examined descriptions of brain fog, themes of containing subreddits (topic-specific discussion forums), and causal attributions.

Results

1663 posts containing 'brain fog' were identified, 717 meeting inclusion criteria. 141 first person phenomenological descriptions depicted forgetfulness (51), difficulty concentrating (43), dissociative phenomena (34), cognitive 'slowness' and excessive effort (26), communication difficulties (22), 'fuzziness' or pressure (10) and fatigue (9). 50% (363/717) posts were in subreddits concerned with illness and disease: including COVID-19 (87), psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, autoimmune and functional disorders. 134 posts were in subreddits about drug use or discontinuation, and 44 in subreddits about abstention from masturbation. 570 posts included the poster's causal attribution, the most frequent attribution being long COVID in 60/570 (10%).

Conclusions

'Brain fog' is used on Reddit to describe heterogeneous experiences, including of dissociation, fatigue, forgetfulness and excessive cognitive effort, and in association with a range of illnesses, drugs and behaviours. Encouraging detailed description of these experiences will help us better understand pathophysiological mechanisms underlying cognitive symptoms in health and disease.

### Prevalence of symptoms, comorbidities, fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology in individuals with long COVID / post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) [^11595tKx]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fibrin(ogen) amyloid microclots and platelet hyperactivation previously reported as a novel finding in South African patients with the coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) and Long COVID/Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), might form a suitable set of foci for the clinical treatment of the symptoms of Long COVID/PASC. A Long COVID/PASC Registry was subsequently established as an online platform where patients can report Long COVID/PASC symptoms and previous comorbidities.

Methods

In this study, we report on the comorbidities and persistent symptoms, using data obtained from 845 South African Long COVID/PASC patients. By using a previously published scoring system for fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology, we also analysed blood samples from 80 patients, and report the presence of significant fibrin amyloid microclots and platelet pathology in all cases.

Results

Hypertension, high cholesterol levels (dyslipidaemia), cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were found to be the most important comorbidities. The gender balance (70% female) and the most commonly reported Long COVID/PASC symptoms (fatigue, brain fog, loss of concentration and forgetfulness, shortness of breath, as well as joint and muscle pains) were comparable to those reported elsewhere. These findings confirmed that our sample was not atypical. Microclot and platelet pathologies were associated with Long COVID/PASC symptoms that persisted after the recovery from acute COVID-19.

Conclusions

Fibrin amyloid microclots that block capillaries and inhibit the transport of O 2 to tissues, accompanied by platelet hyperactivation, provide a ready explanation for the symptoms of Long COVID/PASC. Removal and reversal of these underlying endotheliopathies provide an important treatment option that urgently warrants controlled clinical studies to determine efficacy in patients with a diversity of comorbidities impacting on SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. We suggest that our platelet and clotting grading system provides a simple and cost-effective diagnostic method for early detection of Long COVID/PASC as a major determinant of effective treatment, including those focusing on reducing clot burden and platelet hyperactivation.

### Long COVID signs and symptoms… [^113iJGk8]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points Long COVID can include a wide range of ongoing symptoms and conditions that can last weeks, months, or even years. Most people with Long COVID symptoms see significant improvement after 3 months, while others may see improvement up to 6 months after symptoms first appear. Some people may experience health problems from different types and combinations of symptoms that require comprehensive care. Be difficult to recognize or diagnose Require comprehensive care Result in disability Fact Fatigue, brain fog, and post-exertional malaise are commonly reported symptoms, but more than 200 Long COVID symptoms have been identified. 1 2 3 Other commonly reported symptoms:

Neurological symptoms Difficulty thinking or concentrating Headaches Sleep problems Dizziness when you stand up Pins-and-needles feelings Change in smell or taste Depression or anxiety Digestive Symptoms Diarrhea Stomach pain Constipation. Some people, especially those who had severe COVID-19, may experience multi-organ effects or autoimmune conditions lasting weeks, months, or even years after COVID-19 illness. 4 5 Multi-organ effects can involve many body systems, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, skin, and brain. 3 Symptoms for many of these multi-organ complications are similar to commonly reported Long COVID symptoms. As a result of these effects, people who have had COVID-19 may be more likely to develop new or worsening of health conditions such as:

Muscle weakness Problems with thinking and judgment Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder For people who experience PICS following a COVID-19 diagnosis, it is difficult to determine whether these health problems are caused by a severe illness, the virus itself, or a combination of both. Long COVID and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome. Some people with Long COVID experience symptoms similar to those reported by people who suffer from other poorly understood chronic illnesses that may occur after other infections, such as Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. 8 People with ME/CFS and other infection-associated illnesses can have difficulty.

Recognizing and identifying symptoms of their illness Being believed by family, friends and healthcare providers Getting a diagnosis Managing their symptoms or conditions CDC is working with partners to better understand and support people suffering from Long COVID, ME/CFS, and other chronic illnesses.

### Evaluating and supporting patients presenting with cognitive symptoms following COVID… [^111XR9Ur]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview During this COCA Call, presenters will discuss post-COVID conditions, an umbrella term for the wide range of health consequences that are present four or more weeks after infection with SARS-CoV-2, which includes long COVID. Cognitive symptoms, often described by patients as "brain fog", are frequently reported following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation has recently published a Multi-Disciplinary Collaborative Consensus Guidance Statement on the Assessment and Treatment of Cognitive Symptoms in PCC that provides practical guidance to clinicians in the assessment and treatment of individuals with cognitive symptoms and a history consistent with PCC. The burden of PCC is expected to reflect the disproportionate burden of infection by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and to highlight ongoing inequities in health care.

The Health Equity Work Group of the AAPM&R has developed guidance to highlight the central role that principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion play in delivering quality health care. Presenters Jennifer Cope, MD, MPH Medical Officer Post-COVID Conditions Team Epidemiology Task Force COVID-19 Response Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Michelle Haddad, PhD Director of Post-COVID Neuropsychology Clinic Director of Inpatient Neuropsychology.
