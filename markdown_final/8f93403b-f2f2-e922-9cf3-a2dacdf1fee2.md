## Question

cranial nerve iii palsy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cranial nerve III (oculomotor) palsy, including its clinical presentation, etiologies, diagnostic approach, management, and prognosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the neuroanatomy and classic clinical phenotype. Then, I should categorize etiologies by mechanism and age group. Next, I will outline a risk-stratified diagnostic algorithm, including when to image emergently versus observe. After that, I should detail management by cause and supportive care. Finally, I will synthesize prognostic factors and close with a concise clinical takeaway and safety pearls, making sure I verify each claim against the best available evidence as I go.

> Let me first confirm the neuroanatomy and clinical phenotype so I don't miss the forest for the trees. The oculomotor nerve originates in the midbrain, traverses the subarachnoid space, passes through the cavernous sinus, and enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure to innervate most extraocular muscles and the levator palpebrae, with parasympathetic fibers controlling pupillary constriction and accommodation; thus, palsy typically produces ptosis, an eye positioned "down and out" with limited elevation, adduction, and depression, and mydriasis when parasympathetic fibers are involved, which is a key diagnostic clue for compressive etiologies.

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before I categorize the major mechanisms. I need to check the large contemporary series: in adults, inflammation/autoimmunity, space-occupying lesions (aneurysm, tumor, cavernous sinus processes), ischemia/microvascular disease, and idiopathic causes predominate, with brainstem infarctions notably represented in CN III palsy; in children and adolescents, neoplasia is the most common cause and idiopathic or inflammatory etiologies are less frequent, so age meaningfully shifts pretest probabilities and imaging thresholds [^112mJEsN] [^111dyvwL] [^1155CxdB].

> Wait, let me verify the vascular risk profile and the "pupil-sparing" concept because this drives urgency. Microvascular ischemia is common in older adults with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, and pupil-sparing third nerve palsies in this context are often ischemic; however, I should double-check that even relative pupil-sparing does not absolutely exclude compressive disease, and indeed, prospective data show a meaningful fraction of presumed microvascular cases harbor other causes, including aneurysm, tumor, or brainstem infarction, so I need to ensure I don't over-attribute to ischemia without appropriate imaging when red flags are present [^112PDPd9] [^1163fi6g].

> I will now examine the diagnostic approach, and I need to ensure I align with high-quality guidance. Immediate neuroimaging is mandatory for any pupil-involved third nerve palsy, for complete palsies, for partial palsies with pain or progressive deficits, for patients under 50 years old, for those with cancer history, or for any nonresolving isolated palsy by about 3 months; MRI with contrast of the brain, skull base, cavernous sinus, and orbits is first-line, with CTA or MRA of the head to exclude posterior communicating artery aneurysm when compression is suspected, and CSF analysis is indicated when inflammation, infection, or meningeal disease is on the table [^113U7rJw] [^117JZQaa] [^111dyvwL].

> Let me think about the management by etiology, and I should confirm that I'm not mixing acute and chronic strategies. For compressive lesions such as aneurysm or pituitary apoplexy, urgent neurosurgical or endovascular intervention is indicated when there is progressive deficit, mass effect, or altered consciousness; for presumed microvascular ischemia, observation with risk factor optimization is standard and many recover spontaneously; for inflammatory causes like Tolosa-Hunt, sarcoidosis, or demyelination, high-dose corticosteroids are first-line; for infectious etiologies such as Lyme disease or bacterial meningitis, targeted antimicrobial therapy is essential; for traumatic or iatrogenic palsies, supportive care and strabismus rehabilitation are key, with botulinum toxin or surgery considered for persistent deviations [^1117gum8] [^117JZQaa] [^114o1JVv] [^115cKt3q].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or multifocal; I should double-check for mimics and systemic clues. Myasthenia gravis can mimic a pupil-sparing third nerve palsy and should be considered with fluctuating ptosis and diplopia; botulism presents with multiple cranial neuropathies and descending paralysis and requires urgent antitoxin; immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity can produce cranial neuropathies and mandates steroid therapy after excluding aneurysm; and aberrant regeneration after trauma or compression is a hallmark that should prompt careful imaging review for prior compressive injury [^114PMvJF] [^114o1JVv].

> Next, I should review prognosis so I counsel accurately. Let me verify the factors repeatedly linked to better recovery: shorter time from onset to presentation under 7 days, isolated nerve involvement, inflammatory or ischemic etiologies, and smaller initial deviation angle are associated with higher rates of complete recovery; conversely, multiple cranial nerve involvement, compressive etiologies, and delayed presentation portend poorer outcomes, and in children, neoplastic causes and delayed diagnosis worsen prognosis, reinforcing the need for early MRI in pediatric cases [^1146ABKg] [^113Pnmvz] [^116y6fYZ] [^1155CxdB].

> Hold on, I should verify the practical safety pearls so nothing critical is missed. Any new-onset third nerve palsy with pupillary involvement warrants emergent imaging to exclude aneurysm; even in presumed microvascular cases, if there is no improvement by 3 months, imaging should be pursued to uncover compressive or inflammatory causes; and in patients with cancer or atypical features, maintain a low threshold for MRI and CSF analysis to detect leptomeningeal disease or paraneoplastic processes [^113U7rJw] [^117JZQaa] [^114o1JVv].

> Let me reconsider the overall clinical message to ensure internal consistency. Cranial nerve III palsy is a neuro-ophthalmic emergency until proven otherwise because compressive etiologies, especially posterior communicating artery aneurysm, can present with pupil involvement and progress rapidly; a structured, risk-stratified approach anchored by careful pupillary examination, age, pain, tempo, and associated deficits, followed by timely MRI/MRA and selective CSF testing, yields the highest diagnostic yield and guides definitive therapy, while prognosis hinges on etiology, acuity of presentation, and extent of nerve involvement [^113U7rJw] [^117JZQaa].

---

Cranial nerve III palsy presents with **ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and anisocoria** (mydriasis with sluggish reaction) due to oculomotor nerve dysfunction. The most common causes are **microvascular ischemia** (pupil-sparing) in older adults with vascular risk factors, and **compressive lesions** (pupil-involved) such as posterior communicating artery aneurysm or cavernous sinus masses [^117JZQaa] [^114aqsiQ]. Immediate **neuroimaging** (MRI/MRA or CT angiography) is required for pupil-involved palsy or in patients under 50 years to exclude aneurysm or mass [^113U7rJw]. Management is cause-specific: observe microvascular cases, treat aneurysms or masses surgically or endovascularly, and use steroids for inflammatory etiologies [^116Ctfsg] [^1117gum8] [^111cWJz5]. Prognosis depends on etiology and severity, with microvascular palsies often recovering spontaneously, while compressive or inflammatory palsies may persist without targeted therapy [^116y6fYZ] [^1146ABKg].

## Clinical presentation

CN III palsy has a characteristic constellation of signs:

- **Ptosis**: Drooping of the upper eyelid due to levator palpebrae superioris weakness [^112zy1HP].
- **Ophthalmoplegia**: Impaired movement of the superior, medial, and inferior recti, and inferior oblique, causing the eye to rest "down and out" with limited elevation, adduction, and depression [^112zy1HP].
- **Mydriasis**: Dilated, fixed pupil with loss of accommodation due to parasympathetic fiber involvement [^112zy1HP].
- **Anisocoria**: Unequal pupils, with the affected pupil larger and sluggishly reactive [^112zy1HP].

Pupil involvement distinguishes compressive from ischemic etiologies: **pupil-sparing** palsies are typical of microvascular ischemia, whereas **pupil-involved** palsies suggest compression [^1163fi6g].

---

## Etiology

CN III palsy has a broad differential, summarized below:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Vascular | - Microvascular ischemia (diabetes, hypertension) [^117JZQaa] <br/> - Posterior communicating artery aneurysm [^114aqsiQ] <br/> - Brainstem infarction [^117JZQaa] |
| Compressive | - Pituitary adenoma [^114aqsiQ] <br/> - Cavernous sinus mass (meningioma, metastasis) [^114aqsiQ] <br/> - Uncal herniation [^113pcJq9] |
| Inflammatory | - Tolosa-Hunt syndrome [^114aqsiQ] <br/> - Multiple sclerosis [^112eMa7v] <br/> - Sarcoidosis [^114aqsiQ] |
| Infectious | - Meningitis (bacterial, tuberculous) [^115cKt3q] <br/> - Lyme disease [^113E6RMq] <br/> - Herpes zoster [^notfound] |
| Traumatic | - Basilar skull fracture [^notfound] <br/> - Direct orbital trauma [^notfound] |
| Miscellaneous | - Ophthalmoplegic migraine [^113Eeh1i] <br/> - Cavernous sinus thrombosis [^114aqsiQ] <br/> - Pituitary apoplexy [^1117gum8] |

---

Microvascular ischemia is the **most common cause in older adults** with vascular risk factors, whereas compressive lesions predominate in younger patients or those with pupil involvement [^117JZQaa] [^114YZ2Uh].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

A structured approach is essential:

- **History**: Onset, pain, vascular risk factors, trauma, infection, malignancy, autoimmune disease [^notfound].
- **Examination**: Detailed cranial nerve exam, including pupils, extraocular movements, and other neurologic signs [^112zy1HP].
- **Imaging**: MRI/MRA or CT angiography is mandatory for pupil-involved palsy, patients under 50, or those with progressive deficits to exclude aneurysm or mass [^113U7rJw].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, ESR/CRP, glucose, HbA1c, Lyme serology, ACE, and CSF analysis when indicated [^notfound].

---

## Management

Management is **cause-specific**:

- **Microvascular ischemia**: Observation, control vascular risk factors, and prism or occlusion for diplopia; most recover spontaneously over weeks to months [^notfound].
- **Compressive lesions**: Surgical clipping or endovascular coiling for aneurysm; surgical resection or radiation for tumors; urgent decompression for pituitary apoplexy with visual loss [^1117gum8].
- **Inflammatory etiologies**: High-dose corticosteroids for Tolosa-Hunt, sarcoidosis, or multiple sclerosis [^notfound].
- **Supportive care**: Eye patching, lubrication, and prisms to prevent corneal injury and manage diplopia [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies by **etiology and severity**. Microvascular palsies generally recover spontaneously, whereas compressive or inflammatory palsies may persist without targeted therapy. Early recognition and treatment of compressive lesions improve outcomes and prevent permanent deficits [^116y6fYZ] [^1117gum8].

---

Cranial nerve III palsy is a **neuro-ophthalmic emergency** characterized by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and anisocoria. Rapid identification of etiology — especially exclusion of aneurysm or mass — and targeted therapy are critical to optimize recovery and prevent permanent deficits [^113U7rJw].

### Cranial nerve palsies in childhood [^114xAyfX]. Eye (2015). Low credibility.

We review ocular motor cranial nerve palsies in childhood and highlight many of the features that differentiate these from their occurrence in adulthood. The clinical characteristics of cranial nerve palsies in childhood are affected by the child's impressive ability to repair and regenerate after injury. Thus, aberrant regeneration is very common after congenital III palsy; Duane syndrome, the result of early repair after congenital VI palsy, is invariably associated with retraction of the globe in adduction related to the innervation of the lateral rectus by the III nerve causing co-contraction in adduction. Clinical features that may be of concern in adulthood may not be relevant in childhood; whereas the presence of mydriasis in III palsy suggests a compressive aetiology in adults, this is not the case in children. However, the frequency of associated CNS abnormalities in III palsy and the risk of tumour in VI palsy can be indications for early neuroimaging depending on presenting features elicited through a careful history and clinical examination. The latter should include the neighbouring cranial nerves. We discuss the impact of our evolving knowledge of congenital cranial dysinnervation syndromes on this field.

### Facial nerve palsy: etiology and approach to diagnosis and treatment [^113G2oTB]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Facial nerve palsy has a broad differential diagnosis and possible psychological and anatomical consequences. A thorough investigation must be performed to determine the cause of the palsy and to direct treatment. If no cause can be found, therapy with prednisone with or without an antiviral medication can be considered and begun as early as possible after onset of symptoms. Resolution and time to recovery vary with etiology, but overall prognosis is good.

Bell's palsy — patient follow-up: Clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C, Level of confidence in evidence: High, Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm, and Policy level: Recommendation. Rationale includes that based on the natural history of Bell's palsy most patients will show complete recovery 3 months after onset, that failure to recover completely within 3 months warrants reevaluation to reconsider the initial diagnosis, and that the 3-month timeframe is an appropriate window to identify other causes.

Understanding the natural progression of these conditions is vital for guiding clinical decisions and providing appropriate patient care. However, there is a current gap in the literature on the prognostic factors that affect the recovery rate. Investigating these factors allows for a comprehensive assessment of patient outcomes and provides valuable insights into optimizing management strategies for these neuro-ophthalmologic conditions.

In this study, we aim to report the etiologies, clinical courses, and factors associated with good prognosis in a tertiary referral hospital. Furthermore, we conducted a literature review to compare our study with previous reports.

### Complete, pupil-sparing third nerve palsy in a patient with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor… [^114WZNgK]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Magnetic resonance images. A, Coronal T2-weighted image showing a sphenoid sinus mass. B, Coronal contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image. R indicates right; L, left; H, head; and F, feet. A 72-year-old man with controlled hypertension had a 5-week history of left ptosis and diplopia. The patient had normal visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields in each eye. The pupils were isocoric and equally and normally reactive to light and near stimulation. The right upper eyelid was in normal position and the right eye moved fully in all directions. The left upper eyelid was completely ptotic. The left eye had no elevation, depression, or adduction, but there was normal abduction and intorsion on attempted downgaze in abduction. The rest of the examination revealed no abnormalities.

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a hyperintense, heterogeneous, multilobulated mass centered in the sphenoid sinus on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, with heterogeneous enhancement and central nonenhancing parts with evidence of bilateral cavernous sinus invasion on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Within a month after surgery, the patient's eyelid had returned to a normal position and his double vision had resolved. Examination at that time revealed normal visual sensory function, full extraocular movements, and no ocular misalignment in any field of gaze. What was the cause of third nerve palsy in our case. One possibility is that it was related not to the tumor but to the patient's underlying vascular disease. This would be consistent with the painless onset of the palsy and its complete resolution after about 7 months, although this is somewhat longer than one would expect in such a setting.

Although lesions of the sphenoid sinus do not commonly produce third nerve palsies, a few such examples have been reported. 5, 6 Thus, the mass could have affected the oculomotor nerve in the anterior cavernous sinus by compression, by producing an inflammatory reaction, or by causing focal ischemia. Any of these mechanisms could account for the rapid resolution of the palsy following resection of the lesion. In any event, this case provides support for the recommendation that a patient with an isolated, complete, pupil-sparing OMNP be evaluated with neuroimaging when there is no evidence of improvement after several months.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^114HGp7i]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Abducens nerve palsy was the most common palsy, and oculomotor nerve palsy had the shortest onset and recovery period. Complete recovery was associated with an onset of < 7 days and isolated cranial nerve palsy. Further research may identify additional factors influencing good outcomes, ultimately improving patient care and recovery prospects.

Many reasons support the association between a short onset of presentation and good prognosis. First, it may reflect the cause of abrupt changes in nerve function, such as inflammation, ischemia, or infection, which can be reversible or treatable. Second, early onset may reflect early detection and subsequent intervention, leading to significant improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. Third, early intervention may improve neural plasticity, which offers a better chance of function regeneration and restoration. Fourth, a short onset may lower the risk of complications arising from chronic or long-standing conditions, such as muscle contracture. Finally, patients with recent onset may be more motivated to adhere to treatment plans and follow-up appointments, resulting in a positive influence on prognosis. In this study, early onset before 7 days was significantly associated with good recovery (odds ratio 1.73; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.89). Urgent visits and prompt treatment of these conditions may affect the excellent recovery rate.

For various reasons, involvement of multiple cranial nerves can result in poor outcomes. At first, multiple cranial nerve palsy resulted from a wide range of complicated etiologies, such as systemic diseases, autoimmunity, infection, or tumor. The complexity of addressing these underlying conditions can make management challenging and influence prognosis. Second, multiple cranial nerve palsies often signify more extensive nerve damage or a lesion affecting multiple nerve pathways. The extent of neurologic involvement can lead to more profound and lasting deficits. Finally, the simultaneous involvement of multiple cranial nerves may reduce the likelihood of complete recovery, especially if the underlying cause is severe or not readily treatable. Our study indicated that isolated cranial nerve involvement led to good outcomes (odds ratio 2.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.21–5.39). Extensive etiologies might require complicated treatment, affecting unfavorable clinical outcomes.

### Infliximab-associated third nerve palsy… [^1121MWy4]. JAMA Network (2006). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. W. RICHARDGREEN, MD A third nerve palsy may show gadolinium enhancement of the cisternal segment of the oculomotor nerve on magnetic resonance imaging. Causes include inflammation, infection, neoplasm, ophthalmoplegic migraine, and demyelination. Infliximab, a tumor necrosis factor α inhibitor, may cause demyelination or increase relapses in patients with multiple sclerosis. 1 We report a patient who developed a TNP associated with infliximab use. On examination, he had minimal ptosis and limitation of elevation and adduction of the right eye. Pupils were equal in size and reactivity. Visual acuity, dilated fundus examination, neurologic examination, and review of systems were unremarkable. Other medications included 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily and 10 mg of methotrexate weekly. He took latanoprost and carteolol hydrochloride for glaucoma.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed gadolinium enhancement of the cisternal segment of the right oculomotor nerve. There were no white matter lesions or dural enhancement. After stopping infliximab administration, the diplopia and ptosis gradually resolved during 3 months. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging showed resolution of the oculomotor nerve enhancement. No new neurologic symptoms had developed after 16 months' follow-up. High-resolution axial and coronal fat-suppressed, gadolinium-enhanced, T1-weighted images demonstrate prominent enhancement of the cisternal segment of the right third cranial nerve. A and B, Similar follow-up images in the same patient show resolution of the abnormal enhancement of the right third cranial nerve. Several disorders may cause enhancement of the cisternal segment and palsy of the oculomotor nerve. The transient and isolated nature of the palsy described herein suggests demyelination.

Evaluation did not reveal evidence of infection, inflammation, or migraine. Seven cases of demyelinating TNP associated with enhancement of the oculomotor nerve cisternal segment were reported in patients with multiple sclerosis. 3 Although, to our knowledge, demyelinating TNP has not been reported previously, others have described peripheral, multifocal motor neuropathy occurring 3 to 24 months after initiation of infliximab therapy. 4.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^113GWcwF]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes that a minority of facial paresis/paralysis cases have identifiable causes and should not be treated as Bell's palsy; approximately 70% of facial nerve palsies are Bell's palsy and 30% have other causes, so clinicians should take a comprehensive history, confirm the acute onset of symptoms, document other cranial nerve function, inquire about viral prodrome or hyperacusis and underlying conditions (e.g., prior stroke, brain or parotid tumors, skin cancers of the head/face, trauma, recent infections), and perform a comprehensive physical examination including inspection of the ear canal, tympanic membrane, parotid gland, and head/face/cheek skin, ruling out ear infection, cholesteatoma, and vesicular rashes; atypical presentations (including bilateral facial nerve paresis/paralysis) may warrant additional specialized and more extensive laboratory testing, and clinicians should consider infrequent causes such as Lyme disease in endemic areas, sarcoidosis, Guillain–Barré syndrome, Sjögren's syndrome, and leprosy; Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion and Table 7 outlines categories and distinguishing features of other causes, with disproportionate presentation among pregnant women and people with diabetes, influenza, a cold, or other upper respiratory illness.

### Consensus disease definitions for ophthalmic immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^114o1JVv]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Immune-related mononeuritis of cranial nerves III (oculomotor), IV (trochlear), VI (abducens)

Common: Mononeuritis of any one of the three nerves innervating the extraocular muscles typically presents with diplopia. This is horizontal for CN VI, mostly vertical for CN IV and can be a combination of both or be vertical-oblique in the case of CN III. The latter also innervates the pupil and levator palpebrae superioris muscle and, therefore, CN III palsy typically presents with ptosis and ipsilateral mydriasis. Eye pain or headache may also accompany inflammation or infarction of any of these CNs (online supplemental tables 9,10,11).

It should be noted that extraocular muscle abnormalities and binocular diplopia in the setting of ICI use are more typically related to immune-related MG or immune-related myositis than to mononeuritis of CNs. These are defined in the previously published irAE-N guidelines and should be carefully excluded.

In addition to an irAE, alternative causes of cranial neuropathy should be considered, including nerve compression and microvascular disease. Particularly in the case of a CN III palsy, urgent vascular imaging with CT angiography or magnetic resonance angiography of the head should be performed to rule out an enlarging aneurysm. Once this is ruled out, an MRI of the skull base, cavernous sinus, and orbit with contrast and fat-suppressed sequences should be obtained to assess for inflammation anywhere along the course of these nerves. If an inflammatory cranial neuropathy is suspected, additional serologies may provide clues, as outlined. This may include testing for GQ1b antibodies particularly in the presence of multiple cranial neuropathies and other features of the Miller Fisher syndrome such as ataxia or areflexia.

A definitive diagnosis of an Eye-irAE affecting one of these CNs is made based on the presence of classic symptoms of nerve palsy, negative imaging for metastasis or aneurysm, and rapid improvement of symptoms with steroids. Treatment is typically with high-dose oral steroids with slow taper to prevent rebound.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^115yQNeC]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, this study had a retrospective design. The neuroimaging protocol was inconsistent across all subjects, with variations based on clinical presentations. Second, a selection bias may exist. The patient source primarily consisted of referrals to a tertiary hospital, potentially leading to an overrepresentation of severe underlying pathologies in our research. Due to differences in referral patterns, this might influence the prevalence of specific etiologies related to third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies, such as those resulting from trauma. Third, because all data were collected from a single center, predominantly from patients with one ethnicity, it is crucial to exercise caution when applying these findings directly to other racial or ethnic groups.

Future research should focus on uncovering additional prognostic factors for cranial nerve palsies. Exploring advanced neuroimaging and biomarkers may refine our understanding of etiological subtypes and therapies. Collaborative, multicenter studies can enhance the applicability of the findings, ultimately optimizing patient care and long-term recovery for those with cranial nerve palsies.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1166M2JK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — clinical overview from the abstract describes that Bell's palsy is the most common acute mono-neuropathy and the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis; it is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause that leads to partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side; although typically self-limited, it may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and inability to close the eye with potential eye injury; many available diagnostic tests are of questionable benefit, and misdiagnosis or unnecessary delay in diagnosis are concerns.

Bell's palsy — algorithm of guideline key action statements: For a patient presenting with acute onset, unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, assess with history & physical exam to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis/paralysis, prescribe oral steroids, and offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids. If the Bell's palsy patient has incomplete eye closure, implement eye protection. If the Bell's palsy patient has complete facial paralysis, offer electrodiagnostic testing. When any of the following are present — new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, ocular symptoms developing at any point, or incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial onset — reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist or ocular specialist for ocular symptoms; if none apply, acute management of patient complete.

### Extraocular cranial nerve palsies in children [^114zXHu6]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Visual disturbances resulting from acute nerve paralysis of the muscles controlling eye movements can be challenging to evaluate in the pediatric population. Children may not be capable of describing symptoms or providing an adequate history. Therefore, it is important to have an understanding of the anatomical course of the extraocular cranial nerves and clinical manifestations of their dysfunction. We report 2 cases of extraocular cranial nerve palsies and, in addition to an anatomical review, discuss the common etiologies of paralysis and the importance of ophthalmological and neurological follow-up to ensure optimal long-term visual function.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^112mJEsN]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The causes of OMNPs are very heterogeneous, ranging from neoplasms, aneurysms and brainstem infarctions to autoimmune diseases, viral/bacterial infections or trauma. However, even if diagnostic tools such as MRI and CSF analysis are routinely applied according to a prespecified protocol, up to a quarter of the cases remained unexplained. However, the use of these modern diagnostic tools enabled us to diagnose the causes more precisely. As a result, the inflammatory and ischaemic causes of OMNP were observed to be much more frequent than previously reported. We found that about one fifth of CNP III were caused by brainstem infarctions, for which a MRI was essential. We were also able to show that evidence for an additional CNP, especially those of the second, fifth or seventh CN, can serve as a valuable information on the location of the lesion. Furthermore, if an additional nerve is affected the etiological profile changed strongly in the direction to inflammation and space-occupying lesions. Because multiple nerve involvement often means the presence of a larger lesion, these are more likely to be detected on MRI. The use of modern diagnostic tools is the basis for future interventional trials.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^1124VT9w]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

In the following, we focused on the patients with multiple cranial nerve palsies (26.8% of the cohort); here, the etiologies of inflammation and space-occupying lesions were overrepresented if compared to single nerves. In addition, the proportion of idiopathic palsies in patients with multiple CNP was only 9.8% (total cohort: 23.4%). A reason why multiple CNP can be assigned to a defined etiology more frequently than isolated OMNP might be, that the involvement of multiple nerves indicates the presence of larger lesions. However, it was also obvious, that an additionally affected nerve can provide more information about its location of the cause in the brain. For example, CNP III is closest to CN II and CN V at the cavernous sinus and intraorbitally, so a lesion would be anatomically most plausible there. In fact, two thirds of CNP III with an additional CNP II or V were located there. Another 15% were caused by an anatomically defined lesion in the brainstem or at the root. Every eighth patient (12.2%, N = 18) also had a palsy of the seventh nerve (CNP VII), who enters the inner auditory canal directly after exiting the brainstem. Therefore, the anatomical proximity between CNP III and VII can only be considered inside the brainstem or directly after its exit. Supporting the hypothesis, 61.1% of the lesions could be ascribed to the brainstem or the roots and neighbouring meninges, when both nerves where affected. Another 16.7% had an underlying systemic disease such as multiple sclerosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1113YWHP]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Natural history and therapies — most patients with Bell's palsy show some recovery without intervention within 2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptoms and completely recover within 3 to 4 months; even without treatment, facial function is completely restored in approximately 70% of patients with complete paralysis within 6 months and as high as 94% of patients with incomplete paralysis, with as many as 30% not recovering completely; corticosteroids and antiviral medications are the most commonly used medical therapies, and the benefit of surgical decompression of the facial nerve remains relatively controversial.

### Unilateral third nerve palsy caused by Guillain-Barrésyndrome [^115cqBg3]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Highly asymmetric clinical signs in a patient suggest the need for caution in making the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS).

Methods

Case report and literature review. We present a case of strictly unilateral left third cranial nerve palsy in a patient with GBS, review other highly asymmetrical cranial nerve palsies previously reported in this condition, and suggest an appropriate alternative differential diagnosis.

Conclusion

Unilateral third cranial nerve palsy is an exceptionally rare manifestation of GBS, expanding the spectrum of clinical signs and neuraxis involvement that may be seen in the condition.

### Oculomotor nerve palsy as an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease [^113yJoZP]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may present with extraintestinal manifestations. Neurological symptoms associated with IBD are infrequent. Thus, any unexplained neurological symptom that occurs in patients with IBD should raise the suspicion of a link between the two disorders. We report a case of a man in his 60s, who was diagnosed with Crohn's disease and developed ptosis and diplopia. Neurological examination revealed oculomotor nerve palsy, sparing the pupil. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain were insignificant and no other cause was determined. He was treated with oral corticosteroids and symptoms gradually subsided. Cranial nerve palsies associated with IBD have been rarely reported. They usually involve the optic and acoustic nerve and are attributed to a common dysimmune base. This is the first reported case of oculomotor nerve palsy (III cranial nerve) associated with IBD. Clinicians treating patients with IBD should be alert for unusual neurological complications and treat them appropriately.

### Isolated III cranial nerve palsy: a Hodgkin's lymphoma? [^115tUeGe]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

A 69-year-old woman developed ptosis and diplopia due to an isolated pupil-involving left oculomotor nerve palsy. General examination was unremarkable. Initial workup showed a mild increase in cerebrospinal fluid proteins. Imaging studies were remarkable for a left oculomotor nerve enhancement in brain MRI and hyperfixation along the nerve's pathway in full body single-photon emission CT. Assuming the possible diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis, the patient was started on high-dose methylprednisolone. Three months later she developed pancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy was performed and histopathology revealed infiltration by Hodgkin's lymphoma. Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine protocol chemotherapy was started and full haematological remission obtained after four cycles, despite mild oculomotor nerve palsy persisted. Isolated oculomotor palsy as the first presenting manifestation of a lymphoma is rare and alternative differential diagnosis must be considered in the absence of other lymphoma manifestations. In this case as with many rare initial manifestations of common diseases watchful waiting was crucial to the correct diagnosis and treatment strategy.

### Cranial nerve III palsy induced by adjuvant capecitabine for cholangiocarcinoma [^114S7UN1]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

A man in his 70s with completely resected cholangiocarcinoma started adjuvant treatment with capecitabine chemotherapy. Within 3weeks he developed complete left-sided ptosis with loss of ocular adduction, elevation and depression. There were no other neurological features; CT and MRI scans of the brain were normal. He had no history of diabetes and blood pressure was reasonably controlled. A diagnosis of capecitabine-induced cranial nerve III palsy was made and no further capecitabine was given. The patient's ptosis improved within a month and there was full resolution within 2months. He continued with follow-up surveillance CT scans for cholangiocarcinoma. This is the first reported cranial nerve III palsy due to capecitabine, the aetiology of which is uncertain. It is important that clinicians are able to recognise this as a potential complication as capecitabine is commonly given in combination with other agents for various cancer types.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^111dyvwL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cranial nerve palsy is a complex neurologic disorder that is characterized by the dysfunction of one or more cranial nerves, and it can vary in clinical presentation and course. Three cranial nerves, namely, oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, are vital in controlling eye movements. Their dysfunction can result in an imbalance in ocular control, resulting in binocular diplopia. As evidenced by various reports in the literature, the incidence of cranial nerve palsy varies among different regions. Recent reports have indicated that the incidence rates of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy among the Korean population are 3.71, 5.73, and 4.66 per 100,000 per year, respectively. These rates exhibit an age-dependent increase, accelerating notably after individuals reach 60 years of age. It is also noteworthy that these incidence rates are comparatively lower than those reported in the United States. The causes of these nerve palsies are diverse, encompassing ischemic events, trauma, aneurysms, and compressive lesions. Intriguingly, the distribution of etiological factors can vary, even within the same institution across different time frames. Moreover, the underlying etiology of these palsies is notably influenced by their clinical course, leading to a spectrum of outcomes that range from complete recovery to a lack of improvement.

Recent population-based studies have provided valuable insights into the etiologies of cranial nerve palsies. Oculomotor nerve palsy is predominantly attributed to microvascular causes, particularly in older adults. Pupillary involvement, although not specific to compressive lesions, is relatively rare. In the case of trochlear nerve palsy, evidence has revealed a bimodal distribution, with congenital factors prevalent in early childhood and vascular etiology more common in adults. In younger and adolescent patients, cranial nerve palsy typically has nonvascular origins. A retrospective series highlighted the prevalence of tumor-related causes in this demographic. However, the population-based literature often highlights a primarily congenital basis. High-resolution neuroimaging is pivotal in pathology demonstration and diagnostic support. Treatment modalities are tailored to the specific etiologies and are aimed at alleviating sequelae through interventions such as prism glasses, botulinum toxin, or strabismus surgery.

### Not just down and out: oculomotor nerve pathologic spectrum [^1116C2sX]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this article is to understand the complex pathologic spectrum of oculomotor nerve palsy. We review the detailed anatomy and function of the oculomotor nerve and demonstrate how the location of a lesion can drive the differential diagnosis. Lastly, we review atypical presentations of oculomotor nerve palsy to include oculomotor synkinesis and oculomotor nerve hyperactivity. Radiologists must be aware of the typical and atypical presentations of CN III palsy to accurately localize lesions as well as avoid premature exclusion of CN III pathology.

### Isolated third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies from presumed microvascular versus other causes: a prospective study [^112PDPd9]. Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

To estimate the proportion of patients presenting with isolated third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve palsy of presumed microvascular origin versus other causes.

Design

Prospective, multicenter, observational case series.

Participants

A total of 109 patients aged 50 years or older with acute isolated ocular motor nerve palsy.

Testing

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.

Main Outcome Measures

Causes of acute isolated ocular motor nerve palsy (presumed microvascular or other) as determined with early MRI and clinical assessment.

Results

Among 109 patients enrolled in the study, 22 had cranial nerve III palsy, 25 had cranial nerve IV palsy, and 62 had cranial nerve VI palsy. A cause other than presumed microvascular ischemia was identified in 18 patients (16.5%; 95% confidence interval, 10.7–24.6). The presence of 1 or more vasculopathic risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, and smoking) was significantly associated with a presumed microvascular cause (P = 0.003, Fisher exact test). Vasculopathic risk factors were also present in 61% of patients (11/18) with other causes. In the group of patients who had vasculopathic risk factors only, with no other significant medical condition, 10% of patients (8/80) were found to have other causes, including midbrain infarction, neoplasms, inflammation, pituitary apoplexy, and giant cell arteritis (GCA). By excluding patients with third cranial nerve palsies and those with GCA, the incidence of other causes for isolated fourth and sixth cranial nerve palsies was 4.7% (3/64).

Conclusions

In our series of patients with acute isolated ocular motor nerve palsies, a substantial proportion of patients had other causes, including neoplasm, GCA, and brain stem infarction. Brain MRI and laboratory workup have a role in the initial evaluation of older patients with isolated acute ocular motor nerve palsies regardless of whether vascular risk factors are present.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^112VsUuk]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy evaluation considerations — Bell's palsy is rapid in onset (< 72 hours) and is diagnosed when no other medical etiology is identified as a cause of the facial weakness. Bilateral Bell's palsy is rare, and currently no cause for Bell's palsy has been identified. Other conditions may cause facial paralysis, including stroke, brain tumors, tumors of the parotid gland or infratemporal fossa, cancer involving the facial nerve, and systemic and infectious diseases, including zoster, sarcoidosis, and Lyme disease. Bell's palsy is typically self-limited and may occur in men, women, and children but is more common in those 15 to 45 years old; those with diabetes, upper respiratory ailments, or compromised immune systems; or during pregnancy. The guideline development group (GDG) accepted the definition of "acute" or "rapid onset" to mean that the occurrence of paresis/paralysis typically progresses to its maximum severity within 72 hours of onset of the paresis/paralysis.

### Third cranial nerve palsy? Look for a sicca syndrome [^112VJGUG]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2007). Low credibility.

Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune disorder, and neurological involvement may frequently occur. Here we describe a 79-year-old woman who came to our attention for a sudden right incomplete 3rd cranial nerve palsy. Following extensive investigations, a diagnosis of primary SS was reached, and the patient recovered after treatment with ev Ig and steroids. Therefore, we suggest that SS should be considered in apparently idiopathic 3rd cranial nerve palsies, since, with the appropriate treatment, they might be transient and reversible.

### Enhancement of cranial nerves in Lyme neuroborreliosis: incidence and correlation with clinical symptoms and prognosis [^113E6RMq]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lyme borreliosis is estimated to affect more than 200,000 Europeans and 470,000 in the USA each year. It is a tick-borne spirochetal infection that affects the nervous system in 10–15% of cases. Most patients experience painful radiculoneuritis, and additional symptoms of cranial neuritis is a common clinical presentation in Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). Cranial nerve involvement is reported to occur in 43% of LNB patients, and in 50% among those hospitalized. Facial nerve palsy accounts for up to 95% of these, while ocular motor nerve palsies constitute most of the remainder. Data in a systematic review estimate that persistent cranial neuropathy after treatment affects 4–10% of LNB patients.

Imaging evaluation of cranial nerve enhancement together with laboratory tests are important in the work-up of patients with cranial nerve palsies. Findings of neoplasms, infections, demyelination, granulomatosis, or stroke have implications for treatment. When interpreting such images, one needs to be aware of physiological or spontaneous cranial nerve enhancement: The geniculate ganglion, mastoid, and tympanic segments of the facial nerve enhance in most individuals without facial nerve pathology.

Several case reports on cranial nerve enhancement due to LNB exist. However, there are few imaging studies, and they report low numbers of cranial nerve enhancement compared to clinical reports. In a retrospective study from 2009, three of the 63 LNB patients who were examined with contrast had meningeal or cranial nerve enhancement. Recent studies that only used clinical radiology reports of contrast enhanced brain examinations, found cranial nerve enhancement in one of 79 LNB patients and five of 29 LNB patients with facial palsy. Due to suboptimal designs of these studies with no description or validation of the enhancement ratings, and contradictory low prevalence of enhancement compared to clinical studies of cranial neuropathy, we hypothesized that enhancement of cranial nerves in LNB is underreported.

We aimed to describe the prevalence of enhancement of cranial nerves III–XII at the time of diagnosis of LNB, and to assess if enhancement is associated with clinical manifestation of neuropathy in the acute phase and 6 months after treatment.

### Cranial nerve involvement with juvenile polyarteritis nodosa: clinical manifestations and treatment [^112QEJcs]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Juvenile polyarteritis nodosa, a rare systemic vasculitis, may present with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Neurologic involvement has been reported in as high as 50% to 70% of patients; however, the incidence of cranial nerve palsies is extremely uncommon. We report here the case of a 20-month-old girl with juvenile polyarteritis nodosa who developed cranial nerve III palsy, demonstrated both clinically and radiographically on MRI despite aggressive management with immunosuppressants. Neurologic manifestations resolved with treatment including corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide; however, persistent fevers, rash, and headaches interfered with attempts at a corticosteroid taper. Subsequent therapy with a combination of mycophenolate mofetil and infliximab proved highly efficacious in inducing disease remission and eventual discontinuation of corticosteroids. Knowledge about the management of refractory juvenile polyarteritis nodosa is limited. Here we report a rare case of cranial nerve involvement, as demonstrated on MRI, and successful management with a regimen of mycophenolate mofetil and infliximab.

### Cranial nerve palsy in wegener's granulomatosis – lessons from clinical cases [^114mKVWL]. Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The problem of diagnosing vasculitic neuropathy is discussed based on case reports of two patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. One patient developed de novo 6(th) nerve palsy as an isolated relapse manifestation and the second patient a sequence of multiple cranial nerve palsies. Brain imaging with CT and MRI and the laboratory provided no clues suggesting active vasculitis. However, in both patients the neuropathies fully recovered in response to standard induction protocols of vasculitis. In the absence of organ-specific proof of vasculitis, these treatment decisions were guided by the overall clinical presentations. Cranial neuropathy may be the first obvious vasculitic manifestation preceding other organ disease, and since single reliable tests for its diagnosis are lacking, a multidisciplinary approach is advocated here to detect vasculitic manifestations in other organs.

### The role of intervention timing and treatment modality in visual recovery following pituitary apoplexy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1117gum8]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Type of surgical intervention

Compression of cranial nerves III and VI can result in ophthalmoplegia, an extraocular muscle palsy that has been reported in 70% of cases of pituitary apoplexy. Of the cranial nerve palsies observed in apoplexy, CN III palsy is in fact the most common and represents approximately half. When mass effect is exerted upon the optic chiasm, bitemporal hemianopsia will be a presenting sign/symptom – reported in approximately 75% of pituitary apoplexy patients with visual dysfunction. Prior literature suggests that patients with mild visual deficits are candidates for conservative treatment and that ophthalmoplegia will resolve without surgical intervention in these cases. Nonetheless, exceptions to this rule can arise and this is only reasonable management for patients with an overall clinical presentation that can be considered mild.

When permissible, conservative treatment is preferred because surgical decompression is associated with risks of any surgical procedure involving the pituitary gland: endocrinopathy, hemorrhage, CSF leak, and death. Performing surgery for pituitary apoplexy is indicated when significant cranial nerve and/or ophthalmologic defects are detected on exam or the patient presents in or deteriorates into a low state of consciousness/mental status (indicating significant mass effect or elevated ICP). Altogether, our analysis suggests that, among studies claiming to adhere to treatment protocols along these lines, outcomes are roughly equivocal following conservative management and surgery. Both can be effective when patient selection is performed carefully and dictated by the results of a thorough, meticulous neurological examination and subsequent documentation of any deviations from the baseline exam.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^116Ctfsg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Study Participants

We analyzed the data/hospital records of patients who underwent treatment for cranial palsy in an inpatient/outpatient clinic at Phramongkutklao Hospital between April 1, 2012 and April 30, 2022. We included subjects who visited the ophthalmology clinic at least four times in a year with all recorded data available, and we excluded subjects who visited the clinic fewer than four times in a year and who had incompletely recorded data.

We recruited 297 subjects with oculomotor nerve palsy, 152 cases of trochlear nerve palsy, and 338 cases of abducens nerve palsy. After excluding patients with incomplete data, the overall numbers of subjects included in the analysis were 65 cases of oculomotor nerve palsy, 57 cases of trochlear nerve palsy, and 176 cases of abducens nerve palsy, respectively.

This study was retrospective in nature and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Royal Thai Army (approval No. S027h/66_Exp).

Disease Definition

Oculomotor nerve palsy is defined as any presentation resulting from weakness of the oculomotor nerve, including exotropia, vertical misalignment, and ptosis with or without pupillary involvement. Trochlear nerve palsy is defined as any presentation that results from a weakness of the trochlear nerve, including vertical or torsional diplopia. Abducens nerve palsy is defined as any presentation resulting from weakness of the abducens nerve, including incomitant esotropia. The onset of symptoms refers to the duration between the onset of symptoms and the initial visit to the hospital. Oral corticosteroids are prescribed for treating inflammatory causes at our institution at a dose of 1 mg/kg per day for at least 2 weeks and a slower taper, depending on the case. There is no given treatment for ischemic etiology. Complete recovery is defined as the resolution of presenting signs and symptoms of the affected subjects. The entire ocular duction with orthotropia in the primary position is reserved for complete recovery of an ocular sign. An absence of clinical double vision was the favorable endpoint of symptoms. Partial recovery is defined as residual signs and symptoms at the endpoint.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^117JZQaa]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ocular motor nerve palsies (OMNP) frequently cause patients to present in an emergency room. In the following study, we report the differential diagnosis of OMNP by use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CSF examination as a standard.

Method

We performed a data analysis of N = 502 patients who presented with oculomotor, trochlear, and/or abducens nerve palsy in the emergency room of the Department of Neurology, University of Ulm, between January 2006 and December 2019. We report clinical and MRI scan findings in all patients; furthermore, the CSF of 398 patients has been analysed.

Results

Abducens nerve palsies were most common (45%), followed by palsies of the oculomotor (31%) (CNP III) and trochlear nerve (15%). Multiple OMNPs were seen in 9% of our cohort. The most common causes included inflammations (32.7%), space-occupying lesions, such as aneurysms or neoplasms (17.3%), diabetes mellitus (13.3%), and brainstem infarctions (11%). Still 23.4% of the patients could not be assigned to any specific cause after differential diagnostic procedures and were described as idiopathic. One of three patients with an inflammation and 39% of the patients with space-occupying lesions showed additional cranial nerve deficits.

Conclusion

Inflammation and space-occupying processes were the most frequent causes of OMNP, although brainstem infarctions also play a significant role, in particular in CNP III. The presence of additional CNPs increases the probability of an inflammatory or space-occupying cause.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^1122NsMc]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — imaging indications and modality: Routine imaging at the time of initial diagnosis is discouraged, but there is a distinct role for imaging when suggestive history or physical findings are present or if paralysis fails to recover or worsens; any presentation inconsistent with Bell's palsy should be further evaluated by imaging. Features atypical of Bell's palsy include a second paralysis on the same side, paralysis of isolated facial nerve branches, other cranial nerve involvement, or no sign of recovery after 3 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire facial nerve course, with and without contrast, is the imaging test of choice in these circumstances; imaging should include the internal auditory canal (IAC) and face, and if MRI is contraindicated, a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) can be used.

### Neuroimaging and acute ocular motor mononeuropathies: a prospective study… [^113U7rJw]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Therefore, we performed a prospective study to determine the utility of neuroimaging in detecting causative lesions in patients with acute isolated cranial nerve III, IV, and VI palsies referred to a single neuro-ophthalmology practice over 15 months. Seventy-seven patients were examined in follow-up and 16 confirmed resolution of their diplopia via telephone contact. There were 14 cases of CN III palsy, 27 cases of CN IV palsy, and 52 cases of CN VI palsy. The majority of patients were male. The most frequent microvascular risk factor overall was hypercholesterolemia, followed closely by hypertension. A prospective study by Chou et al6 evaluating ocular motor cranial mononeuropathies included only patients older than 50 years and found that 9 of 66 patients had a cause other than a microvascular one for their mononeuropathies.

However, this study included 9 patients with pupil-involving CN III palsies and 10 patients with partial CN III palsies. Likewise in this situation, the CN VI palsy does not remain isolated. 17 Additionally, 2 patients, 1 with an isolated CN III palsy and 1 with a CN VI palsy, were found to have brainstem infarctions. Although these manifestations of brainstem infarction have been described, they are also very uncommon. 10, 18 The 66 patients included in the study by Chou and colleagues were gathered over a 5-year period as opposed to the 93 patients gathered over 15 months in our study. Therefore, it is possible that our referral base reflects the general population of patients with isolated mononeuropathies as opposed to being a tertiary referral site for primarily complicated mononeuropathies. Our study supports the traditional guidelines for imaging patients with acute, new-onset mononeuropathies.

21 These guidelines include imaging all patients younger than 50 years, with a history of any type of cancer, 22 and with multiple cranial neuropathies or evidence of additional neurologic dysfunction. Additionally, patients with incomplete or pupil-involving CN III palsies should be imaged immediately. 23–25 Lastly, imaging should be undertaken in any isolated mononeuropathy that progresses or has not resolved 3 months after the initial visit.

### Isolated ptosis following a vipera aspis bite [^111mQYk4]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In Spain, snakebites are uncommon medical emergencies that cause barely 100 hospitalizations annually. Most of the venomous bites are by snakes of the Viperidae family. Venom from Vipera snakes is reported to have cytotoxic and hematotoxic effects, and neurological effects have also been described. Ptosis (cranial nerve III palsy) is the most common sign, although any cranial nerve can be affected. We describe isolated ptosis, which was very likely after a Vipera aspis bite in the East Catalonian Pyrenees. No antivenom was administered. The ptosis resolved spontaneously within 10 h. Although neurologic findings are usually mild, they indicate a moderate or severe envenomation. Treating snakebites can be challenging for clinicians, especially when there are uncommon clinical manifestations. A toxicologist at a poison center should be consulted to help guide management. Development of local protocols may provide clinical support.

Facial paralysis etiologies and clinical features — Table 7 details conditions with etiologic agents and distinguishing factors, including autoimmune, idiopathic, infectious, inherited, neoplastic, neurovascular, and traumatic causes. Autoimmune Guillain-Barré lists an etiologic agent of autoimmune/infectious with distinguishing factors of acute polyneuropathy, ascending paralysis, and weakness of hands and feet progressing to the trunk. Idiopathic acute facial nerve paresis/paralysis is noted as classic Bell's palsy with other etiologies excluded. Infectious examples include Ramsay Hunt syndrome from herpes zoster virus with a pronounced prodrome of pain and vesicular eruption in the ear canal or pharynx; Lyme disease due to the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi that may be bilateral with rash and arthralgias; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) associated with fever, malaise, and CD4 count; and otitis media from bacterial pathogens with gradual onset, ear pain, fever, and hearing loss. Inherited heritable disorders show autosomal dominant inheritance with family history as high as 4%, and may have other neurologic disorders. Neoplastic causes such as facial nerve tumor, skin cancer, and parotid tumors involve multiple carcinomas of the head and neck and may involve only select branches of the facial nerve or other cranial nerves, presenting as multiple cranial neuropathies. Neurovascular stroke involves ischemia or hemorrhage with forehead sparing most often and extremities often involved. Traumatic injury to the facial nerve is tied to trauma, including forceps delivery, with timing of injury coinciding with the trauma.

Differences in etiologies between older and younger patients

We also addressed the question whether the causes of OMNP vary in different age groups. In summary, vascular etiologies such as ischemic brainstem infarctions and diabetogenic OMNPs were significantly more common in patients over 50 years of age (diabetogenic p = 0.0005; brainstem infarction p = 0.0016). The incidences of space-occupying lesions and inflammations were higher in younger patients, but only the difference in inflammatory causes was significant (p = 0.0008). The age-related occurrence of idiopathic OMNPs decreased for CNP IV and CNP VI with age but increased in CNP III. Figure 3 summarizes the results.

### Tuberculous meningitis: pathogenesis, immune responses, diagnostic challenges, and the potential of biomarker-based approaches [^115cKt3q]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical manifestation.

TBM typically presents as a subacute disease with many days or weeks (an average of 5 to 30 days) of nonspecific symptoms, including low-grade fever, malaise, headache, dizziness, vomiting, personality changes, and symptoms related to pulmonary TB (such as cough). Patients with advanced disease may present with more severe headache, altered mental status, stroke, hydrocephalus, and cranial neuropathies.

In children, clinical signs may include initial apathy or irritability that progresses to meningism, signs of raised intracranial pressure (such as abducens nerve palsy), and focal neurological signs. In adults, clinical signs may include neck stiffness, cranial nerve palsies (cranial nerve III, IV, VI, and VIII), confusion, and coma. Clinical motor deficits (monoplegia, hemiplegia, or paraplegia) occur in about 10% to 20% of cases. Death is invariably inevitable if TBM is not treated.

Immune response.

The host inflammatory response plays an important role in TBM pathology. Within the CNS, microglia are resident macrophages and are arguably the most prominent immune effector cells responsible for recognition and internalization of. Microglial cells and migrated infected neutrophils and macrophages become rapidly activated and can proliferate and increase the expression of different molecules and secrete cytokines and chemokines, which in turn modulate immune responses within the CNS. Such cytokines and chemokines released by infected microglial cells include TNF-α, IFN-γ, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, CCL2, CCL5, and CXCL10. The cytokines and chemokines may disrupt the BBB, allowing the influx of other uninfected cells (monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes). Infected cells (microglial cells and migrated cells) together with migrating uninfected cells lead to the formation of Rich focus.

### Bell palsy: rapid evidence review [^113HC6M5]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bell's palsy:

- **Definition**: Bell's palsy, also known as idiopathic facial paralysis, is an acute-onset, isolated, unilateral, lower motor neurone facial weakness/paralysis.
- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, reactivation of herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve has been postulated.
- **Disease course**: The likely vascular distension, inflammation, and edema with ischemia of the facial nerve results in Bell's palsy, which presents with clinical manifestations of unilateral weakness/paralysis of upper and lower facial muscles, drooping of ipsilateral eyelids, dry eye due to inability to close eyes completely, epiphora, drooping of the corner of the mouth, ipsilateral impaired/loss of taste sensation, difficulty in eating, dribbling of saliva, altered sensation on the affected side of the face, pain in or behind the ear, hyperacusis on the affected side if stapedius muscle is involved. Spontaneous complete recovery occurs in 70–75% of untreated patients.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bell's palsy is not associated with an increased risk of mortality.

Vascular

Neurovascular compression

Neurovascular compression syndromes are caused by vascular structures (usually arteries) that directly contact the cisternal segment of a cranial nerve (Fig. 30). Typically, the transition zone between the central and the peripheral myelin is the most vulnerable region of the nerve. Clinical presentation is variable and includes trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia, vestibular paroxysm, and hemifacial spasm. However, neurovascular compression should be evaluated only in the presence of specific clinical features. Also, nonhemorrhagic aneurysms may be associated to nerve dysfunction, for example in the case of vision loss due to compression of II nerve or optic chiasm by proximal internal carotid artery, and III, IV, or VI cranial nerves' palsy secondary to intracavernous aneurysm. Imaging may be useful to detect the displacement and the compression of a nerve by redundant arteries. Steady-state sequences and corresponding Time-of-Flight (TOF) or 3D T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced images are very useful for diagnosis and preoperative evaluation.

### Peripheral third cranial nerve enhancement in multiple sclerosis [^112eMa7v]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Cranial nerve III dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) is uncommon. Seven cases of isolated cranial nerve III paresis associated with MS have been reported in the English-language literature. MR imaging was obtained in five cases demonstrating lesions within the midbrain. We present the detailed clinical and MR imaging findings of a young woman with MS and an isolated, painful pupil involving complete left cranial nerve III palsy. Initial MR imaging showed isolated enhancement of the cisternal portion of the cranial nerve III, suggesting that peripheral nervous system involvement may develop as part of the disease process in some patients with MS.

### Clinical features and natural history of acquired third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy [^116y6fYZ]. Eye (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Clinical features of acquired third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy showed variation among previous studies. Evaluation of natural course with objective criteria will establish accurate recovery rates and important factors for recovery.

Methods

Retrospective chart review was performed on 206 patients who visited a neuro-ophthalmic department with acquired third, fourth, and sixth nerve palsy. Aetiology and results of ocular exam on each visit were reviewed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent factors affecting recovery.

Results

The sixth cranial nerve was affected most frequently (n = 108, 52.4%) and vascular disease (n = 64, 31.1%) was the most common aetiology. Recovery was evaluated with change of deviation angle for 108 patients, who were first examined within a month of onset and followed up for at least 6 months. Ninety-two (85.2%) patients showed overall (at least partial) recovery and 73 (67.6%) showed complete recovery. In univariate analysis, initial deviation angle was found to be only significant factor associated with complete recovery (P = 0.007) and most patients who experienced successful management of treatable underlying disease showed recovery.

Conclusions

With objective criteria based on deviation angle, overall recovery rate from the third, fourth, and sixth nerve palsy was 85.2%. Patients who had smaller initial eyeball deviation or successful management of treatable underlying disease had a high chance of recovery.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^1146ABKg]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Although various studies have explored the causes and clinical aspects of cranial nerve palsies, there remains a significant gap in understanding the prognostic factors that influence outcomes. In this study, we sought to address this gap by investigating the incidence, etiologies, clinical courses, and factors associated with long-term recovery, with the aim of enhancing the knowledge base in this field and providing valuable insights for improved patient care.

Patients and Methods

This retrospective study evaluated the data gathered from subjects who had third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy at the ophthalmology outpatient clinic of Phramongkutklao Hospital between April 1, 2012, and April 30, 2022.

Results

Among the three nerves, abducens nerve palsy was the most prevalent finding by most commonly involved. Our study revealed that ischemic and compressive lesions were the most common etiology of oculomotor nerve palsy, comprising 24.6% each. In addition, the most common etiology of trochlear and abducens nerve palsy was trauma, at 31.6% and 27.1%, respectively. Compared with the other nerves, oculomotor nerve palsy was associated with a shorter duration onset of symptoms and recovery period. The best recovery outcomes among the various etiologies were inflammation, ischemic events, and trauma in oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsy, respectively. Logistic regression revealed that an onset of < 7 days and isolated nerve involvement were significantly associated with good long-term outcomes, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.89) and 2.56 (95% confidence interval, 1.21–5.39) adjusted for the type of cranial nerve palsy, aged at 50 years, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, onset at 7 days, and number of cranial nerves involved, respectively.

Conclusion

The onset of symptoms in less than 1 week and isolated nerve involvement were associated with better prognosis in subjects with third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy executive summary [^114oshwv]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue featuring the new Clinical Practice Guideline: Bell's Palsy. To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 11 recommendations developed encourage accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitate patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy; some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, there are numerous diagnostic tests available that are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have an unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

### Causes of isolated recurrent ipsilateral sixth nerve palsies in older adults: a case series and review of the literature [^111ge5hW]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Ophthalmoplegic migraine, which is now termed recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (IHS 13.9) according to The International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third Edition (ICHD III) criteria, is another cause of chronic recurrent sixth nerve palsies in our study cohort of patients ≥ 50 years of age. (The terminology of this disorder was recently revised because this pain syndrome is not considered migrainous, but rather a recurrent painful ocular cranial neuropathy with ipsilateral headache). Unlike childhood recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathies that usually present as a third nerve palsy in males, adult-onset cases often affect the sixth nerve, as was shown in the largest case series in adult recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathies, based on a consecutive series of 62 patients with severe migraine recruited between the years 1996–2005. These episodes usually happen just once and are rarely recurrent in adults. The pathophysiology of recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathies remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that vasospasm of the arterial supply to the sixth cranial nerve may cause ischemia followed by recovery of nerve function. It has also been thought that cranial neuropathies could represent repeated episodes of demyelination, seen as gadolinium enhancement of the nerve on MRI, with subsequent axonal damage. In our study cohort, one out of seven patients (14.29%) had a recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy, presenting as a relapsing-remitting ipsilateral sixth nerve palsy over an 8-month period. Unlike childhood recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathies involving the third cranial nerve, in which the nerve often enhances on MRI with gadolinium and/or develops focal enlargement, the sixth cranial nerve in our patient with opthhalmoplegic migraine did not show any pathological changes. Although treatment with corticosteroids has been beneficial in some patients, our 57-year-old female patient elected not to take prednisone because of the risk of adverse effects.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^113byjfu]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Monitoring Illness Progression in Patients with Botulism

Botulism causes progressive flaccid, descending paralysis that might result in respiratory compromise from upper airway collapse or respiratory muscle impairment. Patients with botulism should be monitored closely for neurologic, respiratory, and autonomic manifestations. Because of the potential for rapid clinical deterioration, frequent examination and other monitoring measures should be performed to allow prompt life-saving interventions.

Neurologic Monitoring

Botulism signs and symptoms occur in a typical order. Some patients initially have nausea and vomiting, then nearly all patients develop cranial nerve palsies (which might include respiratory compromise from upper airway compromise); some develop respiratory failure and paralysis of the extremities. A systematic review of 375 patients in the literature documented a range in the number of cranial nerve palsies recorded at hospital admission: 126 (34%) patients had one or two cranial nerve palsies, 119 (32%) patients had three or four, and 130 (35%) patients had five or more; 27 (7%) had no cranial nerve palsies noted. Paralysis can progress rapidly.

### Retrospective analysis of factors related to the long-term recovery of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy with etiologies and clinical course in a tertiary hospital [^116xkzCL]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Cranial nerves 3, 4, and 6 supply extraocular muscle movement. Their pathology affects both the motor and autonomic nervous systems. In an analysis of existing research on the long-term outcomes of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy, we found a diverse landscape of research findings.

Our data corroborates those of previous studies, indicating that abducens nerve palsy is the most frequently encountered among the three nerves, whereas trochlear nerve palsy exhibits a lower prevalence. However, recently reported incidence rates in the Korean population present a different perspective, with trochlear nerve palsy being the most common and oculomotor nerve palsy the least common. These regional disparities underscore the significance of geographic factors in the distribution of cranial nerve palsies and emphasize the need for clinical evaluations and research to consider such variations.

We conducted a literature review on the etiologies of oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerve palsy, categorized according to the most extensive literature reviews of 4278 subjects from the previous study(Table 4). The etiologies varied across the studies for many reasons. First, the evolution in investigation lessens the undetermined etiology. Second, studies in different regions may reflect other disease distributions. Finally, even at the same institution, different data collection times led to various etiologies, implying an actual change.

Table 4
Compared Etiologies of Isolated Third, Fourth, and Sixth Cranial Nerve Palsy (%)

Our data showed that the overall recovery rate was 38.5%, which is comparable with previous reports (range, 38–80%). The recovery rate varied across studies due to data collection methods. Moreover, the rate depended on the criteria used for recovery measurement. Some studies used follow-up letters or telephone calls to collect data, which might not accurately reflect total recovery. In our research, ophthalmologists evaluated all patients, asked for symptoms, and measured ocular deviation at every visit, which might have resulted in excellent reliability regarding accurate recovery.

### Third cranial nerve palsy due to COVID-19 infection [^1131L3Fp]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

We report a case of a previously healthy man in his 40s who presented with mild SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) concomitant with acute onset of left third cranial nerve palsy with restricted supraduction, adduction and infraduction. Our patient did not present any history of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus or smoking. The patient recovered spontaneously without any antiviral treatment. To our knowledge, this is the second report of third cranial nerve palsy spontaneously resolved without any risk factors of vascular disease, specific image findings, nor any possible causes other than COVID-19. In addition, we reviewed 10 other cases of third cranial nerve palsy associated with COVID-19, which suggested that the aetiology varies greatly. As a clinician, it is important to recognise COVID-19 as a differential diagnosis for third cranial nerve palsy. Finally, we aimed to encapsulate the aetiologies and the prognosis of the third cranial nerve palsy associated with COVID-19.

Oculomotor palsy — disease definition and clinical features — is also known as a 3rd nerve palsy and is the second most common cranial neuropathy; patients usually present with diplopia from misalignment that has both a horizontal and vertical component and sometimes with difficulty reading secondary to accommodative deficiency, and the presentation is an incomitant deviation with ptosis and extraocular muscle paresis that typically leaves the eye abducted, infraducted, and incyclotorted due to preserved lateral rectus and superior oblique function; the pupil may or may not be involved, which should be noted to help direct evaluation, and aberrant re-innervation is more common with prior trauma or a compressive lesion but can also occur with other etiologies.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist, Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness/paralysis. Bell's palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell's palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell's palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell's palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell's palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell's palsy.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell's palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell's palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell's palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell's palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell's palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell's palsy. ACTION STATEMENTS: The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell's palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell's palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell's palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell's palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options: (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell's palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell's palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations: (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell's palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell's palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell's palsy.

### Clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of botulism, 2021 [^114wTmSn]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Clinicians

Be aware of the spectrum of signs and symptoms of botulism, ranging from limited cranial nerve palsies (e.g. ptosis) to respiratory failure and complete extremity paralysis.
Be aware that the respiratory system might be compromised early in the illness, when respiratory muscles (e.g. diaphragm) are unaffected but the upper airway is compromised from paresis of cranial nerve muscles, resulting in pharyngeal collapse or pooling of secretions.

Recommendations

Consider botulism when myasthenia gravis or Guillain-Barré syndrome are suspected and in a patient with unexplained symmetric cranial nerve palsies, with or without paresis of other muscles.
Conduct thorough, serial neurologic examinations to detect the neurologic deficits of botulism and their progression.
If botulism is suspected, immediately contact the local or state health department's emergency on-call staff to arrange an emergency expert clinical consultation and, when indicated, request botulinum antitoxin from CDC.

### Metastatic pancreatic carcinoma to the orbital apex presenting as a superior divisional third cranial nerve palsy [^1142io6S]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Metastatic tumors to the orbit are rare, especially from a primary pancreatic carcinoma. A 59-year-old man presented with 4 weeks of right eye pain and eyelid swelling. There was right upper eyelid ptosis associated with a right supraduction deficit consistent with a superior divisional third cranial nerve (CN III) palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a right orbital apex lesion. A right orbital exenteration was performed for intractable and severe pain. Surgical pathology demonstrated a poorly differentiated carcinoma that was ultimately felt to be derived from the pancreas. In this report, we describe the clinical and neurological imaging findings of a superior divisional CN III palsy as the presenting manifestation of a presumed metastatic pancreatic carcinoma to the orbital apex, and review the neuroanatomy of CN III with particular emphasis on the anatomical bifurcation of the nerve into a superior and inferior division.

### Nasopharyngeal B-cell lymphoma with pan-hypopituitarism and oculomotor nerve palsy: a case report and review of the literature [^112SGWjs]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and Conclusions

We have described a woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nasopharyngeal B-cell lymphoma infiltration of both cavernous sinuses and pituitary gland, who presented with the left eye ptosis (3rd, 4th, and 6th nerve palsy), severe headache, and pan-hypopituitarism.

Clinical presentations in our patient (i.e. hypopituitarism, headaches, and visual disturbances) could suggest the infiltration of the pituitary gland by lymphoma, leukemia, and metastasis to the pituitary. In our patient, the left eye oculomotor nerve palsy suggested two main differential diagnoses as diabetic cranial neuropathy or cavernous sinuses involvement.

A comprehensive review on the management of III nerve palsy suggested that when a patient presents with an acute onset of unilateral limitation of an eye, the defect should be categorized to "complete or partial" and "with or without the involvement of the pupil" to come to a diagnosis. Pupil-sparing in old patients with known systemic vascular disease can suggest ischemic mononeuropathy as a common cause

The adjacent cavernous sinus infiltration involving nerve III, IV, and VI, usually induces cranial nerve palsy in decreasing order of frequency. 6th nerve palsy is relatively uncommon because it is well sheltered in the cavernous sinus. In diabetic neuropathy, multiple cranial nerve palsies are extremely rare, and pupillary reflex usually spared because the ischemic lesion is confined to the core of the nerve and does not affect peripherally situated pupillomotor fibers. Although diabetic neuropathy is the most common cause of third nerve palsy, it is advisable to perform a brain MRI to exclude other causes of oculomotor nerve palsy.

On the other hand, poor glycemic control or rapid treatment of hyperglycemia could increase the risk of diabetic neuropathy. It may have an acute onset resulting from ischemic infarction of the vasa nervorum. Diabetic neuropathy was less suggested in our patient due to well-controlled diabetes, the chronic and insidious presentation of the symptoms, and multi-neuropathy involvement.

### Multiple cranial nerve palsies… [^111PinLD]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Cranial nerves VI, VII, V, and III were most commonly affected. The locations and causes were diverse, with cavernous sinus, brainstem, and individual nerves being the most frequent sites, and tumor, vascular disease, trauma, infection, and the Guillain-Barré and Fisher syndromes being the most frequent causes. Patients who were selected had simultaneous or serial involvement of 2 or more different cranial nerves. Previously described patients1-8 were included. Patients with botulism, but not those with myasthenia, were included. Neither postpapilledema optic atrophy nor chiasmal damage was tallied as second-nerve involvement. The first and ninth cranial nerves were not examined systematically and were not tabulated.

Diagnoses were based on extensive inpatient evaluation using contemporary contrast studies and computed scans, spinal fluid examination, electrophysiological studies, and biopsies, as clinically indicated. Probable diagnoses were favored over no diagnosis. Reflecting frequent involvement in cavernous sinus lesions and meningeal processes, the sixth cranial nerve was most commonly involved by a wide margin. The seventh cranial nerve was implicated in the Guillain-Barré and Fisher syndromes as well as in benign causes and skull base lesions. Cranial nerves III and V were most commonly damaged within the cavernous sinus. Recurrent cranial neuropathy frequently involved cranial nerves VII, III, and VI. By comparison, 222 patients had nystagmus, 91 had Horner syndrome, 57 had skew deviation, and 20 had internuclear ophthalmoplegia.

In the present study, only 22% of MCN cases originated in the brainstem. Central signs were absent in just 1 case that had a lateral pontomedullary infarct similar to another in the literature. 21 Nearly all of the brainstem cases of MCN will have telltale clues such as long track signs, gaze palsies, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and complex spontaneous eye movement abnormalities.

### Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy: a case report with atypical features and a review of the literature [^113Eeh1i]. Cephalalgia (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent Painful Ophthalmoplegic Neuropathy, previously known as Ophthalmoplegic Migraine, is a poorly characterized disorder mainly because there are few cases described. We report a new case of Recurrent Painful Ophthalmoplegic Neuropathy and a review of the literature to contribute to increasing the knowledge of the clinical features of this disorder.

Case Report and Review Of Literature

A 45-year-old woman presented with adult-onset recurrent attacks of abducens and oculomotor palsy associated with diplopia followed by headache. Most notably, pain always presented many days after oculomotor impairment, a feature never described in the literature. A diagnosis of possible Recurrent Painful Ophthalmoplegic Neuropathy was made after excluding other possible mimicking disorders. Symptoms usually resolved gradually with corticosteroid therapy, albeit without a clear-cut benefit. Clinical data collected from 1989 to 2022 showed that adult onset in Recurrent Painful Ophthalmoplegic Neuropathy is not uncommon. While III cranial nerve palsy is typical, VI and IV nerve palsy have also been described.

Pathophysiology and Diagnosis

Several hypotheses have been proposed, including nerve compression, ischemia or inflammation/demyelination, but none has been completely accepted. Diagnosis remains of exclusion; magnetic resonance imaging and blood exams are key in differential diagnosis.

Conclusions

Our case gives us the possibility to expand the clinical features of Recurrent Painful Ophthalmoplegic Neuropathy, also contributing to updating the pathophysiological hypotheses.

Neurosarcoidosis is a rare identity and occurs in only 5% to 15% of patients with sarcoidosis. It can manifest in many different ways, and therefore, diagnosis may be complicated. We report a case presented in a very unusual manner with involvement of 3 cranial nerves; anosmia (NI), facial palsy (NVII), and hearing loss (NVIII). When cranial nerve dysfunction occurs, it is very important to take neurosarcoidosis into consideration.

Results

Demography and epidemiology

The total cohort of 502 patients was included in the description of epidemiologic and demographic data. 90.8% (n = 456) showed isolated acquired OMNP and 9.2% had multiple OMNPs (n = 46). The cohort comprised 273 men (54.4%) and 229 women (45.6%) with a mean age of 61.2 years (SD 17.5) and an age range of 16–92 years. The most common isolated OMNP was CNP VI (44.6%), followed by oculomotor nerve palsy with 31.3% (CNP III) and trochlear nerve palsies (CNP IV) with 14.9% (refer to Table 1). We saw a seasonal peak in August and September (Fig. 2). The medical history of 84 of 502 patients (16.7%) revealed previous OMNP earlier in life. Comorbidities were not uncommon in patients with OMNP, as shown in Table 1, specifically, 23.9% had diabetes, 57.4% had arterial hypertension, and 20.9% had severe obesity (BMI ≥ 30).

Etiology

The most common causes were space-occupying lesions (17.3%), autoimmune/inflammatory processes (25.7%), viral/bacterial infections (6.3%), brainstem infarctions (11%), and diabetic (13.3%) or idiopathic (23.4%) palsies. The frequency of brainstem infarctions was somewhat higher in CNP III (19.7%) than in the other OMNPs. The frequency of diabetogenic and idiopathic palsies was higher in CNP IV compared to the CNP III and CNP VI, but only the difference between the idiopathic CNP IV and CNP III was statistically significant (p = 0.0001). The main cause of multiple OMNPs was inflammation (67.4%). Table 2 shows the distribution of etiologies across the different CNPs.

Etiologies Correlation with Recovery Rate

Among the various etiologies of nerve palsy, our study showed that inflammation had the best recovery rate in oculomotor nerve palsy as shown in Table 2, patients experiencing ischemic events had the best recovery in trochlear nerve palsy and trauma in abducens nerve palsy. Among the groups, the two proportions revealed traumatic causes in trochlear nerve palsy, which had a statistically significant difference compared with abducens nerve (p = 0.00). Comparatively, there was a considerable difference in idiopathic etiology between trochlear nerve palsy and oculomotor and abducens nerve, with p values of 0.001 and 0.026, respectively.

Table 2
Recovery Rates by Etiology

As shown in Table 3, we combined the three nerve palsy groups for logistic regression analysis. Our study revealed that an early onset of < 7 days and isolated cranial nerve palsy were significantly associated with complete recovery at an adjusted odds ratio of 1.73 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–2.89) and 2.56 (95% confidence interval, 1.21–5.39), respectively.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^114aqsiQ]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Thirty patients with CNP III (20.4%) were diagnosed with space-occupying lesions. These lesions represented the second most common cause of CNP III in our cohort. The ratio between incomplete and complete palsies was 15:15. 46.7% of all space-occupying lesions were found in close neighborhood to the cavernous sinus. One tumor was found inside the orbita, the remaining lesions were found intracerebrally, close to the meninges or intrathecally. The most common space-occupying lesions were pituitary macroadenomas (n = 7), followed by aneurysms (n = 6) and meningeosis carcinomatosa (n = 4); other causes were meningioma (n = 3), cavernous-sinus-thrombosis (n = 2), thalamic and pontine bleedings (n = 2), metastases (n = 1), brainstem tumour (n = 1), intracranial hypertension (n = 1), and a sphenoidal mucous cyst (n = 1). In this category 93.3% also had a ptosis and 55.6% mydriasis. Furthermore, one palsy was also caused by a cavernous-sinus-fistula (n = 1). These patients with a space-occupying lesion often did not present with a palsy alone. For example, we found out that 84.6% of all patients with pituitary macroadenoma (N = 13 in all OMNP together) had additional symptoms such as visual field loss or headache.

Inflammations were the most common etiologies of CNP III (27.2%): 33 palsies occurred due to autoimmune/inflammatory processes and seven palsies due to viral or bacterial infections. Autoimmune/inflammatory disorders comprised Tolosa–Hunt syndrome (n = 13), ocular myasthenia gravis (n = 5; presence of acetylcholine-receptor antibodies), multiple sclerosis (n = 4), Miller-Fisher syndrome (n = 3), giant-cell arteritis (n = 3) and less common diseases such as Morbus Wegener (granulomatosis with polyangiitis; high titer of cANCA) and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common defined pathogen was the varicella-zoster-virus (n = 4). The remaining patients had pneumococcal meningitis (with typical symptoms plus OMNP) and sinusitis with secondary orbital involvement. In this category, incomplete CNPs III dominated with 70% of these patients (ptosis occurred in 85% and mydriasis in 29.4%).

### Age-related risk of stroke following ocular motor cranial nerve palsy [^115cvb9S]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Cranial nerve palsies of the third, fourth, and sixth nerves can result in limited eye movement and diplopia, prompting patients to seek urgent medical care. One of the most common causes of ocular motor cranial nerve palsy (CNP) is microvascular ischemia, which is commonly observed in older patients with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. As these patients often share similar atherosclerotic risk factors, numerous studies have explored the relationship between ocular motor cranial nerve palsy and stroke. Previous research using the Sample Cohort database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) comprising 1 million individuals has demonstrated an increased risk of stroke following ocular motor CNP.

Given the rarity of ocular motor CNP, this study aimed to investigate its association with stroke risk in a larger population to ensure an adequate sample size for robust analysis. We sought to establish a cohort of patients diagnosed with ocular motor CNP and a 1:5 matched control group by sex and age using health insurance and examination data from NHIS covering the Korean general population of 50 million. Furthermore, this study aimed to explore whether stroke risk associated with ocular motor cranial nerve palsy might differ by age.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^112fyzy8]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

CNP IV had the highest rate of idiopathic (39.4%) and diabetogenic (21.1%) etiologies compared to the other nerves, but only the incidence of idiopathic CNP IV was significantly different from CNP III (p = 0.0001). Surprisingly, the percentage of idiopathic CNP IV in our study was higher than in older studies. Inflammatory causes were found in 25.4% and brainstem infarctions in 9.9% of CNP IV in our study. Therefore, we found more inflammations and brainstem infarctions in CNP IV than Choi et al.

In CNP VI, inflammations were also the most common etiological category (30%) and were much more frequent if compared to the literature. Here, 27.1% of CNP VI had to be considered as idiopathic, another 18.6% were caused by space-occupying lesions and 7.1% by brainstem infarctions. Our results concerning idiopathic CNP VI were broadly consistent with older studies, whereas we found more brainstem infarctions similar to the other nerves studied.

It is interesting to note that in multiple OMNP, two thirds of the palsies were caused by inflammation (67.4%) and another 23.9% by space-occupying lesions. Only 6.5% of the palsies were classified as idiopathic and none as diabetogenic. A similarly high percentage of idiopathic and inflammatory multiple OMNPs were also found by Choi et al.

2.1% of the total cohort (n = 10) had an aneurysm which led to a palsy due to nerve compression. We observed that four of these ten patients had mydriasis and they had an aneurysm close to the cavernous sinus. Not unexpectedly, the CN III was affected in eight out of ten cases (in two cases combined with another OMNP). The CN III is much more susceptible to aneurysms than the other OMNPs. For this reason, imaging of the skull is essential in the acute situation to exclude aneurysms. For aneurysm detection, the use of MRI and analysis of cerebrospinal fluid was sufficient in our study. In case of doubt, we rarely used also a CT-scan.

### Acquired onset of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies in children and adolescents [^1155CxdB]. Eye (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To describe the causes of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies in children and adolescents.

Methods

In this retrospective case series, a total of 66 patients aged 0–19 years with third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies seen in strabismus and neuro-ophthalmic practice from 2010 to 2017 were included. Causes of palsies were determined based on clinical assessment, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and laboratory work-up.

Results

Thirty-five patients had sixth cranial nerve palsy, 14 patients had third cranial nerve palsy (7 partial, 7 complete), 13 patients had fourth cranial nerve palsy, and 4 patients had combined cranial nerve palsies in this study. Neoplasia involving central nervous system was one of the most common causes of third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies both in children (age: 0–14 years) and adolescents (age: 15–19 years) (20% and 31%, respectively). Overall, neoplasia (23%) was the most common cause of acute third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies, followed by idiopathic cause (14%), inflammation (11%), and non-aneurysmal vascular contact (11%). Neoplasia was also the most common cause of sixth and third cranial nerve palsies (25% and 29%, respectively). The most common cause of fourth cranial nerve palsy was late decompensation in congenital fourth cranial nerve palsy (46%).

Conclusions

A substantial proportion of pediatric and juvenile patients had serious pathologies for third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies. If nerve palsies are indicated, prompt diagnosis of etiologies using high-resolution MRI with contrast and laboratory work-up are important for this disease population.

### Enhancement of cranial nerves in Lyme neuroborreliosis: incidence and correlation with clinical symptoms and prognosis [^116uDowQ]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In patients with pathological cranial nerve enhancement, Lyme neuroborreliosis should be considered a differential diagnosis regardless of whether clinical manifestations of neuropathy are present or not. For the facial nerve, emphasis should be on evaluation of the distal IAC and parotid nerve segments due to correlation with grade of palsy. Parotid segment enhancement seems to increase the risk of persistent palsy after 6 months.

### Acquired bilateral facial palsy: a systematic review on aetiologies and management [^113Kbr91]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To systematically review the published cases of bilateral facial palsy (BFP) to gather evidence on the clinical assessment and management of this pathology.

Methods

Following PRISMA statement recommendations, 338 abstracts were screened independently by two authors. Inclusion criteria were research articles of human patients affected by BFP, either central or peripheral; English, Italian, French or Spanish language; availability of the abstract, while exclusion criteria were topics unrelated to FP, and mention of unilateral or congenital FP. Only full-text articles reporting the diagnostic work-up, the management, and the prognosis of the BFP considered for further specific data analysis.

Results

A total of 143 articles were included, resulting a total of 326 patients with a mean age of 36 years. The most common type of the paralysis was peripheral (91.7%), and the autoimmune disease was the most frequent aetiology (31.3%). The mean time of onset after first symptoms was 12 days and most patients presented with a grade higher than III. Associated symptoms in idiopathic BFP were mostly non-specific. The most frequently positive laboratory exams were cerebrospinal fluid analysis, autoimmune screening and peripheral blood smear, and the most performed imaging was MRI. Most patients (74%) underwent exclusive medical treatment, while a minority were selected for a surgical or combined approach. Finally, in more than half of cases a complete bilateral recovery (60.3%) was achieved.

Conclusions

BFP is a disabling condition. If a correct diagnosis is formulated, possibilities to recover are elevated and directly correlated to the administration of an adequate treatment.

### Adult strabismus preferred practice pattern ® [^114ZHzfL]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Abducens palsy (6th nerve palsy) in adults — presentation, causes, and natural history: It typically presents with an acute onset of horizontal double vision, worse at distance than at near and worse laterally toward the side of the affected nerve. The majority of acute 6th nerve palsies in the adult population are vasculopathic, associated with risk factors such as diabetes and hypertension, and most palsies resolve after 6 months, with about one-third resolving within 8 weeks; if no recovery is apparent by 6 months, approximately 40% of patients demonstrate a serious underlying pathology warranting further evaluation. Other common causes are trauma and neoplasm; traumatic etiology may include a basilar skull fracture or an acute rise in intracranial pressure from an intracranial bleed, and a 6th nerve palsy caused by an intracranial neoplasm may be either insidious or acute. Postviral 6th nerve palsy is typically a diagnosis of exclusion and has been described with COVID-19 infection and post COVID-19 vaccination.

Patient Demographics

Our study included 65 patients with oculomotor nerve palsy, 58 subjects with trochlear nerve palsy, and 177 with abducens nerve palsy. Table 1 presents the demographic data.

Table 1
Demographic Data of Cranial Nerve Palsy

Oculomotor Nerve Palsy

Subjects with oculomotor nerve palsy had a mean age of 50.34 years. The onset of palsy was approximately 14 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated nerve palsy. The most common etiologies were ischemic and compressive. The complete recovery rate of oculomotor nerve palsy was 35.4% and for those receiving strabismus surgery was 10.8%. In cases with full recovery, the average duration was 4.74 months.

Trochlear Nerve Palsy

The average age of patients with trochlear nerve palsy was 54.75 years, with a median onset of 90 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated involvement. The rate of acquired trochlear nerve palsy was 73.7%. Trauma was the most common etiology in this set of patients. Idiopathic etiology was ranked second. In this group, 26.3% had complete recovery and 21.1% received strabismus surgery due to inferior oblique muscle weakening. Among these groups, the average duration of recovery was 5.39 months.

Abducens Nerve Palsy

Abducens nerve palsy was the most common palsy among the three groups. The average age of the subjects was 48.71 years, with a mean onset of 84.25 days. Most subjects had unilateral and isolated involvement. Traumatic causes were the most common etiology in this population. The second and third most common etiologies were inflammation and ischemic, respectively. In our population, 44.1% had complete recovery and 14.3% received strabismus surgery. The average recovery time was 4.76 months.

### Enhancement of cranial nerves in Lyme neuroborreliosis: incidence and correlation with clinical symptoms and prognosis [^111BvFd4]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Facial nerve

The enhancement pattern in the facial nerve resembles that of idiopathic facial palsy with main involvement of distal IAC and labyrinthine segments, and this suggests a common neurotoxic or inflammatory pathway for neuritis. An animal study showed that inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of LNB. Also, a recent study of 372 patients with acute peripheral facial palsy reported no difference in outcome of palsy due to LNB compared to subjects without LNB.

In our cohort of LNB patients, facial nerve enhancement has a strong correlation with clinical palsy. There are conflicting reports on the value of MRI as a prognostic marker in idiopathic facial neuritis — one study reported no association between intensity of enhancement and degree of palsy or outcome, while others found correlation between enhancement in IAC and presence of palsy or poor outcome. We have not found previous studies of facial palsy that included the parotid segment in analyses. Our study of LNB patients shows that enhancement of the parotid segment is more specific, but less sensitive, than enhancement of distal IAC segment in predicting palsy at baseline and after 6 months. We found that 6 of 21 nerves with parotid segment enhancement had corresponding persistent palsy after 6 months compared to 6 of 48 with distal IAC segment enhancement. An important potential implication that is unstudied in idiopathic facial palsy is that parotid segment enhancement seems to increase the risk of poor outcome.

Still, a mild or moderate degree of enhancement in the distal IAC segment was not accompanied by palsy in 19 out of 37 nerves with this enhancement rate — more than can be attributed to possible spontaneous or physiological enhancement. This implies that subclinical facial neuritis in LNB is not uncommon, and is comparable to the finding in a study of idiopathic palsy where 30.8% had enhancement of the non-paralyzed nerve.

Results for other cranial nerves

Oculomotor and abducens nerve enhancement mostly occurs with no evident eye movement palsy (16/17). A study from 2017 reported 7% with eye movement palsy in LNB compared to 1.4% in our sample. The study with higher prevalence only included hospitalized patients, and therefore, probably a selected cohort of more severely affected patients who are not representative for all LNB patients. We found a low rate of enhancement of cranial nerves V (7/138, 5%), and VIII–XII (4/138, 3%), and little or no association with clinical manifestations.

### The spectrum and differential diagnosis of acquired ocular motor nerve palsies: a clinical study of 502 patients [^112Lfagv]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

When ocular motor nerve palsies (OMNP) cause patients to present in a neurological clinic, a broad differential diagnostic procedure is necessary to distinguish between the various heterogeneous etiologies. They include a wide range of causes such as inflammations, space-occupying lesions such as neoplasms and aneurysms, ischemia or trauma. According to the literature, the abducens nerve (CNP VI) is the second most affected cranial nerve (CNP) after the facial nerve with an annual incidence of about 11.3/100000. In most previous studies the mere presence of risk factors — such as diabetes, hypertension, old age or obesity — was considered to be sufficient to assign the palsies to a cause, in particular of vascular origin. Large retrospective studies with 4278 patients date back to the 1990s and could not take advantage of currently broadly available diagnostic tools. Diagnostic procedures such as MRI-based neuroimaging and, if possible, CSF analysis offer a more straightforward opportunity to define the etiology of OMNP. In the literature, there is large variation in the reported etiologies of OMNP, e.g. the frequency of neoplasms causing oculomotor nerve palsies varies between 1 and 13% in previous reports. In addition, according to the available literature, between 16 and 31% of all OMNP could not be assigned to a specific etiology and were, therefore, defined as idiopathic. In this study of 502 OMNP patients, we analyzed data in the setting of a Neurological University Clinic where state of the art MRI techniques and, if necessary, detailed CSF studies were prospectively used for differential diagnosis.

The causes of ophthalmoplegia in 24 consecutive patients with neurologically isolated, relative pupil-sparing third nerve palsy included infarction in 10 patients, compression by tumors or aneurysms in 10 patients, and miscellaneous disorders in four patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients with pain, degree of external ophthalmoplegia, or degree of internal ophthalmoplegia between the groups with infarction or mass lesions. Therefore, screening for mass lesions using neuroimaging is indicated in patients with this presentation of third nerve palsy.

### Assessment of the prevalence and risk factors of ophthalmoplegia among diabetic patients in a large national diabetes registry cohort [^114sK3rt]. BMC Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ophthalmoplegia is a rare entity seen in patients with diabetes mellitus and is associated with great patients' anxiety and may appear as a serious diagnostic and therapeutic medical challenge. Ophthalmoplegia secondary to cranial nerve III, IV, and VI palsies in diabetic patients is considered to be a form of microvascular cranial nerve palsy involving small vessels atherosclerotic changes, however, full recovery within 12 weeks after the onset of symptoms is the usual outcome.

Despite extensive studies on the epidemiology of diabetic neuropathy in general, there is a relative paucity of knowledge regarding factors associated with ophthalmoplegia in patients with diabetes. Most of the published studies available in the literature have been generated from tertiary referral centres rather than general diabetic population.

In a retrospective large Caucasian diabetic population follow up, mainly type 2 diabetes, 0.4% were hospitalized with ophthalmoplegia, while a Japanese study reported the prevalence of ophthalmoplegia among diabetic patients to be 0.97% which is ten times more than non-diabetic patients at 0.13%. Among Saudi diabetic patients, VI and III cranial nerves palsies were found to be the most frequently affected cranial nerves. Ophthalmoplegia in diabetic patients are more frequently seen in older individuals with a long duration of diabetes. Other risk factors are chronic diabetes micro and macroangiopathies namely: retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and major vessel diseases.

Diabetes registry is a valuable source of clinical data that can be used to study rare conditions associated with diabetes. The Saudi National Diabetes Registry (SNDR) hosts large number of diabetic patients with different types of diabetes and a wide age spectrum. Over the past 14 years, this registry has collected information from a wide range of diabetic patients suffering from different cranial nerve palsies. Utilizing this registry, we performed a cross sectional prevalence study for ophthalmoplegia secondary to cranial nerves III, IV, and VI palsies and its related risk factors for patients who are older than 18 years of age regardless of their diabetes type.

### Pseudomyasthenia resulting from a posterior carotid artery wall aneurysm: a novel presentation: case report [^111cWJz5]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective and Importance

Painful oculomotor palsy can result from enlargement or rupture of intracranial aneurysms. The IIIrd cranial nerve dysfunction in this setting, whether partial or complete, is usually fixed or progressive and is sometimes reversible with surgery. We report an unusual oculomotor manifestation of a posterior carotid artery wall aneurysm, which mimicked ocular myasthenia gravis.

Clinical Presentation

A 47-year-old woman developed painless, intermittent, partial IIIrd cranial nerve palsy. She presented with isolated episodic left-sided ptosis, which initially suggested a metabolic or neuromuscular disorder. However, digital subtraction angiography revealed a left posterior carotid artery wall aneurysm, just proximal to the origin of the posterior communicating artery.

Intervention

The aneurysm was successfully clipped via a pterional craniotomy. During surgery, the aneurysm was observed to be compressing the oculomotor nerve. The patient's symptoms resolved after the operation.

Conclusion

The variability of incomplete IIIrd cranial nerve deficits can present a diagnostic challenge, and the approach for patients with isolated IIIrd cranial nerve palsies remains controversial. Although intracranial aneurysms compressing the oculomotor nerve classically produce fixed or progressive IIIrd cranial nerve palsies with pupillary involvement, anatomic variations may result in atypical presentations. With the exception of patients who present with pupil-sparing but otherwise complete IIIrd cranial nerve palsy, clinicians should always consider an intracranial aneurysm when confronted with even subtle dysfunction of the oculomotor nerve.
