## Question

What are some studies on effect of wegovy on cardiovascular risk?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about studies on the effect of Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly) on cardiovascular risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pivotal trial and its design. Then, I should verify the primary and key secondary outcomes and their statistical interpretation. Next, I will examine subgroup analyses and real-world validation. After that, I need to consider mechanistic insights and safety signals. Finally, I should integrate guideline context, population-level impact, and practical prescribing considerations, while double-checking for any caveats or limitations that could alter clinical decisions.

> Let me first confirm the pivotal evidence base. The SELECT trial (NCT03574597) enrolled 17,604 adults aged ≥ 45 years with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² without diabetes, randomized to semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly versus placebo on a background of standard-of-care cardiovascular therapy and lifestyle counseling, with a median follow-up of 39.8 months, which establishes the highest-quality evidence for MACE reduction in this population [^115p5x5C] [^116BNhXD] [^1167xAR5].

> I should confirm the primary endpoint and its magnitude. The primary composite MACE (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke) occurred in 6.5% with semaglutide vs 8.0% with placebo, yielding a hazard ratio of 0.80 (95% CI 0.72–0.90; p < 0.001), indicating a 20% relative risk reduction and establishing superiority, which is the basis for the FDA-approved cardiovascular risk reduction indication for Wegovy in adults with established CVD and overweight/obesity [^115p5x5C] [^112cg3iC] [^114f9QRV].

> Wait, let me verify the component-level effects and secondary outcomes to ensure consistency. Nonfatal stroke and nonfatal MI drove much of the MACE reduction, while CV death alone did not reach statistical significance in the primary analysis, though a composite heart failure outcome (CV death or HF hospitalization/urgent visit) was significantly reduced, and all-cause mortality was also lower with semaglutide, supporting broad cardiovascular benefit beyond a single component [^115p5x5C] [^1129UsVd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about generalizability without subgroup checks. I need to check whether benefits persist across baseline adiposity, glycemia, and heart failure status. Prespecified and post hoc analyses show consistent MACE reduction across baseline weight and waist circumference strata, across HbA1c categories including normoglycemia, and importantly, in patients with prevalent HFpEF/HFrEF, where semaglutide reduced MACE and HF events irrespective of EF subtype, reinforcing external validity across clinically relevant subgroups [^115yvo3a] [^114ZbYvR] [^115MnZZU].

> Next, I should review real-world corroboration to assess external validity and early hazard behavior. The SCORE study, a large U.S. claims-based analysis of adults with ASCVD and overweight/obesity without diabetes, found significantly lower risks of MACE and related outcomes with semaglutide 2.4 mg initiation versus matched nonusers, with hazard ratios around 0.55–0.65 over approximately 6–12 months, aligning directionally with SELECT and suggesting early separation of curves consistent with mechanisms beyond weight loss alone [^111QCGeZ] [^111oUKZh] [^1169jpMq].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. Mediation analyses from SELECT indicate that only about one-third of the MACE benefit is explained by waist circumference changes, implying pleiotropic effects including anti-inflammatory, blood pressure, lipid, and possibly direct vascular or myocardial actions. Proteomic data also show weight- and glycemia-independent modulation of cardiovascular risk pathways, which helps reconcile early event separation with later weight nadir [^115yvo3a] [^116h4JcB].

> But wait, what about safety signals that could temper enthusiasm. I should double-check key adverse effects. Gastrointestinal intolerance is common and drives discontinuation in a minority, resting heart rate increases by about 1–4 bpm on average warranting monitoring, and in patients with diabetes there is a recognized risk of worsening retinopathy with rapid glycemic improvement; pancreatitis and gallbladder disease remain rare but important warnings, so patient selection and counseling are essential [^114FuZH2] [^111TYqRH].

> Next, I should review the regulatory and guideline context to ensure alignment. The FDA expanded Wegovy's label to include reduction of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with established CVD and either obesity or overweight, making it the first anti-obesity medication with a cardiovascular risk reduction indication; ACC expert consensus similarly emphasizes GLP-1 RAs with proven CV benefit as foundational therapy in T2D with ASCVD and supports their use for risk reduction in appropriate obesity populations [^112cg3iC] [^114f9QRV] [^115JdpUi] [^1175Wbtw].

> I need to ensure I contextualize the magnitude of benefit at a population level. Modeling studies estimate that if broadly adopted among U.S. adults meeting SELECT criteria, semaglutide 2.4 mg could prevent roughly 500,000 to 2 million MACE and 300,000 to 1.2 million deaths over 10 years, underscoring substantial public health impact contingent on access, affordability, and adherence [^111moq4v] [^117X5Prz].

> Let me consider practical prescribing details and limitations. Standard titration from 0.25 mg weekly with 4-week increments to 2.4 mg improves tolerability. Benefits are observed with or without concomitant SGLT2 inhibitor therapy, though dedicated CV outcome data for combination use are still evolving. And while SELECT enrolled only those with established ASCVD, ongoing and future studies may clarify primary prevention utility, so I should avoid over-extrapolation beyond the current evidence base [^1175Wbtw] [^116wTCLF] [^112oQja4].

> In summary, I should confirm the bottom line: in adults with established ASCVD and overweight/obesity without diabetes, Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly) reduces MACE by 20% versus placebo in SELECT, with benefits consistent across diverse subgroups, corroborated by real-world data, and likely mediated in part by weight-independent mechanisms. The FDA-approved cardiovascular indication, robust safety profile with appropriate monitoring, and favorable population impact projections collectively support its use as a disease-modifying therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction in this population [^115p5x5C] [^112cg3iC] [^115yvo3a] [^111QCGeZ].

Wegovy (semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly) **reduces cardiovascular risk** in adults with obesity or overweight and established cardiovascular disease, as shown in the SELECT trial [^115p5x5C] [^116BNhXD]. It lowered major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke) by **20%** (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72–0.90; p < 0.001) [^115p5x5C] over a median 39.8 months, with benefits emerging by 3–6 months and persisting across subgroups, including those with prior MI, stroke, or PAD [^111oUKZh]. Benefits appear **independent of weight loss**, suggesting direct cardiovascular effects [^115yvo3a] [^116h4JcB]. Wegovy is the first anti-obesity agent approved to reduce cardiovascular risk in this population [^112cg3iC] [^114f9QRV].

## Key cardiovascular outcomes trial: SELECT

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled; 17,604 adults ≥ 45 years with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m², established CVD, and no diabetes; median follow-up 39.8 months [^115p5x5C] [^116BNhXD].
- **Primary outcome**: MACE (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke); 6.5% with Wegovy vs 8.0% with placebo (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72–0.90; p < 0.001) [^115p5x5C] [^115iCTNp].
- **Secondary outcomes**: Reduced CV death or HF events (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71–0.96) and all-cause mortality (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71–0.93) [^115p5x5C].
- **Subgroup consistency**: Benefits were consistent across age, sex, race, BMI, and renal function [^1129UsVd].

---

## Mechanisms of cardiovascular benefit

Wegovy's cardiovascular risk reduction likely reflects **weight loss–independent effects**, including:

- **Blood pressure and lipid improvements**: Reduced systolic/diastolic BP, LDL-C, triglycerides, and increased HDL-C [^113L53Qk] [^1167xAR5].
- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Downregulation of inflammatory proteins and pathways [^116h4JcB].
- **Direct vascular effects**: Potential improvements in endothelial function and atherosclerosis progression [^1175i7bQ].

## Comparison with other GLP-1 receptor agonists

| **Medication** | **Trial** | **Mace reduction** | **Population** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Semaglutide (Wegovy) | SELECT | 20% (HR 0.80) | Obesity/overweight with CVD, no diabetes [^115p5x5C] |
| Semaglutide (Ozempic) | SUSTAIN-6 | 26% (HR 0.74) | Type 2 diabetes with high CV risk [^113aiBrc] [^111hFLNL] |
| Liraglutide (Victoza) | LEADER | 13% (HR 0.87) | Type 2 diabetes with high CV risk [^1171z5kX] |
| Dulaglutide (Trulicity) | REWIND | 12% (HR 0.88) | Type 2 diabetes with CV risk factors [^116V2DcE] |

---

Wegovy's **20% MACE reduction** is comparable to or greater than other GLP-1 RAs, particularly in obesity without diabetes [^115p5x5C].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

The **ACC/AHA 2025 expert consensus** recommends semaglutide 2.4 mg weekly for adults with obesity/overweight and established CVD to reduce cardiovascular events [^notfound]. The **FDA 2024 approval** granted a new indication for Wegovy to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults with established CVD and obesity or overweight [^112cg3iC] [^114f9QRV].

---

## Safety considerations

- **Gastrointestinal side effects**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation are common but usually mild-to-moderate [^112cg3iC] [^116fWzWk].
- **Serious adverse events**: Lower serious adverse event rates vs placebo in SELECT (33.4% vs 36.4%) [^115p5x5C].
- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor heart rate; discontinue if sustained increase occurs [^114FuZH2].

---

## Limitations and ongoing research

- **Generalizability**: SELECT enrolled mostly older, male, White participants; broader populations need study [^116BNhXD].
- **Long-term safety**: Continued post-marketing surveillance is warranted [^notfound].
- **Primary prevention**: Effects in individuals without established CVD are under investigation [^notfound].

---

Wegovy **reduces cardiovascular risk** by 20% in adults with obesity or overweight and established CVD, with benefits emerging early and persisting across subgroups. These effects likely reflect both weight loss and direct cardiovascular actions, supporting its use to lower cardiovascular events in this population [^115p5x5C] [^115yvo3a].

### Cardiovascular efficacy of liraglutide and semaglutide in individuals with diabetes and peripheral artery disease [^1171z5kX]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the cardiovascular (CV) efficacy of liraglutide and semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

Materials and Methods

LEADER and SUSTAIN 6 trials investigated subcutaneous liraglutide (≤ 1.8 mg/day) and semaglutide (0.5 or 1.0 mg/week), respectively, versus placebo in patients with T2D and high CV risk (median follow-up: 3.8 and 2.1years, respectively). The primary outcome was a composite of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (major adverse CV event [MACE]) according to the presence of PAD at baseline.

Results

Overall, 1184/9340 (12.7%) patients in LEADER and 460/3297 (14.0%) in SUSTAIN 6 had PAD at baseline. Patients with PAD were at an ~35% increased risk of MACE versus those without (LEADER: hazard ratio [HR] 1.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17–1.58; SUSTAIN 6: HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.94–1.83). The effects of both therapies on MACE were consistently beneficial in patients with PAD (liraglutide: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58–1.01; semaglutide: 0.61, 0.33–1.13) and without (liraglutide: HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–1.00; semaglutide: HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.58–1.01; P interaction = .34 for liraglutide and .49 for semaglutide). Absolute risk reductions for MACE were higher in patients with PAD (liraglutide: 4.13%-point, 95% CI -0.15–8.42; semaglutide: 4.63%-point, 95% CI -0.58–9.84) versus without (liraglutide:1.42%-point, 95% CI -0.03–2.87; semaglutide: 1.90%-point, 95% CI 0.00–3.80).

Conclusion

Both liraglutide and semaglutide reduce MACE with consistent CV efficacy regardless of PAD status.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113aiBrc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

The study SUSTAIN-6 was published by Steven P Marso and colleagues in 2016 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk? In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the population was: 3297 patients (1295 female, 2002 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen. The key exclusion criteria were treatment with a dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 inhibitor within 30 days before screening or with a GLP-1-receptor agonist or insulin other than basal or premixed within 90 days before screening; history of an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event within 90 days; planned revascularization of a coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery; long-term dialysis. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the interventions were: n = 1648 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly for 4 weeks, then titrated to 0.5 mg for another 4 weeks until the maintenance dose of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg once weekly, and continued for a total of 104 weeks) n = 1649 placebo (matching placebo for 104 weeks). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.6% vs. 8.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.95). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in nonfatal myocardial infarction (2.9% vs. 3.9%; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.08) Significant decrease in death from all causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (7.4% vs. 9.6%; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.97) Significant decrease in new or worsening nephropathy (3.8% vs. 6.1%; HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.88). In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in severe hypoglycemia. In the SUSTAIN-6 study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM who were on a standard-care regimen, semaglutide was noninferior to placebo with respect to the composite of first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### Estimated life-years gained free of new or recurrent major cardiovascular events with the addition of semaglutide to standard of care in people with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular risk [^115VB3W7]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in a post hoc analysis of pooled data from Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN) 6 and Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER) 6. We estimated the benefit of adding semaglutide to standard of care (SoC) on life-years free of new/recurrent CVD events in people with T2D at high risk of CVD.

Research Design and Methods

The Diabetes Lifetime-perspective prediction (DIAL) competing risk-adjusted lifetime CVD risk model for people with T2D was developed previously. Baseline characteristics of the pooled cohort from SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 (POOLED cohort) (N = 6,480) were used to estimate individual life expectancy free of CVD for patients in the POOLED cohort. The hazard ratio of MACE from adding semaglutide to SoC was derived from the POOLED cohort (hazard ratio [HR] 0.76 [95% CI 0.62–0.92]) and combined with an individual's risk to estimate their CVD benefit.

Results

Adding semaglutide to SoC was associated with a wide distribution in life-years free of CVD gained, with a mean increase of 1.7 (95% CI 0.5–2.9) life-years. Estimated life-years free of CVD gained with semaglutide was dependent on baseline risk (life-years free of CVD gained in individuals with established CVD vs. those with cardiovascular risk factors only: 2.0 vs. 0.2) and age at treatment initiation.

Conclusions

Adding semaglutide to SoC was associated with a gain in life-years free of CVD events that was dependent on baseline CVD risk and age at treatment initiation. This study helps contextualize the results of semaglutide clinical trials.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of obesity [^1128h29W]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for chronic weight management. This paper reviews data on the mechanism of action, weight-loss and cardiometabolic efficacy, and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg/week for obesity. Semaglutide has demonstrated the largest weight loss of any obesity medication to date with reductions of approximately 15% of initial weight at 68 weeks, accompanied by improvements in cardiovascular risks factors and physical functioning. The approval of this medication provides patients with greater options for weight management.

### Cardiovascular event reduction among a US population eligible for semaglutide per the SELECT trial [^113rTeHg]. American Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Our objective was to determine the number of major cardiovascular events (MACE, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or cardiovascular death) and deaths from any cause that could be prevented across varying nationwide uptake of semaglutide 2.4 mg SC weekly for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

Methods

Using a nationally representative cross-sectional study of participants in the 2017–2018 and 2019-March 2020 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the U.S. (NHANES), we estimated the number of MACE and deaths from any cause potentially prevented over a four-year period among participants meeting SELECT trial inclusion criteria.

Results

In a sample of n = 216 individuals (corresponding to 4,473,681 adults in the U.S. population) potentially eligible for this therapy, a total of 356,329 MACE and 232,808 all-cause mortality events were expected without semaglutide over 4 years and 35,633 MACE and 22,117 all-cause mortality events would be prevented with 50% uptake of semaglutide.

Conclusions

Approximately 4.5 million adults in the U.S. are forecasted to be eligible for semaglutide 2.4mg SC weekly therapy, with substantial impact on CVD and mortality if accessible and broadly used.

### Cardiovascular risk reduction with once-weekly semaglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes: a post hoc analysis of gender, age, and baseline CV risk profile in the SUSTAIN 6 trial [^112PMzFJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Treatment guidelines recommend the use of antidiabetes agents with proven CV benefits as second-line therapy in T2D populations with CVD. All currently approved injectable GLP-1RAs have demonstrated CV safety (non-inferiority) in CVOTs, but only four have demonstrated both CV safety and superiority relative to standard of care. While there appears to be a class effect among human-based GLP-1 analogs with respect to CV benefit, additional studies are needed to further elucidate whether CV protective effects are provided by all GLP-1RAs.

Semaglutide has demonstrated a consistent effect with respect to glycemic efficacy and safety in T2D populations across the spectrum of care. In SUSTAIN 6, subjects with T2D at high CV risk treated with semaglutide had a 26% lower risk of the primary composite outcome of first MACE (death from CV causes, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) vs those receiving placebo over 2 years (p = 0.02 for superiority [post hoc]). Results of this post hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN 6 trial suggest the beneficial effects of semaglutide vs placebo were similar for men and women, for both younger (50–65 years) and older (> 65) populations studied, and for subjects with varying CV risk profiles at baseline. Similar results were observed with another once-weekly GLP-1RA (exenatide), in which subgroup analyses showed a consistent reduction in MACE across a range of baseline characteristics, including gender, age, and previous CV events. Gender is an important determinant of CV risk within T2D. Historically, women have reached target values for modifiable CV risk factors, including HbA 1c, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and lipid levels, less frequently than men. In the present post hoc analysis, the decreased risk of first occurrence of MACE associated with semaglutide treatment vs placebo demonstrated in SUSTAIN 6 was comparable for both genders, and overall event rates were similar or lower for women than men. Given the scarcity of available evidence for the effects of T2D treatment on CV outcomes in women and the increased emphasis on CV risk reduction, additional analysis of CV outcome trials in T2D by gender could help individualize optimal care and risk management for all patients with a history of or risk factors for CVD.

### An overview of obesity-related complications: the epidemiological evidence linking body weight and other markers of obesity to adverse health outcomes [^115aEnjN]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

According to a meta‐analysis comparing dietary macronutrient patterns and dietary programmes for weight and CV risk factor reduction in overweight and obese adults, most dietary patterns resulted in similar, only modest short‐term weight loss, but with substantial improvements in cardiovascular risk factors. However, there is no evidence that caloric restriction alone or in combination with increasing physical activity significantly reduces cardiovascular (CV) events. As an example, in the Look AHEAD trial, 5145 patients with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes were randomised to an intensive lifestyle intervention (weight loss promotion through reduced caloric intake and increased physical activity) or regular care. Despite greater weight loss (−8.6% vs. −0.7%), and greater reduction in HbA1c and blood pressure levels, the intensive lifestyle intervention did not reduce the rate of CV events. However, a post‐hoc analysis revealed a significant reduction in CV events in patients achieving ≥ 10% weight loss in the first year of intervention.

Until recently, there was no formal evidence that weight loss interventions in people with obesity without type 2 diabetes may significantly decrease cardiovascular endpoints. Data from bariatric surgery indicated that the extent of weight loss may be associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular endpoints. But this observation has not been tested in a randomised controlled trial.

The SELECT trial was the first prospective randomised controlled trial that demonstrated that in patients with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease and overweight or obesity but without diabetes, a significant weight reduction achieved by weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke at a mean follow‐up of 39.8 months. In a total of 17 604 participants, the primary cardiovascular end‐point event occurred in 569 of the 8803 patients (6.5%) in the semaglutide group and in 701 of the 8801 patients (8.0%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.72–0.90; p < 0.001). However, the beneficial cardiovascular outcome effects of the SELECT trial cannot be entirely explained by weight loss effects of semaglutide. Participants of the SELECT trial who experienced only modest weight loss with semaglutide also had cardiovascular benefits. Moreover, in type 2 diabetes cardiovascular outcomes trials for liraglutideand dulaglutide, a modest weight loss was associated with significant benefits on cardiovascular outcome endpoints.

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^1115Y6G3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

✱ p < 0.001 (unadjusted 2-sided) for superiority, controlled for multiplicity.

For Study 6, the primary efficacy parameters were mean percent change in body weight and the percentage of patients achieving greater than or equal to 5% weight loss from baseline to week 68.

After 68 weeks, treatment with WEGOVY 1.7 mg and 2.4 mg resulted in a statistically significant reduction in body weight compared with placebo. Greater proportions of patients treated with WEGOVY achieved 5%, 10%, and 15% weight loss than those treated with placebo as shown in Table 8.

1The intent-to-treat population includes all randomized patients. At baseline, 24.7% of patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. At week 68, the body weight was missing for 3%, 3%, and 1% of patients randomized to WEGOVY 1.7 mg, WEGOVY 2.4 mg, and placebo, respectively. Missing data were imputed from retrieved subjects of the same randomized treatment arm (RD-MI).

### Population-level impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with obesity or overweight and cardiovascular disease: a modelling study based on the SELECT trial [^115Weepf]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, approximately 6.1 million adults in the United States meet the SELECT criteria and would be eligible for semaglutide 2.4 mg. Our model demonstrates a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality. Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg in eligible individuals could lead to a substantial prevention of cardiovascular events in the United States, regardless of age or severity of excess weight.

5.8 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a 2-year trial with semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg once-weekly injection in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk, diabetic retinopathy complications (which was a 4-component adjudicated endpoint) occurred in patients treated with semaglutide injection (3%) compared to placebo (1.8%). The absolute risk increase for diabetic retinopathy complications was larger among patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline (semaglutide injection 8.2%, placebo 5.2%) than among patients without a known history of diabetic retinopathy (semaglutide injection 0.7%, placebo 0.4%).

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m² for weight reduction (Study 3), diabetic retinopathy was reported by 4% of WEGOVY-treated patients and 2.7% placebo-treated patients [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. The effect of long-term glycemic control with semaglutide on diabetic retinopathy complications has not been studied. Patients with a history of diabetic retinopathy should be monitored for progression of diabetic retinopathy.

5.9 Heart Rate Increase

Treatment with WEGOVY was associated with increases in resting heart rate. Mean increases in resting heart rate of 1 to 4 beats per minute (bpm) were observed in WEGOVY-treated adult patients compared to placebo in clinical trials for weight reduction. More adult patients treated with WEGOVY compared with placebo had maximum changes from baseline at any visit of 10 to 19 bpm (41% versus 34%, respectively) and 20 bpm or more (26% versus 16%, respectively). In a clinical trial in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with normal baseline heart rate, more patients treated with WEGOVY compared to placebo had maximum changes in heart rate of 20 bpm or more (54% versus 39%) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor heart rate at regular intervals consistent with usual clinical practice. Instruct patients to inform their healthcare providers of palpitations or feelings of a racing heartbeat while at rest during WEGOVY treatment. If patients experience a sustained increase in resting heart rate, discontinue WEGOVY.

GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) — cardiovascular outcomes and preferred agents: "Albiglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and injectable semaglutide have been shown to reduce MACE", while "Exenatide once weekly and oral semaglutide showed numerically favorable but not statistically significant results for 3-point MACE when compared with placebo (HR for exenatide: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.00 and HR for oral semaglutide: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.11)". "Lixisenatide did not lower risk for CV events after an acute coronary syndrome compared with placebo", and "The potential for clinically relevant heterogeneity within the class exists, leaving dulaglutide, liraglutide, and injectable semaglutide the currently preferred agents (albiglutide is no longer available in the United States)".

### Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with overweight or obesity: STEP 1 and 4 exploratory analyses [^1175i7bQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In patients with T2D and established CVD, liraglutide and semaglutide are approved for reducing the risk of MACE. Reductions in CV events with GLP‐1RAs are potentially driven by modification of atherosclerosis progression. In line with this, semaglutide reduced atherosclerosis in preclinical studies at doses that did not significantly reduce body weight, suggesting that anti‐atherosclerotic effects are not due solely to its impact on weight. In a meta‐analysis of trials in T2D, reductions in CVD risk were also independent of reductions in SBP and body weight. Further research is needed to elucidate fully the mechanisms behind the effect of GLP‐1RAs on CV outcomes.

Based on current and previously published data, it is reasonable to hypothesize that semaglutide may also have beneficial effects on CV outcomes in individuals with overweight/obesity without T2D. However, the present analyses revealed that the reduction in ASCVD risk with semaglutide in STEP 1 was not significantly different from that with placebo. The most probable explanation for this is that the STEP 1 population was at relatively low risk at the start of the trial; for example, the participants were relatively young. Stratification of participants by C‐reactive protein concentrations or statin use may have assisted with differentiating the effects of semaglutide and placebo on risk. To investigate this further, the ongoing SELECT (Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients With Overweight or Obesity; NCT03574597) trial will evaluate semaglutide versus placebo for preventing MACE in patients with established CVD and overweight/obesity, but without T2D.

Some of the analyses described here were exploratory or post‐hoc in nature, approaches with inherent limitations. In addition, not all analyses were controlled for multiplicity, and the studies were not able to determine the contribution of weight loss alone to improvement in CV risk. Furthermore, in STEP 4, as the treatment group comparisons over 68 weeks only included the 89% of enrolled trial participants who completed the 20‐week run‐in on semaglutide, which followed a strict dose‐titration schedule, selection bias may have been introduced and could have favoured participants who were better able to tolerate semaglutide. As changes in use of antihypertensive and lipid‐lowering medication were based on physician judgement, they may have been affected by site‐ or physician‐dependent variability. Finally, the trial populations were predominantly female and the impact of sex on the findings is unknown.

### The expanding role of semaglutide: beyond glycemic control [^115YUKJR]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has transformed the treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its robust efficacy and wide-ranging therapeutic benefits. This review outlines semaglutide's diverse mechanisms of action, including its roles in glucose homeostasis, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection. Data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trials demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), firmly establishing semaglutide as a key agent in diabetes management. The STEP trials further highlight its exceptional effectiveness in weight control, with participants achieving up to 20% weight loss alongside improvements in obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, ongoing studies such as the FOCUS trial are investigating its impact on microvascular complications. Beyond glycemic control, semaglutide exhibits renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potential hepatoprotective effects. Emerging evidence also supports its expanding role in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart failure, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and Alzheimer's disease. While gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse events, long-term studies affirm its overall safety and tolerability. The availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations further enhances treatment adherence and accessibility. As a result, semaglutide has emerged as a cornerstone therapy for a broad spectrum of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine disorders. Future research should continue to explore its therapeutic potential in under-studied populations, including individuals with non-diabetic cardiovascular disease and hepatic fibrosis.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^112oQja4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Concomitant use of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1RAs — evidence summary: To date, no trials have studied the CV outcome effects of concomitant use of both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit. DURATION-8 (Phase 3 28-Week Study With 24-Week and 52-Week Extension Phases to Evaluate Efficacy and Safety of Exenatide Once Weekly and Dapagliflozin Versus Exenatide and Dapagliflozin Matching Placebo) demonstrated greater reductions in blood pressure and body weight in patients randomly allocated to the combination of dapagliflozin and exenatide than to either agent alone. Combination therapy with both an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1RA for glycemic management also accords with current T2D management guidelines, and in randomized, placebo-controlled trials, dulaglutide, liraglutide, and semaglutide have shown an additive glucose-lowering benefit over placebo.

### Semaglutide for cardiovascular event reduction in people with overweight or obesity: SELECT study baseline characteristics [^113dDFwR]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

A central defining characteristic of CVOTs in the fields of diabetes and obesity is whether they enroll only those participants with prior CVD. SELECT only enrolled participants with prior CV events or PAD, whereas, in other CVOTs, up to two‐thirds of the enrolled population did not have prior CV events. Specifically, across the obesity CVOTs, SELECT is the only study to our knowledge that only enrolled participants with established CVD, whereas in the other obesity CVOTs, 24.9% to 50.5% of participants had no prior events. As such, it is anticipated that SELECT will have the highest event rates versus previously published obesity CVOTs, but lower event rates compared with the diabetes CVOTs.

We report the characteristics of the SELECT population grouped by several potential determinants of CV risk, including glycemia as measured by HbA 1c, tertiles of adiposity as measured by waist to height ratio, and type of prior CV event. Prespecified analyses will evaluate the CV and metabolic benefits of semaglutide across subgroups with distinct CVD phenotypes, as well as across the obesity and diabetes disease continuum, providing insights into both the CV protective mechanisms and the ability to define populations who observe the greatest benefit. For example, the HbA 1c subgroups will contribute to our understanding of glucose‐mediated risk of CV events in people with overweight or obesity and no diabetes. It is notable that two‐thirds of the population had an abnormal HbA 1c (> 5.7%) at baseline. This finding highlights the high prevalence of dysglycemia among those with established CVD and allows us to investigate whether any effect of semaglutide on 3‐point MACE is mediated through improvements in glycemic status. The waist to height tertiles will allow us to quantify the CV benefits across various degrees of obesity. Importantly, it also allows us to explore the degree to which weight loss, as opposed to the other effects of semaglutide, mediates any CV benefits. The subgroups with different CVD phenotypes will provide further understanding of the effect of semaglutide in different disease subtypes. Of particular note is the enrollment of patients with PAD, which reflects a subpopulation of patients that has been relatively under investigated.

### Cardiovascular and kidney outcomes and mortality with long-acting injectable and oral glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^115vu9Pc]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in type 2 diabetes (T2D), although whether benefits extend to both subcutaneous and oral formulations remains unclear.

Purpose

In these meta-analyses, including new data from the Semaglutide cardiOvascular oUtcomes triaL (SOUL) (oral semaglutide) and Evaluate Renal Function with Semaglutide Once Weekly (FLOW) trial, we examined cardiovascular (CV) and kidney benefits and risks of long-acting (defined as having pharmacokinetics sufficient to provide 24-h activity) GLP-1RA in T2D.

Data Sources

A systematic review of PubMed was conducted (to 7 February 2025).

Study Selection

Randomized placebo-controlled CV and kidney outcomes trials of GLP-1RA with ≥ 500 individuals with T2D were included.

Data Extraction

A random-effects model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for MACE, its components, all-cause mortality, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), a composite kidney outcome (kidney failure [kidney replacement therapy or persistent estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 mL/min/1.73 m²], sustained ≥ 50% eGFR decline or nearest equivalent, or kidney-related death), worsening kidney function, and safety outcomes.

Data Synthesis

Across 10 trials (n = 71,351), long-acting GLP-1RA reduced incidence rate of MACE by 14% (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.81, 0.90]; I2 = 27.6%), HHF by 14% (0.86 [0.79, 0.93]; I2 = 2.1%), and the composite kidney outcome by 17% (0.83 [0.75, 0.92]; I2 = 20.4%) and all-cause mortality by 12% (0.88 [0.82, 0.93]; I2 = 17.5%). A consistent 14% reduction was seen for all MACE components. There was no significant heterogeneity by GLP-1RA administration route (subcutaneous vs. oral). There were no increased risks of severe hypoglycemia, retinopathy, or pancreatic events.

Limitations

Trial-level meta-analyses preclude detailed subgroup analyses and may introduce ecological bias.

Conclusions

As a group, long-acting GLP-1RA, including both injectable and oral formulations, reduce incidence of MACE, HHF, and kidney events and all-cause mortality in T2D.

### Oral semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk type 2 diabetes [^1165Zumc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study SOUL was published by Darren K McGuire and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2, Diabetic nephropathy, Chronic kidney disease and Coronary artery disease. In the SOUL study, the trial question was: what is the effect of oral semaglutide in patients with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD? In the SOUL study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SOUL study, the population was: 9650 patients (2790 female, 6860 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients, aged ≥ 50 years, with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD. The key exclusion criteria were ESRD; receipt of long-term RRT; myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris or TIA within the past 60 days; planned coronary, carotid, or peripheral artery revascularization; treatment with any GLP-1 receptor agonist within the past 30 days. In the SOUL study, the interventions were: n = 4825 semaglutide (3 mg once daily as starting dose, with a maximum dose of 14 mg, plus standard care) n = 4825 placebo (matching placebo PO plus standard care). In the SOUL study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in major adverse cardiovascular events (12% vs. 13.8%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96). In the SOUL study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in major kidney disease events (8.4% vs. 9%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.05) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (6.2% vs. 6.6%; HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.09) Significant decrease in major adverse limb events (1.5% vs. 2.1%; HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96). In the SOUL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in acute pancreatitis. significant difference in serious adverse events (47.9% vs. 50.3%). In the SOUL study, the conclusion was: in adult patients, aged ≥ 50 years, with T2DM and ASCVD and/or CKD, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events.

### Semaglutide for the treatment of overweight and obesity: a review [^114YSbP5]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

8 CONCLUSIONS

A growing body of data from the STEP clinical trial programme has demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in individuals with overweight or obesity. Across the STEP trials, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg was consistently associated with mean weight losses of 14.9%‐17.4% in participants without diabetes, and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, physical function and quality of life. Furthermore, the safety profile of semaglutide 2.4 mg was as expected for the GLP‐1RA class. Results of other trials within the STEP programme are awaited, together with data from SELECT, which will provide valuable information on the impact of weight reduction with semaglutide 2.4 mg on decreasing CV risk.

### Cardiovascular risk reduction with once-weekly semaglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes: a post hoc analysis of gender, age, and baseline CV risk profile in the SUSTAIN 6 trial [^115BVahA]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The SUSTAIN 6 trial demonstrated that once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 mg) significantly reduced major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (MACE) vs placebo in subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and high CV risk. The effects of gender, age and baseline CV risk on outcomes are important considerations for further study.

Methods

Subjects were grouped according to gender, age (50–65 years and > 65 years), and CV risk profile at baseline (prior myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke vs no prior MI or stroke, and established CV disease [CVD] vs CV risk factors alone, including subjects with chronic kidney disease). Time to MACE and its individual components (CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke), hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure, and revascularization (coronary and peripheral) were analyzed for all subgroups. Additional analyses were performed for gender and age to investigate change from baseline in HbA 1c and body weight, as well as tolerability.

Results

A total of 3297 subjects were included. The majority of subjects (60.7%) were male; 43% were > 65 years of age; 41.5% had a history of MI or stroke; and 76.8% had established CVD. Compared with placebo, semaglutide reduced the risk of the first occurrence of MACE and each MACE component consistently across all subgroups (gender, age, and baseline CV risk profile). Revascularizations, HbA 1c and body weight were also reduced consistently across all subgroups compared with placebo. Gastrointestinal adverse events in all treatment groups were more common among women than men, but rates of premature treatment discontinuation were similar for both genders.

Conclusions

In this post hoc analysis of SUSTAIN 6, once-weekly semaglutide vs placebo reduced the risk of MACE in all subjects included in the trial, regardless of gender, age, or baseline CV risk profile.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a comparison of study designs, populations and results [^116V2DcE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

3 CONCLUSIONS

GLP‐1 RAs have shown efficacy in HbA1c, body weight reduction, and have established CV safety; some have even shown a CV benefit (liraglutide, albiglutide and dulaglutide). The 2020 American Diabetes Association standards of medical care in diabetes note that there are four FDA‐approved GLP‐1 RAs (liraglutide, albiglutide, semaglutide and dulaglutide) that report statistically significant reductions in CV events. 34 As part of the recommended patient‐centred approach to choosing pharmacotherapies in T2D, CV co‐morbidities should be considered. 35 Among patients with T2D and established CVD at or high risk, GLP‐1 RAs with a label indication are now recommended as part of the glucose‐lowering regimen independent of HbA1c and in consideration of patient‐specific factors. 35 In 2017, liraglutide became the first GLP‐1 RA in the United States with a label indication to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with T2D who have established CVD, 36 followed by injectable semaglutide in 2020. 37 In 2020, dulaglutide became the first agent in the United States with a label indication to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with T2D who have established CVD or multiple CV risk factors. 33 Meta‐analysis results included here and those reported by others for GLP‐1 RA CVOTs suggest that MACE reduction with GLP‐1 RA treatment may be greater in patients with established CVD compared with those without established CVD; yet heterogeneity of the effect of GLP‐1 RAs on MACE has not been shown between patients with and without prior CVD. 24, 38 Furthermore, dulaglutide reduced the risk of MACE in a trial where nearly twice as many patients had only CV risk factors than those with prior CVD.

### Lower risk of cardiovascular events in patients initiated on semaglutide 2.4 mg in the real-world: results from the SCORE study (semaglutide effects on cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight or obesity in the real world) [^113MZAg1]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Individuals with overweight/obesity face a higher risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) compared with those with a healthy weight. Consequently, an increased risk of subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death is observed in this growing population. The annual obesity‐related cardiovascular disease deaths in the United States (US) tripled from 2.2 per 100,000 population to 6.6 per 100,000 population between 1999 and 2020.

In 2024, semaglutide 2.4 mg, a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist indicated for weight management, was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MACE risk reduction in adults with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This approval was based on the results of the multicenter, double‐blind, randomised, placebo‐controlled SELECT trial, which demonstrated that once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg was superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of death from cardiovascular causes, non‐fatal myocardial infarction (MI), or non‐fatal stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72 to 0.90; p < 0.001), in patients with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes.

While there is compelling evidence from the SELECT trial supporting the efficacy of semaglutide 2.4 mg in lowering the risk of cardiovascular events among patients with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes, real‐world data are essential for gaining insights into these effects in everyday clinical practice. Such data would provide insight into the variability in patient characteristics and management strategies that often differ from those in randomised controlled trials. This interim analysis from the observational SCORE study (Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People with Overweight or Obesity in the Real World) aims to address this gap by using a large real‐world database to evaluate the association of semaglutide 2.4 mg use vs. no use and the risk of cardiovascular events and other obesity‐related outcomes in US adults with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes.

Results

In total, 96.9% of patients completed the trial, and vital status was available for 99.4% of patients. The median follow-up duration was 41.8 months. A total of 31% of WEGOVY-treated patients and 27% of placebo-treated patients permanently discontinued study drug.

For the primary analysis, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for superiority. Type 1 error was controlled across multiple tests.

WEGOVY significantly reduced the risk for first occurrence of MACE. The estimated hazard ratio (95% CI) was 0.8 (0.72, 0.9) (see Figure 4 and Table 4).

### Comparative effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs for type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116z9z6q]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Several pharmacologic options for type 2 diabetes are available.

Purpose

To compare benefits and harms of glucose-lowering drugs in adults with type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

Several databases from inception through 18 December 2019 and ClinicalTrials.gov on 10 April 2020.

Study Selection

English-language randomized trials that had at least 24 weeks of intervention and assessed the effects of glucose-lowering drugs on mortality, glycemic, and vascular outcomes.

Data Extraction

Pairs of reviewers extracted data and appraised risk of bias.

Data Synthesis

453 trials assessing 21 antidiabetic interventions from 9 drug classes were included. Interventions included monotherapies (134 trials), add-on to metformin-based therapies (296 trials), and monotherapies versus add-on to metformin therapies (23 trials). There were no differences between treatments in drug-naive patients at low cardiovascular risk. Insulin regimens and specific glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) added to metformin-based background therapy produced the greatest reductions in hemoglobin A 1c level. In patients at low cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background treatment (298 trials), there were no clinically meaningful differences between treatments for mortality and vascular outcomes. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background treatment (21 trials), oral semaglutide, empagliflozin, liraglutide, extended-release exenatide, and dapagliflozin reduced all-cause mortality. Oral semaglutide, empagliflozin, and liraglutide also reduced cardiovascular death. Odds of stroke were lower with subcutaneous semaglutide and dulaglutide. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors reduced heart failure hospitalization and end-stage renal disease. Subcutaneous semaglutide and canagliflozin increased diabetic retinopathy and amputation, respectively.

Limitation

Inconsistent definitions of cardiovascular risk and low-level confidence in some estimates for patients at low cardiovascular risk.

Conclusion

In diabetic patients at low cardiovascular risk, no treatment differs from placebo for vascular outcomes. In patients at increased cardiovascular risk receiving metformin-based background therapy, specific GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors have a favorable effect on certain cardiovascular outcomes.

### Cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and ASCVD initiating once-weekly semaglutide vs DPP-4is in the USA [^114LWr1h]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and health care resource utilization (HCRU) in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Current diabetes and cardiology guidelines and professional societies recommend that patients with T2D with or at high risk for ASCVD consider or receive treatment with a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) or a sodium-glucose transport protein 2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i), which has demonstrated cardiovascular (CV) benefit. This recommendation is independent of baseline or target hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. While GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated CV benefits in clinical trials, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) have not. However, DPP-4is are still commonly prescribed to improve glucose control in those with T2D and ASCVD, while use of GLP-1 RAs for this indication remains suboptimal.

Once-weekly semaglutide (Ozempic ®; hereafter called semaglutide) is an injectable GLP-1 RA indicated for use in people with T2D to improve blood glucose levels and in people with T2D and known heart disease to reduce the risk of major CV events such as heart attack, stroke, or death. A recent study investigated the real-world effects of newer once-weekly GLP-1 RAs vs DPP-4is using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics ® Data Mart (CDM). In that study, once-weekly GLP-1 RAs were associated with reduced risk of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) and reduced ASCVD-related and all-cause HCRU and costs relative to DPP-4is. The findings from this study may be complicated by heterogeneous CV effects within the broader GLP-1 RA class, highlighting the need to consider the effects of single agents within the GLP-1 RA class. However, real-world data comparing the effects of semaglutide vs DPP-4is in a diverse US population are lacking. Here, we used real-world data to confirm the effects of semaglutide and to complement existing data from prior clinical trials and real-world studies of the broader GLP-1 RA class.

The aim of this study was to compare the time to occurrence of CV events, HCRU, and medical costs in patients with T2D and ASCVD who initiated semaglutide vs a DPP-4i.

### Lower risk of cardiovascular events in patients initiated on semaglutide 2.4 mg in the real-world: results from the SCORE study (semaglutide effects on cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight or obesity in the real world) [^116xW83i]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Findings from this study extend the evidence base for semaglutide 2.4 mg by demonstrating not only a reduced risk of MACE outcomes, but also a significantly lower risk of incident T2D, MAKE, and MORAE in a real‐world population. This is particularly relevant in the context of the American Heart Association's emerging cardiovascular‐kidney‐metabolic (CKM) framework, which emphasises a more integrated approach to cardiometabolic risk reduction. Our results align with this paradigm shift by underscoring the potential of cardiovascular therapies such as semaglutide 2.4 mg to deliver broad clinical benefits across interrelated metabolic, renal, and cardiovascular domains, thus shifting the focus from MACE outcomes alone to a more holistic view of relevant health outcomes.

This study benefits from several strengths as the first large‐scale real‐world study investigating the cardiovascular benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg in a diverse patient population using a nationally representative database. First, the present results confirmed the benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg in reducing risks of cardiovascular outcomes among patients with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes in routine clinical practice. Second, compared to the population in the SELECT trial, this study had a diverse population more representative of real‐world individuals taking semaglutide 2.4 mg, with close to two‐thirds of female patients and more than half of non‐white patients, complementing results from the SELECT trial. Consistent subgroup analysis results by age, sex, and race in this study strengthened the generalisability of findings from SELECT. Third, patients were rigorously matched using propensity score methods, similar to prior studies, with the goal of investigating if benefits observed in clinical trials were also observed in the real‐world setting. Patients were matched using a comprehensive list of patient characteristics based on literature review and clinical input, which allowed for maximisation of balance and minimisation of confounding between semaglutide 2.4 mg use and non‐use to ensure robust comparisons. Fourth, this study evaluated a broader set of outcomes beyond those assessed in the SELECT trial, suggesting favourable effects associated with semaglutide 2.4 on a wide range of complications, including incident T2D and MAKE, and in improving overall metabolic health. Lastly, the results were unchanged after multiple sensitivity analyses. Specifically, consistent results from the 'as treated' sensitivity analysis are important because adherence to semaglutide 2.4 mg in the real‐world might differ from clinical trial regimens, and discontinuation rates due to side effects or other factors could impact outcome estimates. Thus, the present study also confirms the cardiovascular benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with adherence and persistence in routine clinical care compared to that of a clinical trial.

### Population-level impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with obesity or overweight and cardiovascular disease: a modelling study based on the SELECT trial [^111moq4v]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aim

To estimate the impact of semaglutide 2.4mg treatment on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with overweight/obesity in the United States based on the SELECT trial of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Materials and Methods

Using 2023 census projections and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, we developed Markov population-based predictive models for US adults meeting SELECT inclusion criteria and, separately, for adults eligible for semaglutide 2.4mg for its MACE risk reduction indication. The 10-year rate of recurrent MACE and deaths was estimated based on the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease 2 risk calculator and estimated semaglutide 2.4mg treatment effect as per the SELECT MACE hazard ratio.

Results

Of 6164019 US adults meeting the SELECT criteria, 2523218 (40.9%) are estimated to have ≥ 1 new MACE in the next 10years with no additional intervention. Semaglutide 2.4mg may prevent 496400 events, a 16% relative reduction. An estimated 2103630 deaths are predicted over the next 10years, of which 332597 deaths (any cause, 16% relative reduction) could be avoided with semaglutide 2.4mg. Among the estimated 22653158 meeting the MACE risk reduction FDA label criteria, 42.7% could experience ≥ 1 new MACE; treatment could prevent 1934493 MACE and 1231295 deaths (16% relative reduction for both).

Conclusion

Four in 10 individuals in the United States meeting the SELECT criteria are estimated to experience a recurrent CV event without additional intervention. Semaglutide 2.4mg can potentially prevent between half a million and up to 2 million MACE over the next 10years in the population meeting SELECT and MACE risk reduction eligibility.

Plain Language Summary

What is the context and purpose of this research study? More than 7 in 10 US adults have overweight or obesity, which increases the risk of heart disease. Semaglutide is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. A clinical study called SELECT found that semaglutide reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death by 20% in adults with overweight or obesity and heart disease. What was done? Our research estimated how many people in the United States would meet the criteria for participation in SELECT, how many heart disease events they might have with regular medical care over the next 10 years, and how many could be avoided with semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment in addition to regular medical care. We also estimated how many people would still be alive if they were treated with semaglutide. We estimated the same information for all people eligible for treatment with semaglutide based on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with heart disease. These estimations were based on a large survey of US adults. What were the main results? We found that over 6 million people would meet the SELECT study criteria. Of these, 41% are estimated to have at least 1 new heart disease event in the next 10 years. If treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg, nearly 500 000 heart disease events and more than 300 000 deaths could be avoided. More than 22 million adults would qualify for semaglutide 2.4 mg, according to the FDA indication. If all of these people were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg, nearly 2 million heart disease events and more than 1 million deaths might be prevented. What is the originality and relevance of this study? Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg can reduce the risk of new heart disease events and death in patients with existing heart disease, showing a substantial impact of semaglutide treatment in a real-world setting in the United States. Our study used different analyses to add to the existing research about reducing the risk of heart disease in people with overweight or obesity.

In an embryofetal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.4-, 2-, and 6-fold the MRHD) were administered throughout organogenesis, from Gestation Day 16 to 50. Pharmacologically mediated, marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with the occurrence of sporadic abnormalities (vertebra, sternebra, ribs) at greater than or equal to 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (greater than or equal to 2 times human exposure).

In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys, subcutaneous doses of 0.015, 0.075, and 0.15 mg/kg twice weekly (0.2-, 1-, and 3-fold the MRHD) were administered from Gestation Day 16 to 140. Pharmacologically mediated marked initial maternal body weight loss and reductions in body weight gain and food consumption coincided with an increase in early pregnancy losses and led to delivery of slightly smaller offspring at greater than or equal to 0.075 mg/kg twice weekly (greater than or equal to 1-time human exposure).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no data on the presence of subcutaneously administered semaglutide or its metabolites in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Semaglutide was present in the milk of lactating rats. When a drug is present in animal milk, it is likely that the drug will be present in human milk (see Data). The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for WEGOVY and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from WEGOVY or from the underlying maternal condition.

Data

In lactating rats, semaglutide was detected in milk at levels 3- to 12-fold lower than in maternal plasma.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Based on data from animal reproduction studies, females of reproductive potential receiving WEGOVY for CV risk reduction or weight reduction or females of reproductive potential receiving WEGOVY for MASH in whom the potential risk outweighs the potential benefit should discontinue WEGOVY at least 2 months before they plan to become pregnant to account for the long half-life of semaglutide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

### Lower risk of cardiovascular events in patients initiated on semaglutide 2.4 mg in the real-world: results from the SCORE study (semaglutide effects on cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight or obesity in the real world) [^1169jpMq]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, in this real‐world study of US patients with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes, semaglutide 2.4 mg was associated with significantly lower risks of MACE and other obesity‐related complications. Further research using data with longer follow‐up is needed to extend the present findings to assess the long‐term benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg in this patient population. Additionally, future studies of semaglutide 2.4 mg in broader patient populations, such as primary prevention among patients without ASCVD or secondary prevention among patients with a broader set of pre‐existing cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. carotid artery disease and aortic aneurysm), would provide valuable insight into the therapeutic potential of semaglutide 2.4 mg among patients with overweight/obesity.

### FDA approves first treatment to reduce risk of serious… [^112cg3iC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new indication for use for Wegovy injection to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in adults with cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight. Wegovy should be used in addition to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. Cardiovascular disease is a group of diseases of the heart and blood vessels. "Wegovy is now the first weight loss medication to also be approved to help prevent life-threatening cardiovascular events in adults with cardiovascular disease and either obesity or overweight, " said John Sharretts, M. D., director of the Division of Diabetes, Lipid Disorders, and Obesity in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "This patient population has a higher risk of cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke.

Providing a treatment option that is proven to lower this cardiovascular risk is a major advance for public health". Wegovy's efficacy and safety for this new indication were studied in a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled double-blind trial that randomly assigned over 17, 600 participants to receive either Wegovy or placebo. Participants in both groups also received standard-of-care medical treatment and healthy lifestyle counseling. Wegovy significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, which occurred in 6. 5% of participants who received Wegovy compared to 8% of participants who received placebo.

Wegovy also contains warnings for inflammation of the pancreas, gallbladder problems, low blood sugar, acute kidney injury, hypersensitivity reactions, diabetic retinopathy, increased heart rate and suicidal behavior or thinking. Patients should discuss with their health care provider if they have symptoms of pancreatitis or gallstones. The most common side effects of Wegovy include nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, dyspepsia, dizziness, abdominal distension, eructation, hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes, flatulence and gastroesophageal reflux disease.

### Semaglutide for cardiovascular event reduction in people with overweight or obesity: SELECT study baseline characteristics [^114mTPzg]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, to our knowledge, SELECT is the first CVOT in people with overweight or obesity and established CVD but without diabetes. The study uses standard‐of‐care preventive measures along with semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneous once‐weekly treatment, which has been demonstrated to provide significant and sustained mean weight loss of up to 16%, significant CV risk factor improvements, and proven CV benefit in patients with diabetes and prior CV events. If SELECT does demonstrate CV event reduction with semaglutide, we anticipate that this may have an impact on treatment recommendations for GLP‐1RAs and guidelines for people with obesity and established CVD. Furthermore, if SELECT demonstrates a protective effect, it would be the first randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the benefits of significant and sustained semaglutide‐mediated weight loss on CV events; previous evidence, even in the bariatric field, is only observational. The study population in SELECT represents the general population with atherosclerotic CVD as encountered internationally and also includes a broad range of patients across relevant risk categories and thus will provide important insights into the CV and metabolic benefits of this GLP‐1RA intervention.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials in Adults with Obesity or Overweight for Weight Reduction

WEGOVY 2.4 mg Subcutaneous Weekly Dosage

WEGOVY was evaluated for safety in 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials that included 2,116 adult patients with obesity or overweight treated with 2.4 mg WEGOVY for up to 68 weeks and a 7-week off-drug follow-up period [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Baseline characteristics included a mean age of 48 years, 71% female, 72% White, 14% Asian, 9% Black or African American, and 5% reported as other or unknown; and 85% were not Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, 13% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, and 2% reported as unknown. The baseline characteristics were 42% with hypertension, 19% with type 2 diabetes, 43% with dyslipidemia, 28% with a BMI greater than 40 kg/m2, and 4% with CV disease.

In these clinical trials, 6.8% of patients treated with 2.4 mg WEGOVY and 3.2% of patients treated with placebo permanently discontinued treatment as a result of adverse reactions. The most common adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were nausea (1.8% versus 0.2%), vomiting (1.2% versus 0%), and diarrhea (0.7% versus 0.1%) for WEGOVY and placebo, respectively.

### Effect of semaglutide versus other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on cardio-metabolic risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of head-to-head, phase 3, randomized controlled trials [^115Rc8yA]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as a cornerstone treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of the present meta-analysis was to assess whether semaglutide exerts greater effects on glycemia and other cardio-metabolic risk factors compared to other GLP-1RAs.

Methods

PubMed and Cochrane Library databases, along with grey literature sources, were searched form inception to 8th February 2023, in order to retrieve head-to-head, phase 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of semaglutide versus other GLP-1RAs on glycemia and other cardio-metabolic risk factors in T2DM.

Results

We finally pooled data from 5 RCTs in a total of 3760 randomized participants. Semaglutide compared to other GLP-1RAs provided a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c levels by 0.44%, in fasting plasma glucose by 0.48 mmol/L, in body weight by 2.53 kg and in body mass index by 0.91 kg/m 2. Subjects receiving semaglutide experienced significantly greater odds for achieving target and optimal HbA1c, along with significantly greater odds for weight loss > 5% and 10%. However, subjects randomized to semaglutide also experienced significantly greater odds for gastrointestinal adverse events and treatment discontinuation.

Conclusion

Semaglutide is more effective than rest GLP-1RAs, in terms of improvement in glycemia and other cardio-metabolic risk factors, among individuals with T2DM.

### Lower risk of cardiovascular events in patients initiated on semaglutide 2.4 mg in the real-world: results from the SCORE study (semaglutide effects on cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight or obesity in the real world) [^111QCGeZ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

In this first interim analysis of the SCORE study, we investigated the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and overweight/obesity but without diabetes who initiated semaglutide 2.4mg in real-world settings.

Materials and Methods

Individuals initiating semaglutide 2.4mg aged ≥ 45years with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes were identified in a US database (01/01/2016–12/31/2023) and matched 1:2 to those not on semaglutide based on a non-parsimonious propensity-score model. The primary outcomes included revised 3-point MACE (rMACE-3: myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality) and revised 5-point MACE (rMACE-5: rMACE-3, coronary revascularisation, and hospitalisation for heart failure). Secondary outcomes included MACE-3 and MACE-5, defined similarly to rMACE-3 and rMACE-5 but replacing all-cause mortality with cardiovascular-related mortality. Exploratory outcomes included incident type 2 diabetes, major adverse kidney events, and major obesity-related adverse events.

Results

A total of 9321 individuals on semaglutide 2.4mg were matched to 18,642 individuals not on semaglutide; patient characteristics were well-balanced between cohorts. Over a mean follow-up of 200days, semaglutide 2.4mg was associated with significantly lower risks of rMACE-5 (hazard ratio: 0.55; p < 0.001), rMACE-3 (0.43; p < 0.001), MACE-5 (0.65; p < 0.001), and MACE-3 (0.58; p < 0.01). Semaglutide 2.4mg was also associated with lower risks of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-related mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, and all exploratory outcomes.

Conclusions

In this real-world study of US individuals with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes, semaglutide 2.4mg was associated with significantly reduced risk of MACEs and other obesity-related morbidities (NCT06874751).

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes by baseline and changes in adiposity measurements: a prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial [^115yvo3a]. Lancet (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

The SELECT trial found semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with overweight or obesity with cardiovascular disease but without diabetes. We report a prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial on the relationships between baseline adiposity measures, treatment-induced adiposity changes, and subsequent MACE risk.

Methods

Patients aged at least 45 years, with a BMI of at least 27 kg/m 2 were enrolled in 41 countries (804 sites) and randomised 1:1 to once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. The primary outcome was time to first MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke). Adiposity measures included weight and waist circumference. In this analysis, risk of MACE occurring after 20 weeks was assessed between patients by adiposity changes in the first 20 weeks and, in a separate analysis, all in-trial MACE were assessed between patients by adiposity changes over 104 weeks. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03574597.

Findings

Semaglutide significantly reduced MACE incidence compared with placebo among 17604 patients enrolled in SELECT, with consistent benefits across all baseline weight and waist circumference categories. In the semaglutide group, analyses for linear trends showed lower baseline bodyweight and waist circumference were associated with lower incidence of MACE-an average 4% reduction in risk per 5 kg lower bodyweight (hazard ratio [HR] 0.96 [95% CI 0.94–0.99]; p = 0.001) and per 5 cm smaller waist circumference (0.96 [0.93–0.99]; p = 0.004). In the placebo group, lower baseline waist circumference (0.96 [0.94–0.99]; p = 0.007), but not bodyweight (0.99 [0.97–1.01]; p = 0.28), was associated with a lower MACE risk and weight loss was paradoxically associated with increased MACE risk. In those receiving semaglutide there was no linear trend linking weight loss at week 20 to subsequent MACE risk, but greater waist circumference reduction at week 20 was associated with lower subsequent MACE risk, and waist circumference reduction by week 104 was associated with lower in-trial risk of MACE. An estimated 33% of the observed benefit on MACE was mediated through waist circumference reduction (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.77–0.97] after adjustment for time-varying changes in waist circumference).

Interpretation

The cardioprotective effects of semaglutide were independent of baseline adiposity and weight loss and had only a small association with waist circumference, suggesting some mechanisms for benefit beyond adiposity reduction.

Hypoglycemia

Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

In a trial of adult patients with type 2 diabetes and BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2for weight reduction, clinically significant hypoglycemia (defined as a plasma glucose less than 54 mg/dL) was reported in 6.2% of WEGOVY-treated patients versus 2.5% of placebo-treated patients. A higher rate of clinically significant hypoglycemic episodes was reported with WEGOVY (semaglutide 2.4 mg) versus semaglutide 1 mg (10.7 vs. 7.2 episodes per 100 patient years of exposure, respectively); the rate in the placebo-treated group was 3.2 episodes per 100 patient years of exposure. In addition, one episode of severe hypoglycemia requiring intravenous glucose was reported in a WEGOVY-treated patient versus none in placebo-treated patients. The risk of hypoglycemia was increased when WEGOVY was used with a sulfonylurea.

Patients without Type 2 Diabetes

Episodes of hypoglycemia have been reported with GLP-1 receptor agonists in adult patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus. In WEGOVY clinical trials in adult patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus for weight reduction, there was no systematic capturing or reporting of hypoglycemia.

In a CV outcomes trial in adult patients without type 2 diabetes, 3 episodes of serious hypoglycemia were reported in WEGOVY-treated patients versus 1 episode in placebo. Patients with a history of bariatric surgery (a risk factor for hypoglycemia) had more events of serious hypoglycemia while taking WEGOVY (2.3%, 2/87) than placebo (0%, 0/97).

### Semaglutide (Wegovy) [^1172R2wj]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In Studies 2, 3, and 5, all patients received instruction for a reduced calorie diet (approximately 500 kcal/day deficit) and increased physical activity counseling (recommended to a minimum of 150 min/week) that began with the first dose of study medication or placebo and continued throughout the trial. In Study 4, patients received an initial 8-week low-calorie diet (total energy intake 1,000 to 1,200 kcal/day) followed by 60 weeks of a reduced calorie diet (1,200–1,800 kcal/day) and increased physical activity (100 mins/week with gradual increase to 200 mins/week).

Study 2 was a 68-week trial that enrolled 1,961 patients with obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m²) or with overweight (BMI 27 to 29.9 kg/m²) and at least one weight-related comorbid condition, such as treated or untreated dyslipidemia or hypertension; patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either WEGOVY or placebo. At baseline, mean age was 46 years (range 18 to 86), 74% were female, 75% were White, 13% were Asian and 6% were Black or African American. A total of 12% were Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Mean baseline body weight was 105.3 kg and mean BMI was 37.9 kg/m2.

### Oral semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes, according to SGLT2i use: prespecified analyses of the SOUL randomized trial [^116wTCLF]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Both GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonists and SGLT2 (sodium-glucose cotransporter-2) inhibitors (SGLT2i) improve cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease. However, there are limited data about the effect of combining these agents on cardiovascular and safety outcomes.

Methods

The SOUL trial (Semaglutide Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial; NCT03914326) randomized 9650 participants with type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and/or chronic kidney disease to oral semaglutide or placebo. As prespecified, participants were analyzed according to baseline use of SGLT2i (yes, n = 2596; no, n = 7054), and subsequently for any use of SGLT2i during the trial (yes, n = 4718; no, n = 4932). The primary outcome was time to first major adverse cardiovascular event, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Safety was evaluated by comparing the incidence of serious adverse events.

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 47.5 ± 10.9 months, the risk of the primary outcome in the overall trial population was 14% lower for oral semaglutide versus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.77–0.96). In those taking SGLT2i at baseline, there were 143 of 1296 (semaglutide) versus 158 of 1300 (placebo) primary outcome events (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.71–1.11); and 436 of 3529 versus 510 of 3525, respectively, in participants not taking SGLT2i at baseline (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.74–0.95; P -interaction, 0.66). An analysis of major adverse cardiovascular events by any in-trial SGLT2i use versus no use also showed no evidence of heterogeneity in the effects of oral semaglutide. The adverse event profiles of oral semaglutide with or without concomitant SGLT2i were similar.

Conclusions

Oral semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular event outcomes independently of concomitant SGLT2i treatment, and this combination appeared to be safe.

### Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with overweight or obesity: STEP 1 and 4 exploratory analyses [^113L53Qk]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aims

Evaluate the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg on cardiometabolic risk factors in people with overweight/obesity without diabetes in the STEP 1 and 4 trials.

Materials and Methods

STEP 1 and 4 were phase III, 68-week, placebo-controlled trials of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg combined with lifestyle intervention; STEP 4 had a 20-week semaglutide run-in and 48-week randomized withdrawal period. Participants had a body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m² or ≥ 27 kg/m² with one or more weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes. Pre-specified endpoints were changes in waist circumference, systolic/diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), lipids, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting serum insulin and antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication use. Post-hoc assessments included non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR; STEP 1 only), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association algorithm; STEP 1 only) and cardiometabolic risk factors by weight loss achieved (< 5%, 5% to < 10%, 10% to < 15%, or ≥ 15%) (STEP 1 only).

Results

Of the 1961 participants in STEP 1 and 803 in STEP 4, most had one or more complication/comorbidity at baseline, with dyslipidaemia and hypertension most prevalent. In STEP 1, reductions in waist circumference, SBP, DBP, FPG, fasting serum insulin, lipids and HOMA-IR were greater with semaglutide versus placebo (p ≤ .001). Reductions in SBP, non-HDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and FPG were generally greater with semaglutide than placebo within weight-loss categories. Non-significant ASCVD risk reductions were observed with semaglutide versus placebo (p > .05). In STEP 4, improvements in waist circumference, SBP, FPG, fasting serum insulin and lipids during the semaglutide run-in (week 0–20) were maintained over week 20–68 with continued semaglutide, but deteriorated following the switch to placebo (p < .001 [week 20–68]). Net reductions in antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication use occurred with semaglutide versus placebo (both trials).

Conclusions

Semaglutide may improve cardiometabolic risk factors and reduce antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication use versus placebo in adults with overweight/obesity without diabetes. These potential benefits were not maintained after treatment discontinuation.

### Population-level impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with obesity or overweight and cardiovascular disease: a modelling study based on the SELECT trial [^117X5Prz]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aim

To estimate the impact of semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment on the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with overweight/obesity in the United States based on the SELECT trial of patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

Materials and Methods

Using 2023 census projections and National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, we developed Markov population‐based predictive models for US adults meeting SELECT inclusion criteria and, separately, for adults eligible for semaglutide 2.4 mg for its MACE risk reduction indication. The 10‐year rate of recurrent MACE and deaths was estimated based on the Secondary Manifestations of ARTerial disease 2 risk calculator and estimated semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment effect as per the SELECT MACE hazard ratio.

Results

Of 6 164 019 US adults meeting the SELECT criteria, 2 523 218 (40.9%) are estimated to have ≥ 1 new MACE in the next 10 years with no additional intervention. Semaglutide 2.4 mg may prevent 496 400 events, a 16% relative reduction. An estimated 2 103 630 deaths are predicted over the next 10 years, of which 332 597 deaths (any cause, 16% relative reduction) could be avoided with semaglutide 2.4 mg. Among the estimated 22 653 158 meeting the MACE risk reduction FDA label criteria, 42.7% could experience ≥ 1 new MACE; treatment could prevent 1 934 493 MACE and 1 231 295 deaths (16% relative reduction for both).

Conclusion

Four in 10 individuals in the United States meeting the SELECT criteria are estimated to experience a recurrent CV event without additional intervention. Semaglutide 2.4 mg can potentially prevent between half a million and up to 2 million MACE over the next 10 years in the population meeting SELECT and MACE risk reduction eligibility.

Plain Language Summary

What is the context and purpose of this research study?

More than 7 in 10 US adults have overweight or obesity, which increases the risk of heart disease. Semaglutide is a medication used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity. A clinical study called SELECT found that semaglutide reduces the risk of heart attack, stroke, or death by 20% in adults with overweight or obesity and heart disease.

What was done?

Our research estimated how many people in the United States would meet the criteria for participation in SELECT, how many heart disease events they might have with regular medical care over the next 10 years, and how many could be avoided with semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment in addition to regular medical care. We also estimated how many people would still be alive if they were treated with semaglutide. We estimated the same information for all people eligible for treatment with semaglutide based on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with heart disease. These estimations were based on a large survey of US adults.

What were the main results?

We found that over 6 million people would meet the SELECT study criteria. Of these, 41% are estimated to have at least 1 new heart disease event in the next 10 years. If treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg, nearly 500 000 heart disease events and more than 300 000 deaths could be avoided. More than 22 million adults would qualify for semaglutide 2.4 mg, according to the FDA indication. If all of these people were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg, nearly 2 million heart disease events and more than 1 million deaths might be prevented.

What is the originality and relevance of this study?

Treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg can reduce the risk of new heart disease events and death in patients with existing heart disease, showing a substantial impact of semaglutide treatment in a real‐world setting in the United States. Our study used different analyses to add to the existing research about reducing the risk of heart disease in people with overweight or obesity.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex metabolic disorder associated with obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and complications that include cardiovascular, hepatic and renal disease; these complications impart significant morbidity and premature mortality. Whilst pharmacotherapies for T2D have largely focussed on glycaemic control, there is growing clinical and regulatory interest in optimising modifiable risk factors for complications of T2D. The importance of dietary and pharmacological interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in persons with T2D is highlighted by the benefits of risk factor modification and adverse cardiovascular consequences of some previous pharmacological therapies for T2D. Pharmacological interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease will reduce the financial burden associated with T2D treatment, since the cost of treating the complications of T2D is greater than treating the disease itself. Hence diabetes therapies which have a multifactorial approach to reduce complications (e.g. glucose, weight, blood pressure, lipids) are of major interest.

Cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) have reported reduced major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, non-fatal stroke or myocardial infarction, in association with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analogue (GLP-1RA) therapy. Indeed, there is strong rationale for the use of GLP-1RAs in people with T2D and obesity, and these drugs are generally recommended in a subgroup of people with poorly controlled T2D and obesity as a second- or third-line therapy. These agents enhance the incretin effect to augment glucose-mediated insulin release from the pancreatic β-cells and to diminish glucagon release from the α-cells, thereby reducing blood glucose levels. Furthermore, GLP-1RAs delay gastric emptying and enhance centrally mediated hypothalamic satiety, two factors which may account for the observed weight loss associated with these agents. The once-weekly GLP-1RA semaglutide is the most recently licenced injectable GLP-1RA and is associated with clinically significant improvements in metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors. In the SUSTAIN-6 trial, these benefits included a reduction in body weight (2.9–4.4 kg), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (3.4–5.4 mmHg) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c; 11.9–15.4 mmol/mol [1.1–1.4%]), along with reductions in total cholesterol and serum triglycerides. Whilst semaglutide is sometimes associated with gastrointestinal disturbance, it is generally well tolerated.

14.2 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial of OZEMPIC in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Cardiovascular Disease

SUSTAIN 6 (NCT01720446) was a multi-center, multi-national, placebo-controlled, double-blind cardiovascular outcomes trial. In this trial, 3,297 patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were randomized to OZEMPIC (0.5 mg or 1 mg) once weekly or placebo for a minimum observation time of 2 years. The trial compared the risk of Major Adverse Cardiovascular Event (MACE) between semaglutide and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and non-fatal stroke.

Patients eligible to enter the trial were; 50 years of age or older and had established, stable, cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, peripheral artery disease, chronic kidney disease or NYHA class II and III heart failure or were 60 years of age or older and had other specified risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In total, 1,940 patients (58.8%) had established cardiovascular disease without chronic kidney disease, 353 (10.7%) had chronic kidney disease only, and 442 (13.4%) had both cardiovascular disease and kidney disease; 562 patients (17%) had cardiovascular risk factors without established cardiovascular disease or chronic kidney disease. In the trial 453 patients (13.7%) had peripheral artery disease. The mean age at baseline was 65 years, and 61% were men. The mean duration of diabetes was 13.9 years, and mean BMI was 33 kg/m². Overall, 83% were White, 7% were Black or African American, and 8% were Asian; 16% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Concomitant diseases of patients in this trial included, but were not limited to, heart failure (24%), hypertension (93%), history of ischemic stroke (12%) and history of a myocardial infarction (33%). In total, 98.0% of the patients completed the trial and the vital status was known at the end of the trial for 99.6%.

### Weight regain and cardiometabolic effects after withdrawal of semaglutide: the STEP 1 trial extension [^113AgkkE]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a highly prevalent, complex, chronic disease, associated with cardiometabolic complications, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease. Obesity also leads to a wide range of other health problems, is associated with substantial socioeconomic burden and was estimated to cause 5 million deaths globally in 2019.,

Weight loss activates compensatory biological changes that prevent the maintenance of long‐term weight loss; weight regain is common. In people with obesity, pharmacotherapy is indicated as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention for chronic weight management and can help with achieving and maintaining weight loss. Long‐term obesity pharmacotherapy may be required for weight maintenance, as cessation of pharmacological treatment is frequently followed by weight regain, even with continued lifestyle intervention.

The present observational study examined changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors over 52 weeks following cessation of once‐weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide 2.4 mg (or placebo) and lifestyle intervention in participants who had completed 68 weeks of initial treatment in the randomized, placebo‐controlled Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) 1 trial. Semaglutide is a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) analogue recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency for chronic weight management, as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention, at a once‐weekly s.c. dose of 2.4 mg in adults with overweight (with ≥ 1 weight‐related condition) or obesity. The efficacy and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg for weight management have been investigated in the global phase III STEP programme. In the main phase of the STEP 1 trial, 68 weeks of treatment with semaglutide plus lifestyle intervention in adults with overweight/obesity produced clinically meaningful reductions in body weight, as well as improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors, and physical functioning.

A prior trial (STEP 4) assessed the effects of semaglutide withdrawal, with participants initially receiving 20 weeks of semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment during a run‐in period, followed by randomization to continued semaglutide treatment or withdrawal (switch to placebo) for an additional 48 weeks, with lifestyle intervention throughout. The present STEP 1 extension study complements STEP 4 by exploring post‐treatment changes in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors following a longer (68‐week) initial treatment period with semaglutide or placebo, and in the absence of active lifestyle intervention support during the 1‐year off‐treatment follow‐up period.

5 DISCUSSION

In the PIONEER programme, oral semaglutide was shown to be effective for glycaemic control across the spectrum of disease durations, background therapies and comorbidities (CVD/CKD) in patients with T2D. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44 Although most trials analysed the primary outcome after 26 weeks, treatment continued in most of the global trials for 52 weeks (78 weeks in PIONEER 3 37), and HbA1c remained significantly better for oral semaglutide 7 and 14 mg versus comparators at these later times. 36, 37, 38, 41, 42, 43, 44 At least half of the patients treated with oral semaglutide 14 mg in any given trial had HbA1c below the ADA target of 7.0% at the end of treatment. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44 When dose adjustment of oral semaglutide was permitted to account for a need to improve glycaemic control or to alleviate side effects (PIONEER 7), 41 oral semaglutide was more effective than sitagliptin after 52 weeks, suggesting that such an approach, in which the dose can be adjusted per individual patient, may be beneficial in clinical practice. Only 9% of patients were not escalated to the 7 or 14 mg dose by week 52. 41 The results of an open‐label extension phase of PIONEER 7, during which patients continued with (or switched from sitagliptin to) flexible oral semaglutide dosing for a further 52 weeks, are due to be reported soon (NCT02849080).

14.1 Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Cardiovascular Disease and Either Obesity or Overweight

Overview of Clinical Trial Study 1 (NCT03574597) was a multi-national, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to determine the effect of WEGOVY relative to placebo on major adverse CV events (MACE) when added to current standard of care, which included management of CV risk factors and individualized healthy lifestyle counseling (including diet and physical activity). The primary endpoint, MACE, was the time to first occurrence of a three-part composite outcome which included CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke.

All patients were 45 years or older, with an initial BMI of 27 kg/m2or greater and established CV disease (prior myocardial infarction, prior stroke, or peripheral arterial disease). Patients with a history of type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded. Concomitant CV therapies could be adjusted, at the discretion of the investigator, to ensure participants were treated according to the current standard of care for patients with established CV disease.

In this trial, 17,604 patients were randomized to WEGOVY or placebo. At baseline, the mean age was 62 years (range 45–93), 72% were male, 84% were White, 4% were Black or African American, and 8% were Asian, and 10% were Hispanic or Latino. Mean baseline body weight was 97 kg and mean BMI was 33 kg/m2. At baseline, prior myocardial infarction was reported in 76% of randomized individuals, prior stroke in 23%, and peripheral arterial disease in 9%. Heart failure was reported in 24% of patients. At baseline, CV disease and risk factors were managed with lipid-lowering therapy (90%), platelet aggregation inhibitors (86%), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (74%), and beta blockers (70%). A total of 10% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m²) and 0.4% had severe renal impairment eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Semaglutide for cardiovascular event reduction in people with overweight or obesity: SELECT study baseline characteristics [^112RQ77b]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

We present a comprehensive report of the baseline characteristics of the SELECT study population. The SELECT trial, which is one of the largest CVOTs in the field of obesity, will answer the important question of whether subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly reduces the risk of adverse CV outcomes in persons with overweight or obesity but without diabetes. In addition, SELECT will show the long‐term effect of semaglutide on multiple cardiometabolic and other obesity‐related end points. SELECT is the only CVOT study thus far designed to evaluate the superiority of weight‐lowering pharmacotherapy and will provide definitive data regarding the role of the GLP‐1RA semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly and the weight loss it induces on CVD and 3‐point MACE reduction. As such, it is important that the population enrolled in the study closely reflects the population toward which such intervention is geared, and the results for the total SELECT population will be the primary objective of this trial.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes by baseline HbA1c and change in HbA1c in people with overweight or obesity but without diabetes in SELECT [^114ZbYvR]. Diabetes Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the cardiovascular effects of semaglutide by baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and change in HbA1c in a prespecified analysis of Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People With Overweight or Obesity (SELECT).

Research Design and Methods

In SELECT, people with overweight or obesity and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease without diabetes were randomized to weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. The primary end point of first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke) was reduced by 20% with semaglutide versus placebo. Analysis of outcomes included first MACE, its individual components, expanded MACE (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke; coronary revascularization; or hospitalization for unstable angina), a heart failure composite (heart failure hospitalization or urgent medical visit or cardiovascular mortality), coronary revascularization, and all-cause mortality by baseline HbA1c subgroup and categories of HbA1c change (< -0.3, -0.3 to 0.3, and > 0.3 percentage points) from baseline to 20 weeks using the intention-to-treat principle with Cox proportional hazards.

Results

Among 17,604 participants (mean age 61.6 years, 72.3% male), baseline HbA1c was < 5.7% for 33.5%, 5.7% to < 6.0% for 34.6%, and 6.0% to < 6.5% for 31.9%. Cardiovascular risk reduction with semaglutide versus placebo was not shown to be different across baseline HbA1c groups and was consistent with that of the overall study for all end points, except all-cause mortality. Cardiovascular outcomes were also consistent across subgroups of HbA1c change.

Conclusions

In people with overweight or obesity and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease but not diabetes, semaglutide reduced cardiovascular events irrespective of baseline HbA1c or change in HbA1c. Thus, semaglutide is expected to confer cardiovascular benefits in people with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are normoglycemic at baseline and/or in those without HbA1c improvements.

### Cardiovascular safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes: rationale, design and patient baseline characteristics for the PIONEER 6 trial [^112VtKJS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the cardiovascular (CV) safety of oral semaglutide, the first tablet formulation of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist.

Materials and Methods

PIONEER 6 is a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV events (defined as being aged ≥ 50 years and having established CV disease [CVD] or moderate [stage 3] chronic kidney disease [CKD], or being aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 1 other CV risk factor). Patients were randomized to once-daily oral semaglutide (up to 14 mg) or placebo added to standard of care. The primary composite endpoint is time to first occurrence of CV death or non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. The primary hypothesis was to exclude an excess in CV risk with oral semaglutide by assessing non-inferiority versus placebo for the primary endpoint (non-inferiority margin of 1.8 for the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio). PIONEER 6 is event-driven, with follow-up continuing until accrual of at least 122 primary outcome events. There is no pre-defined minimal duration.

Results

Overall, 3183 patients have been enrolled (mean age 66.1 years, 31.6% females) in 214 sites across 21 countries. At baseline, the mean duration of diabetes was 14.9 years, mean glycated haemoglobin concentration was 66 mmol/mol (8.2%), and 84.6% of patients had established CVD/moderate CKD.

Conclusions

PIONEER 6 will provide evidence regarding the CV safety of oral semaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk.

3.2 Risk of recurrentevents and death over the next 10 years

Of the total modelled cohort of 6 164 019 US adults meeting the SELECT inclusion criteria, an estimated 2 523 218 individuals (40.9%) may experience at least one new MACE in the next 10 years without further CV risk intervention. An estimated 2 183 175 (35.4%) individuals treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg are likely to experience a MACE (i.e. first recurrent event), a relative reduction of 13%. Table 2 shows the predicted number of events over 10 years without additional intervention, accounting for ≥ 1 event per individual. Figure S3 plots the events avoided and their 95% CI from Year 1 to Year 10. During the next 10 years, it is estimated that semaglutide 2.4 mg could prevent a total of 496 400 (95% CI: 216999, 786 815) events, a relative reduction of 16% (95% CI: 7%, 25%). The 95% CI is estimated from the Monte Carlo simulation. Figure S4 reports the probabilistic distribution of MACE avoided. Figures S5–S9 report the probabilistic distributions of other outcomes from the Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the model base case results are robust to the uncertainty of the input parameters.

TABLE 2
Risk of recurrent CV events and deaths over the next 10 years in US adults in the overall cohort meeting SELECT trial inclusion criteria (of 6 164 019 individuals).

In the secondary analysis, among the cohort of 22 653 158 individuals eligible for semaglutide 2.4 mg according to the FDA label for MACE risk reduction, it is estimated that 9 675 616 (42.7%) will experience at least one new CV event with no additional intervention; 8 385 882 people (37.0%) treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg are likely to experience a MACE, a relative reduction of 13%. Table S9 shows the model projections of 11 877 158 MACE, with semaglutide 2.4 mg potentially preventing 1 934 493 events, a relative reduction of 16%. An estimated 34.4% of individuals will die of any cause over the next 10 years without additional intervention. It is estimated that 1 231 295 premature deaths could be prevented if all eligible individuals were treated with semaglutide 2.4 mg (16% relative risk reduction), 674 823 of which are CV deaths.

### Proteomic changes upon treatment with semaglutide in individuals with obesity [^116h4JcB]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes are prevalent chronic diseases effectively managed by semaglutide. Here we studied the effects of semaglutide on the circulating proteome using baseline and end-of-treatment serum samples from two phase 3 trials in participants with overweight or obesity, with or without diabetes: STEP 1 (n = 1,311) and STEP 2 (n = 645). We identified evidence supporting broad effects of semaglutide, implicating processes related to body weight regulation, glycemic control, lipid metabolism and inflammatory pathways. Several proteins were regulated with semaglutide, after accounting for changes in body weight and HbA 1c at end of trial, suggesting effects of semaglutide on the proteome beyond weight loss and glucose lowering. A comparison of semaglutide with real-world proteomic profiles revealed potential benefits on disease-specific proteomic signatures including the downregulation of specific proteins associated with cardiovascular disease risk, supporting its reported effects of lowering cardiovascular disease risk and potential drug repurposing opportunities. This study showcases the potential of proteomics data gathered from randomized trials for providing insights into disease mechanisms and drug repurposing opportunities. These data also highlight the unmet need for, and importance of, examining proteomic changes in response to weight loss pharmacotherapy in future trials.

### Safety profile of semaglutide versus placebo in the SELECT study: a randomized controlled trial [^116w5Qwp]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The availability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) analog, represents a paradigm shift in the management of obesity, a chronic, progressive, and relapsing disease. Newer‐generation nutrient‐stimulated, hormone‐based therapeutics are more effective for weight loss than previously approved medications, provide weight‐dependent and other pleotropic cardiometabolic effects, and are delivered as convenient weekly formulations. The phase 3 Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) program evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg versus placebo for weight management in people with obesity or overweight.

Once‐weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg was approved for chronic weight management by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021 and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2022. In addition to improvements in body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors, a dedicated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trial (CVOT) was conducted to evaluate CV safety, as requested by the FDA and EMA for antiobesity medications (AOMs). In the Semaglutide Effects on Cardiovascular Outcomes in People with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) study, once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg reduced major adverse CV events (MACE) by 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.72–0.90; p < 0.001) versus placebo in 17,604 patients with overweight and obesity and preexisting CV disease (CVD) without diabetes. The FDA recently approved a label expansion including this indication.

The effects of semaglutide on weight loss and cardiometabolic risk in a high‐risk population must be weighed against its safety profile. The safety profile is evaluated based on prospectively collected clinical trial data and continuous post‐marketing reporting. As the longest and largest placebo‐controlled study to date systematically evaluating semaglutide, SELECT significantly builds on data from the STEP studies, providing a unique opportunity to explore known and new safety signals. This analysis provides a detailed assessment of the safety data collected in SELECT (including all adverse events [AEs] leading to permanent treatment discontinuation) to support clinicians and policy makers in assessing the risk–benefit and potential coverage of semaglutide for relevant patients.

### Semaglutide for cardiovascular event reduction in people with overweight or obesity: SELECT study baseline characteristics [^114iutV7]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

One of the study population limitations is the disproportionately smaller number of females and some ethnic/race groups, which will limit our ability for subgroup analyses. For example, the Black population, which has a higher prevalence of obesity as well as CVD, is under represented. As comorbidities were ascertained through medical records and investigator discretion is a limitation, the prevalence of comorbidities that were not directly measured has been underestimated. Reporting of comorbidities may also vary by race and/or country. Additionally, only those with preexistent CV events or PAD were eligible; thus, the study will provide no information on those with lower CV risk. SELECT will evaluate the CV outcomes of semaglutide‐mediated weight loss, and thus, it would not be possible to extrapolate the results to weight loss achieved through other methods, including lifestyle interventions. Furthermore, semaglutide might have direct cardioprotective effects independent of weight loss; thus, the results should not be extrapolated to other weight‐lowering pharmacotherapies either.

5 CONCLUSION

In summary, PIONEER 6 is a pre‐approval non‐inferiority trial that will investigate the CV safety of oral semaglutide compared with placebo and will, therefore, provide an important insight for regulatory approval. The trial has completed enrolment of 3183 patients with type 2 diabetes who are at high CV risk and will conclude once a minimum of 122 adjudication‐confirmed first MACEs needed to determine CV safety are accrued.

### U.S. eligibility and preventable cardiovascular, diabetes, and kidney outcomes from semaglutide in the SELECT trial [^1115Rk1D]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Overweight and obesity are highly prevalent in U.S. adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, reduces CVD events in patients with diabetesand with overweight or obesity and pre-existing CVD without diabetes from the SELECT (Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity) trialwith a 20% reduction in CVD events and a 73% reduction in incident diabetes. There was also a 22% lower risk for renal outcomes. Not well-established is the eligibility of the U.S. population and potential preventable CVD, diabetes, and renal outcomes from semaglutide based on SELECT.

### Semaglutide (SUSTAIN and PIONEER) reduces cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes across varying cardiovascular risk [^1145yMop]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In the combined SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 population, semaglutide reduced the risk of MACE versus placebo in subjects with T2D at high risk of CV events. While the HRs for each component of MACE favoured semaglutide versus placebo, the HR for overall MACE was mainly driven by the effect of semaglutide on nonfatal stroke and the HRs were not statistically significant for CV death or nonfatal MI. When fatal and nonfatal MI, and fatal and nonfatal stroke events were analysed in the combined CVOT population, there was no significant effect of semaglutide versus placebo, consistent with the effect of semaglutide on the CV death component of the primary endpoint. Furthermore, no significant effect of semaglutide versus placebo on hospitalization for HF was observed in the combined analysis of the CVOTs. The effect of semaglutide on overall MACE in the combined population of SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 was consistent irrespective of baseline CV risk, with the exception of subjects with prior HF.

The subgroup analysis by subjects' history of CVD (established CVD and/or CKD vs. CV risk factors only) was based on the inclusion criteria of the CVOTs, which can differ across trials. Although these inclusion strata are suitable for identifying subjects at high risk of MACE, they are not ideal for clinical decision‐making. In practice, decisions are typically based on the presence or absence of a prior CV event, making subgroup analyses based on prior MI or stroke, or history of HF, more relevant. It should be noted that the subgroup analyses were not mutually exclusive.

Findings from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER glycaemic efficacy trials also suggest a potentially beneficial effect of semaglutide on MACE in subjects with T2D at low risk of MACE. These data were included to investigate the effects of semaglutide in a population of patients with T2D considered to be at a lower CV risk than those in the CVOTs. However, the number of events was small; accordingly, the 95% CIs were broad and not statistically significant. Furthermore, the pooling of placebo and active comparators (including liraglutide and empagliflozin, for which CV benefits have been demonstrated) 2, 5 may confound the ability of this analysis to detect a benefit of semaglutide. Results were similar, however, when subjects receiving a GLP‐1RA or an SGLT‐2i were excluded from the analysis.

### Pharmacotherapy of obesity: an update on the available medications and drugs under investigation [^11695jAi]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

While early total body weight loss of at least 5% labels patients as responders to AOM, a higher response should be targeted; 5–10% total body weight loss is associated with a reduction in the risk of various metabolic, skeletal, and anatomical complications of obesity, and a total body weight loss > 15% may be needed to result in improvement of CV outcomes, as observed in studies assessing effects of weight loss in response to lifestyle modifications. The effectiveness of the currently available weight loss monotherapies is still modest, with the exception of GLP-1 RA, and in particular semaglutide, which in combination with behavioral modification therapy, may achieve more than 15% weight loss. The combination of more than one molecule may be needed to achieve a larger total body weight loss; for instance, tirzepatide, a GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist, led to ∼23% weight loss with the highest dose. New drugs seem thus have a much higher potency and are expected to change the medical weight management landscape in the not-so-distant future. Trials on AOM showed improvement in various metabolic parameters, some of which were of a small magnitude with a limited clinical implication. Furthermore, whether this effect has been driven solely by total body weight loss, rather than a direct effect of the drug per se, and whether it differs between metabolically healthy and metabolically unhealthy individuals with obesity, has been poorly investigated. While some available data showed improvement in liver steatosis with GLP1-RA, there is no evidence of reduction in liver fibrosis with any AOM, a parameter that requires longer term studies to show benefit. To-date, data on the effect of AOM on CV outcomes are still lacking. However, indirect evidence from trials in patients with DM is promising. The LEADER trial compared liraglutide (1.8 mg/d) to placebo in patients with DM on a composite CV outcome (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarct and non-fatal stroke). After a median follow up of 3.8 years, there was a 13% relative risk reduction in the composite CV outcomes and 22% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular death, in liraglutide group, compared to placebo. In a similar study design in patients with DM, semaglutide showed a 26% relative risk reduction the composite CV outcome, compared to placebo, while there was no difference in CV death. Interestingly, new findings suggest a potential neuroprotective effect of GLP-1 agonist, with a reduction of the risk of dementia and age-related cognitive decline, associated with diabetes and obesity; such a promising effect needs to be demonstrated in large prospective studies, extending over several years to decades.

Semaglutide cardiovascular outcomes (SELECT) in adults with overweight or obesity and cardiovascular disease without diabetes — semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly — reduced major adverse cardiac events and improved lipids while reducing body weight. In this trial, 17,604 patients were treated for 34.2 ± 13.7 months with mean follow-up 39.8 ± 9.4 months, with a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiac events; baseline lipids were total cholesterol 153 mg/dL, LDL-C 78 mg/dL, triglycerides 139 mg/dL, and HDL-C 44 mg/dL. Over 104 weeks, mean body weight change was −9.4% with semaglutide versus −0.88% with placebo (estimated treatment difference, −8.50% points), and at study end lipids changed by −4.6% (total cholesterol), −5.3% (LDL-C), −18.3% (triglycerides), and +4.9% (HDL-C). In short, semaglutide reduced body weight by 8.5% and reduced CVD events by 20%.

### Semaglutide for cardiovascular event reduction in people with overweight or obesity: SELECT study baseline characteristics [^117YXoRV]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This paper describes the baseline characteristics of the Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) study, one of the largest cardiovascular (CV) outcome studies in the field of obesity, which evaluates the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on major CV events.

Methods

SELECT enrolled individuals with overweight or obesity without diabetes, with prior myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or peripheral artery disease. This study reports participants' baseline characteristics in the full study population and subgroups defined by baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c; < 5.7%, ≥ 5.7 to < 6.0%, ≥ 6.0 to < 6.5%), baseline waist to height ratio tertile, and qualifying prior CV event or condition.

Results

The study enrolled 17,605 participants (72.5% male) with an average (SD) age of 61.6 (8.9) years and BMI of 33.34 (5.04) kg/m². The most common prior CV event was myocardial infarction (76.3% of participants), followed by stroke (23.3%) and peripheral artery disease (8.6%). Furthermore, 24.3% had a heart failure diagnosis. Two-thirds of participants (66%) had HbA 1c in the prediabetes range (5.7%-6.4%). Across groups of increasing HbA 1c, prevalence of all CV risk factors increased.

Conclusions

The enrolled population in SELECT includes participants across a broad range of relevant risk categories. This will allow the study to garner information about the CV benefits of semaglutide across these relevant clinical subgroups.

### Cardioprotective effects of semaglutide on isolated human ventricular myocardium [^113kdGAZ]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The STEP‐HFpEF study investigating the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist semaglutide in patients with heart failure (HF) and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and obesity (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 30 kg/m 2) showed larger reductions in symptoms and physical limitations, greater improvements in exercise function, and greater weight loss upon treatment with 2.4 mg per week semaglutide than placebo. Furthermore, in the SELECT study, 2.4 mg per week semaglutide improved a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, non‐fatal myocardial infarction, or non‐fatal stroke in patients with a BMI of ≥ 27 kg/m 2, which appeared to be mainly driven by a reduction of a HF composite endpoint. The exact mode of action of semaglutide is, however, still unclear. As shown in the STEP‐HFpEF and SELECT trials, semaglutide is highly effective even in a non‐diabetic population, underscoring that the glucose‐lowering action of semaglutide may not be the only important effect. Furthermore, semaglutide remains effective across the BMI spectrum of the participants of the trials, hinting at effects beyond weight reduction. A recent post‐hoc analysis of SELECT indicated consistent reductions of major adverse cardiovascular events regardless of the HF subtype of participants (i.e. HFpEF or HF with reduced ejection fraction [HFrEF]), but no randomized controlled trial for semaglutide in patients with HFrEF exists. A direct effect of semaglutide on cardiomyocyte contractility and sodium (Na) and calcium (Ca) homeostasis could help explain the consistent effects of semaglutide in diabetic and non‐diabetic patients with comorbidities and in patients at risk for or with existing HF.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in obesity without diabetes [^115p5x5C]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study SELECT was published by A Michael Lincoff and colleagues in 2023 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Obesity. In the SELECT study, the trial question was: what is the role of semaglutide in patients with preexisting CVD and overweight or obesity but without diabetes? In the SELECT study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the SELECT study, the population was: 17604 patients (4872 female, 12732 male). The inclusion criteria were patients, aged ≥ 45 years, with preexisting CVD and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² but no history of diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina pectoris; TIA within the past 60 days prior to the day of screening; history of T1DM or T2DM; history or presence of chronic pancreatitis. In the SELECT study, the interventions were: n = 8803 semaglutide (initiated at 0.25 mg SC once weekly, then titrated every 4 weeks (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.7 mg, and 2.4 mg) to the maintenance dose of 2.4 mg once weekly by week 16) n = 8801 placebo (matching placebo once weekly). In the SELECT study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (6.5% vs. 8%; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.9). In the SELECT study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (2.5% vs. 3%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.01) Significant decrease in first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization or an urgent medical visit for HF (3.4% vs. 4.1%; HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.96) Significant decrease in death from any cause (4.3% vs. 5.2%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.93). In the SELECT study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious gastrointestinal disorders. significant differences in serious adverse events (33.4% vs. 36.4%), adverse event leading to discontinuation of trial drug (16.6% vs. 8.2%). In the SELECT study, the conclusion was: in patients, aged ≥ 45 years, with preexisting CVD and a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² but no history of diabetes, semaglutide was superior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

### Lower risk of cardiovascular events in patients initiated on semaglutide 2.4 mg in the real-world: results from the SCORE study (semaglutide effects on cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight or obesity in the real world) [^111oUKZh]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this large retrospective study of 27,963 US individuals with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes from real‐world clinical practice, semaglutide 2.4 mg use was associated with significantly lower risks of all MACE outcomes, supporting the significant clinical cardiovascular benefits observed in the SELECT trial. Notably lower risks were also observed across individual components of the MACE outcomes. Additionally, the results of the exploratory analyses were consistent with the data from clinical trials for semaglutide 2.4 mg in terms of lower risk of obesity‐related outcomes such as incident T2D and kidney outcomes, underscoring its broader therapeutic effects.

The substantial and early reduction in CV risks associated with semaglutide 2.4 mg observed in this study is consistent with the findings from the SELECT trial at similar time points. A recent secondary analysis of the SELECT trial demonstrated that the nominal significant benefit of semaglutide 2.4 mg for MACE was observed as early as 3 months post‐randomisation and over the first 6 months. The association between semaglutide 2.4 mg in real‐world practice and cardiovascular benefits demonstrated in this study is remarkably similar to those seen in the SELECT trial (MACE‐3 HR: 0.59 [0.44–0.80] at 6 months). This is also supported by previous studies which found that the cardiovascular benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg appeared long before maximal weight loss was achieved. This could be due to alternative vascular, inflammatory, insulin resistance, metabolic, or other mechanisms beyond weight loss that contribute to the cardioprotective effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg. A mediation analysis suggested that about 80% of the MACE risk reduction with semaglutide is mediated by factors other than body weight loss. Taken together, current results combined with existing evidence suggest that the cardiovascular benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg in patients with ASCVD and overweight/obesity but without diabetes may be driven by accelerated physiological changes beyond just the extent of weight loss. Additionally, these cardiovascular benefits of semaglutide 2.4 mg appear to be molecule‐specific and not a class effect of all GLP‐1 receptor agonists.

### 2020 expert consensus decision pathway on novel therapies for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with type 2 diabetes: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^115JdpUi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes cardiovascular risk reduction — initiation and titration of SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) should follow trial-tested dosing. SGLT2 inhibitors with CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose tested in CV and renal outcomes trials (e.g., 100 mg for canagliflozin, 10 mg for dapagliflozin, 10 mg for empagliflozin), and no further dose titration is needed for CV or renal risk reduction. Among GLP-1RAs, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or injectable semaglutide have demonstrated CV benefit to reduce the risk of MACE, and a GLP-1RA with demonstrated CV benefit should be initiated at the lowest dose and up-titrated stepwise to the doses used in the trials or the otherwise maximal tolerated dose. Prior to initiating T2D therapies aimed at CV disease risk reduction, a detailed patient-clinician risk discussion is recommended, including risks, benefits, drug-drug interactions, safety, patient preferences, and cost considerations.

### Once-weekly semaglutide for patients with type 2 diabetes: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the Netherlands [^114Lvx7t]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2019). High credibility.

There is increasing interest in the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular risk. Efficacy appears to vary between GLP-1 receptor agonists, with once-weekly semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide and albiglutide shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, but lixisenatide and exenatide extended release shown to have no impact compared with placebo. It was not possible to take into account the impact of interventions on cardiovascular risk in the present analysis, as risk equations based on the cardiovascular outcome studies have not yet been integrated into cost-effectiveness models. Exclusion of the direct cardioprotective effect observed with semaglutide, particularly in the comparison with insulin glargine U100 which has been shown to have no cardioprotective effect, is a conservative approach, with a modeling study based on the SUSTAIN 6 trial showing that conventional risk equations underestimate the reduced incidence of stroke with once-weekly semaglutide. The cardiovascular outcome trials in type 2 diabetes have been conducted in patients with varying characteristics, most notably with differing cardiovascular risk profiles at baseline. Studies in homogeneous populations are required to assess the relative impact of different GLP-1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular risk, and subsequently capture any differences in risk equations for use in health economic analyses. Nevertheless, the cardiovascular benefits for semaglutide reported in the SUSTAIN 6 study may increase the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide, particularly in comparison with insulin glargine U100.

### Effects of semaglutide on risk of cardiovascular events across a continuum of cardiovascular risk: combined post hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials [^111nY6YU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Findings in context of the broader literature

Our results are consistent overall with a post hoc analysis of pooled SUSTAIN and PIONEER data, which also showed that the effect of semaglutide vs comparators on MACE was largely consistent across different CV subgroups. Furthermore, a meta-analysis including CVOTs for all GLP-1 receptor agonists found no significant heterogeneity in the effect of these therapies in subgroups with a history of CVD vs those with no history of CVD. Although there were no significant subgroup interactions in the meta-analysis, there was a numerically lower risk of MACE in subjects with a history of CVD (−14%, hazard ratio 0.86) vs those without such a history (−6%, hazard ratio 0.94). The HARMONY Outcomes CVOT (which only included subjects with established CVD) similarly showed a 22% CV risk reduction with albiglutide vs placebo (hazard ratio 0.78), and the REWIND CVOT showed an identical 13% effect size across subgroups with and without established CVD (hazard ratio 0.87). Taken together, these findings are counter to the suggestion that there is a greater relative CV benefit of GLP-1 receptor agonists in subjects at lower CV risk. Therefore, we believe the totality of data for GLP-1 receptor agonists indicates similar relative risk reduction effects across a broad continuum of baseline CV risk.

### Changes in cardiovascular risk factors and health care expenditures among patients prescribed semaglutide [^114Kjx3K]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, has demonstrated substantial weight reduction and cardiovascular benefits in clinical trials. However, its association with clinical outcomes and health care expenditures remains underexplored.

Objective

To evaluate changes in cardiovascular risk factors and health care expenditures among patients prescribed semaglutide across multicenter cohorts.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective cohort study included 23 522 adults (≥ 18 years) who received an initial semaglutide prescription between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2025, at Sentara Healthcare and between January 1, 2018, and May 1, 2025, at Yale New Haven Health System.

Exposure

The first prescription of semaglutide identified at the ingredient level, stratified by type 2 diabetes status.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes included changes in weight (% baseline), blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c. Secondary outcomes assessed health care expenditures using Medicare-based cost estimates. A staggered difference-in-differences design compared outcomes of patients after the first semaglutide prescription with those of patients who had not yet received their prescription during the same period.

Results

The study cohort included 23 522 patients (mean [SD] age at initiation of semaglutide, 56.2 [12.9] years; 66.7% female; 68.6% with diabetes). In the overall cohort, initiation of semaglutide was significantly associated with a -3.8% (95% CI, -3.9% to -3.7%) reduction in weight at 13 to 24 months, with a -5.1% (95% CI, -5.5% to -4.7%) reduction in weight among patients without diabetes. Significant reductions in diastolic BP (-1.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.7 to -1.4 mm Hg), systolic BP (-1.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, -1.4 to -0.8 mm Hg), and total cholesterol (-12.8 mg/dL; 95% CI, -14.3 to -11.4 mg/dL) were also observed. Hemoglobin A1c reductions were greater among patients with diabetes (-0.3%; 95% CI, -0.3% to -0.2%) compared with patients without diabetes (-0.1%; 95% CI, -0.2% to -0.01%). Imputed health care expenditures, excluding the cost of semaglutide, increased by $80 per month (95% CI, $68-$92 per month) during the 13- to 24-month period, which was associated with inpatient stays shifting to more expensive circulatory and metabolic diagnoses.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of adults prescribed semaglutide, initiation was associated with reductions in weight and cardiovascular risk factors but increases in health care expenditures, excluding semaglutide costs. These findings suggest potential clinical benefits in routine practice, while highlighting the need to evaluate the long-term impact of semaglutide on economic outcomes.

### Impact of BMI and comorbidities on efficacy of once-weekly semaglutide: post hoc analyses of the STEP 1 randomized trial [^115gcSw9]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study assessed the effects of semaglutide on body weight, cardiometabolic risk factors, and glycemic status in individuals categorized by baseline BMI with or without additional obesity-related comorbidities, including prediabetes and high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods

This was a post hoc exploratory subgroup analysis of the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) 1 trial (NCT03548935), in which participants without diabetes and BMI ≥ 30kg/m 2, or BMI ≥ 27kg/m 2 with ≥ 1 weight-related comorbidity, were randomized to once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo for 68weeks. For this analysis, individuals were categorized into subgroups based on baseline BMI < 35 versus ≥ 35kg/m 2 (with no additional criteria, with ≥ 1 comorbidity, with prediabetes, and with prediabetes and high risk of CVD).

Results

Mean changes in body weight from baseline to week 68 with semaglutide were -16.2% and -14.0% in the subgroups with baseline BMI < 35 and ≥ 35kg/m 2, respectively (both p < 0.0001 vs. placebo). Similar changes were observed in individuals with comorbidities, with prediabetes, and with prediabetes plus high CVD risk. The beneficial effects of semaglutide on cardiometabolic risk factors were consistent across all subgroups.

Conclusions

This subgroup analysis confirms that semaglutide is effective in individuals with baseline BMI < 35 and ≥ 35kg/m 2, including in those with comorbidities.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) — regulatory status and overall cerebrovascular effects are as follows: a 24% reduction in the risk of stroke (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.94) has been reported, and liraglutide, semaglutide SC, and dulaglutide are approved by the FDA to reduce the risk of MACE in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular (CV) disease, with dulaglutide being the only agent also approved for CV disease reduction in patients without established ASCVD; additionally, a recent meta-analysis suggests this class may offer modest reductions in hospitalization for heart failure, apparently driven by albiglutide rather than a consistent effect across all agents.

### Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with overweight or obesity: STEP 1 and 4 exploratory analyses [^1144gnuF]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is a highly prevalent disease with a serious, chronic, relapsing course. It imposes substantial economic burdens on patients, health care systems and wider society through direct health care expenditure and indirect costs, such as lost productivity. As obesity can lead to increased multimorbidity and reduced life expectancy, its increasing prevalence is an urgent public health concern.

People with obesity have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) and cardiometabolic complications, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). These effects are driven by the exacerbation of risk factors including insulin resistance, hypertension and dyslipidaemia. The key goals of treatment are, therefore, not only to reduce body weight, but also to mitigate cardiometabolic complications. Lifestyle intervention, in the form of diet and increased physical activity, is the cornerstone of weight management, alongside adjunctive pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery. However, data on the effects of these approaches on long‐term cardiometabolic outcomes are limited.

Semaglutide is a glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) analogue available in subcutaneous (s.c.) and oral formulations for the treatment of T2D. Once‐weekly s.c. semaglutide 2.4 mg (as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention) was evaluated for weight management in people with overweight/obesity in the phase III Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) trials. Semaglutide 2.4 mg led to mean weight losses of 15‐17% in participants without T2D and showed benefits beyond weight loss, including on patient‐reported outcomes. It has subsequently been approved for weight management.

It is hypothesized that semaglutide may reduce CV risk in people with overweight/obesity, both through weight loss and partly through independent effects on CV risk factors and other metabolic parameters. Although the exact mechanisms behind the CV effects are not fully elucidated, data suggest GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs), including semaglutide, may have direct and beneficial effects on the CV system.

### Current perspectives on cardiovascular outcome trials in diabetes [^114ukPBF]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Since the 2008 FDA/EMA regulations demanded an investigation of CV outcomes for newly developed glucose-lowering agents, a number of CVOTs have been completed and their results published. These trials, in general, have shown that glucose-lowering drugs do not increase CV risks over placebo levels, and even that some drugs, as empagliflozin, semaglutide or liraglutide, can actually lead to cardiovascular protection. However, despite satisfying the requirements of regulatory agencies when it comes to demonstrating not incrementing CV risk beyond a certain safety level, current CVOTs suffer still from certain design flaws that hinder their potential. Head to head comparisons, broader patient population groups, long-term analysis and an expansion of safety end-points, etc. would serve to improve CVOT design and expand its applicability spectrum.

### Effect of semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly on 10-year type 2 diabetes risk in adults with overweight or obesity [^116FCXsH]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) trials, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg plus lifestyle intervention reduced body weight and improved cardiometabolic parameters in adults with obesity (or overweight with weight-related comorbidities). Effects on the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2D) require investigation.

Methods

STEP 1 (68 weeks) and 5 (104 weeks) randomized participants to semaglutide 2.4 mg or placebo. STEP 4 included a 20-week semaglutide run-in followed by randomization to 48weeks of continued semaglutide or withdrawal (placebo). Ten-year T2D risk scores were calculated post hoc using Cardiometabolic Disease Staging.

Results

In STEP 1 (N = 1583), relative risk score reductions were greater with semaglutide versus placebo (semaglutide: -61.1%; placebo: -12.9%; p < 0.0001). These reductions were maintained to week 104 in STEP 5 (N = 295; semaglutide: -60.0%; placebo: 3.5%; p < 0.0001). Risk scores during the STEP 4 run-in period (N = 776) were reduced from 20.6% to 11.1% and further to 7.7% at week 68 with continued semaglutide, increasing to 15.4% with withdrawal (relative risk score change: semaglutide: -32.1%; placebo: +40.6%; p < 0.0001). Risk score reductions mirrored weight loss.

Conclusions

Cardiometabolic Disease Staging risk assessment suggests that once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg may substantially lower 10-year T2D risk in people with overweight or obesity.

### Effect of semaglutide versus placebo on cardiorenal outcomes by prior cardiovascular disease and baseline body mass index: pooled post hoc analysis of SUSTAIN 6 and PIONEER 6 [^114ucuuC]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Cardiorenal effects of semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at high cardiovascular (CV) risk were investigated.

Materials and Methods

Post hoc analyses of pooled SUSTAIN 6 (NCT01720446) and PIONEER 6 (NCT02692716) data assessed time to primary major adverse CV events (MACE; CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke), expanded MACE (MACE + hospitalisation for unstable angina or heart failure), CV death, all-cause death, and new or worsening nephropathy. The impact of body weight (BW) changes on primary MACE risk was also evaluated. Participants were stratified by prior CV disease (CVD) status and baseline body mass index (BMI).

Results

Semaglutide significantly reduced the risk of primary and expanded MACE, with a nonsignificant risk reduction of CV and all-cause death versus placebo in the overall population; the effect was consistent across all subgroups (p INT > 0.05 for all comparisons). Semaglutide consistently reduced nephropathy risk versus placebo in the SUSTAIN 6 population (HR [95% CI]: 0.64 [0.46; 0.88], p = 0.0054) and across all subgroups (p INT > 0.05 for all comparisons). When accounting for BW changes, treatment effects on primary MACE risk in the overall population and by BMI subgroups remained similar compared with the results of the main analysis.

Conclusions

Semaglutide treatment improved cardiorenal outcomes versus placebo in people with T2D, regardless of prior CVD and baseline BMI. This improvement was observed even when accounting for changes in BW, indicating direct effects of semaglutide on the cardiorenal system. This analysis supports the broad efficacy of semaglutide in a diverse T2D population.

### Effects of GLP-1 agonists on 10-year cardiovascular risk reduction in primary prevention: a 44-week open label prospective study [^1144FwYo]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus face elevated cardiovascular risk. We assessed the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on 10-year CVR in a primary prevention cohort.

Methods

In this 44-week prospective, non-randomized study, 135 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity were included across 13 healthcare centers. The primary endpoint was the change in 10-year cardiovascular risk, estimated using the AHA ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus tool at baseline and week 44. Secondary endpoints included weight loss, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and lipid profiles. Patients received subcutaneous semaglutide, oral semaglutide, dulaglutide, or other GLP-1RAs.

Results

In the primary prevention cohort (n = 105), mean 10-year CVR decreased by 3.28 percentage points, a relative reduction of 13.45% (p < 0.001). Subcutaneous semaglutide showed the greatest weight loss (-8.1 kg), followed by oral semaglutide (-6.5 kg) and dulaglutide (-5.6 kg). HbA1c improved from 8.1% to 6.6%, and fasting plasma glucose decreased by 45.8 mg/dL (both p < 0.001).

Conclusions

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce 10-year cardiovascular risk in primary prevention and improve metabolic control. Findings support early use in high-risk people with type 2 diabetes.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY in combination with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity to reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with obesity have been established. Use of WEGOVY for this indication is supported by a 68-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 201 pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with a BMI corresponding to ≥ 95th percentile for age and sex [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] and from trials in adult patients with obesity [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Use of the 1.7 mg once weekly maintenance dosage of WEGOVY in pediatric patients is also supported by additional exposure-efficacy and safety analyses in pooled adult and pediatric patients.

Adverse reactions with WEGOVY treatment in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older were generally similar to those reported in adults. Pediatric patients aged 12 years and older treated with WEGOVY had greater incidences of cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, hypotension, rash, and urticaria compared to adults treated with WEGOVY [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

There are insufficient data in pediatric patients with type 2 diabetes treated with WEGOVY for obesity to determine if there is an increased risk of hypoglycemia with WEGOVY treatment similar to that reported in adults. Inform patients of the risk of hypoglycemia and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. In pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 diabetes, monitor blood glucose prior to starting WEGOVY and during WEGOVY treatment. When initiating WEGOVY in pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with type 2 diabetes, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue (such as sulfonylureas) or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

The safety and effectiveness of WEGOVY have not been established in pediatric patients:

To reduce the risk of major adverse CV events. Clinical trials for this indication are highly impracticable because of the low prevalence of the condition in pediatric patients.
To reduce excess body weight and maintain weight reduction long term in those less than 12 years of age.
For the treatment of noncirrhotic MASH.

### Semaglutide effects on cardiovascular outcomes in people with overweight or obesity (SELECT) rationale and design [^116zmsGC]. American Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Although it has been widely appreciated that obesity is a major risk factor for CVD, treatments that produce effective, durable weight loss and the impact of weight reduction in reducing cardiovascular risk have been elusive. Instead, progress in CVD risk reduction has been achieved through medications indicated for controlling lipids, hyperglycemia, blood pressure, heart failure, inflammation, and/or thrombosis. Obesity has been implicated as promoting all these issues, suggesting that sustained, effective weight loss may have independent cardiovascular benefit. GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) reduce weight, improve glycemia, decrease cardiovascular events in those with diabetes, and may have additional cardioprotective effects. The GLP-1 RA semaglutide is in phase 3 studies as a medication for obesity treatment at a dose of 2.4 mg subcutaneously (s.c.) once weekly. Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) is a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group trial testing if semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly is superior to placebo when added to standard of care for preventing major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with established CVD and overweight or obesity but without diabetes. SELECT is the first cardiovascular outcomes trial to evaluate superiority in major adverse cardiovascular events reduction for an antiobesity medication in such a population. As such, SELECT has the potential for advancing new approaches to CVD risk reduction while targeting obesity.

### Two-year effects of semaglutide in adults with overweight or obesity: the STEP 5 trial [^117Uf9Da]. Nature Medicine (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

Behavioral intervention incorporating modifications in diet and physical activity remains the foundation of treatment for overweight and obesity. However, because behavioral intervention is often not associated with clinically meaningful and sustainable weight loss, pharmacotherapy is recommended as an additional tool for long-term weight management in people with a body mass index (BMI) of at least 30 kg m –2, or at least 27 kg m –2 in those with weight-related comorbidities.

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (oral semaglutide and subcutaneous semaglutide) and for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (subcutaneous semaglutide only) –. At a dose of 2.4 mg once-weekly, subcutaneous semaglutide was approved in the United States, Europe, the United Kingdom and Canada for weight management in adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg m –2 with at least one weight-related comorbidity) or obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg m –2) –, based on results from the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity (STEP) clinical trial program. In the STEP 1 and 3 trials in participants without type 2 diabetes, average placebo-subtracted weight losses of 12.4% and 10.3%, respectively, were seen with semaglutide 2.4 mg at week 68 (refs.).

Previous studies in the STEP trial program have been limited to treatment durations of up to 68 weeks –. The 2-year STEP 5 study reported herein was conducted to evaluate the long-term effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg compared with placebo, as an adjunct to behavioral intervention, on body weight and cardiometabolic risk factors, in adults with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg m –2), or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m²) and at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes (Extended Data Fig. 1). This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial represents the longest study of the use of semaglutide for weight management to date. Co-primary endpoints were percentage change in body weight from baseline to week 104 and achievement of weight loss of at least 5% of baseline weight at week 104.

### Cardiovascular outcomes of semaglutide and tirzepatide for patients with type 2 diabetes in clinical practice [^1119EMbE]. Nature Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Cardiovascular outcome trials of the incretin-based medicines tirzepatide and semaglutide have shown benefits in populations with varying levels of cardiovascular risk. However, without direct head-to-head comparisons, treatment decisions rely on indirect evidence from heterogeneous trial populations, leaving optimal treatment choices uncertain. We therefore conducted five cohort studies to assess the effectiveness of tirzepatide and semaglutide in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, enrolled in insurance programs in United States between 2018 and 2025. First, we emulated two cardiovascular outcome trials, SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide versus sitagliptin as placebo proxy) and SURPASS-CVOT (tirzepatide versus dulaglutide), to benchmark and critically evaluate our design, data, and analytic framework. Second, we assessed each drug in expanded populations reflective of patients routinely seen in clinical practice. Third, we directly compared tirzepatide versus semaglutide. Baseline confounders were balanced using propensity score matching. For the primary composite end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or all-cause mortality, benchmarking identified high agreement between the reference trials and their emulations for all individual end points except for all-cause mortality in SUSTAIN-6, informing subsequent analyses. In expanded populations, comparing semaglutide versus sitagliptin for the composite outcome of myocardial infarction or stroke yielded a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.91), and comparing tirzepatide versus dulaglutide for the composite outcome including mortality yielded a hazard ratio of 0.87 (0.75 to 1.01). In the head-to-head comparison of tirzepatide versus semaglutide, the hazard ratio was 1.06 (0.95 to 1.18). These findings support a comparable cardiovascular benefit of tirzepatide and semaglutide in clinical practice and demonstrate how rigorously designed real-world evidence can complement randomized clinical trials.

### Semaglutide improves cardiometabolic risk factors in adults with overweight or obesity: STEP 1 and 4 exploratory analyses [^112Qb9mT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

In patients with T2D at high CV risk, two trials designed to assess non‐inferiority have shown that semaglutide (once‐weekly 1.0 mg s.c. and once‐daily 14 mg orally) reduced the rate of major adverse CV events (MACE; composite primary endpoint) compared with placebo. As many individuals with obesity do not have T2D and obesity is associated with CVD, it is important to determine the CV effects of pharmacotherapies that promote weight loss in people without T2D.

The STEP 1 and 4 trials enrolled people with overweight/obesity without T2D and showed that semaglutide reduced body weight compared with placebo (estimated treatment differences of −12.4 percentage points from baseline to week 68 in STEP 1 and −14.8 percentage points from week 20 to week 68 in STEP 4 [p < .001 for both trials]). In addition, semaglutide treatment was associated with greater improvements in some cardiometabolic parameters. The current analyses use data from STEP 1 and 4 to investigate further the effect of semaglutide on cardiometabolic risk factors in people with overweight/obesity without T2D, beyond the previously published observations. STEP 1 was included to assess the effect of semaglutide when combined with lifestyle intervention and STEP 4 was included to assess the effect of continued use versus withdrawal of semaglutide under similar conditions. The objectives of the analyses were to evaluate: (a) if semaglutide improved cardiometabolic risk factors, overall and by degree of weight loss; (b) if continuous therapy with semaglutide was required to sustain any observed benefits; and (c) the effect of semaglutide on atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk and use of concomitant medications for CV risk factors.

### Semaglutide versus placebo in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction: a pooled analysis of the SELECT, FLOW, STEP-HFpEF, and STEP-HFpEF DM randomised trials [^113ZX6zQ]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Heart failure with mildly reduced or preserved ejection fraction (hereafter referred to as HFpEF) is the most common type of heart failure and is associated with a high risk of hospitalisation and death, especially in patients with overweight, obesity, or type 2 diabetes. In the STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpEF DM trials, semaglutide improved heart failure-related symptoms and physical limitations in participants with HFpEF. Whether semaglutide also reduces clinical heart failure events in this group remains to be established.

Methods

We conducted a post-hoc pooled, participant-level analysis of four randomised, placebo-controlled trials (SELECT, FLOW, STEP-HFpEF, and STEP-HFpEF DM) to examine the effects of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (2.4 mg in SELECT, STEP-HFpEF, and STEP-HFpEF DM; 1.0 mg in FLOW) on heart failure events. The STEP-HFpEF and STEP-HFpF DM trials enrolled participants with obesity-related HFpEF, the SELECT trial enrolled participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and overweight or obesity, and the FLOW trial enrolled participants with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Hence, for this analysis, we include all participants from the STEP-HFpEF trials and those with an investigator-reported history of HFpEF from SELECT and FLOW. The main outcomes for this analysis were the composite endpoint of time to cardiovascular death or first worsening heart failure event (defined as hospitalisation or urgent visit due to heart failure), time to first worsening heart failure event, and time to cardiovascular death. Efficacy and safety endpoints were analysed with the full analysis set (ie, all participants randomly assigned to treatment, according to the intention-to-treat principle). The SELECT, FLOW, STEP-HFpEF, and STEP-HFpEF DM trials are registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03574597, NCT03819153, NCT04788511, and NCT04916470, respectively, and all are complete.

Findings

Across the four trials, 3743 (16.8%) of 22282 participants had a history of HFpEF (1914 assigned to semaglutide and 1829 assigned to placebo). In this group of participants with HFpEF, semaglutide reduced the risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or heart failure events (103 [5.4%] of 1914 in the semaglutide group had events vs 138 [7.5%] of 1829 in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0.69 [95% CI 0.53–0.89]; p = 0.0045). Semaglutide also reduced the risk of worsening heart failure events (54 [2.8%] vs 86 [4.7%]; HR 0.59 [0.41–0.82]; p = 0.0019). No significant effect on cardiovascular death alone was seen (59 [3.1%] vs 67 [3.7%]; HR 0.82 [0.57–1.16]; p = 0.25). A lower proportion of patients treated with semaglutide had serious adverse events than did those who were treated with placebo (572 [29.9%] vs 708 [38.7%]).

Interpretation

In patients with HFpEF, semaglutide reduced the risk of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death or worsening heart failure events, and worsening heart failure events alone, whereas its effect on cardiovascular death alone was not significant. These data support the use of semaglutide as an efficacious therapy to reduce the risk of clinical heart failure events in patients with HFpEF, for whom few treatment options are currently available.

### A population-adjusted indirect comparison of cardiovascular benefits of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide and dulaglutide in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without established cardiovascular disease [^111jAXT4]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular (CV) effects of once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c.) semaglutide 0.5 and 1 mg and dulaglutide 1.5 mg are reported in their respective placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs), SUSTAIN 6 and REWIND. There is no head-to-head CVOT comparing these treatments and heterogeneity between their CVOTs renders conventional indirect comparison inappropriate. Therefore, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to compare the effects of s.c. semaglutide and dulaglutide on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with and without established cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods

Individual patient data from SUSTAIN 6 were matched with aggregate data from REWIND, using a propensity score method to balance baseline effect-modifying patient characteristics. Hazard ratios (HRs) for three-point (3P) MACE (CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke), anchored via placebo, were then indirectly compared between balanced populations. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the main analysis.

Results

After matching, included effect modifiers were balanced. In the main analysis, s.c. semaglutide was associated with a statistically significant 35% reduction in 3P MACE versus placebo (HR, 0.65 [95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.48, 0.87]) and nonsignificantly greater reduction (26%) versus dulaglutide (HR, 0.74 [95% CI; 0.54, 1.01]). Results were supported by all sensitivity analyses.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated a statistically significant lower risk of 3P MACE for s.c. semaglutide versus placebo, in a population with lower prevalence of pre-existing CVD than that in the pre-specified primary analysis in SUSTAIN 6. Reduction in 3P MACE with s.c. semaglutide was greater than with dulaglutide, although not statistically significant.

### Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with obesity and prevalent heart failure: a prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial [^115MnZZU]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Background

Semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in people with overweight or obesity, but the effects of this drug on outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and heart failure are unknown. We report a prespecified analysis of the effect of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg on ischaemic and heart failure cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed to investigate if semaglutide was beneficial in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a history of heart failure compared with placebo; if there was a difference in outcome in patients designated as having heart failure with preserved ejection fraction compared with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; and if the efficacy and safety of semaglutide in patients with heart failure was related to baseline characteristics or subtype of heart failure.

Methods

The SELECT trial was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, placebo-controlled, event-driven phase 3 trial in 41 countries. Adults aged 45 years and older, with a BMI of 27 kg/m 2 or greater and established cardiovascular disease were eligible for the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a block size of four using an interactive web response system in a double-blind manner to escalating doses of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide over 16 weeks to a target dose of 2.4 mg, or placebo. In a prespecified analysis, we examined the effect of semaglutide compared with placebo in patients with and without a history of heart failure at enrolment, subclassified as heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, or unclassified heart failure. Endpoints comprised MACE (a composite of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and cardiovascular death); a composite heart failure outcome (cardiovascular death or hospitalisation or urgent hospital visit for heart failure); cardiovascular death; and all-cause death. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03574597.

Findings

Between Oct 31, 2018, and March 31, 2021, 17604 patients with a mean age of 61.6 years (SD 8.9) and a mean BMI of 33.4 kg/m 2 (5.0) were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide (8803 [50.0%] patients) or placebo (8801 [50.0%] patients). 4286 (24.3%) of 17604 patients had a history of investigator-defined heart failure at enrolment: 2273 (53.0%) of 4286 patients had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, 1347 (31.4%) had heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, and 666 (15.5%) had unclassified heart failure. Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with and without heart failure. Patients with heart failure had a higher incidence of clinical events. Semaglutide improved all outcome measures in patients with heart failure at random assignment compared with those without heart failure (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72, 95% CI 0.60–0.87 for MACE; 0.79, 0.64–0.98 for the heart failure composite endpoint; 0.76, 0.59–0.97 for cardiovascular death; and 0.81, 0.66–1.00 for all-cause death; all p interaction > 0.19). Treatment with semaglutide resulted in improved outcomes in both the heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49–0.87 for MACE; 0.79, 0.58–1.08 for the composite heart failure endpoint) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction groups (0.69, 0.51–0.91 for MACE; 0.75, 0.52–1.07 for the composite heart failure endpoint), although patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction had higher absolute event rates than those with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. For MACE and the heart failure composite, there were no significant differences in benefits across baseline age, sex, BMI, New York Heart Association status, and diuretic use. Serious adverse events were less frequent with semaglutide versus placebo, regardless of heart failure subtype.

Interpretation

In patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular diease and overweight or obesity, treatment with semaglutide 2.4 mg reduced MACE and composite heart failure endpoints compared with placebo in those with and without clinical heart failure, regardless of heart failure subtype. Our findings could facilitate prescribing and result in improved clinical outcomes for this patient group.

### Forecasting trial milestones: a predictive analysis for early termination of the SOUL study [^115bcizd]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Oral semaglutide, the first and only orally available GLP1RA, is considered a major scientific breakthrough because of its unique mechanism and mode of action. Naturally, the oral route makes it more attractive than its parenteral counterparts. The PIONEER trial program has studied the effects of oral semaglutide in patients with T2D in detail. PIONEER 6 was conducted on 3183 patients and followed up for 69 weeks to assess the cardiovascular outcomes of once daily oral semaglutide in an event-driven, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving patients at high cardiovascular risk (aged ≥ 50 years with established cardiovascular or chronic kidney disease or aged ≥ 60 years with cardiovascular risk factors only) and revealed that oral semaglutide was safe in patients with T2D.

However, proof of its positive effect on cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with T2D remains elusive. The SOUL trial aims to provide this evidence.

In anticipation of this publication, a mathematical model was developed, and the results of the SOUL trial are predicted by this study. The search was conducted using the PICO search strategy.

P = Type 2 diabetes patients with high cardiovascular risk.

I = Semaglutide.

C = Placebo.

O = Reduction in composite CV events (MACE) and their individual components. In addition, a prediction analysis will be performed to predict the effective duration and outcome benefits in the ongoing SOUL study, aiming to suggest a means of reducing the cost of studies being designed for the future.

### Semaglutide for cardiovascular event reduction in people with overweight or obesity: SELECT study baseline characteristics [^114UUUnJ]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg, a once‐weekly administered long‐acting glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1RA), was first approved for chronic weight management in June 2021 in the United States and since then in several other countries. Semaglutide has been shown to lower body weight by up to 16% when used in conjunction with lifestyle recommendations. GLP‐1RAs such as semaglutide exert direct effects at multiple sites, including glucose‐dependent stimulation of insulin secretion, suppression of glucagon secretion, decrease of appetite through central effects on satiety signals, and delayed gastric emptying, while also being postulated to have direct CV effects. GLP‐1RAs, including semaglutide, improve many known CV risk factors such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, blood pressure, dyslipidemia, body weight, waist circumference, fatty liver, and inflammatory markers. In line with this, subcutaneous semaglutide 0.5 and 1.0 mg once weekly, like other GLP‐1RAs, has been shown to reduce major adverse CV events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes and high CV risk. Although the definitive mechanism(s) responsible for the CV event reduction with GLP‐1RAs in the type 2 diabetes population remains unknown, based on the available data, it is reasonable to hypothesize that CV benefits might also be observed in those without type 2 diabetes.

The SELECT trial was designed to evaluate the effect of a once‐weekly subcutaneously administered dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide on CV outcomes compared with placebo in people without diabetes but who were living with overweight or obesity and who suffered from a prior stroke and/or myocardial infarction (MI) and/or peripheral artery disease (PAD). SELECT is one of the largest interventional studies in individuals with overweight or obesity and is the only CV outcome trial (CVOT) to date designed to evaluate the superiority of a weight‐lowering agent on 3‐point MACE.

Here, we present the baseline demographic and biomedical characteristics of participants enrolled in SELECT. We evaluate the SELECT population according to three prespecified categories: baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c), tertiles of waist to height ratio, and type of prior CV event (MI, stroke, or PAD).

Semaglutide cardiovascular outcomes programs — across type 2 diabetes and overweight/obesity — include a placebo-controlled trial evaluating oral semaglutide on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; prior PIONEER 6 showed oral semaglutide was not inferior to placebo regarding cardiovascular disease risk; SUSTAIN-6 demonstrated once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (0.5 or 1.0 mg) reduced cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke compared to placebo; the SELECT trial is a placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial of semaglutide 2.4 mg subcutaneously once weekly in patients with overweight or obesity and cardiovascular disease but without diabetes mellitus; and, in addition to SELECT, two other ongoing trials are evaluating heart failure with preserved ejection fraction in patients with obesity with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus.

### Effects of semaglutide on risk of cardiovascular events across a continuum of cardiovascular risk: combined post hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials [^115kK7mr]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) available in subcutaneous (s.c.) and oral formulations. Two cardiovascular (CV) outcomes trials showed that in subjects with T2D at high risk of CV events there were fewer major adverse CV events (MACE; defined as CV death, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction) with semaglutide than with placebo (hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.74 [0.58;0.95] for once-weekly s.c. semaglutide and 0.79 [0.57;1.11] for once-daily oral semaglutide). However, there is little evidence for an effect of semaglutide on MACE in subjects not at high risk of CV events. This post hoc analysis examined CV effects of semaglutide in subjects across a continuum of baseline CV risk.

Methods

Data from the s.c. (SUSTAIN) and oral (PIONEER) semaglutide phase 3a clinical trial programs were combined according to randomized treatment (semaglutide or comparators) and analyzed to assess time to first MACE and its individual components. A CV risk model was developed with independent data from the LEADER trial (liraglutide vs placebo), considering baseline variables common to all datasets. Semaglutide data were analyzed to assess effects of treatment as a function of CV risk predicted using the CV risk prediction model.

Results

The CV risk prediction model performed satisfactorily when applied to the semaglutide data set (area under the curve: 0.77). There was a reduced relative and absolute risk of MACE for semaglutide vs comparators across the entire continuum of CV risk. While the relative risk reduction tended to be largest with low CV risk score, the largest absolute risk reduction was for intermediate to high CV risk score. Similar results were seen for relative risk reduction of the individual MACE components and also when only placebo comparator data were included.

Conclusion

Semaglutide reduced the risk of MACE vs comparators across the continuum of baseline CV risk in a broad T2D population.

### Semaglutide for cardiovascular event reduction in people with overweight or obesity: SELECT study baseline characteristics [^111tX96f]. Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

This paper describes the baseline characteristics of the Semaglutide Effects on Heart Disease and Stroke in Patients with Overweight or Obesity (SELECT) study, one of the largest cardiovascular (CV) outcome studies in the field of obesity, which evaluates the effect of semaglutide versus placebo on major CV events.

Methods

SELECT enrolled individuals with overweight or obesity without diabetes, with prior myocardial infarction, stroke, and/or peripheral artery disease. This study reports participants' baseline characteristics in the full study population and subgroups defined by baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1c; < 5.7%, ≥ 5.7 to < 6.0%, ≥ 6.0 to < 6.5%), baseline waist to height ratio tertile, and qualifying prior CV event or condition.

Results

The study enrolled 17,605 participants (72.5% male) with an average (SD) age of 61.6 (8.9) years and BMI of 33.34 (5.04) kg/m 2. The most common prior CV event was myocardial infarction (76.3% of participants), followed by stroke (23.3%) and peripheral artery disease (8.6%). Furthermore, 24.3% had a heart failure diagnosis. Two‐thirds of participants (66%) had HbA 1c in the prediabetes range (5.7%‐6.4%). Across groups of increasing HbA 1c, prevalence of all CV risk factors increased.

Conclusions

The enrolled population in SELECT includes participants across a broad range of relevant risk categories. This will allow the study to garner information about the CV benefits of semaglutide across these relevant clinical subgroups.

### Semaglutide: charting new horizons in GLP-1 analogue outcome studies [^112SUSYA]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

The growing epidemic of obesity and diabetes represents a growing health emergency, exemplified by a marked increase in cardiovascular and renal disease. As such, healthcare systems are increasingly focussing on therapeutic approaches to address these challenges. Cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) evaluating glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues have previously observed significant improvements in major adverse cardiac events in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, their impact in obese people without T2D is unknown. The SELECT study is the first pharmacotherapy study in obesity powered for cardiovascular superiority and investigates the impact of semaglutide on cardiovascular disease outcomes in overweight and obese people without T2D. The results of this study will potentially redefine obesity management, especially as secondary outcomes of the study will include evaluation of health-related quality of life and incident diabetes rates. In another potentially evolutionary therapeutic step for the incretin class of therapeutic agents, the FLOW study is the first dedicated study to investigate the effects of GLP-1 receptor analogues on renal and cardiovascular outcomes in people with renal impairment and T2D. Post-hoc analyses of GLP-1 analogue CVOTs have demonstrated reduced adverse renal outcomes associated with their use. In this review we discuss the known impact of GLP-1 analogues on cardiovascular, weight and renal outcomes in previous CVOTs. We further discuss the importance of the ongoing SELECT and FLOW studies on shifting the paradigm of obesity pharmacotherapy and in adding to our understanding of renal disease management in people with T2D.
