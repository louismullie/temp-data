## Question

Ascites albumin 2.5 interpretation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret an ascitic fluid albumin of 2.5 g/dL and what to do next in the diagnostic workup and management of ascites. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about unit confirmation and which parameter 2.5 g/dL represents. Then, I should verify whether we are dealing with total protein or albumin and what that means diagnostically. Next, I will review the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) framework to classify portal hypertensive versus non-portal etiologies. After that, I need to check how an ascitic albumin of 2.5 g/dL influences the SAAG interpretation and whether we have enough data. Then, I should outline immediate next steps, including which additional ascitic tests are needed. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, SBP risk stratification, and albumin replacement during paracentesis so I do not miss actionable management implications.

> Let me first confirm the unit and the parameter, because 2.5 g/dL is a commonly cited cut-point for ascitic total protein, whereas ascitic albumin itself is usually lower than that in portal hypertensive states. I need to ensure whether the reported 2.5 g/dL refers to total protein or albumin, since guidelines emphasize measuring both ascitic total protein and albumin with a simultaneous serum albumin to compute the SAAG for etiologic classification of ascites [^111Yborx] [^1135CgdZ] [^114SRKgZ].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic implications if 2.5 g/dL is total protein: in the SAAG algorithm, when SAAG is high (≥ 1.1 g/dL), an ascitic total protein ≥ 2.5 g/dL suggests a postsinusoidal process such as cardiac ascites or hepatic outflow obstruction, whereas ascitic total protein < 2.5 g/dL supports cirrhosis or presinusoidal portal hypertension. If SAAG is low (< 1.1 g/dL), non-portal etiologies like peritoneal carcinomatosis, tuberculous peritonitis, or nephrotic syndrome are more likely, so the total protein threshold of 2.5 g/dL refines the differential when combined with SAAG [^113wbQMh] [^112yVLNf] [^111KuzhC].

> Hold on, I should verify the scenario if 2.5 g/dL is the ascitic albumin concentration: an ascitic albumin of 2.5 g/dL is actually high for portal hypertensive ascites, which typically shows markedly low ascitic albumin due to "wash-down" of interstitial protein as sinusoidal pressure rises. This pattern would therefore raise suspicion for non-portal etiologies or mixed processes and would only make sense diagnostically once I can subtract it from a simultaneous serum albumin to compute the SAAG and then consider malignancy, infection, or other peritoneal disease if SAAG is low [^115fWxjW] [^113wbQMh] [^111Yborx].

> I need to check whether we have the SAAG in hand, because the interpretation hinges on it. If the SAAG is ≥ 1.1 g/dL, that supports portal hypertension (cirrhosis, heart failure, massive liver metastases, or sinusoidal obstruction), whereas if SAAG is < 1.1 g/dL, that argues against portal hypertension and should prompt evaluation for malignancy, infection, or other peritoneal disease. In cirrhotic patients, a low SAAG has modest diagnostic yield and can occasionally be lab variation, so repeating the paracentesis to recalculate SAAG is reasonable when the clinical picture conflicts with the gradient result [^113wbQMh] [^116xfWdo].

> Next, I should review the immediate next steps: I should confirm simultaneous serum albumin, measure ascitic total protein and cell count with differential, obtain cultures with bedside inoculation, and add targeted tests based on suspicion such as triglycerides for chylous ascites, amylase for pancreatic ascites, adenosine deaminase for TB, cytology for malignancy, and consider BNP or echocardiography if cardiac ascites is suspected. I also need to assess SBP risk, because ascitic total protein < 1.5 g/dL is a recognized risk factor for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and influences prophylaxis decisions [^111Yborx] [^1135CgdZ] [^111KuzhC] [^116pba1m].

> Let me consider the practical interpretation of an ascitic albumin of 2.5 g/dL more explicitly: in portal hypertensive ascites, the ascitic albumin is usually far lower than 2.5 g/dL, so seeing 2.5 g/dL pushes me to reconsider non-portal causes or mixed processes. However, I should not jump to conclusions until I compute the SAAG and align it with the total protein, because the combination of SAAG and total protein together steers the etiologic workup and avoids misclassification [^115fWxjW] [^113wbQMh] [^112yVLNf].

> But wait, what if this patient is cirrhotic and we are planning paracentesis? I should double-check albumin replacement guidance: for large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), guidelines recommend infusing 20–25% albumin at 6–8 g per liter removed, and for smaller volumes, consider albumin if there is hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities. Importantly, in acute-on-chronic liver failure or high-risk settings, albumin is reasonable even after smaller volume taps to mitigate post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction and renal injury, and repeated low-volume paracenteses without albumin can still lead to complications when daily drainage exceeds about 1.5 L [^112mecDQ] [^115UnBvH] [^116E9y4b] [^112h8B6T] [^115c255x].

> I should also confirm that an ascitic albumin of 2.5 g/dL does not, by itself, change SBP risk or the neutrophil threshold. SBP is diagnosed with an ascitic neutrophil count ≥ 250 cells/mm³, and risk stratification for prophylaxis is based on ascitic total protein rather than albumin, with total protein < 1.5 g/dL indicating higher risk and informing primary prophylaxis discussions in the right clinical context [^116xctRG] [^111KuzhC] [^115o9h96].

> Let me summarize to ensure nothing is missing: I first confirmed units and that 2.5 g/dL commonly refers to total protein but could be albumin. If total protein, it helps refine the SAAG-based differential toward cardiac or postsinusoidal processes when SAAG is high, or remains nonspecific when SAAG is low. If albumin, it is unusually high for portal hypertensive ascites and should prompt me to compute SAAG and reassess for non-portal etiologies. In all cases, I need simultaneous serum albumin, ascitic total protein, cell count with differential, and cultures, then layer targeted tests and consider albumin replacement during paracentesis based on volume removed and patient risk, so I do not misattribute the cause or miss preventable complications [^113wbQMh] [^111Yborx] [^112mecDQ] [^116E9y4b].

An ascitic albumin of 2.5 g/dL is **intermediate-low** and must be interpreted with the **SAAG** [^113wbQMh] and total protein [^113Brfv2]. If SAAG is ≥ 1.1 g/dL, portal hypertension is likely (cirrhosis, heart failure, or Budd-Chiari) [^1137WuCd]; if SAAG is < 1.1 g/dL, consider peritoneal disease (malignancy, TB, pancreatitis) [^1137WuCd]. Total protein helps distinguish cardiac ascites (often > 2.5 g/dL) from cirrhotic ascites (usually < 2.5 g/dL) [^112yVLNf]. Always **interpret 2.5 g/dL in clinical context**, including serum albumin, total protein, cell count, and culture, to guide diagnosis and management [^114F94Xv].

---

## Physiological basis of ascitic albumin concentration

Ascitic albumin reflects **balance between hepatic lymph protein** and intestinal capillary filtration. In portal hypertension, sinusoidal pressure rises and intestinal capillary filtration increases, diluting protein and lowering ascitic albumin; this underlies the diagnostic utility of SAAG [^113wbQMh]. Low ascitic albumin with high SAAG indicates portal hypertension; higher ascitic albumin with low SAAG suggests peritoneal disease [^112yVLNf].

---

## Clinical significance of ascitic albumin concentration

Ascitic albumin helps distinguish portal hypertensive ascites from peritoneal disease; however, a single value of 2.5 g/dL is **not diagnostic** and must be interpreted with SAAG and total protein [^113wbQMh] [^111KuzhC].

---

## Interpretation of ascitic albumin concentration 2.5 g/dL

An ascitic albumin of 2.5 g/dL is **intermediate-low**. Interpretation depends on SAAG and total protein:

| **Saag** | **Total protein** | **Likely etiology** | **Clinical interpretation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| ≥ 1.1 g/dL | < 2.5 g/dL | Portal hypertension (cirrhosis) | High SAAG, low protein ascites typical of cirrhosis [^112yVLNf] [^111KuzhC] |
| ≥ 1.1 g/dL | > 2.5 g/dL | Cardiac ascites (HF, Budd-Chiari) | High SAAG, high protein ascites from postsinusoidal hypertension [^111KuzhC] [^112yVLNf] |
| < 1.1 g/dL | Variable | Peritoneal disease (malignancy, TB, pancreatitis) | Low SAAG indicates non-portal etiologies [^113wbQMh] [^112yVLNf] |

---

Thus, 2.5 g/dL alone **does not distinguish** cirrhosis from cardiac or peritoneal causes; it must be interpreted with SAAG and total protein [^113wbQMh] [^113Brfv2].

---

## Clinical implications and management considerations

### Portal hypertension-related ascites

If SAAG is ≥ 1.1 g/dL, portal hypertension is likely; **management** includes:

- **Sodium restriction**: 5–6.5 g/day [^115o9h96].
- **Diuretics**: spironolactone ± furosemide [^115o9h96].
- **Large-volume paracentesis**: with albumin if > 5 L removed [^116E9y4b].
- **SBP prophylaxis**: if ascitic protein < 1.5 g/dL [^115o9h96].

---

### Non-portal hypertension-related ascites

If SAAG is < 1.1 g/dL, evaluate for peritoneal disease; **management** includes:

- **Cytology**: for malignancy [^113Uq3Zz].
- **ADA and mycobacterial studies**: for TB [^112yVLNf].
- **Amylase**: for pancreatic ascites [^1137WuCd].
- **Targeted therapy**: based on etiology [^117WEX5C].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Interpretation can be limited by **sample handling**, comorbidities, and variability. Ensure proper collection and processing, and interpret results in the clinical context [^114Qadwe].

---

## Summary and recommendations

An ascitic albumin of 2.5 g/dL is **intermediate-low** and not diagnostic by itself. Interpret with **SAAG and total protein** to distinguish portal hypertensive from peritoneal ascites, and tailor management accordingly [^113wbQMh] [^111KuzhC]. Always correlate with clinical context and other tests to guide diagnosis and therapy [^115HHZ9u].

### Albumin administration – what is the evidence of clinical benefit? A systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^114EEu27]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

The advantages of albumin over less costly alternative fluids continue to be debated. Meta-analyses focusing on survival have been inconclusive, and other clinically relevant end-points have not been systematically addressed. We sought to determine whether albumin confers significant clinical benefit in acute illness compared with other fluid regimens.

Methods

Database searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) and other methods were used to identify randomized controlled trials comparing albumin with crystalloid, artificial colloid, no albumin or lower-dose albumin. Major findings for all end-points were extracted and summarized. A quantitative meta-analysis was not attempted.

Results

Seventy-nine randomized trials with a total of 4755 patients were included. No significant treatment effects were detectable in 20/79 (25%) trials. In cardiac surgery, albumin administration resulted in lower fluid requirements, higher colloid oncotic pressure, reduced pulmonary oedema with respiratory impairment and greater haemodilution compared with crystalloid and hydroxyethylstarch increased postoperative bleeding. In non-cardiac surgery, fluid requirements, and pulmonary and intestinal oedema were decreased by albumin compared with crystalloid. In hypoalbuminaemia, higher doses of albumin reduced morbidity. In ascites, albumin reduced haemodynamic derangements, morbidity and length of stay and improved survival after spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In sepsis, albumin decreased pulmonary oedema and respiratory dysfunction compared with crystalloid, while hydroxyethylstarch induced abnormalities of haemostasis. Complications were lowered by albumin compared with crystalloid in burn patients. Albumin-containing therapeutic regimens improved outcomes after brain injury.

Conclusions

Albumin can bestow benefit in diverse clinical settings. Further trials are warranted to delineate optimal fluid regimens, in particular indications.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of ascites, volume overload, and hyponatremia in cirrhosis: expert review [^1111AaRS]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Description

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update (CPU) is to summarize the available evidence and offer expert Best Practice Advice (BPA) on the management of ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, and hyponatremia in patients with cirrhosis.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board and Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. This CPU expert review underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through the standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These BPA statements were developed based on review of the published literature and expert opinion and approved by the AGA Institute Governing Board. Because formal systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Patients with cirrhosis with ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, or volume overload should be managed with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics at the lowest effective dose, with dose escalation guided by symptoms, weight, urine output, and electrolyte/renal monitoring. Education and referral to a dietitian should be provided for dietary management. Triggers of liver decompensation should be identified and addressed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with new-onset ascites, or those admitted to the hospital for symptoms related to ascites or encephalopathy should receive diagnostic paracentesis as soon as possible. Testing should include serum ascites albumin gradient and cell count, Gram stain, and culture. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with hepatic hydrothorax with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia should undergo a therapeutic thoracentesis for both symptom relief and expansion of the underlying lung. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All patients with refractory ascites and/or hepatic hydrothorax should be considered for liver transplantation evaluation, regardless of their Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Refractory ascites and/or hydrothorax should be managed with therapeutic paracentesis and/or thoracentesis, respectively, with the frequency guided by recurrence. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: When the volume of ascites removed is > 5 L, 20%-25% intravenous albumin 6–8 g per every total liter removed should be administered. For patients with hypotension, renal insufficiency, or electrolyte abnormalities, albumin should also be considered for removal of smaller volumes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Well-selected patients with refractory ascites, hepatic hydrothorax, volume overload, or hyponatremia should be referred for to transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Diagnostic workup for the etiology of hyponatremia in cirrhosis should include dietary and medication history (diuretics, bowel regimen); review of electrolyte and kidney function; gastrointestinal bleeding assessment; infectious workup, including diagnostic paracentesis, and evaluation of secondary causes (thyroid or adrenal dysfunction). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Outpatient management of asymptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis entails both sodium and water restriction (aiming for 1–1.5 L of daily fluid intake), modification of diuretics and laxatives, and monitoring of electrolytes. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Inpatient management of severe or symptomatic hypervolemic hyponatremia in liver cirrhosis includes both sodium and water restriction; modification or discontinuation of diuretics and laxatives; and additional measures, such as intravenous albumin based on volume assessment or oral vasoconstriction therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Recurrent or refractory hyponatremia management should involve a multidisciplinary approach (including the liver transplantation team when appropriate) and can consider several therapeutic options, including intravenous vasoconstrictor therapy, infusion of hypertonic saline, use of vasopressin receptor antagonist (vaptans), or use of renal replacement therapy. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: Inpatient management of volume overload includes escalation or trial of intravenous loop diuretics (furosemide or bumetanide) in bolus (2–3 times per day) or continuous fashion. Cautious escalation can be done every 2–3 days with monitoring of volume status, kidney function, daily weights, and symptoms. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Advanced strategies in refractory anasarca should be coordinated with nephrology for consideration of diuretics in the setting of contraction alkalosis (eg, addition of acetazolamide), second agent with alternate mechanism of actions (eg, thiazide diuretics, such as metolazone), or need for ultrafiltration.

Pediatric refractory ascites — albumin–furosemide use, paracentesis flow-rate signal, and albumin replacement dosing: In children with "grade 3 and RA", "IV infusion of 25% albumin when combined with 0.5–1.0 mg/kg furosemide has been used to improve the mobilization of ascites when serum albumin is low (e.g., < 2.5 g/dL)". In an observational cohort, among those not receiving albumin, flow rates were higher in those who developed PPCD "(n = 10, 1,224 ± 476 mL/hour) compared with those who did not (n = 5, 678 ± 214 mL/hour)", but the discriminatory ability was limited as "the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve… was only 0.6". For large-volume paracentesis support, "Children undergoing LVP are generally given 25% albumin infusion of 0.5–1.0 g/kg, or 6–8 g per liter of ascites removed".

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and management of ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome: 2021 practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^115HHZ9u]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Ascites — initial evaluation includes abdominal ultrasonography with Doppler, complete blood count, liver function tests (INR, serum total bilirubin, serum albumin), renal function tests (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen), serum and urine electrolytes (Na, K) and urine analysis with spot urine protein, and ascitic fluid analysis with serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG), total protein concentration, polymorphonuclear leukocyte count, and culture. For ascitic fluid interpretation, a serum albumin ascites gradient < 1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites, while a high ascitic fluid protein (> 2.5 g/dL) supports a cardiac source for ascites; other tests of the ascitic fluid, such as amylase, cytology, or culture for mycobacteria, are not routinely indicated but should be guided by the patient's clinical context.

Evidence Summary

We identified a 2019 Cochrane systematic review including 27 RCTs (N = 1,592) examining the use of any plasma volume expanders in patients with cirrhosis undergoing paracentesis. In general, enrolled patients were undergoing large-volume paracentesis (> 5 L), and the most commonly used albumin doses were either 6 to 8 g of albumin per 1 L of fluid removed or a standard dose of 20 to 40 g. Compared with no plasma expander, no statistically significant effect of using hyperoncotic (20%-25%) albumin on mortality (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.06–4.83), kidney impairment (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.02–5.88), or recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.49–3.42) was found. Compared with hyperoncotic albumin, use of other fluids showed uncertain effects on mortality (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.82–1.30), kidney impairment (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.71–1.91), and recurrence of ascites (RR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.96–1.36). Paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction was more frequent with nonalbumin plasma expanders (RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.31–2.99) compared with albumin. A 2020 systematic review focused on the impact of different therapies (albumin, other fluids, vasoactive drugs) on the rate of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction and identified nine RCTs (N = 620). Albumin at a dose of 8 g/L was found to be superior to other volume expanders for the prevention of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (rise in plasma renin activity by ≥ 50% of baseline). Similar to the Cochrane review, uncertainty regarding the role of albumin as compared with alternative treatments was noted for the prevention of complications after paracentesis. RCTs comparing high-dose albumin (6–8 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L of ascitic fluid removed) found no difference in the rate of paracentesis associated circulatory dysfunction, although uncertainty exists regarding the risk to benefit profile of the two doses, given the small sample size (two studies [N = 120]; RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.22–4.49).

### Does this patient have bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension? How do I perform a paracentesis and analyze the results? [^114Qadwe]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

Abdominal paracenteses are performed in patients with ascites, most commonly to assess for infection or portal hypertension and to manage refractory ascites.

Objectives

To systematically review evidence for paracentesis methods that may decrease risk of adverse events or improve diagnostic yield and to determine the accuracy of ascitic fluid analysis for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Sources

Relevant English-language studies from Medline (1966-April 2007) and EMBASE (1980-April 2007).

Study Selection

Paracentesis studies evaluating interventions (use of preprocedure coagulation parameters, needle type, insertion location, ultrasound guidance, bedside inoculation into blood culture bottles, and use of plasma expanders in therapeutic taps) for reducing adverse events or improving the diagnostic yield, and studies assessing the accuracy of ascitic fluid biochemical analyses for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or portal hypertension.

Data Extraction

For technique studies, data on intervention and outcome; and for diagnostic studies, data on parameters for diagnosing spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and portal hypertension (ie, ascitic fluid white blood cell and polymorphonuclear leukocyte [PMN] count, ascitic fluid pH, blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient, and serum-ascites albumin gradient).

Data Synthesis

Thirty-seven studies met inclusion criteria: 2 showed that obtaining preprocedure coagulation was likely unnecessary prior to paracentesis; 1 showed the 15-gauge, 3.25-inch needle-cannula results in less multiple peritoneal punctures [P = .05] and termination due to poor fluid return [P = .02] vs a 14-gauge needle in therapeutic paracentesis; 1 showed immediate inoculation of culture bottles improves diagnostic yield vs delayed (from 77% to 100% [95% CI for the difference, 5.3%-40.0%]); 9 evaluated therapeutic paracentesis, performed with or without albumin or nonalbumin plasma expanders, and found no consistent effect on morbidity or mortality; 16 showed the accuracy of biochemical analysis of ascitic fluid in patients suspected of having spontaneous bacterial peritonitis to increase the likelihood of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (PMN count > 250 cells/microL [summary likelihood ratio {LR}, 6.4] 95% CI, 4.6–8.8; ascitic fluid leukocyte count > 1000 cells/microL [summary LR, 9.1] 95% CI, 5.5–15.1; pH < 7.35 [summary LR, 9.0] 95% CI, 2.0–40.6; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient ≥ 0.10 [LR, 11.3] 95% CI, 4.3–29.9) and other levels lowered the likelihood (PMN count ≤ 250 cells/microL [summary LR, 0.2] 95% CI, 0.11–0.37; or a blood-ascitic fluid pH gradient < 0.10 [summary LR, 0.12] 95% CI, 0.02–0.77); and 4 showed the diagnostic accuracy of the serum-ascites albumin gradient lowers the likelihood of portal hypertension (< 1.1 g/dL [summary LR, 0.06] 95% CI, 0.02–0.20).

Conclusions

Ascitic fluid should be inoculated into blood culture bottles at the bedside. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is more likely at predescribed parameters of ascitic PMN count or blood-ascitic fluid pH, and portal hypertension is less likely below a predescribed serum-ascites albumin gradient.

A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in patients with GI bleeding, shock, fever or other signs of systemic inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, hepatic encephalopathy, and in patients with worsening liver or renal function. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.3. Ascitic neutrophil > 250/mm 3 count remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of SBP and this can be performed either by manual microscopy or using automated counts, based on flow cytometry for counting and differentiating cells. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.4. Ascitic fluid culture with bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles should be performed to guide the choice of antibiotic treatment when SBP is suspected. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.5. Immediate empirical antibiotic therapy should be determined with due consideration of context of SBP (community acquired or healthcare associated), severity of infection and local bacterial resistance profile. Cefotaxime has been widely studied, but choice of antibiotic should be guided by local resistance patterns and protocol. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 2.6. A second diagnostic paracentesis at 48 hours from the start of treatment to check the efficacy of antibiotic therapy should be considered in those who have apparently inadequate response or where secondary bacterial peritonitis is suspected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.7. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal bleeding and underlying ascites due to cirrhosis should receive prophylactic antibiotic treatment (cefotaxime has been widely studied but the antibiotic should be chosen based on local data) to prevent the development of SBP. (Quality of evidence: strong; Recommendation: strong) 2.8. Patients who have recovered from an episode of SBP should be considered for treatment with norfloxacin (400 mg once daily), ciprofloxacin (500 mg once daily, orally) or co-trimoxazole (800 mg sulfamethoxazole and 160 mg trimethoprim daily, orally) to prevent further episode of SBP. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 2.9. Primary prophylaxis should be offered to patients considered at high risk, as defined by an ascitic protein count < 1.5 g/dL. However, it is important that the potential risks and benefits and existing uncertainties are communicated to patients. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Dietary salt restriction 3.1. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should have a moderately salt restricted diet with daily salt intake of no more than 5–6.5 g (87–113 mmol sodium). This translates to a no added salt diet with avoidance of precooked meals. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 3.2. Patients with cirrhosis and ascites should receive nutritional counselling on the sodium content in the diet. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Diuretics 4.1. In patients with the first presentation of moderate ascites, spironolactone monotherapy (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) is reasonable. In those with recurrent severe ascites, and if faster diuresis is needed (for example, if the patient is hospitalised), combination therapy with spironolactone (starting dose 100 mg, increased to 400 mg) and furosemide (starting dose 40 mg, increased to 160 mg) is recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 4.2. All patients initiating diuretics should be monitored for adverse events. Almost half of those with adverse events require diuretic discontinuation or dose reduction. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.3. Hypovolaemic hyponatraemia during diuretic therapy should be managed by discontinuation of diuretics and expansion of plasma volume with normal saline. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.4. Fluid restriction to 1–1.5 L/day should be reserved for those who are clinically hypervolaemic with severe hyponatraemia (serum sodium < 125 mmol/L). (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.5. Hypertonic sodium chloride (3%) administration should be reserved for those who are severely symptomatic with acute hyponatraemia. Serum sodium should be slowly corrected. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 4.6. It may be appropriate to consider use of midodrine in refractory ascites on a case by case basis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Large volume paracentesis (LVP) 5.1. Patients should give informed consent for a therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 5.2. Ultrasound guidance should be considered when available during LVP to reduce the risk of adverse events (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 5.3. Routine measurement of the prothrombin time and platelet count before therapeutic or diagnostic paracentesis and infusion of blood products are not recommended. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Use of human albumin solution (HAS) 6.1. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 6.2. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) can be considered after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with ACLF or high risk of post-paracentesis acute kidney injury. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak) 6.3. In patients with SBP and an increased serum creatinine or a rising serum creatinine, infusion of 1.5 g albumin/kg within 6 hours of diagnosis, followed by 1 g/kg on day 3, is recommended. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS) 7.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with refractory ascites. (Quality of evidence: high; Recommendation: strong) 7.2. Caution is required if considering TIPSS in patients with age > 70 years, serum bilirubin > 50 µmol/L, platelet count < 75×10 9 /L, model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score ≥ 18, current hepatic encephalopathy, active infection or hepatorenal syndrome. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Umbilical hernia 8.1. Suitability and timing of surgical repair of umbilical hernia should be considered in discussion with the patient and multidisciplinary team involving physicians, surgeons and anaesthetists. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Hepatic hydrothorax (HH) 9.1. TIPSS should be considered in patients with HH after discussion with the multidisciplinary team. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong) 9.2. In patients with HH who are not undergoing a TIPSS and/or a liver transplant evaluation, alternative palliative interventions should be considered. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: strong)
Non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and ascites 10.1. Refractory ascites should not be viewed as a contraindication to NSBB. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong) 10.2. Patients with refractory ascites who are taking NSBB should be monitored closely, and dose reduction or discontinuation may be appropriate in those who develop hypotension or acute/progressive renal dysfunction. (Quality of evidence: moderate; Recommendation: strong)
Automated low-flow ascites pump 11.1. An automated low-flow ascites pump should be considered only in special circumstances with robust arrangements of clinical governance, audit or research. (Quality of evidence: low; Recommendation: weak)
Palliative care 12.1. Patients with refractory ascites who are not undergoing evaluation for liver transplant should be offered a palliative care referral. Besides repeated LVP, alternative palliative interventions for refractory ascites should also be considered. (Quality of evidence: weak; Recommendation: strong)
Research recommendations 13.1. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) with large sample size should evaluate the role of antibiotics in the secondary prophylaxis for SBP in ascites secondary to cirrhosis. 13.2. Large RCTs should assess the role of midodrine in the management of ascites. 13.3. Cost-effectiveness of long-term administration of albumin to patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites should be evaluated. 13.4. Role of nutritional interventions in the management of ascites should be evaluated. 13.5. Large RCT of long-term carvedilol versus no carvedilol in patients with refractory ascites without large oesophageal varices should be carried out. 13.6. Role of TIPSS in the management of hepatic hydrothorax should be compared with other therapeutic interventions. 13.7. The cost-effectiveness and the effect of automated low-flow ascites pumps on the quality of life of patients with refractory ascites should be evaluated. 13.8. Effectiveness and safety of long-term abdominal drains should be assessed in RCTs for the palliative care of patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^112QETUt]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

As discussed in Section IIF, it is expected that changes in plasma albumin should have a complicated effect on the severity of ascites. Figure 6 plots the predicted ascites volume as a function of P HVPG for plasma colloid osmotic pressure of 25 mm Hg (black line), 20 mm Hg (red), 15 mm Hg (green) and 10 mm Hg (blue). As expected (Section IIF), the increase in ascites volume produced by decreasing albumin is greatest at higher portal pressures and becomes negligible at P HVPG less than about 14 mm Hg. Even at P HVPG above14 mm Hg, the effect of decreasing oncotic pressure is relatively minor until this pressure reaches a value of 10 mm Hg (equivalent to a serum albumin of about 1.5 gm%). Thus, it is not surprising that many investigators have concluded that serum albumin infusion is not efficacious for the reduction of ascites. It also is apparent that no ascites would be expected with very low serum albumin concentrations, providing the P HVPG is normal (< 6 mm Hg). This prediction is borne out by the absence of ascites in subjects with congenital hypoalbumenemia.

### Use of intravenous albumin: a guideline from the International Collaboration for Transfusion Medicine Guidelines [^114fLvXr]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for Recommendations

Approximately one-third of albumin is used for patients with cirrhosis, and although this practice is exceedingly common, the certainty of evidence supporting this therapy in this population is insufficient to allow for strong recommendations. Although the use of albumin for large-volume paracentesis is a commonly accepted clinical practice and is endorsed by guidelines, the reported trials have important limitations that affect the certainty in outcomes. These trials included a small number of patients and findings for most patient-important outcomes (mortality, kidney dysfunction) were imprecise, leaving residual uncertainty regarding true clinical benefits and harms. Albumin, as compared with other fluid expanders, may be superior for the prevention of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (rise in serum renin level on the sixth day after paracentesis), but whether this translates to improvement in patient-important outcomes is less certain. Plasma renin levels are predictive of greater morbidity in patients with cirrhosis. The panel suggested continuing this commonly accepted practice for patients undergoing large-volume paracentesis, but believed the data supported only a conditional recommendation based on low-quality evidence. Further trials are needed urgently to clarify if albumin improves patient important outcomes, to elucidate the optimal dosing strategy, to further the understanding of the safety profile of the treatment, and to evaluate alternative fluids and therapies. It is unclear if improving laboratory measures of paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction will translate into reductions in renal failure, hospital admission, or other patient-important outcomes. The panel also highlighted the need to personalize the use of albumin, the dose after paracentesis, or both, considering the patient's baseline creatinine, volume of ascites removed, and history of hypotensive symptoms after prior procedures.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^115f7zaQ]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Synthetic crystalloids may be substituted for albumin if < 5 L of ascitic fluid are removed. In fact, the use of a plasma volume expander may not be necessary at all in this settingand is not recommended unless there is another reason for volume expansion (eg, presence of AKI).

Although the use of albumin in the setting of LVP (> 5 L) is not questionable, there are several points that require discussion. On one hand, the dose of albumin (6–8 g/L of ascites removed) was established empirically. A RCT in which a dose of albumin of 4 g/L of ascites removed was compared with 8 g/L after LVP (> 5 L of ascites removed), showed no differences in the incidence of PCD, hyponatremia, renal dysfunction, recurrence of ascites, or survival. In fact, one could argue that the dose of albumin should be individualized based on factors such as "dry" body mass index, volume status, and/or presence of concomitant AKI.

### Management of ascites: expert panel narrative review [^117WEX5C]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ascites can develop in the setting of a variety of pathologies. The approach to treatment depends on accurate determination of the underlying cause, for which fluid analysis plays a central role. In particular, the serum-ascites-albumin gradient serves as a primary diagnostic test for differentiating among causes, with certain additional fluid tests performed based on clinical suspicion. Treatment options range from nonspecific fluid removal, including large-volume paracentesis and tunneled peritoneal catheters, to targeted therapies (e.g., diuretics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, and lymphangiography). Societal guidelines exist for the approach to cirrhotic ascites, but the management of other less common causes remains less well defined. The goal of this AJR Expert Panel Narrative Review is to provide guidance for the diagnosis and management of ascites, based on available evidence and the authors' clinical experience.

Survival risk changes based on variables comprising CPS

To obtain a comprehensive understanding of survival outcomes in patients with CPS 7, clinical variables that constitute the CPS, including TB, albumin, international normalized ratio (INR), and ascites, were evaluated for their association with the HR for OS (Fig. 2). In terms of HE, no one included in the cohort had a history of HE. For albumin levels, the HR decreased from 2.7 to 3.1 g/dL but then showed an increasing trend from 3.1 g/dL and above (Fig. 2A). The HRs for albumin levels of 2.7, 3.1, and 3.7 g/dL were 1.15 (95% CI, 0.48–2.79), 0.66 (95% CI, 0.42–1.01), and 1.67 (95% CI, 1.02–2.74), respectively. However, the P value for the linear relationship was 0.106, indicating no significant linear association between albumin level and HR for OS. In terms of TB, a significant linear relationship was observed (P = 0.003), with a consistent increase in HR as TB levels increase (Fig. 2B). For INR, no significant linear association with HR for OS was detected (P = 0.274). The lowest HR was observed at an INR of 1.09 (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39–0.93), whereas the highest HR was seen at an INR of 1.21 (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.91–2.28; Fig. 2C). Regarding ascites, the presence of a moderate/severe amount of ascites was associated with a significantly higher HR (3.15; 95% CI, 1.84–6.89) compared with mild ascites (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.76–1.84), with no ascites as the reference (Fig. 2D). Lastly, the albumin–bilirubin (ALBI) score was also evaluated and demonstrated a nonlinear association with OS, with no statistically significant relationship observed (Supplementary Fig. S1A).

Serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG) interpretation — ascites etiology is stratified by threshold values, with SAAG ≥ 1.1 g/dL reflecting portal hypertension and potential causes including ascites in cirrhosis, ascites related to massive liver metastasis, and ascites related to liver involvement in right heart failure, whereas SAAG < 1.1 g/dL excludes portal hypertension with potential causes including peritoneal carcinomatosis, tuberculous peritonitis, and other clinical conditions.

Diagnostic paracentesis in new-onset ascites

Aspiration of ascitic fluid and its laboratory analysis is an essential step in the management of patients with newly diagnosed ascites. In cirrhosis, hepatic sinusoids are less permeable owing to fibrous tissue deposition, resulting in ascites with low protein content. It is important to estimate total protein level in ascites fluid; a concentration below 1.5 g/dL (or 15 g/L) is a risk factor for the development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In addition, serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) should be estimated routinely. A cut-off point of 1.1 g/dL (or 11 g/L) differentiates between causes of ascites with high sensitivity, although alternative causes should be considered based on the clinical scenario (table 1).

Table 1
Grouping of aetiology of ascites based on serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG)

Hepatic sinusoids are normally permeable in heart failure, which allows for leakage of protein-rich lymph into the abdominal cavity and therefore, total protein concentration in ascitic fluid is high (> 2.5 g/dL) in combination with a high SAAG. In such a situation, measurement of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the serum ± ascites is useful. Total protein concentrations > 2.5 g/dL within the ascites and serum BNP > 364 ng/L are suggestive of underlying or additional cardiac disease, whereas serum protein values < 182 ng/L rule out cardiac disease.

In low SAAG states, clinical context and imaging should guide the investigational approach. The yield for positive cytology in the context of malignancy is variable, ranging from 0% to 96.7%, in part determined by the site of the tumour. Combining cytology with tumour markers in the ascitic fluid may increase the positive predictive value (PPV), specifically the use of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), CA 15–3 and CA 19–9. However, CA 125 in the serum or ascites has no role as a discriminator and will commonly be elevated by the presence of ascites from any cause.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^113igVB6]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Two small prospective RCTs compared standard dose (6–8 g/L of ascites drained) albumin after LVP with low-dose albumin (2–4 g/L). Pooled results from 70 patients suggested no difference in post-paracentesis-induced circulatory dysfunction (RR = 2.97, 95% CI 0.89, 9.91) and no development of renal dysfunction (no events in either group). A larger retrospective review of 935 patients found no increase in renal dysfunction when adherence to guidance (8 g/L after 5 L drained) was implemented, but significant cost savings were made because less HAS was used.

Potential cost savings have been proposed in relation to length of hospital stay in patients with ascites undergoing LVP who are treated with HAS as compared with an alternative plasma expander. However, HAS is more expensive than alternatives and is in worldwide shortage, therefore it should be prescribed according to recommended guidance based on the available evidence. There have been no cost-effectiveness analyses in the UK.

Until further studies are undertaken to compare efficacy of albumin against clinically available artificial plasma expanders, we would recommend that albumin remains the preferred plasma expander when paracentesis is undertaken. Albumin (as 20% or 25% solution) should be infused after paracentesis of > 5 L is completed at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed.

### Pancreatic ascites: update on diagnosis and management [^1137WuCd]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic paracentesis

Paracentesis is considered the gold standard for diagnosing pancreatic ascites and has a therapeutic effect on patients. The diagnostic criteria for pancreatic ascites include an amylase concentration > 1000 mg/dL, a protein level of > 3 g/dL, and a serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) < 1.1 g/dL. First proposed by Dr. John C. Hoefs in 1981, SAAG can help clinicians determine whether ascites is due to portal hypertension or to other causes. The SAAG is calculated by subtracting the ascitic albumin concentration from the serum concentration. SAAG > 1.1 g/dL is transudative in nature and indicates portal hypertension etiology, which may include cirrhosis, heart failure, portal vein occlusion, Budd-Chiari syndrome and hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. In contrast, an SAAG < 1.1 g/dL is considered exudative, insidious, and often due to peritoneal disease. Common causes include infectious peritonitis, chylous ascites, malignancy, nephrotic syndrome and pancreatic ascites. However, SAAG < 1.1 g/dL alone is not diagnostic for either condition.

Similarly to amylase and albumin levels, lipase enzyme level tends to be elevated in pancreatic ascites. Lactate dehydrogenase is typically elevated in pancreatic ascites; however, it can also be elevated in malignant ascites and tuberculous peritonitis. Tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 125 help rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis and malignancy. Fluid cytology and culture are usually negative in pancreatic ascites, particularly in the absence of abscesses or infected pseudocysts. Pancreatic ascites is typically straw-colored in appearance, although isolated cases of black or bloody ascites have also been reported.

### Laboratory investigation of peritoneal fluids: an updated practical approach based on the available evidence [^112Xjg6J]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Even though analysis of peritoneal fluids (PF) is often requested to medical laboratories for biochemical and morphological tests, there is still no mutual agreement on what the most appropriate way is to manage PF samples and which tests should be appropriately executed. In this update, we tried to identify the most useful tests for PF analysis to establish best practice indications. We performed a literature review and examined available guidelines to select the most appropriate tests by an evidence-based approach. Accordingly, the basic PF profile should include (1) serum to effusion albumin gradient and (2) automated cell counts with differential analysis. This profile allows to determine the PF nature, differentiating between 'high-albumin gradient' and 'low-albumin gradient' effusions, which helps to identify the pathophysiological process causing the ascites formation. Restricted to specific clinical situations, additional tests can be requested as follows: PF lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose, to exclude (LDH) or confirm (glucose) secondary bacterial peritonitis; PF total protein, to differentiate ascites of cardiac origin from other causes; PF (pancreatic) amylase, for the identification of pancreatic ascites; PF bilirubin, when a choleperitoneum is suspected; PF triglycerides, in differentiating chylous from pseudochylous ascites and PF creatinine, to detect intraperitoneal urinary leakage.

Use of human albumin solution (HAS)

Plasma expansion after paracentesis

One study evaluating haemodynamic and neurohumoral responses in 12 patients after a single, 5 L total paracentesis concluded that it was safe to omit albumin in these patients. However, a subsequent study including 80 patients with acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF) found that albumin significantly reduced complications (renal impairment, hyponatraemia and death) following < 5 L paracentesis compared with no administration of fluid. Thus in < 5 L paracentesis we recommend that plasma expansion is not necessary, unless there is evidence of ACLF. This recommendation is based on consensus rather than evidence and is consistent with other international guidance.

Plasma volume expansion should always be used for LVP with > 5 L of ascites removed. Serial paracenteses with and without albumin replacement have been evaluated in patients with tense ascites. There was a higher rate of renal impairment, fall in serum sodium levels, and a marked activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system in those not treated with albumin. However, the pooled risk ratio from these studies, which are more than 25 years old, showed only a tendency toward benefit of albumin (pooled RR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.64) (online supplemental table 5). The consensus is that volume expansion should be used with LVP. We recommend large volume paracentesis in one session and discourage repeated low volume paracentesis, which offers no additional benefits and carries a higher risk of procedure-related complications.

Outpatient management of ascites

The onset of ascites signifies an important stage in cirrhosis evolution: the 2-year and 5-year cumulative mortality after ascites development is 38% and 78%, respectively.

Ascites is a clinical manifestation of portal hypertension related renal dysfunction, leading to sodium and water retention and impaired free water clearance. This presents progressively as ascites, refractory ascites, hyponatraemia and ultimately hepatorenal syndrome.

New-onset ascites should be evaluated to ensure it is related to portal hypertension, including calculating serum albumin gradient (SAAG) where SAAG > 11 g/L is consistent with portal hypertension. In the absence of another clear cause of decompensation, CT scan of the liver to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma or portomesenteric vein thrombosis should be considered. Any significant increase in the volume of ascites, abdominal pain or fever should prompt an ascitic tap with fluid sent for white cell count to rule out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and ascitic fluid culture. A neutrophil count of > 250/mm 3 confirms SBP requiring prompt treatment with antibiotics.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^115v2a6r]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum albumin concentration commonly is decreased in cirrhosis. The resultant fall in plasma oncotic pressure is only partially offset by the increased in serum globulins observed in cirrhosis. The use of albumin infusion for the treatment of ascites is controversial. In a comprehensive review of this literature, Trotter et. al. concluded that, although short term therapy (11 to 16 days) was not useful, there was suggestive evidence that long duration albumin infusion (27 days to 2 years) in association with diuretics was beneficial in terms of ascites resolution and ascites redevelopment. In the only controlled trial of albumin in the treatment of ascites, Gentilini et. al. found that addition of albumin to diuretic therapy resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of responders and significantly reduced the redevelopment of ascites. The interpretation of these results is complicated because albumin also has systemic renal and cardiovascular effects. For example, albumin infusions may increase blood volume and central venous pressure which would increase (P L - P A) and exacerbate the ascites. The effects of albumin predicted by our model are small because any change in the amount of protein leaking from the liver will be roughly balanced by the change in the intestinal tissue protein. The model predicts that albumin would affect ascites formation at very high portal pressures because, as was discussed in Section IIA (see eq. (9)), there is a limit to the intestinal capillary pressure at which Starling force balance can be achieved and this limit is set by the plasma colloid osmotic pressure. Thus, in severe portal hypertension that produces intestinal capillary pressures that approach or exceed plasma oncotic pressure, there should be an increase in the rate of ascites formation with decreasing albumin. The quantitative model discussed in Section III provides predictions of the influence of plasma oncotic pressure on ascites volume over the entire range of portal pressures.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^112jsV2Y]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

In summary, although ascites in solid tumor malignancy is most commonly due to peritoneal carcinomatosis, we observed characteristics of portal hypertension with SAAG > 1.1 in 29% of subjects. We also observed that the presence of liver metastasis was not the sole contributor to the development of ascites with features of portal hypertension which could be related to prior chemotherapies or other factors. With ascites fluid analysis, we believe that ascites in the setting of extrahepatic malignancy can be managed with a combination of therapies directed toward the tumor, especially in the era of increasing targeted therapies, and if present portal hypertension. We also noted that despite advances in targeted chemo/immune-oncology therapies and the decreased mortality rates in cancer patients, patients with evidence of PC continues to have high mortality rates. Based on our results, we propose for the management of ascites in subjects with primary extrahepatic solid tumors, we propose that these subjects undergo diagnostic paracentesis to obtain cytology, albumin, and total protein. If the SAAG is ≥ 1.1 with/without TP < 2.5, then treatment of underlying tumor and initiation of diuretic therapy (furosemide/spironolactone at standard doses) is warranted. If these measures fail to control the ascites, then initiation of serial paracenteses should be the next step while adjusting the therapy of the underlying malignancy. If ascites still remains problematic, placement of peritoneal drain/shunt, should be considered along with a discussion of goals of care. If the SAAG ≥ 1.1 with TP > 2.5, then treatment of underlying tumor and initiation of paracentesis should be the initial management steps. If these measures fail to control the ascites, then placement of a peritoneal drain/shunt, adjustment of therapy toward the primary extrahepatic malignancy if required, again with a discussion of goals of care should be considered. Finally, we noted multiple presentations that predicted higher mortality including those with liver metastasis or peritoneal carcinomatosis on cytology and or imaging.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^1137xgd3]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

The British Society of Gastroenterology in collaboration with British Association for the Study of the Liver has prepared this document. The aim of this guideline is to review and summarise the evidence that guides clinical diagnosis and management of ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Substantial advances have been made in this area since the publication of the last guideline in 2007. These guidelines are based on a comprehensive literature search and comprise systematic reviews in the key areas, including the diagnostic tests, diuretic use, therapeutic paracentesis, use of albumin, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic stent shunt, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and beta-blockers in patients with ascites. Where recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis are available, these have been updated with additional studies. In addition, the results of prospective and retrospective studies, evidence obtained from expert committee reports and, in some instances, reports from case series have been included. Where possible, judgement has been made on the quality of information used to generate the guidelines and the specific recommendations have been made according to the 'Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE)' system. These guidelines are intended to inform practising clinicians, and it is expected that these guidelines will be revised in 3 years' time.

### Peritoneal and pleural fluid chemistry measurements performed on three chemistry platforms [^111Nwgrn]. Laboratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chemistry testing is requested for body fluid (BF) specimens despite the lack of assays approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The criteria for categorizing fluids as transudate or exudate are not validated across analyzers.

Objective

To compare BF chemical analysis and classification by different analyzers.

Methods

We analyzed 10 pleural and 18 peritoneal fluids with corresponding plasma specimens using the Vitros 5,1 FS; Abbott ARCHITECT ci8200; and Roche Modular P platforms. Total protein (TP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured for pleural fluids. Light's criteria were applied. Albumin was measured for peritoneal specimens, and the plasma-ascites-albumin gradient was calculated.

Results

TP results showed agreement. The Vitros LDH assay produced higher fluid:plasma ratios. Classification by Light's criteria resulted in 1 discrepancy (ARCHITECT). Albumin results showed agreement. There were 2 discrepant gradient interpretations (Vitros).

Conclusions

These data suggest that analyses of pleural and peritoneal fluids using these platforms are diagnostically interchangeable.

Hepatocellular carcinoma — Albumin-Bilirubin (ALBI) grade is described as an alternative to Child-Pugh (C-P) scoring: Albumin and bilirubin are objectively measured, while ascites and encephalopathy used in C-P are subjective; the ALBI grade takes into account only serum bilirubin and albumin levels and has been shown to be especially helpful in predicting survival in patients with stable decompensated cirrhosis. An analysis of almost 6000 patients from Europe, the United States, Japan, and China showed that ALBI, which stratifies patients into three risk categories, performs as well as the C-P score, and patients scored as C-P grade A were categorized into either ALBI grade 1 or 2.

### Rice-derived recombinant human serum albumin as an alternative to human plasma for patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis: a randomised, double-blind, positive-controlled and non-inferiority trial [^115KkExS]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the percentage of patients whose serum albumin reached ≥ 35 g/L at any time up to 14 days and centrally assessed. Secondary outcomes included: time to reach serum albumin ≥ 35 g/L by day 14; change in colloid osmotic pressure; serum albumin changes from baseline to the EOT; the severity of ascites (measured by abdominal circumference and bodyweight); the occurrence and titres of the anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and anti-HCP antibodies; safety profiles (including adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory evaluations, physical examination, vital signs and ECGs). Any events reported by the patient, any new medical conditions and symptoms, any new abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory evaluation were recorded as AEs. For immunogenicity assessments, blood samples for ADA or anti-HCP antibodies analyses were collected at screening, pre-dose, post-dose and at the end of study. Additional details on safety and efficacy measurements are provided in the supplemental material (online supplemental table S1).

Statistical analysis

The sample size calculation was based on a non-inferiority study design comparing OsrHSA and pHSA treatment groups in terms of the proportion (%) of patients whose serum albumin reached ≥ 35 g/L on or before day 14 (albumin response rate). A sample size of 88 patients in each of the OsrHSA dose groups and 22 in each of the pHSA dose groups assured statistical power of at least 80.0% to reject the null hypothesis that the treatment groups were not equivalent, in favour of the alternative hypothesis that they were equivalent. This used non-inferiority testing of two proportions at a one-sided 2.5% significance level, using normal approximations and assuming a non-inferiority margin of at least 20%, an expected difference in proportions of 5%, 84% proportion in the pHSA group and 20% dropout rate.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^115fWxjW]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

E. Protein concentration in ascitic fluid and the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG)

The model predicts that 1) hepatic lymph protein should be approximately equal to plasma protein (eq. (7)); 2) as the liver sinusoidal pressure is raised, a concomitant rise in intestinal capillary pressure should wash down the protein concentration in the intestinal tissue; and 3) ascitic fluid protein should approximately equilibrate with this washed down intestinal tissue protein (eq. (8)) (which equals intestinal lymph protein). A corollary of predictions 2 and 3 is that as the severity of portal hypertension increases, which causes an increasing intestinal capillary pressure and decreasing intestinal tissue protein, the ascitic fluid protein concentration should also fall. Witte et. al. measured the protein concentration in ascites fluid and hepatic and intestinal lymph in patients in varying stages of ascites. The measured lymph protein/plasma total protein ratios were: control: hepatic = 0.88; intestinal = 0.7; early stage cirrhosis: hepatic = 0.8, intestine = 0.8, ascites = 0.65; late stage: hepatic = 0.6; intestine = 0.12; ascites = 0.17. These experimental observations are in qualitative agreement with the above predictions. An important differential diagnostic marker of ascites is the value of the serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). A SAAG of ≥ 1.1 gm% is strongly indicative of portal hypertension (either cirrhotic or cardiac ascites) while all other causes of ascites (e.g. infections, malignancy) tend to have smaller gradients. While the diagnostic accuracy of the SAAG has been demonstrated empirically, the physiology underlying this measurement has received little attention. The values of the SAAG in various conditions follow directly from the assumption in the model that intestinal tissue and ascites fluid have similar albumin concentrations (eq. (8)). In subjects with normal portal pressure these concentrations are high, about 70% of the plasma value, resulting in a low SAAG. In contrast, the increase in intestinal capillary hydrostatic pressure and the accompanying wash down of intestinal interstitial protein produced by portal hypertension of any etiology results in low ascites protein concentrations, hence a high SAAG.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^115tda4N]. Gut (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for liver cirrhosis, more specifically with respect to management of ascites, intravenous albumin, BASL/BSG 2021 guidelines recommend to consider administering albumin (20% or 25% solution) after paracentesis of < 5 L at a dose of 8 g albumin/L of ascites removed in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure or high risk of post-paracentesis AKI.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^1119iA4K]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

On the other hand, the indication to administer albumin only after 5 L or more of ascites are removed is based on 2 proof-of-concept small studies that demonstrated a lack of deleterious hemodynamic effects up to 48 hours after a single 5 L paracentesis. One would wonder whether doing daily paracenteses of < 5 L would forego the need for albumin. The RCT by Gines et alsuggests that this is not the case since patients randomized to daily LVPs of 4–6 L who received 40 g of albumin with each paracentesis still had better outcomes than those randomized to not receiving albumin. As mentioned previously, in the meta-analysis comparing albumin to plasma volume expanders, for LVPs < 5 L there were no differences in outcomes (mainly PCD) between albumin and plasma volume expanders which indicates that some volume expansion is necessary even with small volumes of ascites removed and it would make rational sense to recommend albumin in patients with AKI. In fact, a recent study showed that, in patients with ACLF per APASL criteria, characterized by jaundice and ascites, paracenteses < 5 L were associated with the development of PCD and had a lower survival, both of which were improved by the administration of albumin. This is not surprising, as patients with increased systemic inflammation, the hallmark of ACLF, are more vasodilated and are therefore more prone to develop PCD. Therefore, in the presence of ACLF (by any definition) albumin administration would be recommended with paracenteses of any volume.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^114x2snw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

How the above described systemic changes translate into ascites accumulation is poorly understood at the quantitative level, and, in fact, is seldom discussed (as illustrated by the above quote). As a result, several clinically important observations remain unexplained. For example, how do the systemic alterations induced by salt restriction and diuretics lead to a reduction in ascites and why does the commonly employed measurement of plasma-ascitic fluid albumin gradient accurately diagnose portal hypertension. In an attempt to better understand the physiology of ascites, we present what appears to be the first quantitative model of the formation and removal of ascitic fluid. In this model, ascites accumulation is explained solely by pathophysiological alterations within the peritoneal cavity; systemic abnormalities are considered relevant only to the extent that they alter intraperitoneal physiology. Insights derived from this model may provide answers to previously unexplained clinical observations in patients with ascites.

Section I of the Discussion provides a brief quantitative description of the factors involved in fluid balance in the peritoneal space of normal subjects. Section II presents an analysis of the pathological abnormalities in the peritoneal cavity that are involved in the accumulation of ascites. This discussion includes mechanistic explanations for several clinically important, but poorly understood phenomena. Finally, in Section III, using a reasonable set of assumptions, a quantitative physical model describing ascites accumulation is developed and discussed. This model accurately predicts the magnitude and time course of the changes in ascites volume that are observed clinically with diuretic treatment or paracentesis. In sections I-III we have focused on the key factors and main supporting experimental results. The attached Additional file 1 (Section A), provides a more detailed discussion of the evidence supporting (or contradicting) the model's assumptions.

### Does this patient have ascites? [^113Hepxm]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

CLINICAL SCENARIOS — DO THESE PATIENTS HAVE ASCITES. In each of the following cases, the clinician will need to determine whether the patient has ascites. Case 1: A 44-year-old cirrhotic man is admitted with fever but has no obvious source of infection. Case 2: A 57-year-old woman presents with an adnexal mass and recent weight gain but otherwise feels well. Case 3: A 65-year-old man with a history of prior myocardial infarction is admitted for decreased exercise tolerance, increased abdominal girth, and ankle edema. WHY IS THIS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ANSWER WITH A CLINICAL EXAMINATION. Free fluid in the abdominal cavity is ascites. Ascites is a symptom that may have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. When clinically detectable, ascites may indicate underlying heart failure, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, or malignancy.

In patients with liver disease, ascites has prognostic significance since operative mortality is increased and overall survival is decreased; ascites. Williams JW, Simel DL. Does This Patient Have Ascites. How to Divine Fluid in the Abdomen. JAMA. 1992; 267: 2645–2648.

Hepatorenal syndrome–acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) — diagnosis requires cirrhosis with ascites; acute kidney injury (AKI) per International Club of Ascites–Acute Kidney Injury criteria; no response after 2 consecutive days of diuretic withdrawal and plasma volume expansion with albumin infusion (1 g/kg body weight per day); absence of shock; no current or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, or iodinated contrast media); and no signs of structural kidney injury indicated by proteinuria (> 500 mg per day), microhematuria (> 50 red blood cells per high-power field), and/or abnormal renal ultrasonography. AKI is defined as an increase in serum creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours or a percent increase of ≥ 50% within the preceding 7 days. Historically, type-1 HRS was defined as a 100% increase in serum creatinine to a value ≥ 2.5 mg/dL (221 μmol/L) within < 2 weeks.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our data indicate that the risk of clinical complications in those performing repeated low-volume paracentesis without albumin substitution is associated with the volume drained per day. Drainage of 1.5 L/d or more associates with a higher risk for hyponatremia, AKI, and increasing inflammation while those with drainage of less than 1.5 L/d show comparable complication rates with those receiving SOC.

### Long-term albumin treatment in patients with cirrhosis and ascites [^116XaDP1]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Although proposed for the first time several decades ago, the possibility that long-term human albumin could be effective for the treatment of patients with cirrhosis and ascites has become a topic of scientific and clinical discussion in the last decade. Long-term albumin administration represents a completely different treatment perspective compared to acute or short-term uses of albumin. Results from the ANSWER and the MACHT studies indicate that long-term albumin treatment can be effective, safe and able to modify the course of the disease provided that albumin is given at a sufficient dose and for a sufficient time to restore physiological levels and functions of the circulating molecule, which are compromised, at least partially, in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Further clinical studies and randomised trials are warranted to confirm the clinical benefits of long-term albumin therapy. Important areas for further research include determining the precise target population, the biomarkers of response, the optimal dose and frequency of albumin infusions, the stopping rules, and the cost-effectiveness of treatment in different healthcare systems across the world, particularly in those where the logistical issues and costs related to the periodic intravenous infusions may represent an important limitation to the implementation of this innovative approach in clinical practice. In this review, we will critically analyse the available data on long-term albumin treatment, focusing on the differences that exist between studies, the controversial issues and the future perspectives.

### Improving clinical decisions in IR: interpretable machine learning models for predicting ascites improvement after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedures [^114R6z2w]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the potential of interpretable machine learning (ML) models to predict ascites improvement in patients undergoing transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement for refractory ascites.

Materials and Methods

In this retrospective study, 218 patients with refractory ascites who underwent TIPS placement were analyzed. Data on 29 demographic, clinical, and procedural features were collected. Ascites improvement was defined as reduction in the need of paracentesis by 50% or more at the 1-month follow-up. Univariate statistical analysis was performed. Data were split into train and test sets. Feature selection was performed using a wrapper-based sequential feature selection algorithm. Two ML models were built using support vector machine (SVM) and CatBoost algorithms. Shapley additive explanations values were calculated to assess interpretability of ML models. Performance metrics were calculated using the test set.

Results

Refractory ascites improved in 168 (77%) patients. Higher sodium (Na; 136 mEq/L vs 134 mEq/L; p = 0.001) and albumin (2.91 g/dL vs 2.68 g/dL; p = 0.03) levels, lower creatinine levels (1.01 mg/dL vs 1.17 mg/dL; p = 0.04), and lower Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) (13 vs 15; p = 0.01) and MELD-Na (15 vs 17.5, P = .002) scores were associated with significant improvement, whereas main portal vein puncture was associated with a lower improvement rate (P = .02). SVM and CatBoost models had accuracy ratios of 83% and 87%, with area under the curve values of 0.83 and 0.87, respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between performances of the models in DeLong test (P = .3).

Conclusions

ML models may have potential in patient selection for TIPS placement by predicting the improvement in refractory ascites.

Large-volume paracentesis (LVP) in refractory ascites — definition, role, and albumin dosing are as follows: LVP, arbitrarily defined as a paracentesis of > 5 L, has been shown to be safe and effective in the management of RA, and LVP is the first-line treatment for RA. Albumin infusion at the time of LVP of > 5 L is recommended to mitigate the risk of postparacentesis circulatory dysfunction (PPCD); the recommended dose of albumin replacement, based on expert opinion, is 6–8 g for every liter of ascites removed, with practical examples that after the fifth liter, approximately 40 g of albumin should be infused, and after 8 L removed, the amount of albumin given should be approximately 64 g. The risk of PPCD may increase with > 8 L of fluid evacuated in one single session, and a recent study showed that by limiting the LVP volume to < 8 L per session and providing a higher than recommended dose of albumin (9.0 ± 2.5 g per liter of ascites removed), renal function and survival may be better preserved over a mean period of 2 years despite the development of PPCD in 40% of patients. In patients with hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure < 90 mm Hg), hyponatremia (serum sodium < 130 mmol/L), and/or the presence of AKI, albumin infusion should be strongly considered for paracenteses of a smaller volume.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^115EsVvN]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia

In adults, intravenous infusion of 50 to 75 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be used. Hypoalbuminemia is usually accompanied by a hidden extravascular albumin deficiency of equal magnitude. This total body albumin deficit must be considered when determining the amount of albumin necessary to reverse the hypoalbuminemia.

In burns, therapy usually starts with the administration of large volumes of crystalloid injection to maintain plasma volume. After 24 hours, ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be added at an initial dose of 25 g with the dose adjusted thereafter to maintain a plasma protein concentration of 2.5 g per 100 mL or a serum protein concentration of 5.2 g/100 mL.

Prevention of Central Volume Depletion after Paracentesis due to Cirrhotic Ascites

In adults, intravenous infusion of 8 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% may be given for every 1,000 mL of ascitic fluid removed.

Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome

In adults, as a guideline, doses of 50–100 g of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% should be infused over 4 hours and repeated at 4- to 12-hour intervals as necessary, when infusion of normal saline fails to achieve or maintain hemodynamic stability and urine output. [7]

### Study details | High dose albumin in refractory ascites… [^115iXAA2]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

The beneficial effect of human albumin might result from blood volume expansion tapering activated vasoconstrictor and sodium-retaining systems improving renal perfusion, hence regular infusion of albumin may be beneficial to prevent development of ascites and to improve survival. The positive effects of albumin are supported by previous studies; Romanelli et al, showed a significant increase in survival rate among cirrhotic patients with ascites when compared to those who did not receive albumin. Moreover, a randomized multicenter open label trial published in lancet last year, demonstrated that long term albumin administration improved 18-month survival, decreased the use of paracentesis and decrease in the incidence of cirrhosis related complications among cirrhotic patients with ascites. As of today, there's a limited use of regular high dose albumin in cirrhotic patients with ascites in US, despite being used elsewhere in the world as previously stated.

Patients with advanced liver disease often has low serum albumin level. The Infusion of human albumin is a standard of care after removal of ascitic fluid in patients with cirrhosis with refractory ascites. The objective of the study is to prove that regular infusion of albumin prevents formation of fluid in abdomen or pleural fluid and thus reduces the requirement of paracentesis or thoracentesis, and prevent complications. The Primary endpoints are: Number of paracentesis/thoracentesis needed and volume of fluid removed per month and if there is any reduction in frequency or volume after high-dose albumin administration; Twelve-month mortality or transplant. In both groups, when large-volume paracentesis is needed, the participant will receive human albumin in the dose of 6–8 g/L of ascites removed. No concomitant medications are withheld during the study.

After enrollment, participants will be assessed by a physician monthly for up to one year or study interruption or liver transplant or death. In both groups with refractory ascites, most of the patient require weekly or biweekly monitoring and paracentesis. The investigators plan to approach the patients during these visits to get the consent and administer the extra albumin dose. In each visit, ascites severity will be evaluated with hemodynamic status, weight, new symptoms, and diuretic dose. Each visit may last 15 minutes or more.

### Subset of Child-Pugh score 7 shows comparable survival outcomes to Child-Pugh score 6 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma treated with atezolizumab and bevacizumab [^111c4Puj]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

To address these unmet needs, we investigated varying survival outcomes based on the distribution of individual scores for the variables that constitute the CPS. Using restricted cubic splines, we identified a nonlinear trend in survival risk among patients with a CPS of 7. This nonlinearity arises from the inherent zero-sum nature of CPS scoring, in which an increase in one variable's score is counterbalanced by a decrease in another, resulting in a compensatory balance. Examining each variable, albumin levels between 2.8 and 3.5 g/dL were associated with a lower HR compared with levels above 3.5 g/dL. This finding underscores the complexity of interpreting albumin levels, as serum albumin in patients with HCC is influenced not only by liver function but also by nutritional status. In contrast, serum bilirubin levels are considered a more accurate reflection of liver dysfunction, as elevated bilirubin levels are mostly affected by decreased function in the excretion process by the liver. In our analysis, TB levels demonstrated a linear correlation with survival outcomes, with a consistent increase in HR as bilirubin levels increase. This observation aligns with previous studies identifying elevated TB as a significant risk factor for poor HCC prognosis. Consequently, within our cohort of patients with CPS 7 treated with Ate/Bev, TB levels of 2 mg/dL or higher were associated with worse survival outcomes. The INR was not significantly associated with survival risk in patients with CPS 7. This result may be due to the relatively homogeneous distribution of INR within this group, as only one patient had an INR greater than 1.7. In addition, we also identified that patients with moderate or severe ascites had a higher HR for mortality compared with those with mild or no ascites. The prognostic significance of ascites in HCC has been well documented, with studies consistently demonstrating an association between ascites and poor survival outcomes. Additionally, higher grades of ascites have been reported to be independently associated with worse survival outcomes, which aligns with the results of our study. Meanwhile, the ALBI score showed no significant association with OS in patients with CPS 7 in our study. This may be attributed to the homogeneity of ALBI grades within this group, with 94% classified as modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade 2b, thereby limiting the ability of ALBI to distinguish subsets with outcomes comparable with patients with CPS 6.

### Quantitative modeling of the physiology of ascites in portal hypertension [^113cVuGo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Figure 2 shows the steady state peritoneal volume (top), protein concentration (middle) and lymph flow as the P HVPG varies from 6 mm Hg (the pressure when liver exudation starts) to 25 mm Hg. At a gradient of 18.15 mm Hg, there is shift between the low pressure domain where P HV = P RA + 2, and the high ascitic pressure domain where P HV = P A (eq. (23)). The ascites protein concentration is expressed in terms of its equivalent colloid osmotic pressure. (For a normal subject with P HVPG = 2, P A = 2, P RA = 2, P HV = 4, the osmotic activity of the steady state ascites protein concentration should be about 20 mm Hg.) The ascites protein stays in a rather narrow range, falling from about 11 mm Hg when the ascites fluid begins to form, to a minimum of about 7 mm Hg at P HVPG of 18 mm Hg and then slowly rising to about 8 mm Hg. Assuming an albumin/total protein fraction of 0.65, these values correspond to albumin concentrations of about 2.5, 1.75 and 1.95 gm% respectively. For the assumed plasma colloid osmotic pressure of 25 mm Hg (albumin concentration of 4.45 gm%), these values correspond to a SAAG of 1.95, 2.75 and 2.5 gm%. The fall in ascites protein results from the wash down of intestinal tissue protein as the capillary blood pressure increases. At high P HVPG the leak of high protein fluid from the liver makes a relatively greater contribution to the total ascitic fluid formation, producing the increase in the ascitic protein concentration.

### The utility of evaluating low serum albumin gradient ascites in patients with cirrhosis [^116xfWdo]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) has been used extensively in the diagnostic workup of patients with ascites. A SAAG level of < 1.1 g/dl is usually thought of as a result of nonportal hypertension etiologies, including malignancies, tuberculous peritonitis, and nephrotic syndrome. However, the predictive value of a low SAAG in patients with existing cirrhosis in whom the pretest probability of portal hypertension is high is not clear.

Methods

We identified all patients with a SAAG of < 1.1 g/dl during a 5-year period at a single large veterans affairs medical center. Cirrhosis was defined by clinical, histological, and radiological features. Nonportal hypertension causes of low SAAG were identified, including bacterial peritonitis, peritoneal carcinomatosis, nephrogenous ascites, tuberculous peritonitis, chylous ascites, and pancreatic ascites.

Results

We identified 92 patients (76 with cirrhosis and 16 with no cirrhosis) with ascites and a SAAG of < 1.1 g/dl. Of the 76 patients with cirrhosis, only 29 (38%) had an identifiable cause, most commonly primary bacterial peritonitis (11, 38%), followed by peritoneal carcinomatosis or malignant ascites (8, 28%) and nephrotic syndrome (5, 17%). There were 47 patients with cirrhosis and a low SAAG for whom no etiology was identified. Thirty-three patients underwent a repeat paracentesis, 24 (73%) of whom changed to a high SAAG. On the other hand, the 16 patients with no cirrhosis had significantly lower SAAG (0.66 vs. 0.81), and most (12, 75%) had an identifiable cause of ascites.

Conclusions

Evaluation of a SAAG < 1.1 g/dl in patients with known cirrhosis has low yield and is less likely to be helpful than that in patients without cirrhosis. A repeat paracentesis as part of the workup is recommended. Further studies of low SAAG cutoffs are needed.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes in those with primary extrahepatic malignancy and malignant ascites [^115oiiUf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Among patients with ascites, 85% have evidence of portal hypertension and cirrhosis. Malignancy is the etiology of ascites in approximately 10% of cases. Ascites in the setting of primary extrahepatic solid tumors may occur due to peritoneal seeding, portal hypertension from massive liver metastasis, obstruction of lymphatics, treatment complications, or infiltration of hepatic sinusoids with malignant cells. Peritoneal carcinomatosis appears to cause ascites by producing proteinaceous fluid from tumor cells lining the peritoneum, and extracellular fluid enters the peritoneal cavity to restore the oncotic equilibrium and was reported to account for 53% of malignancy-related ascites in one series. Extrahepatic malignancy with liver metastases may cause ascites due to portal hypertension and is often accompanied by occlusion of hepatic and portal veins by tumor mass effect or tumor thrombosis. Chylous ascites in patients with lymphoma and other malignancies may be caused by lymph node obstruction by tumor and rupture of chyle-containing lymphatics. There may also be multiple etiologies of ascites in the same patient including peritoneal carcinomatosis, hepatic metastasis and cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma. Budd-Chiari syndrome due to an underlying malignancy is another rare etiology accounting for 1% of malignancy related ascites. Multiple chemotherapeutic agents are associated with development of portal hypertension as an idiosyncratic effect including nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. To evaluate the etiology of ascites, diagnostic paracentesis for analysis of the ascitic fluid to obtain total protein, albumin, triglyceride, cytology, and other laboratory testing and/cultures is performed. The serum albumin ascites gradient (SAAG) may be calculated by subtracting the ascitic fluid albumin from the serum albumin in simultaneously obtained samples. A serum albumin ascites gradient ≥ 1.1 g/dL with ascitic total protein < 2.5 g/dL is highly suggestive of the presence of portal hypertension, typically caused by liver disease with an accuracy of approximately 97%. A serum albumin ascites gradient ≥ 1.1 g/dL with ascitic total protein of > 2.5 g/dL is highly suggestive of a post hepatic sinusoid source of ascites such as ascites due to right heart failure. A serum albumin ascites gradient < 1.1 g/dL suggests other causes of ascites such as peritoneal carcinomatosis, tuberculosis, and other clinical conditions. Chylous ascites is defined as ascitic fluid triglyceride values > 200 mg/dL.

### Controversies regarding albumin therapy in cirrhosis [^112TtsNA]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Albumin in the prevention of relevant outcomes in outpatients with cirrhosis and ascites Infection

Another controversial use of albumin is its long-term use in outpatients with ascites. An initial proof-of-concept study in 45 patients suggested that twice weekly albumin infusions were associated with an improved survival, compared with historical controls. Subsequently, 3 RCTs have analyzed the effect of chronic weekly administration of albumin in patients with cirrhosis and ascites on survival (primary outcome). – The first RCT, performed in patients with new onset ascitesshowed an improvement in survival and a lower recurrence of ascites with i.v. albumin (25 g/wk in the first year and 25 g every 2 wk thereafter). The second, the ANSWER trial, was a large multicenter Italian open-label study that compared weekly i.v. albumin infusions versus standard-of-care in patients with a median MELD of 12 in whom ascites persisted despite diuretic therapy but who did not meet criteria for refractory ascites. The primary outcome, 18-month mortality, was significantly lower in patients randomized to albumin and was associated with a significant decrease in the number of paracenteses required and, importantly, with a reduction of other complications of ascites such as refractory ascites, hyponatremia, and HRS-AKI. Unfortunately, the study was not placebo-controlled and patients randomized to albumin received a loading dose of 40 g twice weekly for 2 weeks and then 40 g weekly thereafter. The lack of a placebo arm is associated with inherent biases including the intensity of medical supervision and the subjectivity of some of the outcomes such as the need for LVP. Still, this study involved > 400 patients with a MELD score between 12 and 13, with the vast majority being Child B. The albumin effect was specially reflected in a lower rate of infection and renal dysfunction. In a recent post hoc analysis of this study, the authors demonstrated that patients reaching on-treatment serum albumin level of 4 g/dL or greater 1 month after randomization was had a lower 18-month mortality. In addition, baseline serum albumin levels and MELD score could predict whether this goal albumin level would be achievable. That is, the sicker the patient, the more difficult it will be to reach these targets and the less the patient will respond to albumin.

Albumin in cirrhosis with infection and SBP indicates benefit and dosing: IV albumin improves survival in patients with cirrhosis and SBP, with those who most benefited having renal dysfunction (blood urea nitrogen > 30 mg/dL or creatinine > 1.0 mg/dL) or severe hepatic decompensation (bilirubin > 5 mg/dL). In an infection other than SBP, IV albumin has been used in the same doses (1.5 g/kg at day 1 and 1 g/kg at day 3); it has remained the standard recommendation. Alternatively, following the recommendations for the use of albumin in patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) would also be appropriate.

### Is the use of albumin of value in the treatment of ascites in cirrhosis? The case in favour [^1134ivWA]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2003). Low credibility.

In patients with cirrhosis, ascites accumulates because of sodium retention, triggered by a reduction of the effective arterial blood volume, and imbalanced Starling forces in the splanchnic area due to portal hypertension and hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is the ideal plasma expander in this setting, since it ameliorates systemic and reneal haemodynamics, so reducing sodium retention, and increases oncotic pressure in the splanchnic compartment. In particular, albumin proved useful in patients treated with diuretics, as demonstrated by a randomised study performed at our Instituition in which 126 ascitic inpatients were treated according to a stepped-care diuretic regimen. In fact, patients receiving diuretics plus albumin (n = 63) had a higher cummulative rate of response (p < 0.05) and a shorter hospital stay (20 ± 1 versus 24 ± 2 days, p < 0.05) than those given diuretics alone. Treatment with albumin on an outpatient basis (25 g/week) resulted in a lower probability of developing ascites (p < 0.02 vs. patients not given albumin) and a lower probability of readmission (p < 0.02). Patients given albumin also had a better quality of life. As discussed in another article, evidence also supports the use of albumin in patients treated for paracentesis, as well as in patients with spontaneous peritonitis or hepatorenal syndrome.

Ascites is a not infrequent finding on CT. Causes of ascites include congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminemia, cirrhosis, inflammation, and neoplasm. In most cases the attenuation of ascites is that of clear fluid, measuring around 0 HU. Rarely, however, a considerably higher density of ascites is seen. This finding may be a challenge for the radiologist, particularly since some of the conditions associated with it are of major clinical importance requiring prompt intervention.

### On-treatment serum albumin level can guide long-term treatment in patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites [^117AG6Tq]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The ANSWER study reported that long-term albumin administration in patients with cirrhosis and uncomplicated ascites improves survival. During treatment, serum albumin increased within a month and remained stable thereafter. In this post hoc analysis, we aimed to determine whether on-treatment serum albumin levels could guide therapy.

Methods

Logistic regression was used to assess the association between baseline serum albumin and mortality, as well as to determine on-treatment factors associated with mortality and to predict the achievement of a given on-treatment serum albumin level. Survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates and second-order polynomial regression. Patients whose on-treatment serum albumin remained below normal were compared with a subset of patients from the control arm matched by principal score.

Results

Baseline serum albumin was closely associated with 18-month mortality in untreated patients; albumin treatment almost effaced this relationship. On-treatment serum albumin and MELD-Na at month 1 were the sole independent variables associated with mortality. Second-order polynomial regression revealed that survival improved in parallel with increased 1-month on-treatment serum albumin. Kaplan-Meier estimations showed that any value of 1-month on-treatment serum albumin (0.1 g/dl intervals) in the range 2.5–4.5 g/dl discriminated patient survival. In the normal range of serum albumin, the best discriminant value was 4.0 g/dl. Compared to untreated patients, survival even improved in patients whose on-treatment serum albumin remained below normal.

Conclusion

Baseline serum albumin per se should not guide the decision to start albumin therapy. Conversely, 1-month on-treatment serum albumin levels are strongly associated with outcomes and could guide the use of albumin - 4.0 g/dl being the target threshold. However, even patients whose serum albumin remains below normal benefit from long-term albumin administration.

Lay Summary

The ANSWER study has shown that long-term albumin administration improves survival and prevents the occurrence of major complications in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. This study shows that the achievement of these beneficial effects is related to a significant increase in serum albumin concentration. Even though the best results follow the achievement of a serum albumin concentration of 4 g/dl, a survival benefit is also achieved in patients who fail to normalise serum albumin.

The primary coeffectiveness end points: control of ascites

After alfapump implantation, the pump was set to remove a mean daily ascites volume of 824 ± 265 mL, with 15 of the 40 patients requiring < 800 mL of ascites removed per day, 13 required 800–1,000 mL daily ascites drainage, while 12 required > 1,000 mL drained per day. The mean per patient ratio of preimplant to postimplant number of paracenteses was 0.18 (95% CI 0.04–0.32) (P < 0.001 vs performance goal of 0.5). Furthermore, 76.8% (95% CI 62.8%–90.7%) of the Pivotal Cohort (n = 40) achieved at least a 50% reduction in TP requirement (P < 0.001 vs performance goal of 50%) (Figure 2 a). Therefore, both coprimary end points were successfully met. A worst case scenario imputation sensitivity analysis is presented in the Supplemental Material (see Supplementary Digital Content 1). The mean number of TP fell from 3.2 ± 1.5 sessions per month in the preimplant period to 0.2 ± 0.6 sessions per month in months 4–6 postimplant (P < 0.001). The total volume of ascites drained by needle paracentesis was 54.2 ± 23.2 L in the preimplant period. This fell to 2.8 ± 9.1 L in months 4–6 in the postimplant period (P < 0.001) (Figure 2 b). The average monthly albumin dose given in the preimplant period was 119 ± 99 g, mostly in conjunction with TP. In the postimplant period, albumin was provided prophylactically in the immediate alfapump implantation, and at 2 weeks and 1 month after implantation at a dose of 1 mg/kg of weight, while monitoring patient's volume status, and thereafter mostly for the management of AEs such as acute kidney injury (AKI) or infections or whenever a large volume needle paracentesis or a pump paracentesis was required. The mean monthly dose of albumin-infused postimplant was 95 ± 105 g (P > 0.05 vs preimplant period).

### Is serum albumin a pivotal biomarker in anticipating acute pancreatitis outcomes? [^1114gSVZ]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In relation to vital signs, among patients exhibiting altered consciousness, 75.6% demonstrated hypoalbuminemia (P = 0.032). Hypoalbuminemia was also observed in all patients who experienced hypovolemic shock (P < 0.001). Furthermore, a significant association was identified between the presence of fever and hypoalbuminemia (P < 0.001).

Univariate analysis revealed also a significant association between low serum albumin levels and elevated mean creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP) and urea levels. The mean creatinine level was 12.5 mg/l ± 19.333 in patients with hypoalbuminemia compared to 7.5 mg/l ± 4.298 in those with normal albumin levels (P = 0.006). Similarly, the mean CRP level was 180 mg/l ± 114.137 in patients with hypoalbuminemia compared to 116 mg/l ± 99.374 in those with normal albumin levels (P < 0.001). Concerning urea: (p < 0.001, mean difference of -0.18454, 95% CI [-0.27393, -0.09515]). A decline in serum albumin level was also associated with a decrease in hematocrit levels (P < 0.001). Patients with hypoalbuminemia also had a lower average hemoglobin level (11.7 ± 2.8 vs. 12.8 ± 1.7, P < 0.001). (Table 4). x.

Baseline clinical characteristics and outcomes among patients with various albumin levels

Regarding severity scores: a significant association was found between hypoalbuminemia, SIRS, BISAP score, and CTSI. Among patients with persistent SIRS after 48 h, 70.8% had hypoalbuminemia, and 29.2% had normal albumin levels (P < 0.001). 66.7% of patients with a BISAP score ≥ 3 had hypoalbuminemia compared to 33.3% with normal albumin levels (P < 0.001). Among patients with a CTSI score > 3, 51.7% had hypoalbuminemia (P < 0.001). Hypoalbuminemia was also associated with the presence of pleural effusion (P < 0.001) and ascites (P < 0.001).

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in cirrhosis — proposed diagnostic and management algorithm begins when there is an "Acute rise in creatinine by ≥ 0.3mg/dL", followed by "Clinical assessment including urinary sediment and biomarkers" and determining if a "Specific diagnosis" is identified; urinary markers guide etiology, as "Urinary sediments and biomarkers (particularly NGAL) may indicate ATN, whereas fractional excretion of sodium < 1% may suggest HRS". If no specific diagnosis is made, the branch evaluates "Creatinine doubled from baseline?"; management emphasizes risk factor correction, and if there is "No resolution in 1–2 days" or a "further rise in serum creatinine", proceed to albumin challenge: "Risk factor management, if applicable Give albumin (1g/kg) for 2 days". After albumin, assess "Meets the criteria for HRS"; if yes, determine "Vasoconstrictor therapy candidate?" and administer vasoconstrictor therapy if appropriate, while if no, use "Individualized nephrology care". Risk factor management includes "the withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs, reduction or withdrawal of diuretics, detection, and treatment of infections, if present, and volume replacement (if severely volume-depleted) using 5% albumin or crystalloids, preferentially balanced, initially".

Stages of acute kidney injury (AKI) — serum creatinine criteria: Stage 1 is defined as an increase of creatinine ≥ 0.3 mg/dL up to 2-fold of baseline, stage 2 as an increase in creatinine between 2- and 3-fold of baseline, and stage 3 as an increase in creatinine > 3-fold of baseline or creatinine > 4 mg/dl (353.6 μmol/l) with an acute increase ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (26.5 μmol/l) or initiation of RRT. Within stage 1, some members proposed subdividing into stage 1A (creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL) and stage 1B (creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL).

### Human albumin for the treatment of ascites in patients with hepatic… [^112EsqWi]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Based on the above pathophysiological considerations, the preservation of the central blood volume represents a major purpose in the management of patients with advanced cirrhosis. Albumin constitutes approximately half of the proteins in the plasma of healthy individuals, and is responsible for about 70% of the plasma oncotic pressure. It plays, therefore, a pivotal role in modulating the distribution of fluid between compartments. However, albumin carries other biological properties, such as molecule and drug transport, free radical scavenging, and anti-inflammatory activity, which can be relevant under several circumstances and diseases. Finally, several controlled and/or randomized studies have shown that albumin administration is effective to prevent the circulatory dysfunction after large-volume paracentesis and renal failure after SBP, and to treat HRS when given together with vasoconstrictors.
- standard medical therapy
- standard medical therapy plus albumin infusion Within 24 hours from randomization, patients will start with albumin infusion at the dose of 40 g twice weekly for 2 weeks, and then 40 g weekly for the rest of the study. Patients who will develop refractory ascites during the study, will be followed up to completion of the 18 month period or to the need of at least 3 paracentesis/months.
- Hypothesis: 35% mortality in the group of patients undergoing standard medical care and 20% mortality in the group of patients receiving albumin. In order to state that the difference in mortality between the two groups is statistically significant with 95% probability, 210 patients per arm have to be enrolled. These figures have been calculated assuming a constant drop rate equal to 0. 04 per interval.
- Ongoing diuretic treatment with an anti-mineralocorticoid drug at a dose of 200 mg/day and furosemide of 25 mg/day, stable for at least 4 days prior enrollment, not inducing response. With this limitation, we aim to identify a fairly homogeneous population with a relatively advanced stage of the disease that will likely have more benefit from albumin administration, as also suggested by Gentilini at al. .
