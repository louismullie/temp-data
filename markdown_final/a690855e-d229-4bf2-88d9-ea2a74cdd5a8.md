## Question

A 70-year-old man with a recent above-the-knee amputation of the left lower extremity, due to wet gangrene secondary to refractory peripheral artery disease, presents with weakness and dizziness. He says that the symptoms began acutely 24 hours after surgery and have not improved. The amputation was complicated by substantial blood loss. He was placed on empiric antibiotic therapy with ciprofloxacin and clindamycin before the procedure, and blood and wound culture results are still pending. The medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medications are metformin and lisinopril. The family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in both parents. Review of symptoms is significant for palpitations and a mild headache for the past 24 hours. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F); blood pressure, 120/70 mm Hg (supine); pulse, 102/min; respiratory rate, 16/min; and oxygen saturation, 99% on room air. When standing, the blood pressure is 90/65 mm Hg and the pulse is 115/min. On physical examination, the patient appears pale and listless. The surgical amputation site does not show any signs of ongoing blood loss or infection. Laboratory tests and an ECG are pending. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
A. Administer IV fluids and withhold lisinopril
B. Administer oral fludrocortisone
C. Administer IV norepinephrine
D. Administer IV fluids

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which management step is most appropriate for a 70-year-old man who developed orthostatic hypotension and related symptoms after major blood loss from an above-knee amputation, with options including IV fluids alone, IV fluids plus withholding lisinopril, oral fludrocortisone, or IV norepinephrine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of orthostatic hypotension. Then, I should verify the likely etiology in the context of recent substantial blood loss. Next, I will review guideline-based first-line therapy for hypovolemic orthostatic hypotension. After that, I need to consider medication contributors, especially ACE inhibitors, and whether to hold them now or later. Finally, I will evaluate when vasopressors or mineralocorticoids are indicated and synthesize the safest, most evidence-based next step with monitoring priorities.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and its severity. The patient has a drop in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg and diastolic of 5 mmHg when standing, with a compensatory rise in heart rate, which meets criteria for orthostatic hypotension and is clinically significant given his dizziness and weakness. Symptoms alone are not reliable, so the objective blood pressure change is key here [^notfound].

> I need to check the likely etiology in this specific context. The symptoms began 24 hours after major surgery with substantial blood loss, and the exam shows pallor and listlessness; there is no evidence of ongoing bleeding or infection at the surgical site, making acute hypovolemia from blood loss the most plausible cause of orthostatic hypotension right now, rather than primary autonomic failure or medication-induced vasodilation alone [^113X16Sj].

> Next, I should review first-line management for hypovolemic orthostatic hypotension. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — my initial thought was to withhold lisinopril immediately because ACE inhibitors can worsen orthostatic symptoms; but wait, I should verify whether stopping the ACE inhibitor is the immediate priority or whether correcting intravascular volume comes first. The diabetes standards emphasize correcting volume depletion with fluids and salt as critical, and they prioritize nonpharmacologic measures including volume repletion before escalating to pharmacologic therapies for orthostatic hypotension, which supports IV crystalloids as the initial step here [^114sbzbQ].

> I will now examine the role of fluids in this scenario. Let me think about dosing and context: in sepsis and shock frameworks, an initial bolus of 30 mL/kg crystalloid is standard for hypoperfusion, and while this patient is not in septic shock, the principle of rapid, guideline-directed volume repletion applies to hypovolemia. Given substantial blood loss and symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, a bolus of IV crystalloids is appropriate with close reassessment of vitals, urine output, and symptoms to titrate further therapy and avoid fluid overload [^1145gRY3] [^1126bUfo].

> Now, about the ACE inhibitor: I should double-check the timing. The perioperative hypertension guidance notes that holding ACE inhibitors before major surgery can reduce intraoperative hypotension, but POISE-3 did not show a clear outcome difference between holding versus continuing, and in the immediate postoperative setting with established orthostatic hypotension from hypovolemia, the priority is to restore volume. Withholding lisinopril can be considered after initial stabilization if orthostatic symptoms persist, but it is not the first step before fluids are given, so I should correct volume first and then reassess the need to hold or adjust antihypertensives [^111RxPqB] [^111g4zHT] [^114sbzbQ].

> Let me consider the pharmacologic options proposed. Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid used for chronic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and requires time to effect; it is not appropriate as an acute intervention for hypovolemia and would risk volume overload if given without addressing the underlying deficit, so I should avoid it now [^notfound]. Norepinephrine is a vasopressor indicated for persistent hypotension after adequate fluid resuscitation, particularly in distributive shock; here, the hemodynamic pattern reflects relative hypovolemia rather than vasodilatory shock, so vasopressors should be reserved for refractory cases after fluids fail to stabilize perfusion, not as an initial step [^111Ji572] [^1121c3Zs].

> I should confirm monitoring and safety steps. After initiating IV fluids, I need to reassess supine and standing blood pressure and heart rate, mental status, urine output, and signs of fluid responsiveness or overload. Dynamic measures like passive leg raise or capillary refill can help guide ongoing resuscitation, and I should be prepared to adjust the plan if there is no improvement or if new concerns arise, including reassessing for occult bleeding or infection as cultures return [^1126bUfo] [^1148iPpk].

> Putting this together, the next best step is to administer IV crystalloid fluids promptly to correct hypovolemia and relieve orthostatic symptoms, with reassessment of blood pressure and symptoms guiding further boluses. Withholding lisinopril can be considered subsequently if orthostatic hypotension persists once volume is restored, but it should not precede volume repletion in this acute setting [^114sbzbQ] [^111RxPqB].

> Final answer: D. Administer IV fluids [^114sbzbQ] [^1145gRY3].

---

The patient's orthostatic hypotension and symptoms are most consistent with **hypovolemia from blood loss** [^112XpfDu]. The next best step is to **administer IV fluids** (crystalloids) to restore intravascular volume and improve perfusion [^114VAo5u]. Withholding lisinopril is reasonable but secondary to volume repletion; fludrocortisone and norepinephrine are not indicated as first-line therapy in this context. Immediate fluid resuscitation is the priority, with close monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and urine output to guide ongoing management [^1126bUfo].

---

## Pathophysiology and clinical presentation

Orthostatic hypotension is defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of ≥ 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥ 10 mmHg within 3 minutes of standing or during head-up tilt [^notfound]. It results from **impaired autonomic regulation** or **intravascular volume depletion** [^113X16Sj]. In this patient, substantial blood loss from the amputation likely caused hypovolemia, reducing preload and cardiac output and precipitating orthostatic symptoms.

---

## Diagnostic approach

The diagnosis of orthostatic hypotension is **clinical**, supported by vital sign measurements in supine and standing positions. Additional tests (e.g. tilt-table, autonomic function tests) may be considered if the cause is unclear or if neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Management of orthostatic hypotension

Management depends on the **underlying cause**, severity, and patient comorbidities. General measures include:

- **Volume repletion**: Intravenous fluids (crystalloids) are first-line for hypovolemia-induced orthostatic hypotension [^114sbzbQ].

- **Medication adjustment**: Review and adjust medications that exacerbate hypotension, such as ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or diuretics [^114sbzbQ].

- **Physical maneuvers**: Compression stockings, abdominal binders, and slow positional changes can help reduce symptoms [^114sbzbQ].

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Midodrine, droxidopa, or fludrocortisone may be considered for persistent symptoms despite volume repletion and medication adjustment [^114sbzbQ].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Rationale** | **Appropriateness** |
|-|-|-|
| A. Administer IV fluids and withhold lisinopril | - IV fluids are first-line for hypovolemia-induced orthostatic hypotension [^114sbzbQ] <br/> - Withholding lisinopril may help, but is secondary to volume repletion | Appropriate, but not the best initial step |
| B. Administer oral fludrocortisone | - Fludrocortisone is a mineralocorticoid that increases sodium retention and blood volume <br/> - Not first-line for acute hypovolemia-induced orthostatic hypotension | Inappropriate initial step |
| C. Administer IV norepinephrine | - Norepinephrine is a vasopressor indicated for severe hypotension or shock <br/> - Not indicated for mild orthostatic hypotension without shock | Inappropriate initial step |
| D. Administer IV fluids | - IV fluids are the cornerstone of treatment for hypovolemia-induced orthostatic hypotension [^114sbzbQ] <br/> - Immediate volume repletion will improve preload, cardiac output, and blood pressure | Most appropriate initial step |

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The patient's orthostatic hypotension is most likely due to **hypovolemia from blood loss**. The next best step is to **administer IV fluids** to restore intravascular volume and improve perfusion [^114sbzbQ]. Withholding lisinopril may be considered after initial volume resuscitation, but it is not the immediate priority. Fludrocortisone and norepinephrine are not indicated as first-line therapy in this scenario.

### Withdrawal of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure and improved ejection fraction [^1131xSzK]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited evidence exists on the prognostic role of continuing medical therapy in patients with heart failure (HF) and an ejection fraction (EF) that has improved over time. This study assessed rates of, patient profiles, and associations with morbidity/mortality of renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RASi), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNi), beta-blockers (BBL), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) withdrawal in patients with HF with improved EF.

Methods

Patients with a first recorded EF < 40% and a later EF ≥ 40% from the Swedish HF registry between June 11, 2000, and December 31, 2023, were included in this retrospective observational study. Withdrawal was defined as a patient on treatment at the first (reduced) but not at the second (improved) registration. The association between withdrawal and time to first cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization for HF with censoring at 1 year was assessed by Cox regression model using overlap weighting.

Results

Of 8728 patients with HF with improved EF (median age, 70 years [25th to 75th percentile, 61–78], 2611 [29.9%] women), 96%, 94%, and 46% received RASi/ARNi, BBL, and MRA, respectively, when EF was < 40%. The withdrawal rates at the time of the improved EF registration were 4.4% for RASi/ARNi, 3.3% for BBL, and 17.2% for MRA. Predictors of withdrawal included lower use of other HF medications, higher EF at the later EF registration, and a longer time between the 2 EF assessments. After weighting, withdrawal was independently associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular mortality/hospitalization for HF by 38% for RASi/ARNi and 36% for MRA, but not for BBL. Withdrawal of BBL was associated with a higher risk of the primary outcome in the subgroup of patients with an improved EF of 40% to 49% versus ≥ 50% (P -interaction 0.03).

Conclusions

In patients with HF with improved EF, HF therapy withdrawal was rare. Withdrawing RASi/ARNi and MRA was associated with higher mortality/morbidity at 1 year. No association was found for BBL withdrawal, albeit with a significant heterogeneity for EF at improvement, suggesting better outcomes with continuing BBL only until EF improves up to 50%. These results are hypothesis-generating and highlight the need for randomized controlled trials testing BBL withdrawal in patients with HF with improved EF.

Campylobacteriosis — adults and adolescents with HIV: For Mild Disease if CD4 Count > 200 Cells/mm3, no therapy unless symptoms persist for more than several days (CIII). For mild to moderate disease (if susceptible), azithromycin 500 mg PO (by mouth) daily for 5 days (BIII) (not recommended for patients with bacteremia [AIII]), or ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV [intravenous]) every 12 hours for 7–10 days (BIII). For Campylobacter bacteremia, ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV) every 12 hours for ≥ 14 days if the isolate is sensitive (BIII) plus an aminoglycoside (BIII) to limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Alternative therapy for mild to moderate disease (if susceptible) is levofloxacin 750 mg (PO or IV) every 24 hours (BIII), and in bacteremic patients add an aminoglycoside to a fluoroquinolone (BIII) to limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance. For recurrent infections, duration of therapy may be extended to 2–6 weeks (BIII). Supportive care includes oral or IV rehydration if indicated (AIII), and antimotility agents should be avoided (BIII). Third-generation cephalosporins are not reliably active, and use of alternative cell wall–active agents, such as carbapenems, may be necessary in severely ill people who require empiric IV therapy until antimicrobial susceptibilities return. In the United States in 2018, 29% of C. jejuni isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 2% were resistant to azithromycin; among C. coli isolates, 40.5% were resistant to fluoroquinolone and 13.3% were resistant to azithromycin. Effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) may reduce the frequency, severity, and recurrence of Campylobacter infections.

Other Adverse Reactions

Lower Limb Amputations

An increased incidence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations occurred in BRENZAVVY-treated patients compared to placebo-treated patients in a trial (Trial 6) that evaluated adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had either established CVD or were at increased risk for CVD. Patients in this trial were followed for a median duration of 2.4 years. The lower limb amputation data are shown in Table 2.

### Abiraterone acetate [^111TpKrc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been abiraterone acetate-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of randomized clinical trials, grade 3 to 4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 X ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received abiraterone acetate, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking abiraterone acetate. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to abiraterone acetate were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with abiraterone acetate, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced abiraterone acetate dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt abiraterone acetate treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with abiraterone acetate at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 X ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 X ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue abiraterone acetate tablets for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 x ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 x ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of abiraterone acetate re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 X ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 X ULN is unknown.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^114qijjf]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-associated shigellosis — preferred therapy is ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO (or 400 mg IV) every 12 hours (if MIC < 0.12 μg/mL) (AIII). Duration of therapy is Gastroenteritis: 5–7 days (AIII) (except ciprofloxacin [5–10 days] and azithromycin [5 days]), Bacteremia: ≥ 14 days (BIII), and Recurrent infections: Up to 6 weeks (BIII). In severely ill patients requiring empiric parenteral therapy while awaiting susceptibility, consider initiating a carbapenem until antimicrobial susceptibilities are available (BIII). Alternative regimens include levofloxacin 750 mg (PO or IV) every 24 hours (BIII), trimethoprim 160 mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg PO or IV every 12 hours for 5–7 days (BIII), azithromycin 500 mg PO daily for 5 days (BIII), or ceftriaxone 1–2 g IV every 24 hours (BIII); azithromycin and TMP-SMX are not recommended for treatment of bacteremia, and azithromycin-resistant Shigella spp. have been reported in MSM with HIV. Increased resistance of Shigella to fluoroquinolones in the United States is noted, and alternative antibiotics should be considered if ciprofloxacin MIC is ≥ 0.12 μg/mL (BIII). Supportive care and cautions include that therapy may slightly shorten the duration of illness and/or prevent the spread of infection (AIII), oral or IV rehydration if indicated (AIII), and antimotility agents should be avoided (BIII). Many Shigella strains that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics are described, and antibiotic sensitivity testing of Shigella isolates from individuals with HIV should be performed routinely. Given increasing antimicrobial resistance and limited data showing that antibiotic therapy limits transmission, antibiotic treatment may be withheld in patients with CD4 count > 500 cells/mm3 whose diarrhea resolves prior to culture confirmation of Shigella infection (CIII). Effective ART may decrease the risk of recurrence of Shigella infections.

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^117QPd7a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency

Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

5.10 Severe Hypotension

OXAYDO may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of OXAYDO. In patients with circulatory shock, OXAYDO may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of OXAYDO in patients with circulatory shock.

5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness

In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), OXAYDO may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with OXAYDO.

Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of OXAYDO in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) and antihypertensive treatment — effects and assessment: The impact of OH on the CVD and mortality benefit from intensive BP control in the SPRINT trial found no difference in the risk reduction for CVD or all-cause mortality, regardless of OH status, and no evidence for harm among those with standing hypotension (SBP < 110 mm Hg); a post-hoc analysis of the NAILED study population (n = 814, 35% experiencing OH at least once) showed that intensification of BP control was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events or death in this stroke/TIA population, and systematic titration of antihypertensive treatment did not increase the prevalence of OH compared with usual care; assessment for OH prior to initiation of treatment is equitable and an assessment for OH in symptomatic patients, particularly after initiation of treatment or adding a new class of antihypertensive medication, is acceptable to detect unmasked autonomic system dysfunction or other acute or chronic conditions.

### Defining the typical characteristics of orthostatic headache in patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension [^112gfZ8Q]. Cephalalgia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Orthostatic headache (OH) is a common feature of various conditions, including spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH), but no precise definition currently exists outlining the typical OH characteristics. This ambiguity risks misdiagnosis with unnecessary investigations and delay in institution of treatment. The present study aimed to carry out structured phenotyping of OH in patients with SIH with the aim of outlining its typical characteristics.

Methods

Eligible patients with clinico-radiological confirmed SIH underwent a structured interview, after which a specialist interest group utilised the modified Delphi process to analyse the data and achieve consensus on defining the typical characteristics of OH in SIH.

Results

In total, 137 patients were recruited. OH was present in 75.9%. Typical OH characteristics in SIH were defined as having a baseline severity (lying flat) on waking up of ≤ 3 (0–10, verbal response scale), headache onset-time of ≤ 4.5h on becoming upright, time to peak severity of ≤ 7.5h and an offset to baseline severity within 1.5h of recumbency. Intra-individual consistency in the onset and offset-time was deemed a necessary characteristic.

Conclusions

Defining typical OH characteristics has the potential of enhancing SIH diagnostics and management, at the same time as minimising unwarranted invasive procedures.

Question 3: What are the best next steps in terms of treatment?
A. Endovascular embolization
B. Debulking surgery
C. Medical treatment
D. Radiation therapy (RT)
E. Above-knee amputation surgery

Answers:
A. Endovascular embolization – Incorrect. Computed tomography angiography revealed that the PN is nourished by the branches of 2 major arteries. The embolization of major arteries can cause extensive tissue necrosis of the leg, and the embolization of artery branches might be ineffective in relieving the PN-related morbidities.
B. Debulking surgery – Incorrect. The MRI showed extensive soft tissue involvement, and debulking surgery can barely restore the leg function when the muscle and knee joint are severely deteriorated. The residual PN is still associated with the risk of malignancy and continuous growth.
C. Medical treatment – Incorrect. For such a giant PN, medical treatment can barely meet the urgency of restoring the function and improving QOL.
D. Radiation therapy (RT) – Incorrect. RT is suitable for confined benign lesions with distinctive borders. The PN in our patient is extensively involving the entire leg; the improper RT can be either ineffective or damaging.
E. Above-knee amputation surgery – Correct. The amputation at the above-knee level can resect most of the PNs in our patient and provide us with more space to safely ligate large blood vessels. Debulking surgery can also be performed simultaneously on the leg to reduce the PN volume and provide more soft tissue to achieve the conical form of the stump, thereby minimizing the difficulties in fitting the stump in the socket. Following graduated rehabilitation, the patient's function and QOL can be significantly improved.

Orthostatic hypotension — management goals and options: The therapeutic goal is to minimize postural symptoms rather than to restore normotension. Most individuals require both nonpharmacologic measures (ensuring adequate salt intake, avoiding medications that aggravate hypotension, or compressive garments over the legs and abdomen) and pharmacologic measures; physical activity and exercise should be encouraged to avoid deconditioning, volume depletion should be corrected, and repletion with fluids and salt is critical. Pharmacologic options often include shorter-acting drugs at bedtime such as guanfacine or clonidine, short-acting calcium blockers (isradipine), or shorter-acting β-blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol tartrate. Midodrine and droxidopa are approved by the FDA for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim [^111doGyJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Respiratory Failure

Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days to week of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products.

Circulatory Shock

Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products, including sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, in patients with history of recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Management of Hypersensitivity and Other Serious Reactions

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in patients treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver enzyme and coagulation abnormalities. If HLH is suspected, discontinue sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim immediately and institute appropriate management.

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111aztBP]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design, search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted and reported in accordance with the 2020 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline (see online supplemental information 1). The review was prospectively registered with the PROSPERO database (CRD42024555402).

The population, intervention, comparator, outcome framework was employed to develop the research question. The population comprised patients with clinically diagnosed OH as a result of any underlying aetiology. The intervention was the provision of pyridostigmine. The comparator group consisted of patients receiving either a placebo or an active comparator. The main outcome measure was the change in SBP and DBP on standing. Additional outcome measures included changes in postural symptoms, medication side effects and effects of treatment on supine BP.

On 4 June 2024, the following databases were searched: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and SCOPUS. The search terms applied were as follows: ((Orthostatic hypotension) OR (postural hypotension)) AND (pyridostigmine) (see online supplemental information 2). Additional studies were acquired through examining the reference list of included studies. Unpublished studies were sought where available.

Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials that evaluated the use of pyridostigmine for the treatment of OH. Studies were excluded if they were not original articles, if English full texts were not available, if not quantitative or if they involved participants under 18 years. There was no restriction on the publication date.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Covidence systematic review software (Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia) was employed to screen studies for eligibility. Title and abstract screening was conducted, followed by full-text review. Two reviewers (SZ and AGM) independently screened studies according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A third reviewer (NVP) resolved disputes. The following data were extracted from included studies; publication details, dataset characteristics, randomisation strategy, patient and outcome assessor blinding, BP measurement technique, treatment groups, treatment duration, as well as primary and secondary outcome measures. Data were presented in tabular and narrative formats.

Two reviewers (SZ and AGM) assessed the quality of included studies by using Version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (see table 1). Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^1148iPpk]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Measuring response to therapy and blood pressure targets — dynamic parameters may help guide resuscitation over static parameters or physical examination alone. Capillary refill time may be used as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion to help guide resuscitation, and an approach using capillary refill time to guide fluid resuscitation should be augmented by repeated and comprehensive patient evaluation to predict or promote early recognition of fluid overload. Capillary refill time has been shown to reflect tissue perfusion and, when used as a resuscitation target, has been found to be more effective than a strategy targeting normalized or 20% reduction of lactate in the first 8 hours of septic shock. Use an initial target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg for septic shock requiring vasopressors, and the recommendation for an initial target MAP of 65 mmHg is unchanged from previous SSC guidelines.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^111Ji572]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Vasoactive agents for adults with septic shock — Patients with septic shock who do not respond to fluid resuscitation will require support with vasopressors. Adults with septic shock should have vasopressors begun through peripheral access to improve mean arterial pressure (MAP) rather than waiting for central access. Norepinephrine should be used as the first-line vasopressor agent in adults with septic shock unresponsive to intravenous fluid resuscitation. Adults with septic shock should be treated initially with norepinephrine over other vasopressors. It is reasonable to use epinephrine or dopamine for adults with septic shock when norepinephrine is not available. For adults with septic shock and persistent MAP less than 65 mmHg on norepinephrine, consider adding vasopressin rather than increasing the dose of norepinephrine. For adults with septic shock and persistent MAP less than 65 mmHg on norepinephrine and vasopressin, consider adding epinephrine. For adults with septic shock and cardiac dysfunction, add dobutamine to norepinephrine or use epinephrine alone.

5.9 Adrenal Insufficiency

Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use, more often following greater than one month of use. Presentation of adrenal insufficiency may include non-specific symptoms and signs including nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If adrenal insufficiency is suspected, confirm the diagnosis with diagnostic testing as soon as possible. If adrenal insufficiency is diagnosed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids. Wean the patient off of the opioid to allow adrenal function to recover and continue corticosteroid treatment until adrenal function recovers. Other opioids may be tried as some cases reported use of a different opioid without recurrence of adrenal insufficiency. The information available does not identify any particular opioids as being more likely to be associated with adrenal insufficiency.

5.10 Severe Hypotension

Oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause severe hypotension including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Regularly evaluate these patients for signs of hypotension after initiating or titrating the dosage of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets. In patients with circulatory shock, oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with circulatory shock.

5.11 Risks of Use in Patients with Increased Intracranial Pressure, Brain Tumors, Head Injury, or Impaired Consciousness

In patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2retention (e.g., those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors), oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may reduce respiratory drive, and the resultant CO2retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy with oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets.

Opioids may also obscure the clinical course in a patient with a head injury. Avoid the use of oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets in patients with impaired consciousness or coma.

Important Discontinuation Instructions

In order to avoid developing withdrawal symptoms, instruct patients not to discontinue oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets without first discussing a tapering plan with the prescriber [see Dosage and Administration (2.9)].

Driving or Operating Heavy Machinery

Inform patients that oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may impair the ability to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating heavy machinery. Advise patients not to perform such tasks until they know how they will react to the medication [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)].

Constipation

Advise patients of the potential for severe constipation, including management instructions and when to seek medical attention [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Adrenal Insufficiency

Inform patients that opioids could cause adrenal insufficiency, a potentially life-threatening condition. Adrenal insufficiency may present with non-specific symptoms and signs such as nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Advise patients to seek medical attention if they experience a constellation of these symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].

Hypotension

Inform patients that oxymorphone hydrochloride tablets may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Instruct patients how to recognize symptoms of low blood pressure and how to reduce the risk of serious consequences should hypotension occur (e.g., sit or lie down, carefully rise from a sitting or lying position) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].

5.4 Syncope/Hypotension/Orthostatic Hypotension

Dopamine agonists, including ONAPGO, may cause orthostatic hypotension at any time, but especially during dose escalation. Patients with PD may also have an impaired capacity to respond to an orthostatic challenge. For these reasons, PD patients being treated with dopaminergic agonists should be monitored for signs and symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, especially during dose escalation, and should be informed of this risk.

When evaluated at various times after dosing in Study 1, patients undergoing titration of ONAPGO showed an increased incidence (from 4.5% pre-dose to 44.4% post-dose) of systolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 20 mm Hg decrease upon standing) compared to placebo (7.1% pre-dose to 16.3% post-dose). Similarly, increased incidences of diastolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 10 mm Hg decrease upon standing) were noted in patients titrated with ONAPGO (4.5% pre-dose to 44.4% post-dose) compared to placebo (11.9% pre-dose to 30.2% post-dose). Through the 12-week treatment period, these differences in incidence rates for systolic and diastolic orthostatic hypotension remained similar between ONAPGO and placebo patients. Patients in both ONAPGO and placebo groups developed severe systolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 40 mm Hg decrease) and/or diastolic orthostatic hypotension (≥ 20 mm Hg decrease).

Preoperative energy restriction

Preoperative energy restriction regimens have been adopted by Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI) surgeons to reduce liver volume before major UGI surgical procedures. Different regimens have been described, which could be collectively categorized as a very low-energy diet (VLED) with 450–800 kcal per day or a low-energy diet (LED) with 800–1500 kcal per day.

A systematic review including 849 patients from nine studies (three randomized clinical trials and six observational studies) found that while a VLED resulted in liver size reduction (5% — 20%), it did not significantly reduce perioperative complications. However, one study (n = 273) reported a protective effect 30 days after surgery. A recent study included 120 candidates for MBS who received a VLED for eight days only and observed a 5% reduction in body weight primarily due to loss of body fat. A recent systematic review by Romeijn MM et al. included eight studies with 251 patients and showed that LED reduced liver volume (12–27%) and achieved a 4–17% weight loss. They concluded that LED had acceptable patient adherence and could be used instead of a VLED for 2 to 4 weeks preoperatively. Besides the technical feasibility of a"liver-shrinking"diet, these regimens have proven to significantly improve liver histological features, including steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning. Dietary modification and nutritional support should be achieved under supervision by experienced teams specialized in managing patients with obesity and T2DM.

Blood pressure changes

Recent studies have shown a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) within ten days to two weeks after MBS in both hypertensive and normotensive patients, with a substantial reduction of blood pressure 6 — 12 months after MBS. These changes are more pronounced after RYGB. Orthostatic intolerance post-MBS has been reported and can present as light-headedness, dizziness, syncope, and palpitations. These findings highlight the need for early monitoring and management of blood pressure after MBS.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111g4zHT]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension management in noncardiac surgery — continuation of chronic therapy and target blood pressure: If well tolerated, beta blockers (BBs) should be continued in patients who are currently receiving them for guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) indications, and clinical judgment is useful in titrating BB during the perioperative period with a focus on continuation throughout the hospital stay and at discharge unless clear contraindications arise. In the absence of conclusive randomized controlled trials (RCTs), control of blood pressure (BP) to levels recommended by this guideline (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) or other target levels specified for a particular individual is reasonable before undertaking major elective procedures in either the inpatient or outpatient setting, and if the patient is unable to take oral medications, it is reasonable to use intravenous medications as necessary to control BP. Caution is advised when continuing antihypertensive therapy in patients with low perioperative diastolic BP (DBP), older adults (age ≥ 65 years), and patients in whom the risk for perioperative hypotension is high. Regarding renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi), evidence from a large cohort study demonstrates that patients who stopped their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome and intraoperative hypotension than those continuing these medications until surgery, whereas POISE-3 randomized 7490 patients with at least 1 high-risk factor and did not find a significant difference between perioperative discontinuation versus maintenance of ACEi/ARB therapy during the operative and immediate perioperative periods; omitted RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas RCTs have failed to prove their continuation or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

### Carvedilol (Coreg) [^113JBeP5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Available data regarding use of COREG in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there are drug-associated risks of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy. The use of beta blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression in the neonate [see Clinical Considerations]. In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. Oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in post- implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and an increased frequency of delayed fetal skeletal development at maternally toxic doses that were 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In addition, oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased post-implantation loss at doses 25 times the MRHD [see Data].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo-Fetal Risk: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions: Neonates of women with hypertension who are treated with beta-blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may be at increased risk for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression and manage accordingly.

### Pyridostigmine in the management of orthostatic hypotension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116W8XPo]. Open Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The collective evidence from six studies suggests that pyridostigmine can be an effective and safe option for certain patients with OH, particularly in patients with neurogenic OH. In most cases, pyridostigmine improved standing BP without significantly increasing supine BP. While methodological limitations in some studies call for further research, the overall findings support the consideration of pyridostigmine in appropriately selected patients. Future studies should focus on larger, well-designed trials to further validate these findings and explore the long-term benefits (> 3 months) and safety of pyridostigmine, both as a monotherapy and in combination with other agents.

### Tularemia antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis: CDC recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response-United States, 2025 [^116oUips]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

During an outbreak of F. tularensis subspecies holarctica (Type B) in Sweden, 29 hospitalized patients with severe pneumonic disease were evaluated, nine of whom also had bacteremia. The patients received either ciprofloxacin (n = four), levofloxacin (n = five), doxycycline (n = six), or a combination of these drugs with or without gentamicin (n = 14). One patient treated with doxycycline for 15 days relapsed 19 days after discharge but recovered after ciprofloxacin treatment. All five patients treated with levofloxacin monotherapy rapidly defervesced within 96 hours of treatment initiation and survived. The only death among this group occurred in a man aged 78 years with comorbidities and delayed treatment with ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.

In Central Anatolia, Turkey, a comparison of 139 cases of tularemia found no difference between the success rates of aminoglycoside and fluoroquinolone treatments. Another analysis of 142 cases of tularemia in northwestern Spain found that ciprofloxacin treatment resulted in fewer therapeutic failures (4.5% [one of 22]) when compared with streptomycin (23.4% [22 of 94]) and doxycycline (42.8% [six of 14]), although the small number of patients treated with doxycycline biased this analysis. This study also found fewer cases of sequelae among those treated with ciprofloxacin. An investigation of 177 tularemia cases in France found that patients treated with fluoroquinolones had a significantly higher rate of treatment failure (33% [14 of 43]) compared with those treated with doxycycline (9.9% [nine of 91]), although high failure rates might have been a result of treatment delays and heterogeneity in antimicrobial dosages and duration.

### Misconceptions and facts about orthostatic hypotension [^113X16Sj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Orthostatic hypotension is a highly prevalent medical condition that is an independent risk factor for falls and mortality. It reflects a condition in which autonomic reflexes are impaired or intravascular volume is depleted, causing a significant reduction in blood pressure upon standing. This disorder is frequently unrecognized until later in its clinical course. Symptoms like orthostatic dizziness do not reliably identify patients with orthostatic hypotension, who are often asymptomatic, leading further to the difficulty of this diagnosis. We summarize seven clinically important misconceptions about orthostatic hypotension.

PPCI in STEMI at PCI-capable hospitals — classed recommendations and timing: In patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) presenting ≤ 12 hours after symptom onset, PPCI should be performed with a goal of first medical contact (FMC) to device activation of ≤ 90 minutes, or ≤ 120 minutes in patients requiring hospital transfer, to improve survival. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and cardiogenic shock or hemodynamic instability, emergency revascularization of the culprit vessel by PCI or CABG is indicated to improve survival, irrespective of time from symptom onset. In patients with STEMI presenting 12 to 24 hours after symptom onset, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes. In patients with STEMI presenting > 24 hours after symptom onset with the presence of ongoing ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmia, PPCI is reasonable to improve clinical outcomes. In patients who are stable with STEMI who have a totally occluded infarct-related artery > 24 hours after symptom onset and are without evidence of ongoing ischemia, acute severe HF, or life-threatening arrhythmia, PPCI should not be performed due to lack of benefit.

Recently, a multicentre prospective cohort of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) has provided compelling evidence in an area where guidance remains poor, namely fluid strategies during the post-resuscitation period. Indeed, a positive cumulative fluid balance by day-7 was independently associated with higher 90-day mortality and worse neurological outcome. Following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), circulatory shock is common, affecting approximately 50–70% of patients. While in the early post-ROSC phase, cardiogenic shock is frequent, over the ensuing hours to days, however, the inflammatory response, typically triggered by reperfusion, may progress to distributive shock, often associated with increased endothelial permeability and relative hypovolemia. In this context, fluid requirements can vary significantly, yet evidence to guide optimal management remains limited. Therefore, we wish to contribute to this discussion by reporting data from our own retrospective single-centre cohort, which offers insights into the timing, amount, and prognostic implications of fluid balance after OHCA. Hundred-nine consecutive adult non-traumatic OHCA patients admitted to our tertiary ICU, from January 2016 to December 2024, were included in the analysis. Post-ROSC care was delivered according to current guidelines, without a standardized fluid management protocol. Available data included demographic and cardiac arrest-related variables, Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at ICU admission, vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS), hemodynamic parameters, arterial lactate levels and pH, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratios, and serum creatinine. Daily fluid intake (i.v. crystalloids, medications, nutrition; excluding blood products) and output (urine and ultrafiltration, if initiated) were recorded for up to 96 h after ICU admission. Fluid balance was calculated as intake minus output and indexed to body weight, with a positive balance defined as greater than zero. The mean daily balance over the observation period (i.e. 96 h or until discharge or death) was calculated for each patient. Associations with ICU mortality were analysed with multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for age, SOFA score and VIS score. To assess potential bias from evolving clinical practices over time, a linear trend analysis of fluid intake and balance was conducted. Sixty-four patients (59%) were discharged alive from the ICU. Compared to survivors, non-survivors had significantly higher SOFA and VIS scores, arterial lactate levels, serum creatinine level, and lower mean arterial pressure (p < 0.01). No other differences were observed. Over the first 96 h post-ROSC, non-survivors received higher daily mean fluid intake (42 mL/kg vs. 35 mL/kg, p = 0.012), had lower daily mean urine output (1724 mL vs. 2067 ml, p = 0.03), and accumulated a markedly higher positive daily mean fluid balance (18 mL/kg vs. 8 mL/kg, p < 0.01). After adjustment for SOFA score, group differences in urine output and fluid balance remained significant beyond 72 h (Fig. 1). A negative linear trend in fluid intake (β = -1.53, p = 0.004) and fluid balance (β = -1.28, p = 0.018), expressed as ml/kg, was found over the years of enrollment. In the multivariate logistic regression model, 1 mL/kg increment in daily mean fluid balance was independently associated with ICU mortality (OR 1.06[1.02–1.10], p = 0.002; Fig. 1D). Previous studies in other critically ill populations, including sepsis, traumatic brain injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, have consistently shown that positive fluid balance is associated with worse outcomes. In the post-ROSC phase, evidence of fluid management and its impact on outcomes remains limited. Our data indicate that post-resuscitation patients receive substantial fluid volumes, with a daily mean intake over the first 96 h exceeding 2.5 L (~ 38 mL/kg). This pattern likely reflects initial hemodynamic instability, early resuscitation requirements, and the evolving course of post-cardiac arrest syndrome, characterized by dynamic shifts from cardiogenic to distributive shock. These results strengthen the association between sustained positive fluid balance and adverse outcome, as recently reported by Renaudier et al. In their study, 74% of patients had a positive fluid balance, compared with 81% in our cohort, possibly reflecting differences in illness severity or variations in clinical practice/intensity treatment, including vasopressor use which was more frequent in their population (maximum VIS 41 vs. 11 in ours). Additionally, their analysis extended to 7 days post-resuscitation, whereas ours focused on the first 96 h; a longer follow-up period may increase the likelihood of achieving a negative fluid balance. Despite these differences, our findings reinforce their conclusions and suggest that a more restrictive fluid management strategy, especially in the first 4 days post–ROSC, could improve outcomes. This study has several limitations. Our single-centre, retrospective design and modest sample size limit generalisability and precluded survival analyses. The extended recruitment period may have introduced variability in clinical practice. Although we observed a statistically significant downward trend in fluid intake over the years, the annual decrease was, however, minimal (≈ 1.5 mL/kg) and unlikely to be clinically relevant. Nevertheless, these findings underscore the need for individualised fluid management strategies that carefully balance early resuscitation needs with the risk of fluid overload following ROSC Fig. 1.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115CfQ7J]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Campylobacter species in people with HIV — culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing is recommended (BIII); in U.S. 2018 data, 29% of C. jejuni isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 2% to azithromycin, and among C. coli isolates, 41% were resistant to fluoroquinolones and 13% to azithromycin. For people with mild disease and CD4 counts > 200 cells/mm3, therapy should be withheld unless symptoms persist for more than several days (CIII). For mild-to-moderate campylobacteriosis, initiating therapy with azithromycin for 5 days or a fluoroquinolone — such as ciprofloxacin — for 7 to 10 days (if the organism is sensitive) is recommended (BIII). Azithromycin susceptibility testing is not widely available in clinical laboratories but can be performed by many state public health laboratories. Campylobacter bacteremia should be treated for at least 14 days using a fluoroquinolone if the isolate is sensitive (BIII), and adding a second active agent — such as an aminoglycoside — may be prudent in patients with bacteremia to limit the emergence of antibiotic resistance (BIII). Third generation cephalosporins are not reliably active and alternative cell-wall active agents such as carbapenems may be necessary in severely ill people requiring empiric parenteral therapy until antimicrobial susceptibilities return. Azithromycin is not recommended for treatment of Campylobacter bacteremia (AIII), and chronic suppressive or maintenance therapy is not recommended for first-time Campylobacter infections in people with HIV (BIII). Recurrent infections can occur, particularly in people with CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3, and in recurrent disease, extending antimicrobial therapy for 2 to 6 weeks is reasonable (BIII); suppression of HIV replication with ART is expected to decrease the risk of recurrent Campylobacter spp. infections.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (5.1)
Peritonitis: Initiate appropriate antimicrobial therapy (5.1)
Monitor for lactic acidosis in patients at risk (5.2)
Monitor for electrolyte, fluid, and nutrition imbalances (5.4)

5.1 Peritonitis and Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis

Peritonitis has been associated with DIANEAL peritoneal dialysis solution use. Following use, inspect the drained fluid for the presence of fibrin or cloudiness, which may indicate the presence of peritonitis. Improper clamping or priming sequence may result in infusion of air into the peritoneal cavity, which may result in abdominal pain and/or peritonitis. If peritonitis occurs, treat with appropriate therapy.

Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis (EPS), sometimes fatal, is a complication of peritoneal dialysis therapy and has been reported in patients using DIANEAL solutions.

5.2 Lactic Acidosis

Monitor patients with conditions known to increase the risk of lactic acidosis [e.g., severe hypotension or sepsis that can be associated with acute renal failure, hepatic failure, inborn errors of metabolism, and treatment with drugs such as nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)] before the start of treatment and during treatment with lactate-based peritoneal dialysis solutions. Use of DIANEAL solutions in patients with severe lactic acidosis is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

5.3 Overinfusion

Overinfusion of peritoneal dialysis solution volume into the peritoneal cavity may be characterized by abdominal distention, feeling of fullness and/or shortness of breath. Drain the peritoneal dialysis solution from the peritoneal cavity to treat overinfusion.

5.4 Electrolyte, Fluid, and Nutrition Imbalances

Peritoneal dialysis may affect a patient's protein, water-soluble vitamin, potassium, bicarbonate, calcium, and magnesium levels and volume status. Monitor hematology, electrolytes, blood chemistry and fluid status periodically and take appropriate clinical action.

Potassium is omitted from DIANEAL solutions because dialysis may be performed to correct hyperkalemia. In situations where there is a normal serum potassium level or hypokalemia, addition of potassium chloride (up to a concentration of 4 mEq/L) to the solution may be necessary to prevent severe hypokalemia. Monitor fluid status to avoid hyper- or hypovolemia and potentially severe consequences including congestive heart failure, volume depletion and hypovolemic shock.

5.5 Hyperglycemia

DIANEAL solutions contain dextrose and may increase the risk for hyperglycemia in patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Patients may require initiation or modification of antidiabetic therapy during treatment with DIANEAL solutions. Monitor blood glucose.

### Prasugrel [^115bG4Tm]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 General Risk of Bleeding

Thienopyridines, including prasugrel tablets, increase the risk of bleeding. With the dosing regimens used in TRITON-TIMI 38, TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Major (clinically overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin ≥ 5 g/dL, or intracranial hemorrhage) and TIMI Minor (overt bleeding associated with a fall in hemoglobin of ≥ 3 g/dL but < 5 g/dL) bleeding events were more common on prasugrel tablets than on clopidogrel [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The bleeding risk is highest initially, as shown in Figure 1 (events through 450 days; inset shows events through 7 days).

Figure 1: Non-CABG-Related TIMI Major or Minor Bleeding Events.

Suspect bleeding in any patient who is hypotensive and has recently undergone coronary angiography, PCI, CABG, or other surgical procedures even if the patient does not have overt signs of bleeding.

Do not use prasugrel tablets in patients with active bleeding, prior TIA or stroke [see Contraindications (4.1, 4.2)].

Other risk factors for bleeding are:

Age ≥ 75 years. Because of the risk of bleeding (including fatal bleeding) and uncertain effectiveness in patients ≥ 75 years of age, use of prasugrel tablets is generally not recommended in these patients, except in high-risk situations (patients with diabetes or history of myocardial infarction) where its effect appears to be greater and its use may be considered [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Trials (14)].
CABG or other surgical procedure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
Body weight < 60 kg. Consider a lower (5 mg) maintenance dose [see Dosage and Administration (2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Propensity to bleed (e.g., recent trauma, recent surgery, recent or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, active peptic ulcer disease, severe hepatic impairment, or moderate to severe renal impairment) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7, 8.8)].
Medications that increase the risk of bleeding (e.g., oral anticoagulants, chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and fibrinolytic agents). Aspirin and heparin were commonly used in TRITON-TIMI 38 [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2, 7.4), and Clinical Studies (14)].

### Management of rotator cuff injuries [^117C5PPK]. AAOS (2025). High credibility.

Post-op mobilization timing — arthroscopic rotator cuff repair: Postoperative clinical and patient-reported outcomes are similar for small to medium-sized full-thickness rotator cuff tears managed with early mobilization or delayed mobilization (delayed up to 8 weeks), supported by Quality of Evidence: High and Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Across randomized trials, mobilization timing compared initiation within 0–2 weeks versus 4–8 weeks post-operatively, and for nearly all measures early and delayed mobilization paradigms yield similar outcomes; early mobilization favors improved range of motion and quality of life measures, but these differences become negligible by 6 months post-operatively. Delayed mobilization until 4–8 weeks is associated with higher rates of post-operative healing, although these differences do not reach statistical significance in the best available evidence; post-operative healing was analyzed by ultrasound and/or MRI from 7 days through up to 2 years post-operatively.

### The factors determining early mobilization in elderly patients undergoing total knee replacement [^112XpfDu]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Various factors were reported to hinder TKR patients participating in early mobilization out of bed, including advanced age, body weight, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, cognitive abilities, wound pain, swelling, postoperative nausea/vomiting (PONV), dizziness, low blood pressure, or postoperative acute delirium. Proper pain management strategies effectively alleviated postoperative pain along with PONV and encouraged patients to comply with immediate rehabilitation exercises after TKR. However, there are inconsistent findings in the literature on the leading factors and it has been suggested that sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and ASA score did not influence patients' early mobilization after surgery. A consensus has not been reached regarding the determining factors of EM within 24 h and the results are still conflicting.

Excessive blood loss after TKR, typically ranging from 886 to 1,450 mL, is common and can lead to post-operative hypovolemia and hypotension, which should be managed using some postoperative protocols or medication. Significant changes in blood pressure, leading to postoperative hypotension, drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, syncope or orthostatic hypotension (OH), may hinder early mobilization following major orthopedic surgeries. However, the real hypotension was uncommon after TKR. Furthermore, previous research has not elucidated whether blood pressure changes after TKR influence a patient's EM. Clarifying the relevant factors affecting post-TKR mobilization capacity is crucial to provide clinicians with information that may help address the changes in perioperative factors and to further adjust them, thereby enhancing the benefits of early mobilization after TKR.

This study aims to explore the determining factors affecting successful early mobilization after primary TKR and assess the relative outcomes associated with early mobilization, including the risk of falls and length of stay. We hypothesized that maintaining post-operative blood pressure without significant decreases of blood pressure is associated with successful mobilization within 24 h of surgery, and that early mobilization could reduce LOS without increasing fall risk after TKR surgery.

### Pediatric advanced life support. pediatric shock care [^114VAo5u]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric shock fluid resuscitation — insights and implications emphasize goals and monitoring: The main goal of fluid resuscitation is to restore intravascular volume to reverse cellular hypoxia and ischemia before irreversible end-organ damage occurs, and monitoring of patient response to fluid resuscitation should be ongoing. Always assess the child or infant after each fluid bolus and discontinue fluid administration if clinical signs or symptoms of hypervolemia develop. Packed red blood cells or whole blood may be indicated in combination with isotonic crystalloids for volume resuscitation in hemorrhagic shock to optimize hemoglobin concentration and hence oxygen delivery in shock.

World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of trauma systems worldwide have specific protocols for transfusion of patients following major injury, usually including aspects of fluid restriction/permissive hypotension in the presurgical phase, with restoration of volume after hemorrhage control. These systems describe the activation; administration, use of ratios of packed red blood cells, plasma, and platelets; the use of coagulation adjuncts; the management of the metabolic factors, which contribute to normal coagulation; and the endpoints of resuscitation. As this is a large and rapidly evolving area of the scientific literature, these protocols require frequent updates and modifications. Adaptation to LMICs with limited blood resources also should be considered.

Retrospective analyses of civilian trauma registries and retrospective studies have shown an association between the use of whole blood and improved survival in trauma patients. Prospective studies are awaited before recommendations can be made regarding the use of whole blood as the primary resuscitation fluid in trauma patients. Considering blood component resuscitation, the timing of plasma administration and the ratio of plasma to red cell administration appears to be important. Early plasma administration in the prehospital environment has resulted in improved survival, in the context of long transport times.

### Relationship between inter-pregnancy interval and risk of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes in subsequent twin pregnancies [^112VNNuE]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome analysis

The primary outcome of this study was a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes associated with fetal growth, encompassing PTB < 34 weeks, the incidence of LBW/LBW, LBW/NBW, and VLBW or ELBW for at least one twin. This classification was based on the clinical severity of LBW, VLBW, and ELBW, which is strongly associated with increased neonatal mortality and morbidity. Stratifying these groups facilitates more accurate risk assessment and optimal resource allocation. Considering only eight infants were born with ELBW, we combined cases where one or both twins had VLBW or ELBW into a single category.

The secondary outcome was a composite of adverse maternal outcomes related to blood loss, including PPH and MHM. In our study, quantitative blood loss measurements were obtained by assessing the accumulated blood volume in the suction canister and weighing the surgical pads before and after the procedure. Specifically, upon entering the uterine cavity and rupturing the membranes, amniotic fluid was aspirated using a dedicated suction system and recorded separately. Following placental delivery and uterine repair, all suctioned fluid was collected into a new canister. Blood loss was calculated as the sum of the suctioned fluid volume post-placental delivery and the weight difference of the surgical pads (pre- vs. post-operative). Additionally, the surgical team visually confirmed the transition from clear/yellowish amniotic fluid to red/clotted blood during both phases. PPH was defined as a cumulative blood loss of ≥ 1000 mL following the cesarean Sect. MHM was a composite outcome defined as significant blood loss requiring emergency interventions. It was assessed by expert obstetricians based on estimated blood loss volume, laboratory results, hemodynamic stability, and clinical presentation, to prevent or manage substantial blood loss. Although our study did not predefine a strict blood loss threshold for MHM, retrospective analysis revealed that the minimum observed blood loss associated with MHM in this study was 800 ml. This aligns with the ACOG 2017 guidelines, which indicate that clinical interventions often precede reaching the 1,000 mL threshold, particularly in high-risk patients.

### Carvedilol phosphate (Coreg CR) [^1119YpcZ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Risk Summary

Available data regarding use of COREG CR in pregnant women are insufficient to determine whether there are drug-associated risks of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy. The use of beta blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may increase the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression in the neonate (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes at clinically relevant doses (see Data). Oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in post-implantation loss, decreased fetal body weight, and an increased frequency of delayed fetal skeletal development at maternally toxic doses that were 50 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). In addition, oral administration of carvedilol to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased post-implantation loss at doses 25 times the MRHD (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk: Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly.

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions: Neonates of women with hypertension who are treated with beta-blockers during the third trimester of pregnancy may be at increased risk for hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression. Observe newborns for symptoms of hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia, and respiratory depression and manage accordingly.

### Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Sulfatrim) [^112VcXys]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity and Other Serious or Fatal Reactions

Fatalities and serious adverse reactions including severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), acute generalized erythematous pustulosis (AGEP); fulminant hepatic necrosis; agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia and other blood dyscrasias; acute and delayed lung injury; anaphylaxis and circulatory shock have occurred with the administration of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products,(see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions of the Respiratory Tract Cough, shortness of breath, and pulmonary infiltrates potentially representing hypersensitivity reactions of the respiratory tract have been reported in association with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim treatment.

Respiratory Failure

Other severe pulmonary adverse reactions occurring within days to weeks of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim initiation and resulting in prolonged respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), lung transplantation or death have also been reported in patients and otherwise healthy individuals treated with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim products.

Circulatory Shock Circulatory shock with fever, severe hypotension, and confusion requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation and vasopressors has occurred within minutes to hours of re-challenge with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole products in patients with history of recent (days to weeks) exposure to sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim.

Management of Hypersensitivity and Other Serious Reactions

Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim should be discontinued at the first appearance of skin rash or any sign of a serious adverse reaction. A skin rash may be followed by a more severe reaction, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, DRESS, AFND, AGEP, hepatic necrosis, or serious blood disorders (see PRECAUTIONS and ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical signs, such as rash, pharyngitis, fever, arthralgia, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, pallor, purpura or jaundice may be early indications of serious reactions.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis

Cases of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) have been reported in patients treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. HLH is a life-threatening syndrome of pathologic immune activation characterized by clinical signs and symptoms of extreme systemic inflammation. Signs and symptoms of HLH may include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, rash, lymphadenopathy, neurologic symptoms, cytopenias, high serum ferritin, hypertriglyceridemia, and liver enzyme and coagulation abnormalities. If HLH is suspected, discontinue sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim immediately and institute appropriate management.

### Advanced life support. initial management of sepsis and septic shock in adults [^1121c3Zs]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Septic shock — practical targets and dosing with vasopressors: In summary, norepinephrine should be used as a first-line vasopressor, with epinephrine and dopamine as alternatives if not available, and a MAP of 65 mmHg should be targeted for patients with septic shock receiving vasopressors. Healthcare professionals may consider initiating invasive monitoring of arterial blood pressure monitoring and, if central access has not been obtained, consider starting vasopressors peripherally. Should MAP targets not be met despite low-to-moderate dose norepinephrine, healthcare professionals may consider adding vasopressin; the usual dose range for norepinephrine is 0.25 to 0.5 micrograms per kilogram per minute, and if the MAP remains inadequate, healthcare professionals may consider adding epinephrine.

Perioperative renin–angiotensin system inhibitors (ACEi/ARB) and outcomes — noncardiac surgery: Data on the potential risk and benefit of ACEi in the perioperative setting are controversial. A large cohort study found that patients who stopped their ACEi or ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to suffer the primary composite outcome and intraoperative hypotension than those continuing therapy, whereas POISE-3, which randomized 7490 patients, did not find a significant difference between strategies of perioperative discontinuation versus maintenance during the operative and immediate perioperative periods. Omitting RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas randomized controlled trials have failed to prove that interruption or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

### The role of older antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections: current perspectives [^116BCrDn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to discuss the evidence and recent literature on the role of older antibiotics in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs).

Recent Findings

The choice of therapy for SSTIs is complicated in view of the rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the availability of new antibiotics. SSTIs are predominantly caused by Staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococci, but other organisms can be involved in patients with comorbidities or post trauma. Treatment options are dictated by the accessibility and cost of newer antibiotics in resource-constrained settings. 'Old antibiotics' including β-lactams, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), clindamycin, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin remain good choices in treating SSTIs. They offer affordable options for outpatient settings. Only few randomized trials have addressed the role of the old agents in SSTIs treatment. Studies suggest that these agents remain effective for empirical and targeted therapy based on the epidemiological context. Ongoing surveillance and clinical trials are needed to assess the role of these agents and to integrate them into modern SSTIs management, supporting sustainable treatment models in both high-income and low-income settings.

Summary

Older antibiotics can be effectively used in treating SSTIs, provided their use is guided by current epidemiological data or culture and susceptibility results.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112c2De6]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial enteric infections — empiric therapy pending definitive diagnosis provides stratified preferred therapy by immune status and severity. For People With HIV and CD4 Count > 500 Cells/mm3, 1–2 Days of Loose Stool Without Fever or Blood in Stool, management includes Oral hydration, no further workup, and no antibiotics. For People With HIV and CD4 Count 200–500 Cells/mm3 With Diarrhea Severe Enough to Compromise Quality of Life or the Ability to Work, options include Azithromycin 500 mg PO daily for 5 days (BIII), or Ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg PO every 12 hours for 5 days (BIII). For People With HIV and Severe Disease (e.g. CD4 Count < 200 Cells/mm3 or Concomitant AIDS-Defining Illness and With Clinically Severe Diarrhea [≥ 6 Liquid Stools Per Day or Bloody Stool and/or Accompanying Fever or Chills]), actions include Hospitalization for diagnostic evaluation and IV antibiotics and Ceftriaxone IV 1–2 g every 24 hours (BIII), with Note: If Campylobacter or Shigella bacteremia is suspected, a carbapenem is preferred (BIII). Therapy and duration should be adjusted based on microbiology and antibiotic sensitivity results, and if no pathogen is identified and the patient recovers quickly, 5 days of therapy is recommended. Diagnostic fecal specimens should be obtained before initiation of empiric antimicrobial therapy, and if a pathogen is identified, antibiotic susceptibilities should be performed to confirm and inform antibiotic choices, given increased reports of antibiotic resistance. Oral or IV rehydration (if indicated) should be given to patients with diarrhea (AIII), and Antimotility agents should be avoided if there is concern about inflammatory diarrhea, including CDI (BIII). If no clinical response is observed after 3–4 days, consider a follow-up stool culture with antibiotic susceptibility testing or alternative diagnostic tests to evaluate alternative diagnoses, antibiotic resistance, or drug–drug interaction (BIII).

### Tularemia antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis: CDC recommendations for naturally acquired infections and bioterrorism response-United States, 2025 [^113YLdtN]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

This report provides CDC recommendations to U.S. health care providers and preparedness personnel regarding treatment and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) of tularemia, an uncommon but potentially serious disease caused by the gram-negative coccobacillus, Francisella tularensis. Tularemia occurs naturally in the United States and other Northern Hemisphere regions. Because F. tularensis has a low infectious inoculum, it is classified as a potential bioterrorism agent that could infect thousands of persons if intentionally released, requiring rapid, informed decision-making by public health agencies, first responders, and clinicians. To mitigate the effects of a bioterrorism attack, the U.S. government stockpiles medical countermeasures, and the 21st Century Cures Act mandates development of evidence-based guidelines for their use. Since 2001 when guidelines for tularemia treatment and PEP were last published, new animal study data and human clinical data have become available. CDC compiled a broad evidence base by conducting a series of systematic reviews of the literature on human tularemia through 2023, analyzing U.S. surveillance data, gathering outbreak reports and case series, and collecting animal data. During a series of scientific forums, evidence was presented from these investigations and additional data sources to subject matter experts, and individual expert input on proposed recommendations was solicited. The guidelines team then assessed the available evidence, considered different perspectives and feedback shared in the expert forums, and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation summary of findings and the Evidence to Decision framework to formulate recommendations based on the balance of benefits and harms. Notable changes include use of a treatment and prophylaxis framework; designation of fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin) and doxycycline as first-line treatment options for outbreaks of any size; identification of third-tier treatment options when first-line and alternative antimicrobials are unavailable or contraindicated for certain patients; and recommendations for neonates, breastfeeding infants, lactating mothers, patients with immunocompromise, and geriatric patients. These guidelines provide a summary of best practices for treatment and prophylaxis of human tularemia for both naturally occurring disease and after a bioterrorism attack. They do not include information on dispensing medical countermeasures, diagnostic testing, triage decisions, or adjunct treatments for patients with tularemia. Health care providers can use these guidelines to manage patients with naturally occurring infection and, with public health officials, prepare their organizations, clinics, hospitals, and communities to respond to a tularemia mass exposure event.

Renin–angiotensin system inhibitor therapy in chronic kidney disease — practice points are as follows: Hyperkalemia associated with use of RASi can often be managed by measures to reduce the serum potassium levels rather than decreasing the dose or stopping RASi. Continue ACEi or ARB therapy unless serum creatinine rises by more than 30% within 4 weeks following initiation of treatment or an increase in dose. Consider reducing the dose or discontinuing ACEi or ARB in the setting of either symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hyperkalemia despite medical treatment, or to reduce uremic symptoms while treating kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 15 ml/min per 1.73 m²). Consider starting people with CKD with normal to mildly increased albuminuria (A1) on RASi (ACEi or ARB) for specific indications (e.g., to treat hypertension or heart failure with low ejection fraction). Continue ACEi or ARB in people with CKD even when the eGFR falls below 30 ml/min per 1.73 m².

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria.

Clindamycin Injection, USP is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the BOXED WARNING, before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin).

Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin.

Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy.

Clindamycin Injection, USP is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below:

Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (except E. faecalis), and Staphylococcus aureus.

Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobes.

Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes.

Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms.

Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis), and susceptible anaerobes.

Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Clindamycin Injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, Clindamycin Injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Red Cross guidelines — initial resuscitation of adults with sepsis and septic shock state that patients "should be treated immediately and resuscitated, to include:" administering at least 30 milliliters per kilogram of intravenous crystalloid fluid within the first 3 hours of resuscitation of patients with sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock and use of dynamic parameters, such as response to passive leg raise or fluid bolus, stroke volume variation or pulse pressure variation over static parameters or physical examination alone to guide fluid resuscitation. They also include using capillary refill time as an adjunct to other measures of perfusion to help guide resuscitation, with use of capillary refill time to guide resuscitation accompanied by frequent and repeated comprehensive patient evaluation to predict or improve early recognition of fluid overload. Additional guidance includes using a decrease in serum lactate to help guide fluid resuscitation of patients with an elevated lactate level and using an initial target mean arterial pressure of 65 mmHg for septic shock requiring vasopressors.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension — ACEi/ARB and RAAS inhibitor (RAASi) management: Observational data show patients who stopped their ACEi or ARB 24 hours before noncardiac surgery were less likely to have the composite of all-cause death, stroke, or myocardial injury and intraoperative hypotension versus those who continued, but POISE-3 randomized 7490 patients and did not find a significant difference between discontinuation and maintenance strategies during the operative and immediate perioperative periods. Omitted RAASi before surgery has been shown to reduce intraoperative hypotension, whereas randomized controlled trials have failed to prove continuation or implementation improves clinical outcomes.

Orthostatic hypotension (OH) considerations during intensive BP treatment: In trials assessing intensive BP control, there was no evidence for harm among those with standing hypotension (SBP < 110 mm Hg). In a post-hoc NAILED study analysis, the population (n = 814, 35% experiencing OH at least once) showed that intensification of BP control was not associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events or death in this stroke/TIA population. Systematic titration of antihypertensive treatment did not increase the prevalence of OH compared with usual care, and there is emerging evidence that OH does not reduce the gains of intensive antihypertensive treatment. For practice, an assessment for OH in symptomatic patients, particularly after initiation of treatment or adding a new class of antihypertensive medication, is acceptable to detect unmasked autonomic system dysfunction or other acute or chronic conditions.

Safety endpoints

Interaction by ACEi/ARB status was non‐significant for all adverse events of special interest (p interaction > 0.1) (Table 3). Compared with Val, Sac/Val had more events of hypotension in both ACEi/ARB naïve and ACEi/ARB users. However, fewer events of worsening renal function were observed in the Sac/Val group, irrespective of ACEi/ARB status (Table 3). For the subgroups of patients with baseline EF ≤ 60%, similar findings were found for worsening renal function, whilst more events of hypotension were only reported for previous ACEi/ARB users (online supplementary Table S11). Conversely, for the subgroup of patients with EF > 60%, both hyperkalaemia and worsening renal function were seen more with Sac/Val for those who were ACEi/ARB naïve, but not for ACEi/ARB users (online supplementary Table S12).

Empiric antimicrobial therapy for acute diarrhea in adults and adolescents with HIV — CD4 count and severity–based approach: In patients with CD4 counts > 500 cells/mm3 who have had 1 to 2 days of loose stools without fever or blood, no further work-up and no treatment other than oral rehydration may be required. A short course of antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin for 5 days [BIII]) may be indicated for CD4 counts of 200 to 500 cells/mm3 with function-limiting diarrhea, whereas severe disease (CD4 counts < 200 cells/mm3 or AIDS-defining illness with clinically severe diarrhea [i.e., ≥ 6 liquid stools per day or bloody stools or fewer liquid stools with fever or chills]) should prompt inpatient evaluation and parenteral antimicrobial treatment (AIII). In stable patients, empiric therapy with oral ciprofloxacin (BIII) or azithromycin (BIII) is recommended, particularly if the infection is not associated with international travel, but careful follow-up is needed due to substantial resistance; if Campylobacter or Shigella bacteremia is suspected, a carbapenem is preferred for empiric therapy (BIII).

Treatment of Skin Infections

Bacterial Infections

Effective management of recurrent skin infections involves identifying and treating the underlying microbiologic agent, and implementing infection prevention measures. If left untreated, skin infections can become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications.

Topical and systemic antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics should only be used in clinically affected AD, as indiscriminate use increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a therapeutic challenge. Choice of treatment depends on local patterns of antibacterial resistance, particularly the prevalence of MRSA. Culture of the causative pathogen is recommended to guide therapy, but empiric therapy is reasonable in uncomplicated cases or before culture results become available.

Table 2 summarises the guideline-recommended antibacterial options for empiric treatment of skin infections and when they are indicated. Topical antibacterial agents can be used for the treatment of localised skin infections and decolonisation. For uncomplicated, non-purulent skin infections, preferred empiric antibacterial treatments are usually oral β-lactam antibiotics, such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. In patients with AD and a skin abscess, oral antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or linezolid can be considered. Infections occurring in countries/regions with a high prevalence of MRSA require treatment with agents that are active against MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin, tetracyclines [doxycycline or minocycline], vancomycin or linezolid) and complicated infections may require agents active against Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam). MRSA-associated AD flares are difficult to treat with TCS because of corticosteroid resistance induced by staphylococcal superantigens. In such a situation, prolonged use of corticosteroids may lead to skin atrophy and adrenal insufficiency, so alternative AD therapy should be considered.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative hypertension — blood pressure (BP) targets and surgical timing: Expert opinion states BP control to levels recommended by this guideline (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) before major elective procedures is reasonable, and if oral agents cannot be used, intravenous medications are reasonable to control BP. Caution is advised when continuing therapy in patients with low perioperative BPs, older adults (age ≥ 65 years), and those at high risk for perioperative hypotension. Evidence is conflicting for delaying surgery when diastolic BP (DBP) is > 110 mm Hg; preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications, and increased cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal failure has been reported with DBP > 110 mm Hg, whereas DBP < 110 mm Hg does not appear to confer significantly increased risk. During anesthesia induction, a sympathetic reaction can produce a 20 to 30 mm Hg BP rise in patients with normal BP. An elevated day-of-surgery BP may reflect white-coat hypertension; referring to baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide management. Without evidence of increased perioperative risk when preoperative SBP/DBP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery, and BP can be managed postoperatively or after discharge.
