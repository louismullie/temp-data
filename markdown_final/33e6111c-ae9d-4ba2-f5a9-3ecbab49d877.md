## Question

my 13 year old has had all the recommended vaccines so far except for hpv i just want to check if its recommended to start now or if i should wait i read online about ages 11–12 but what if i missed that window

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether their 13-year-old should start the HPV vaccine series now or wait, and what the dosing schedule should be after missing the routine 11–12 year window. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current ACIP/CDC catch-up recommendations. Then, I should verify the age-based dosing rules for 2 versus 3 doses. Next, I will consider immunogenicity and effectiveness at this age. After that, I should review safety and any precautions. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and next steps, including what to do if the interval between doses is too short.

> Let me first confirm the catch-up recommendation. ACIP recommends HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, so at 13 years old your child is absolutely eligible and should start now rather than wait, because catch-up is intended for exactly this situation and vaccination remains most effective before sexual exposure [^dbc9f0d9] [^0aae4512] [^788fa9b7].

> Wait, let me verify the dosing schedule because it depends on age at first dose. If the first dose is given before the 15th birthday, only 2 doses are needed, spaced 6 to 12 months apart; if the interval between dose 1 and dose 2 is less than 5 months, a third dose is required to ensure adequate immunogenicity, whereas those who start at age 15 or older, or who are immunocompromised, need a 3-dose schedule at 0, 1–2, and 6 months [^68e71260] [^0aae4512] [^3521b81e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about waiting for a "better time". I should confirm the immunologic rationale. Vaccination at younger ages produces higher antibody titers and stronger immune responses, and effectiveness is greatest before HPV exposure; while 13 is slightly older than the routine 11–12 window, it is still pre-exposure for most adolescents and yields excellent protection, so delaying would only increase the chance of exposure without benefit [^89182cb5] [^a6edfdc8] [^028b9cff].

> I need to check safety and practical considerations. HPV vaccines have a strong safety record with more than 120 million doses administered in the U.S., syncope can occur in adolescents, so observing for 15 minutes after vaccination is prudent, and the vaccine can be coadministered with other adolescent vaccines such as Tdap and meningococcal vaccines, which is convenient and recommended [^783980ac] [^54f293fd] [^0d353ab6].

> Let me synthesize the bottom line. Yes, start the HPV series now at age 13. Your child will need 2 doses if the first dose is given before age 15, with the second dose 6 to 12 months later, and if the interval is shorter than 5 months, a third dose will be needed; if you delay and start at age 15 or older, a 3-dose schedule is required, so starting now keeps it simpler and timely [^68e71260] [^0aae4512] [^3521b81e].

> Next, I should review concrete steps. Schedule the first dose as soon as possible, plan the second dose for 6 to 12 months later, and confirm that the interval is at least 5 months to avoid needing a third dose; if your child is immunocompromised or becomes so, switch to a 3-dose schedule regardless of age, and remember that no HPV test or Pap is needed before vaccination and that vaccination does not replace future cervical cancer screening when indicated [^0aae4512] [^783980ac].

Start the HPV vaccine series **now** at age 13 [^dbc9f0d9]. The CDC recommends routine HPV vaccination at 11–12 years, but catch-up vaccination is recommended through age 26 for those who missed it [^0aae4512]. At 13, your child still qualifies for the **2-dose schedule** (0 and 6–12 months) if started before age 15, which provides excellent protection [^68e71260] [^a6edfdc8]. Delaying increases the risk of HPV exposure and may require a 3-dose series if started at 15 or older [^0aae4512]. The vaccine is safe, effective, and prevents multiple cancers; no additional testing is needed before vaccination [^783980ac] [^0da03180].

---

## Current recommendations for HPV vaccination

The CDC and ACIP recommend **routine HPV vaccination at age 11–12 years**, but the series can start as early as age 9 [^0aae4512] [^3521b81e]. Catch-up vaccination is recommended for all individuals through age 26 who are not adequately vaccinated [^dbc9f0d9] [^fda9e25a]. For those aged 27–45, shared clinical decision-making is advised, but routine vaccination is not recommended for all in this group [^ca7b9075] [^b3a076c1].

---

## Dosing schedule based on age

The dosing schedule depends on the **age at initiation**:

| **Age at initiation** | **Dosing schedule** |
|-|-|
| 9–14 years | 2 doses, 6–12 months apart [^68e71260] [^a6edfdc8] |
| 15–26 years | 3 doses at 0, 1–2, and 6 months [^0aae4512] [^783980ac] |
| Immunocompromised individuals (any age) | 3 doses at 0, 1–2, and 6 months [^0aae4512] [^783980ac] |

---

Since your child is 13, the **2-dose schedule applies** if the first dose is given before age 15 [^68e71260] [^a6edfdc8].

---

## Benefits of starting now

Starting now provides **several advantages**:

- **Optimal immune response**: Vaccination at younger ages yields higher antibody titers and stronger, longer-lasting immunity [^89182cb5] [^a6edfdc8].
- **Protection before exposure**: HPV is commonly acquired after sexual debut; vaccinating now reduces the risk of infection and future HPV-related diseases [^a6edfdc8] [^d67b6386].
- **Simpler schedule**: The 2-dose series is easier to complete than the 3-dose series required for older adolescents and adults [^68e71260] [^cc602a1c].

---

## Risks of delaying vaccination

Delaying vaccination can **increase the risk** of HPV exposure and infection, as sexual activity often begins in adolescence [^a6edfdc8] [^d92c4888]. If vaccination starts at age 15 or older, a 3-dose schedule is required, which may reduce completion rates and delay protection [^0aae4512] [^f6434667].

---

## Safety and effectiveness of the HPV vaccine

The HPV vaccine has an **excellent safety record**, with over 120 million doses administered in the U.S. and robust safety monitoring data [^783980ac] [^16aff043]. It is highly effective at preventing HPV infections and related diseases, including cervical, anal, and oropharyngeal cancers, as well as genital warts [^d1dfa63c] [^4c50be0a].

---

## Addressing common concerns

Parents often have concerns about HPV vaccination, including:

- **Sexual activity**: The vaccine does not increase sexual activity or risk behaviors [^783980ac] [^bcd12cb0].
- **Safety**: The vaccine is safe, with no serious safety signals identified in large-scale studies [^783980ac] [^16aff043].
- **Necessity**: HPV vaccination is recommended for all adolescents, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, to prevent HPV-related diseases [^c8b1e324] [^16aff043].

---

## Practical steps for vaccination

To proceed with vaccination:

- **Schedule an appointment**: Contact your child's healthcare provider to schedule the first dose as soon as possible [^3521b81e].
- **Plan for the second dose**: Ensure the second dose is scheduled 6–12 months after the first dose to complete the series [^68e71260] [^a6edfdc8].
- **Discuss concerns**: Address any questions or concerns with your healthcare provider to make an informed decision [^62ccc2a4].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Start the HPV vaccine series **now** at age 13. Your child still qualifies for the 2-dose schedule, and delaying increases the risk of HPV exposure and may complicate the dosing schedule. The vaccine is safe, effective, and prevents multiple cancers; no additional testing is required before vaccination [^783980ac] [^0da03180].

### Human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV)… [^54f293fd]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite overwhelming evidence of the safety and effectiveness of the human papillomavirus vaccine, vaccination rates remain low. The American Academy of Family Physicians urges physicians to strongly recommend the HPV vaccine to their patients. Physicians give consistent, strong recommendations for the H PV vaccine. A physician's recommendation is the single best predictor of vaccination. It is recommended that physicians "bundle, " and not single out the HPV vaccine in discussions with patients on the importance of receiving vaccinations. The bundling approach has been shown to normalize and increase acceptance of the HPV vaccine and demonstrate the importance of the HPV vaccine. The current HPV immunization schedule is provider- and patient-friendly and is consistent with adolescents' well visits. The 9vHPV vaccine is routinely recommended for children 11 or 12 years of age.

Children ages 11–12 years old: Are recommended to get 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine, given 6 to 12 months apart. 9vHPV can be given starting at age 9. Only 2 doses are needed if the first dose is given before their 15th birthday. Children ages 9–14 years old: Who have received 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine less than 5 months apart will need a 3rd dose. People 15–26 years old who started the series later need 3 doses of 9vHPV vaccine: People with weakened immune systems: Are recommended to get 3 doses if they are 9 through 26 years old. People older than 26 years: Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than 26 years: Patients who began a series with 4vHPV may complete the series with 9vHPV. Repeat vaccination with 9vHPV is not recommended in patients who have completed three-dose courses of 2vHPV or 4vHPV vaccines. Data available from post-licensee monitoring in other countries for 2vHPV and 4vHPV provide additional evidence of the safety of these vaccines.

Gardasil 9 was studied in more than 15, 000 females and males. These clinical trials showed HPV vaccines to be safe and effective. Each vaccine continues to be monitored for any safety problems. Syncope can occur among adolescents who receive any vaccine, including the HPV vaccines. It is recommended that clinicians consider observing patients for 15 minutes after vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccine update [^fa4baf06]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Rates of cancers attributable to human papillomavirus (HPV) are rising. A safe and extremely effective vaccine is available to prevent many of these cancers. Studies have shown that health care providers' recommendation to immunize is the most important factor in parents' decision. Parents of all adolescent boys and girls should receive a strong and unequivocal recommendation to vaccinate their child against HPV at the 11- or 12-year-old well child visit. Ideally, adolescents complete their HPV vaccine series by their 13th birthday, leading to greater immune response and protection before most adolescents are exposed to sexually transmitted HPV.

### Age considerations when vaccinating against HPV [^9172cf5f]. Gynecologic Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been shown to be both highly effective and safe, and there is now considerable enthusiasm among healthcare providers to use the vaccines to reduce the burden of HPV-associated disease in women. When considering who should be vaccinated, it is important that providers understand the complex relationships between age and HPV infections. HPV infections and cervical cancer have a widespread impact on society. Cervical cancer is the cause of a significant amount of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, making it crucial to implement prophylactic HPV vaccines to prevent cervical cancer. Nationally, the target group for vaccination is pre-adolescent females who have not been sexually active or who have recently become sexually active. In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends HPV vaccination for females aged 11 to 12 years. "Catch-up" vaccination of females aged 13 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have missed a vaccination is also recommended, as females within this age group have the highest prevalence of HPV infection. Vaccination can still benefit females over the age of 26 years who have not been previously exposed to HPV 6, 11, 16, or 18 and those who may have new sexual partners in the future. This review discusses the various considerations that should be addressed when making recommendations of who should be vaccinated against HPV.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination coverage among girls before 13 years: a birth year cohort analysis of the national immunization survey-teen, 2008–2013 [^6e636a45]. Clinical Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is recommended at 11 or 12 years by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. National Immunization Survey-Teen data were analyzed to evaluate, among girls, coverage with one or more doses of HPV vaccination, missed opportunities for HPV vaccination, and potential achievable coverage before 13 years. Results were stratified by birth year cohorts. HPV vaccination coverage before 13 years (≥ 1 HPV dose) increased from 28.4% for girls born in 1995 to 46.8% for girls born in 2000. Among girls born during 1999–2000 who had not received HPV vaccination before 13 years (57.2%), 80.1% had at least 1 missed opportunity to receive HPV vaccination before 13 years. Opportunities to vaccinate for HPV at age 11 to 12 years are missed. Strategies are needed to decrease these missed opportunities for HPV vaccination. This can be facilitated by the administration of all vaccines recommended for adolescents at the same visit.

Clinical Question

Who should receive human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination?

Bottom Line

Catch-up vaccination is now recommended for all persons through age 26 years. For persons aged 27 through 45 years, clinicians and patients should now jointly decide whether HPV vaccination is appropriate. Routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years (or as early as age 9 years) continues to be recommended.

### Committee opinion no. 467: human papillomavirus vaccination [^740eaf70]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved both a bivalent and quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices has recommended that HPV vaccination routinely be given to girls when they are 11 years or 12 years old. The vaccine can be given to individuals as young as 9 years; catch-up vaccination is recommended in females aged 13 years through 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many girls in the initial vaccination target group, they are critical to the catch-up vaccination period. Both HPV vaccines are most effective if given before any exposure to HPV infection (ie, before sexual activity). However, sexually active girls and women can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in females aged 13 years through 26 years. Vaccination with either HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant women. It can be provided to women who are breastfeeding. The need for booster vaccination has not been established but appears unnecessary. Health care providers are encouraged to discuss with their patients the benefits and limitations of the HPV vaccine and the need for routine cervical cytology screening for those aged 21 years and older.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2016 [^24e13d2b]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

At the end of 2016, the recommended HPV vaccination schedule was changed from a 3-dose to a 2-dose series for immunocompetent adolescents initiating the series before their 15th birthday. Three doses are recommended for persons initiating the series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons. The recommendation allows for 1 fewer dose and one fewer visit to a health care provider, which might encourage providers to promote, and parents to accept, vaccination at the recommended age of 11–12 years. Although it is too early to assess the direct impact of the revised recommendation on vaccination practices, when applied retrospectively, the HPV up-to-date coverage was 6.3 percentage points higher than the ≥ 3-dose HPV coverage.

Each year in the United States, an estimated 31,500 newly diagnosed cancers in men and women are attributable to HPV; approximately 90% of these could be prevented by receipt of the nine-valent HPV vaccine. Although it is too early to observe the impact of HPV vaccination on HPV-associated cancers, impact on infection with HPV types targeted by the vaccine and other endpoints have been reported. Data from the 2007–2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys indicate that, compared with 2003–2006 (before HPV vaccine introduction), prevalence of HPV types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine ††† in cervicovaginal specimens had decreased 56% (from 11.5% to 5.0%) among females aged 14–19 years. By 2011–2014, prevalence had declined 71% (from 11.5% to 3.3%) among females aged 14–19 years and 61% (from 18.5% to 7.2%) among females aged 20–24 years. Evidence of vaccine impact among males also exists.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^7055adfc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

What is currently recommended?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

Why are the recommendations being updated now?

9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014. This vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), as well as five additional types, HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. ACIP reviewed results of a randomized trial among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years that showed noninferior immunogenicity for the types shared by 4vHPV and 9vHPV and high efficacy for the five additional types. Other trials in the 9vHPV clinical development program included studies that compared antibody responses across age groups and females and males and concomitant vaccination studies. The evidence supporting 9vHPV vaccination was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation (recommendation for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).

What are the new recommendations?

9vHPV, 4vHPV or 2vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of females aged 11 or 12 years and females through age 26 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. 9vHPV or 4vHPV can be used for routine vaccination of males aged 11 or 12 years and males through age 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. ACIP recommends either 9vHPV or 4vHPV vaccination for men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not vaccinated previously.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^028b9cff]. CA (2020). High credibility.

ACIP routine HPV vaccination ages and ACS qualifying statement with rationale indicate that ACIP recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years and that vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years, and ACS states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates and encourages providers to start the series at age 9 or 10 years. The ACIP basis included that the vaccine can be administered as young as age 9 years, high antibody titers after vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and the established young adolescent visit at age 11 or 12 years. Evidence summarized notes that HPV vaccination has been shown to be more effective at younger ages, that vaccinating at age 12 or 13 years is significantly more effective than vaccinating at age 14 or 15 years, that vaccinating at ages 9 to 11 years will be at least as effective and will likely result in a stronger immune response, and that vaccination has shown no sign of protection waning over time.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^8e5e627b]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — disease burden and coverage impact: Of the more than 150 HPV genotypes, 13 genotypes have been shown to cause cervical cancer. Despite the success of cervical cancer screening in the United States, each year cervical cancer is diagnosed in more than 13,000 women and nearly 4,000 die from the disease. Approximately 90% of cases of genital warts are caused by HPV genotypes 6 and 11. Despite the benefits of HPV vaccines, only 54% of women and 49% of men in the recommended age groups have received all recommended doses. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if health care professionals increase HPV vaccination rates in eligible recipients to 80% in the target age range, it is estimated that an additional 53,000 cases of cervical cancer could be prevented during the lifetimes of those younger than 12. Furthermore, for every year that HPV vaccination rates do not increase, an additional 4,400 women will develop cervical cancer.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination guideline update: American cancer society guideline endorsement [^10fdc023]. CA (2016). Low credibility.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE The American Cancer Society (ACS) reviewed and updated its guideline on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination based on a methodologic and content review of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) HPV vaccination recommendations. A literature review was performed to supplement the evidence considered by the ACIP and to address new vaccine formulations and recommendations as well as new data on population outcomes since publication of the 2007 ACS guideline. The ACS Guideline Development Group determined that the evidence supports ACS endorsement of the ACIP recommendations, with one qualifying statement related to late vaccination. The ACS recommends vaccination of all children at ages 11 and 12 years to protect against HPV infections that lead to several cancers and precancers. Late vaccination for those not vaccinated at the recommended ages should be completed as soon as possible, and individuals should be informed that vaccination may not be effective at older ages.

### Committee opinion no. 588: human papillomavirus vaccination [^cdff8250]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination routinely be targeted to females and males aged 11 years or 12 years as part of the adolescent immunization platform to help reduce the incidence of anogenital cancers and genital warts associated with HPV infection. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use in males and females, whereas the bivalent HPV vaccine is approved for use only in females. For those not vaccinated at the target age, catch-up vaccination is recommended up to age 26 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorses these recommendations. Although obstetrician-gynecologists are not likely to care for many patients in the initial HPV vaccination target group, they have the opportunity to educate mothers about the importance of vaccinating their children at the recommended age and are critical to vaccinating adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period. Obstetrician-gynecologists should advise patients and parents that HPV vaccines are most effective in preventing genital cancers when administered before the onset of sexual activity. However, sexually active individuals can receive some benefit from the vaccination because exposure to all HPV types prevented by the vaccines is unlikely in persons aged 13 years through 26 years. Although HPV vaccination in pregnancy is not recommended, neither is routine pregnancy testing before vaccination. Lactating women can receive either HPV vaccine. The need for ongoing cervical cytology screening should be emphasized in all women aged 21 years and older, even those who received HPV vaccination before the onset of sexual activity.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^c8b1e324]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — routine and catch-up guidance emphasizes early adolescent initiation and strong clinician recommendation. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for girls and boys at the target age of 11–12 years (but it may be given from the age of 9 years) as part of the adolescent immunization platform, and obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch-up period (ages 13–26 years) if not vaccinated at 11–12 years. Unvaccinated women age 26 years and younger should receive the HPV vaccine series regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care professionals should strongly recommend HPV vaccination, should educate parents in their decision making for daughters and sons, and are encouraged to stock and administer HPV vaccines when feasible. HPV vaccines are characterized as among the most effective available, with data demonstrating greater than 99% efficacy when given before exposure to that HPV type.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^cd759357]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination — regulatory scope and core recommendations — notes that three vaccines covering 2, 4, or 9 HPV serotypes have been approved, with bivalent and quadrivalent vaccines approved for women and men aged 9–26 years, the 9‑valent vaccine approved for women and men aged 9–45 years, and the 9‑valent vaccine currently the only HPV vaccine available in the United States. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and ACOG recommend routine HPV vaccination for girls and boys at 11–12 years, but it may be given from the age of 9 years. Obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls and young women during the catch‑up period (ages 13–26 years) regardless of sexual activity, prior exposure to HPV, or sexual orientation if they were not vaccinated at 11–12 years. For previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years, clinicians may use shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — ACIP routine and catch‑up recommendations and special populations: "Currently, the ACIP recommends routine vaccination with the HPV vaccine for individuals 11 through 12 years of age." "The vaccine is licensed for use in children beginning at age 9 years," and "the ACIP recommends HPV vaccination beginning at age 9 years for children and youth with any history of sexual abuse or assault who have not initiated or completed the series." "Vaccination is also recommended for 13- through 26-year-old females and 13- through 21-year-old males" not previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series. Those starting at "15 years of age or older," and those "who are immunocompromised, should complete a 3-dose schedule, at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months." "Males 22 through 26 years of age may also receive the vaccine." "Men who are immune suppressed, have HIV infection, or have sex with men should be vaccinated through age 26 years." "For transgender persons, HPV vaccination is recommended through 26 years for those who were not adequately vaccinated previously."

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^2fceb789]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — early initiation between ages 9 and 12 years: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended starting the series between ages 9 and 12 years. Evidence is emerging that series completion and acceptance may be higher when vaccination is initiated at age 9 or 10 years compared with age 11 or 12 years; in a primary care network, initiation by age 11 years increased from 4.6% to 60.8% within 18 months. In a large population-based cohort, 97.5% of children who initiated HPV vaccination at age 9 or 10 years completed the series by age 13.5 years compared with 78.0% when initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The American Cancer Society (ACS) adapted ACIP guidance and states that routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years is expected to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, and that health care providers are encouraged to start offering the series at age 9 or 10 years.

Recommendations for Use of HPV Vaccines

ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initiated at age 11 or 12 years. The vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. † Vaccination of females is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available), or 9vHPV. Vaccination of males is recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available) or 9vHPV.

2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States. 9vHPV targets five additional cancer causing types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers. 4vHPV and 9vHPV also protect against HPV 6 and 11, types that cause anogenital warts.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^684ee074]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations — ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initiated at age 11 or 12 years; the vaccination series can be started beginning at age 9 years; vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3‑dose series, and males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated; vaccination of females is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available), or 9vHPV, and vaccination of males is recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is available) or 9vHPV; 2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers, 9vHPV targets five additional cancer causing types which account for about 15% of cervical cancers, and 4vHPV and 9vHPV also protect against HPV 6 and 11; vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination coverage among adolescents, 2007–2013, and postlicensure vaccine safety monitoring, 2006–2014 – United States [^3e8c3729]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

The President's Cancer Panel 2012–2013 report released in February 2014 (available at) recommended three critical goals that must be achieved to increase HPV vaccination coverage in the United States, including 1) reducing missed clinical opportunities to recommend and administer HPV vaccines; 2) increasing parents', caregivers', and adolescents' acceptance of HPV vaccination; and 3) maximizing access to HPV vaccination services. CDC, in partnerships with state and local immunization programs, is working with health professional organizations to reduce missed opportunities for HPV vaccination and support clinicians' capacities to give HPV vaccination recommendations consistent with national vaccination recommendations.

What is already known on this topic?

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for girls and boys at ages 11 or 12 years. The 2012 National Immunization Survey-Teen indicated only 53.8% of girls and 20.8% of boys aged 13–17 years had received ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine.

What is added by this report?

Vaccination coverage significantly increased in 2013; 57.3% of girls and 34.6% of boys received ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine. The percentage of parents reporting that they received a clinician recommendation for the HPV vaccine was significantly higher in 2013 compared with 2012 for both parents of girls (64.4% versus 61.0%) and parents of boys (41.6% versus 28.0%). Analysis of provider records showed that if HPV vaccine had been administered at health care encounters when other recommended vaccines were administered, ≥ 1 HPV vaccination coverage by age 13 years for the most recent birth cohort of girls could have been as high as 91%. National safety monitoring data continue to indicate that the HPV vaccine is safe.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Despite the availability of safe and effective HPV vaccines, many adolescents have not been vaccinated. Vaccination coverage of adolescent girls by age 13 years increased across seven birth cohorts but missed vaccination opportunities persist. Improving practice patterns so that clinicians and their staff members use every opportunity to recommend HPV vaccines for boys and girls and address questions from parents is necessary to reduce vaccine-preventable HPV infections and cancers caused by HPV.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — ACIP ages and dosing for adolescents and people with HIV — states that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination with 9 valent HPV vaccine for all 11- or 12-year-old girls and boys, with the series able to start at age 9 years; catch-up vaccination is recommended for all 13- to 26-year-old females and all 13- to 21-year-old males who have not been vaccinated, and is also recommended for males aged 22 to 26 years who are men who have sex with men (MSM), or have HIV infection or are otherwise immunocompromised. The 9-valent vaccine should be delivered through a series of three intramuscular injections over a 6-month period, with the second and third doses given at 1 to 2 months and then 6 months after the first dose; although ACIP recommends a 2-dose schedule for adolescents initiating the vaccine series at ages 9 to 14 years, three doses of HPV vaccine (0, 1–2, and 6 months) are recommended for females and males with HIV infection or other immunosuppression because their immune response to vaccination might be attenuated.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — HPV vaccination in HIV-infected youth is recommended (AIII). Either bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine offers protection against the two most common types that are associated with HPV-associated genital cancers, and quadrivalent HPV vaccine also offers protection against the two most common types that cause genital warts. Either the bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination of HIV-infected females aged 11 to 12 years; quadrivalent HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination of HIV-infected males aged 11 to 12 years. The first dose of the HPV vaccine series should be administered to males and females aged 11 to 12 years, but can be administered as early as age 9 years; the second dose should be administered 1 to 2 months after the first dose, and the third dose should be administered 6 months after the first dose. HIV-infected adolescents aged 13 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or have not completed the vaccine series should be vaccinated (AIII). Because the HPV vaccine prevents infection and is not therapeutic, it ideally should be administered before potential exposure to HPV through sexual contact (AIII). Data on prior exposure to vaccine types in HIV-positive individuals aged 13 to 26 years are insufficient to determine the proportion that would benefit from vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^dbc9f0d9]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to prevent new HPV infections and HPV-associated diseases, including some cancers. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)* routinely recommends HPV vaccination at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up vaccination has been recommended since 2006 for females through age 26 years, and since 2011 for males through age 21 years and certain special populations through age 26 years. This report updates ACIP catch-up HPV vaccination recommendations and guidance published in 2014, 2015, and 2016 (1–3). Routine recommendations for vaccination of adolescents have not changed. In June 2019, ACIP recommended catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. ACIP did not recommend catch-up vaccination for all adults aged 27 through 45 years, but recognized that some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range; therefore, ACIP recommended shared clinical decision-making regarding potential HPV vaccination for these persons.

Routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since 2006 for females and since 2011 for males (1,2). This report provides recommendations and guidance regarding use of HPV vaccines and updates ACIP HPV vaccination recommendations previously published in 2014 and 2015 (1,2). This report includes new recommendations for use of a 2-dose schedule for girls and boys who initiate the vaccination series at ages 9 through 14 years. Three doses remain recommended for persons who initiate the vaccination series at ages 15 through 26 years and for immunocompromised persons.

### National vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years – United States, 2006 [^e53e6a69]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Before 2005, vaccines were administered during adolescence to "catch up" children with vaccinations not received at a younger age, with the exception of the tetanus and diphtheria (Td) booster. However, since 2005, three new vaccines specifically for older children have been licensed and recommended in the United States: meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4) for those aged 11–12 years and 15 years; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for those aged 11–12 years (or at ages 13–18 years if not received at ages 11–12 years); and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for girls aged 11–12 years (or at ages 13–18 years if not received at 11–12 years). Since 1996, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and professional organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), and the American Medical Association (AMA), have recommended a health-care visit at ages 11–12 years for receipt of recommended vaccinations. In addition, a Healthy People 2010 objective (14–27) is to achieve ≥ 90% vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–15 years for certain vaccines. In 2006, for the first time, the National Immunization Survey (NIS) collected provider-reported vaccination information for adolescents aged 13–17 years (NIS-Teen). This report describes the results of that survey, which indicated that the Healthy People 2010 target has not been met for any of the vaccines analyzed. HPV vaccination coverage is not included in this report because NIS-Teen was conducted before HPV vaccination recommendations were published in March 2007. Routine health-care visits for adolescents should be encouraged, with emphasis on a visit at ages 11–12 years, and providers should continue to assess the need for vaccinations at every opportunity. NIS-Teen will be conducted annually to monitor coverage with recommended vaccines during ages 11–17 years and to identify groups with lower coverage.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^8105056e]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Preventing human papillomavirus (HPV) infection — vaccination recommendations for people with HIV state that HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years, and to administer three doses of 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII); ideally, the series should have been initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years, and the two-dose series is not recommended in people with HIV. For all people with HIV aged 13 to 26 years who were not vaccinated previously, administer three doses of 9-valent HPV vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII), and the two-dose series is not recommended in people with HIV. For people with HIV aged 27 to 45 years who were not adequately vaccinated previously, HPV vaccine is not routinely recommended; instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for people who may be at risk for a new HPV infection (AIII). For people who were adequately vaccinated with bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine, some experts would consider additional vaccination with 9-valent HPV vaccine, but data are lacking to define the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach (CIII). HPV vaccination is not recommended during pregnancy (CIII).

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^236fddeb]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV) has a minimum age of 9 years and, because it is not a live virus vaccine, it can be administered to individuals who are immunosuppressed, including those with HIV, although the immune response and vaccine efficacy in immunosuppressed individuals may be less than in immunocompetent individuals. HPV vaccines must be administered in a three-dose series to children and adolescents with HIV and are most effective for both males and females when given before exposure to HPV through sexual contact. Administer the first dose at age 11 years or 12 years, with approval to start as early as age 9 years. HPV vaccine should be administered early, beginning at 9 years of age, for persons with a history of sexual abuse and assault, and HPV vaccine can be administered to anyone beginning at 9 years of age. Administer the second dose 1 month to 2 months after the first dose and the third dose 6 months after the first dose (≥ 24 weeks after the first dose), and administer the three-dose series at ages 13 years through 26 years if not previously vaccinated.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination coverage among adolescents, 2007–2013, and postlicensure vaccine safety monitoring, 2006–2014 – United States [^0d353ab6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Since mid-2006, a licensed human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been available and recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for routine vaccination of adolescent girls at ages 11 or 12 years. Two vaccines that protect against HPV infection are currently available in the United States. Both the quadrivalent (HPV4) and bivalent (HPV2) vaccines protect against HPV types 16 and 18, which cause 70% of cervical cancers; HPV4 also protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause 90% of genital warts. In 2011, the ACIP also recommended HPV4 for the routine vaccination of adolescent boys at ages 11 or 12 years. HPV vaccines can be safely co-administered with other routinely recommended vaccines, and ACIP recommends administration of all age-appropriate vaccines during a single visit. To assess progress with HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years, characterize adherence with recommendations for HPV vaccination by the 13th birthday, and describe HPV vaccine adverse reports received postlicensure, CDC analyzed data from the 2007–2013 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) and national postlicensure vaccine safety data among females and males. Vaccination coverage with ≥ 1 dose of any HPV vaccine increased significantly from 53.8% (2012) to 57.3% (2013) among adolescent girls and from 20.8% (2012) to 34.6% (2013) among adolescent boys. Receipt of ≥ 1 dose of HPV among girls by age 13 years increased with each birth cohort; however, missed vaccination opportunities were common. Had HPV vaccine been administered to adolescent girls born in 2000 during health care visits when they received another vaccine, vaccination coverage for ≥ 1 dose by age 13 years for this cohort could have reached 91.3%. Postlicensure monitoring data continue to indicate that HPV4 is safe. Improving practice patterns so that clinicians use every opportunity to recommend HPV vaccines and address questions from parents can help realize reductions in vaccine-preventable infections and cancers caused by HPV.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination and age at first sexual activity, national health and nutrition examination survey [^d92c4888]. Clinical Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collects information on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination history as well as sexual activity. We evaluated data from NHANES to assess report of HPV vaccination with ≥ 1 dose and 3 doses among females and males aged 11 to 26 years during 2007–2014. We also examined age at first vaccine dose and age at first sexual activity among females aged 14 to 26 years. Vaccination significantly increased in females aged 13 to 26 years, but not among 11- to 12-year-old girls, and remained low for both females and males. In NHANES 2011–2014, among females with known age at first vaccine dose, 43.1% reported having had sex before or in the same year they received their first HPV vaccine, and this varied by race/ethnicity. Clinicians should provide strong recommendations consistent with guidelines, including routine vaccination of girls and boys at age 11 or 12 years.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination before 13 and 15 years of age: analysis of national immunization survey teen data [^585828f8]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is suboptimally used in the United States. Vaccination before the 13th birthday is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and vaccination before the 15th birthday requires only 2 doses. We estimated the proportion of adolescents up to date for HPV vaccine using provider-verified vaccination data from the 2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen. Only 16% of US adolescents completed HPV vaccination before turning 13, and 35% completed HPV vaccination before turning 15. With sexual activity initiation increasing throughout adolescence and higher immunogenicity for younger vaccinees, vaccination before the 13th birthday can provide better protection against HPV-related cancers.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^b3a076c1]. CA (2020). High credibility.

American Cancer Society human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination recommendations — The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated, and providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

Vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and the ACS qualifying statement specifies that providers should inform individuals aged 22–26 y who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. For adults, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all aged > 26 y and instead shared clinical decision making is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated; however, the ACS does not endorse the recommendation for shared clinical decision making for adults aged 27–45 y because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on selection of individuals who might benefit.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — people with HIV should receive routine HPV vaccination using the 9-valent inactivated recombinant vaccine (Gardasil 9, Merck). Routine HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV. Ideally, the series should be initiated at age 11 or 12 years but may be started as early as age 9 years. For all people with HIV who are aged 13 to 26 years and who were not vaccinated previously, regardless of sex, administer three doses of the recombinant HPV nonavalent vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months (AIII). The two-dose series is not recommended for people with HIV. Shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV who are aged 27 to 45 years and who were not adequately vaccinated previously (AIII). At present, vaccination with commercially available HPV vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy (CIII). For people who have completed a vaccination series with the recombinant HPV bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, some experts would consider additional vaccination with recombinant HPV nonavalent vaccine, but data are lacking for defining the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach (CIII).

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^f4cb7a8a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes the epidemiology of human papillomavirus (HPV) and associated diseases, describes the licensed HPV vaccines, provides updated data from clinical trials and postlicensure safety studies, and compiles recommendations from CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for use of HPV vaccines. Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in women and men. HPV also causes genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Both are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) contains four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) contains two HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 16 and 18. Both vaccines are administered in a 3-dose series. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with HPV4 or HPV2 for females aged 11 or 12 years and with HPV4 for males aged 11 or 12 years. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who were not vaccinated previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated. As a compendium of all current recommendations for use of HPV vaccines, information in this report is intended for use by clinicians, vaccination providers, public health officials, and immunization program personnel as a resource. ACIP recommendations are reviewed periodically and are revised as indicated when new information and data become available.

### Missed opportunities for human papillomavirus vaccine initiation in an insured adolescent female population [^73c02312]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal, oral, and penile cancers, among others. Approximately 31000 new HPV-attributable cancers occur in the United States (U.S.) every year; almost two-thirds occur among females, the most common being cervical cancer, which affects about 12000 women. Many HPV types can cause cancer, and the associations between virus and cancer types vary according to anatomic site. It is notable that approximately 70% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV type 16 or 18. Highly effective vaccines against these HPV types have been available in the United States since 2006, and we now have strong evidence of their effectiveness at the population level, including evidence for herd effects and cross-protection.

Routine vaccination of females has been recommended in the U.S. for a decade, and in males since 2009. The age for initiation of the vaccine series is 11 to 12 years of age, but it can be administered as early as 9 years of age, with catch-up from 13 to 26 years in females. Virtually all authoritative and professional bodies, including the American Cancer Society, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the US Preventive Services Task Force, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have endorsed the standing recommendation issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Until recently, completion of the HPV vaccine series necessitated 3 doses at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months. A 2-dose series (0 and 6 to 12 months) was recently approved for healthy persons 9 to 14 years of age.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — Recommendations include "Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years," with "Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously." For adults, "shared clinical decision-making… is recommended for certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously," and "HPV vaccination for all adults aged > 26 years" is not routine. Schedule guidance states, "A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday," and "A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation." Additional cautions and access notes include "HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women," availability "for eligible children and adolescents aged < 19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program," strong safety data with " > 120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States," and that "HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors."

In 2006, the ACIP recommended routine vaccination of girls aged 11 to 12 years with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine and vaccination for unvaccinated girls and women aged 13 to 26 years. In 2009, when the bivalent vaccine was licensed in the United States, updated recommendations were issued to state that either vaccine should be used for routine vaccination and vaccination of previously unvaccinated women. According to NIS-Teen data, HPV vaccination uptake (one or more–dose, three-dose, and series completion rates) increased for adolescent girls of virtually all sociodemographic groups from 2008 to 2010, although not all increases were statistically significant. In 2010, less than half (48.7%) of girls aged 13 to 17 years had received one or more doses of vaccine, one in three girls (32.0%) received the entire three-dose series, and 69.6% of those who initiated the series completed it. Nevertheless, the 2010 national three-dose coverage estimate among girls aged 13 to 17 years (32%) falls well short of the Healthy People 2020 target of 80% for girls aged 13 to 15 years and was much lower than uptake reported in Canada (50%–85%), a region in Mexico (67%), and the United Kingdom and Australia (> 70%) (95,96). The low vaccine uptake in the United States overall and among socioeconomic disadvantaged groups is likely because of a combination of factors, including inadequate provider recommendations, issues regarding provider reimbursement, infrequent use of reminder/recall systems that would foster completion of the three-dose series, and factors such as parental hesitancy, health-care access, and general challenges in vaccine delivery to adolescents.

Previous studies have found that health-care provider recommendation is the most important predictor of vaccine acceptance. A survey of pediatricians and family medicine physicians conducted in 2008 (18 months after the initial licensure of the HPV vaccine) found that 57% strongly recommended vaccination for girls aged 11 to 12 years and 90% strongly recommended vaccination for girls aged 13 to 15 years; another survey of primary care physicians in 2009 found only 34.6% "always recommended" vaccination to appropriately aged adolescent girls. Barriers to not "strongly or always" recommending vaccination included the need to discuss sexuality before recommending the vaccine; the high cost of the vaccine (approximately $390 for the three-dose series) and reimbursement concerns; parental refusal because of vaccine safety concerns, religious, or philosophical concerns; and lack of understanding of the HPV vaccine.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^83edf7fc]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Patient education and vaccination efforts — High rates of HPV vaccination will reduce the burden of HPV-related disease in the United States, yet current vaccination rates are unacceptably low and physicians' recommendations have the strongest influence on acceptance. Obstetrician–gynecologists and other health care professionals should strongly recommend HPV vaccination to eligible patients and stress the benefits and safety of the HPV vaccine, and obstetrician–gynecologists are encouraged to stock and administer HPV vaccines in their offices when feasible. Obstetrician–gynecologists should assess and vaccinate adolescent girls age 11–12 years and previously unvaccinated young women during the catch-up period (ages 13–26 years), and health care professionals should share clinical decision making with previously unvaccinated women aged 27–45 years to assess the benefit of HPV vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^35a4ea33]. CA (2020). Medium credibility.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) presents an adaptation of the current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The ACS recommends routine HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years to achieve higher on-time vaccination rates, which will lead to increased numbers of cancers prevented. Health care providers are encouraged to start offering the HPV vaccine series at age 9 or 10 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. Providers should inform individuals aged 22 to 26 years who have not been previously vaccinated or who have not completed the series that vaccination at older ages is less effective in lowering cancer risk. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for adults aged older than 26 years. The ACS does not endorse the 2019 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendation for shared clinical decision making for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated because of the low effectiveness and low cancer prevention potential of vaccination in this age group, the burden of decision making on patients and clinicians, and the lack of sufficient guidance on the selection of individuals who might benefit.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^17933071]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Medium credibility.

Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination, and HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously, and vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014 for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years, and for these recommendations ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males, whereas bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination: ACOG committee opinion, number 809 [^a6edfdc8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

Human papillomavirus vaccination timing and doses — children and adolescents (9–14 years) — specifies that for immunocompetent girls and boys who receive the first dose before 15 years of age, only two doses are needed, given at 0 (baseline) and 6–12 months; the 6‑month interval is critical, and if the interval between the two doses is less than 5 months, a third dose is recommended. Two doses 6 months apart in individuals aged 9–14 years yield antibody titers equal to those in individuals aged 15–26 years who receive three doses; hence, only two doses, 6–12 months apart, are needed if vaccination is initiated before 15 years of age. Earlier vaccination is preferred because HPV vaccines are most effective before exposure and infection, with statistics indicating that 20% of 9th graders and more than 55% of 12th graders have engaged in sexual intercourse; in Sweden, vaccine effectiveness in preventing genital warts was 93% when vaccinated between 10 and 13 years compared with 48% at 20–22 years and 21% at 23–26 years. HPV vaccination is not associated with an earlier onset of sexual activity or increased incidence of sexually transmitted infections.

### National and state vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years – United States, 2012 [^cdea19fe]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2013). Low credibility.

At ages 11 through 12 years, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that preteens receive 1 dose of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, 1 dose of meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY) vaccine, and 3 doses of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. ACIP recommends administration of all age-appropriate vaccines during a single visit. ACIP also recommends that pre-teens and older adolescents receive an annual influenza vaccine as well as any overdue vaccines (e.g., varicella). To monitor vaccination coverage among persons aged 13–17 years, CDC analyzed data from the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen). This report highlights findings of that analysis. From 2011 to 2012, coverage increased for ≥ 1 Tdap vaccine dose (from 78.2% to 84.6%), ≥ 1 MenACWY vaccine dose (from 70.5% to 74.0%) and, among males, ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose (from 8.3% to 20.8%). Among females, vaccination coverage estimates for each HPV vaccine series dose were similar in 2012 compared with 2011. Coverage varied substantially among states. Regarding Healthy People 2020 targets for adolescents, 36 states achieved targets for Tdap, 12 for MenACWY, and nine for varicella vaccine coverage. Large and increasing coverage differences between Tdap and other vaccines recommended for adolescents indicate that substantial missed opportunities remain for vaccinating teens, especially against HPV infection. Health-care providers should administer recommended HPV and meningococcal vaccinations to boys and girls during the same visits when Tdap vaccine is given. In addition, whether for health problems or well-checks, providers, parents, and adolescents should use every health-care visit as an opportunity to review adolescents' immunization histories and ensure that every adolescent is fully vaccinated.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination 2020 guideline update: American cancer society guideline adaptation [^0da03180]. CA (2020). High credibility.

Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 2019 human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — For children and adults aged 9–26 y, HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 y; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 y, and vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 y who are not adequately vaccinated. For adults aged > 26 y, catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 y; instead, shared clinical decision making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27–45 y who are not adequately vaccinated, and HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 y. Administration guidance states that dosing schedules, intervals, and definitions of persons considered adequately vaccinated have not changed and that no prevaccination testing (eg, Pap or HPV testing) is recommended to establish the appropriateness of HPV vaccination. Cervical cancer screening guidelines and recommendations should be followed. These recommendations for children and adults aged 9–26 y and for adults aged > 26 y apply to all persons, regardless of behavioral or medical risk factors; for persons who are pregnant, HPV vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy, however, pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination, and persons who are breastfeeding or lactating can receive HPV vaccine.

### Use of 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine: updated HPV vaccination recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^a7ab3d9f]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

During its February 2015 meeting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) (Gardasil 9, Merck and Co, Inc.) as one of three HPV vaccines that can be used for routine vaccination. HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years. ACIP also recommends vaccination for females aged 13 through 26 years and males aged 13 through 21 years not vaccinated previously. Vaccination is also recommended through age 26 years for men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) if not vaccinated previously. 9vHPV is a noninfectious, virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. Similar to quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), 9vHPV contains HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 VLPs. In addition, 9vHPV contains HPV 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 VLPs. 9vHPV was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 10, 2014, for use in females aged 9 through 26 years and males aged 9 through 15 years. For these recommendations, ACIP reviewed additional data on 9vHPV in males aged 16 through 26 years. 9vHPV and 4vHPV are licensed for use in females and males. Bivalent HPV vaccine (2vHPV), which contains HPV 16, 18 VLPs, is licensed for use in females.

### HPV vaccination recommendations… [^0aae4512]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

HPV Vaccination Recommendations For the full text of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations, see the Human Papillomavirus ACIP Vaccine Recommendations. Vaccination Recommendations
- HPV vaccine is recommended for routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years.
- ACIP also recommends vaccination for everyone through age 26 years if not adequately vaccinated when younger. HPV vaccination is given as a series of either two or three doses, depending on age at initial vaccination.
- Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. Some adults ages 27 through 45 years might decide to get the HPV vaccine based on discussion with their clinician, if they did not get adequately vaccinated when they were younger. HPV vaccination of people in this age range provides less benefit, for several reasons, including that more people in this age range have already been exposed to HPV.
- For adults ages 27 through 45 years, clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with people who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults over age 26 years. See ACIP's shared clinical decision-making FAQs. Keep in mind that HPV vaccination prevents new HPV infections but does not treat existing HPV infections or diseases. HPV vaccine works best when given before any exposure to HPV. Dosing Schedules Two doses of HPV vaccine are recommended for most persons starting the series before their 15 th birthday.
- The second dose of HPV vaccine should be given 6 to 12 months after the first dose.
- Adolescents who receive two doses less than 5 months apart will require a third dose of HPV vaccine. Three doses of HPV vaccine are recommended for teens and young adults who start the series at ages 15 through 26 years, and for immunocompromised persons.
- The recommended three-dose schedule is 0, 1–2 and 6 months.
- Three doses are recommended for immunocompromised persons aged 9 through 26 years.
- A moderate or severe acute illness is a precaution to vaccination, and vaccination should be deferred until symptoms of the acute illness improve.
- A minor acute illness is not a reason to defer vaccination.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d1dfa63c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

HPV burden of disease and impact of the vaccination program in the United States. Approximately 33,700 cancers are caused by HPV in the United States each year, including 12,900 oropharyngeal cancers among men and women, 10,800 cervical cancers among women, and 6,000 anal cancers among men and women; vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers are less common. HPV vaccination for adolescents has been routinely recommended for females since 2006 and for males since 2011. The existing HPV vaccination program for adolescents has the potential to prevent the majority of these cancers. Mean age at acquisition of causal HPV infection for cancers is unknown, but is estimated to be decades before cancer is diagnosed. In 2017, coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine was 65.5% among adolescents aged 13 through 17 years. Although coverage with the recommended number of doses remains below the Healthy People 2020 target of 80% for adolescents, the U.S. HPV vaccination program has resulted in significant declines in prevalences of vaccine-type HPV infections, anogenital warts, and cervical precancers. For example, prevalences of 4vHPV vaccine-type infection during 2013–2016, compared with those of the prevaccine era, declined from 11.5% to 1.8% among females aged 14 through 19 years and from 18.5% to 5.3% among females aged 20 through 24 years. In addition, declines have been observed among unvaccinated persons, suggesting protective herd effects.

### Missed opportunities for human papillomavirus vaccine initiation in an insured adolescent female population [^2a7c3965]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

The Healthy People 2020 target for completed HPV vaccination series by 13 to 15 years of age is 80%. The current rates fall far below this goal; in fact, according to the most recent national data, initiation of HPV vaccination among girls 13 to 17 years of age is only 63%. The initiation rate in our cohort of 11- to 12-year-olds was even lower, and subjects were less likely to receive HPV vaccine than other recommended adolescent vaccines. Missed opportunities for the administration of HPV vaccine were most common among well-adolescent visits, followed by vaccine-related visits and then all-cause PCP visits.

Low HPV vaccination rates are considered a public health problem, and multiple studies have attempted to identify the barriers to vaccination among US adolescents. A systematic review reported that parents' attitudes toward the vaccine, inadequate insurance coverage and reimbursement, financial concerns, preference for vaccinating older adolescents, and knowledge gaps are the most important factors explaining lack of advocacy towards vaccination from the provider perspective. On the other hand, not receiving a provider's recommendation, lack of information, concerns about timing of vaccination (child's age), misconceptions about efficacy and safety, cost and availability were identified as parental barriers for vaccination. In addition, providers' discomfort talking about a topic related to sexual behavior, lack of time or incentives for parental education, lack of systems to remind regarding eligibility, the 3-dose schedule at the time of the present study, and the fact that HPV vaccine is not mandated for school entry in most states contribute to low vaccination rates. Every effort should be made to overcome those barriers from the provider and parent standpoint to increase HPV vaccination rates.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2016 [^bcf84ce6]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2017). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adolescents routinely receive tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine at age 11–12 years. ACIP also recommends catch-up vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and varicella vaccine for adolescents who are not up to date with childhood vaccinations. ACIP recommends a booster dose of MenACWY at age 16 years. In December 2016, ACIP updated HPV vaccine recommendations to include a 2-dose schedule for immunocompetent adolescents initiating the vaccination series before their 15th birthday. To estimate adolescent vaccination coverage in the United States, CDC analyzed data from the 2016 National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) for 20,475 adolescents aged 13–17 years. * During 2015–2016, coverage increased for ≥ 1 dose of Tdap (from 86.4% to 88.0%) and for each HPV vaccine dose (from 56.1% to 60.4% for ≥ 1 dose). Among adolescents aged 17 years, coverage with ≥ 2 doses of MenACWY increased from 33.3% to 39.1%. In 2016, 43.4% of adolescents (49.5% of females; 37.5% of males) were up to date with the HPV vaccination series, applying the updated HPV vaccine recommendations retrospectively. † Coverage with ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose varied by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status and was lowest (50.4%) among adolescents living in non-MSA areas and highest (65.9%) among those living in MSA central cities. § Adolescent vaccination coverage continues to improve overall; however, substantial opportunities exist to further increase HPV-associated cancer prevention.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years – United States, 2014 [^fbb873fa]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

From 2013 to 2014, vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years increased for all vaccines routinely recommended for adolescents. Achieving high HPV vaccination coverage in early adolescence is important to optimize protection before HPV exposure. In 2014, the President's Cancer Panel Report called for coordinated efforts to improve HPV vaccination coverage, including reducing missed opportunities to recommend and administer HPV vaccine at every clinical opportunity, increasing parents' and adolescents' acceptance of HPV vaccine, and maximizing access to HPV vaccination services.

After experiencing no progress in national HPV vaccination coverage among females aged 13–17 years from 2011 to 2012, coverage increased modestly in 2013, and an additional 3.3 percentage points in 2014. Five states, DC, and one local area experienced large, significant increases in ≥ 1- or ≥ 3-dose HPV vaccination coverage among females, including four (Chicago, DC, Georgia, and Utah) of the 11 jurisdictions that received resources in 2013 through the Prevention and Public Health Fund from CDC to conduct activities to improve HPV vaccination coverage.

In six of the seven jurisdictions with increases in ≥ 1- or ≥ 3-dose HPV coverage among females, combinations of strategies were important. Immunization programs highlighted incorporating HPV vaccination in cancer control plans, joint initiatives with cancer prevention and immunization stakeholders, public communication campaigns, immunization information system–based reminder/recall, assessment and feedback activities (including clinician-to-clinician educational sessions emphasizing providing strong vaccination recommendations at ages 11–12 years), practice-focused strategies to educate staff and provide input on how to improve routine HPV vaccination within the practice, and using all opportunities to educate clinicians and parents about the importance of on-time HPV vaccination. These experiences are informing development of best practices for improving HPV vaccination coverage. At the start of 2014, only two jurisdictions had school requirements for HPV vaccination, both with broad exemption provisions. In late 2014, DC expanded its existing school requirement for HPV vaccination to include males and females through 12th grade, with a requirement for submitting exemption forms annually.

### Human papillomavirus-attributable cancers-United States, 2012–2016 [^4c50be0a]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Each year during 2012–2016, an estimated average of 34,800 HPV-attributable cancers were diagnosed in the United States, and 92% (32,100) were attributable to the HPV types targeted by 9vHPV. Previous annual estimates of cancers attributable to the types targeted by 9vHPV were 28,500 for 2008–2012, 30,000 for 2010–2014, §§ and 31,200 for 2011–2015. The higher estimates in more recent years are, in part, due to an aging and growing population and increases in oropharyngeal, anal, and vulvar cancers.

HPV vaccination is an important component of cancer prevention, yet only about half of adolescents are up to date on this vaccine. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends routine HPV vaccination at age 11–12 years and catch-up HPV vaccination for all persons through age 26 years. Catch-up vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years because the benefit of HPV vaccination decreases in older age groups; however, vaccination based on shared clinical decision-making can be considered for some persons aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated. In 2018, HPV vaccination coverage varied by state, and no state met the Healthy People 2020 objective for HPV vaccination (receipt of 2 or 3 doses of HPV vaccine by 80% of adolescents aged 13–15 years). * State efforts to meet the Healthy People 2020 objective for HPV vaccination could reduce geographic disparities in HPV-associated cancer incidence in the future.

Cervical cancer is the only HPV-associated cancer for which screening is routinely recommended. Recommendations state that women aged 21–65 years be screened regularly for cervical precancers and cancers. Women aged 21–29 years should be screened with the Papanicolaou (Pap) test every 3 years. Women aged 30–65 years can be screened with one of three strategies: the Pap test every 3 years, an HPV test every 5 years, or both a Pap and HPV test every 5 years. Regardless of screening strategy, all abnormal test results require follow-up of abnormal results and appropriate treatment. The Healthy People 2020 target for cervical cancer screening coverage is 93%; however, in 2015 only 81% of women aged 21–65 years reported receiving a Pap test within the past 3 years; coverage was lower among Asians, Hispanics, non–U.S. born, and uninsured women. †††

### The need to optimize adolescent immunization [^89182cb5]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — rationale for early adolescent vaccination and immunogenicity: "The rationale for administering the HPV vaccine routinely at the 11- through 12-year-old visit" includes high post‑initiation infection risk, with "nearly 40% within the first 2 years" among college women and "almost 60% among college men," supporting early completion of "all 3 HPV vaccine doses." Sexual debut is common, with "~24%" reporting intercourse by ninth grade and "58.1%" by 12th grade. Immunogenicity is higher at younger ages: "greater antibody responses in girls and boys 9 through 15 years of age" versus "16- through 26 years of age." Long‑term data show durability, with a study "conducted over a period of 8 years" demonstrating safety, immunogenicity, and effectiveness in those "9 through 15 years of age."

From 2011 to 2012, coverage increased for ≥ 1 Tdap vaccine dose § (from 78.2% to 84.6%), ≥ 1 MenACWY vaccine dose (from 70.5% to 74.0%) and, among males, ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose (from 8.3% to 20.8%). Among females, vaccination coverage estimates for each HPV vaccine series dose were similar in 2012 compared with 2011. Coverage varied substantially among states. Regarding Healthy People 2020 targets for adolescents, 36 states achieved targets for Tdap, 12 for MenACWY, and nine for varicella vaccine coverage. Large and increasing coverage differences between Tdap and other vaccines recommended for adolescents indicate that substantial missed opportunities remain for vaccinating teens, especially against HPV infection. Health-care providers should administer recommended HPV and meningococcal vaccinations to boys and girls during the same visits when Tdap vaccine is given. In addition, whether for health problems or well-checks, providers, parents, and adolescents should use every health-care visit as an opportunity to review adolescents' immunization histories and ensure that every adolescent is fully vaccinated.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adolescents routinely receive tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (1) at age 11–12 years. ACIP also recommends catch-up vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, and varicella vaccine for adolescents who are not up to date with childhood vaccinations. ACIP recommends a booster dose of MenACWY at age 16 years (1). In December 2016, ACIP updated HPV vaccine recommendations to include a 2-dose schedule for immunocompetent adolescents initiating the vaccination series before their 15th birthday (2). To estimate adolescent vaccination coverage in the United States, CDC analyzed data from the 2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) for 20,475 adolescents aged 13–17 years.* During 2015–2016, coverage increased for ≥ 1 dose of Tdap (from 86.4% to 88.0%) and for each HPV vaccine dose (from 56.1% to 60.4% for ≥ 1 dose). Among adolescents aged 17 years, coverage with ≥ 2 doses of MenACWY increased from 33.3% to 39.1%. In 2016, 43.4% of adolescents (49.5% of females; 37.5% of males) were up to date with the HPV vaccination series, applying the updated HPV vaccine recommendations retrospectively. † Coverage with ≥ 1 HPV vaccine dose varied by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status and was lowest (50.4%) among adolescents living in non-MSA areas and highest (65.9%) among those living in MSA central cities. § Adolescent vaccination coverage continues to improve overall; however, substantial opportunities exist to further increase HPV-associated cancer prevention.

### Committee opinion no. 641: human papillomavirus vaccination [^90fcd20f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with the development of anogenital cancer (including cervical, vaginal, vulvar, penile, and anal), oropharyngeal cancer, and genital warts. Human papillomavirus vaccination can significantly reduce the incidence of anogenital cancer and genital warts. Despite the benefits of HPV vaccines, only approximately one third of girls in the recommended age group have received all three vaccines. Compared with other vaccines recommended in the same age bracket, HPV vaccination rates in the United States are unacceptably low. It is crucial that obstetrician-gynecologists and other providers educate parents and patients on the benefits and safety of HPV vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend routine vaccination with HPV vaccine for girls and boys. The 9-valent HPV vaccine is recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2014 for girls and boys aged 11–12 years.

### National and state vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years – United States, 2011 [^6f3ff8fe]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2012). Low credibility.

Since 2005, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has expanded the routine adolescent vaccination schedule with administration of the following vaccines at ages 11 or 12 years: meningococcal conjugate (MenACWY), 2 doses; tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap), 1 dose; human papillomavirus (HPV), 3 doses; and influenza, 1 dose annually. To assess vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years, CDC analyzed data from the National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen). This report summarizes the results of that assessment, which indicated that, from 2010 to 2011, vaccination coverage increased for ≥ 1 dose Tdap on or after age 10 years (from 68.7% to 78.2%), ≥ 1 dose MenACWY (from 62.7% to 70.5%), and, among females, for ≥ 1 dose of HPV (from 48.7% to 53.0%) and ≥ 3 doses of HPV (from 32.0 to 34.8%). Vaccination coverage varied widely among states. Interventions that increase adolescent vaccination coverage include strong recommendations from health-care providers, urging consideration of every health visit as an opportunity for vaccination, reducing out-of-pocket costs, and using reminder/recall systems. Despite increasing adolescent vaccination coverage, the percentage point increase in ≥ 1 dose HPV coverage among adolescent females was less than half that of the increase in ≥ 1 dose of Tdap or MenACWY. The causes of lower coverage with HPV vaccine are multifactorial; addressing missed opportunities for vaccination, as well as continued evaluation of vaccination-promoting initiatives, is needed to protect adolescents against HPV-related cancers.

### Optimal human papillomavirus vaccination strategies to prevent cervical cancer in low-income and middle-income countries in the context of limited resources: a mathematical modelling analysis [^34f4edbf]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Routine vaccination of girls aged 9 years with a 5-year extended interval between doses combined with a catch-up programme for girls aged 14 years was predicted to provide the same accelerated benefits and long-term population-level effectiveness as multiple age-cohort vaccination of girls aged 9–14 years in the first year of the programme, but with fewer vaccine doses required in the short term and lower NNVs and ICERs. An important advantage of this extended-interval vaccination strategy is that it offers countries the opportunity to not give a second dose if the results from single-dose vaccine efficacy randomised clinical trials are positive. Indeed, post-hoc analysis of randomised trials and post-vaccination surveillance studies suggest that single-dose HPV vaccination could provide protection against HPV infections and related diseases. The vaccine efficacy and duration of protection of one dose of HPV vaccine is unknown, but results of randomised trials are expected in the next 2–5 years. If a second dose is not deemed to be required in the next 5 years, our results predict that countries that introduce extended-interval dosing programmes will have implemented the most efficient and cost-effective vaccination strategy, and saved substantial medical costs. However, if two doses of HPV vaccine remain necessary, maintaining high vaccination coverage for the second dose at age 13 or 14 years will be important. If the extended-interval vaccination strategy also includes catch-up vaccination at age 14 years, countries can have time to implement programmes to increase vaccination coverage in that age group. Additionally, although not included in our model assumptions, an extended interval would allow girls who missed their first dose at age 9 years to be vaccinated at age 14 years. Furthermore, little is known about the vaccine efficacy of 3–5 year extended-interval schedules, and such a strategy would be considered off-label use of the vaccine. To our knowledge, the only study that has examined this interval found that extended intervals resulted in similar levels of geometric mean IgG antibody titres when the second dose was given 6 months or 3–8 years after the first dose. Finally, WHO recommended that countries consider routine vaccination of girls aged 9 years with a 3–5 year extended interval between doses (with a catch-up programme at age 14 years) after careful consideration of its programmatic challenges, and with a clear and well planned communication strategy.

### Physicians' human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations, 2009 and 2011 [^e4003d81]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Physician recommendation is a key predictor of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake. Understanding factors associated with recommendation is important for efforts to increase current suboptimal vaccine uptake.

Purpose

This study aimed to examine physician recommendations to vaccinate female patients aged 11–26 years, in 2009 and 2011, at 3 and 5 years postvaccine licensure, respectively. A second aim was to identify trends in factors associated with vaccine recommendation for ages 11 and 12 years.

Methods

Nationally representative samples of physicians practicing family medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology were randomly selected from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile (n = 1538 in 2009, n = 1541 in 2011). A mailed survey asked physicians about patient and clinical practice characteristics; immunization support; and frequency of HPV vaccine recommendation ("always" ≥ 75% of the time vs other). Analyses were conducted in 2012.

Results

Completed surveys were received from 1013 eligible physicians (68% response rate) in 2009 and 928 (63%) in 2011. The proportion of physicians who reported always recommending HPV vaccine increased significantly from 2009 to 2011 for patients aged 11 or 12 years (35% vs 40%, respectively; p = 0.03), but not for patients aged 13–17 years (53% vs 55%; p = 0.28) or 18–26 years (50% vs 52%; p = 0.52). Physician specialty, age, and perceived issues/barriers to vaccination were associated with vaccine recommendation for patients aged 11 or 12 in both years.

Conclusions

Results suggest a modest increase in recommendations for HPV vaccination of girls aged 11 or 12 years over a 2-year period; however, recommendations remain suboptimal for all age groups despite national recommendations for universal immunization.

### The need to optimize adolescent immunization [^4d90947c]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — coverage, disparities, and impact of provider recommendation: "Most female adolescents with commercial and Medicaid health plans are currently not receiving the recommended doses of HPV vaccine by 13 years of age," and although Medicaid coverage is higher, "the median of adolescent girls receiving 3 doses was only 19%." "According to the 2015 NIS–Teen, just over half (63%) of girls ages 13 through 17 years received ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine, and only 41.9% completed the series." Among boys of the same age, "49.8%" received " ≥ 1 dose," and "28.1%" completed the series. Disparities exist: compared with non‑Hispanic white adolescents or those at or above poverty, several groups "have a higher rate of initiation of the HPV vaccine series." Provider influence is substantial: "Health care provider recommendation and physician attitude play a major role," "A strong endorsement is more influential than a weak one," and "offering the HPV vaccine without strongly recommending it appears to confuse and frustrate parents," with the message that vaccination "is a critical strategy for cancer prevention."

### Missed opportunities for human papillomavirus vaccine initiation in an insured adolescent female population [^17857139]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2017). Low credibility.

Most HPV vaccine initiators in this cohort received their first dose before 13 years of age, which indicates that, by and large, the recommendation to give the series at 11 to 12 years of age (before the 13th birthday) was being followed. This guideline is important for ensuring immunity well before HPV exposure is likely. Completion rates for the 3-dose series could not be assessed in the entire study cohort because of variability in the duration of follow-up (nationally, the completion rate in 2015 was only 42%). Yet, the differences between 3-dose administration among younger and older girls in this cohort suggest that, as found in other studies, the earlier the vaccine series is started, the higher the completion rate that is achieved.

Prior studies in insured populations have demonstrated lower HPV vaccine uptake among commercial health plans compared with Medicaid. In our study, we found a greater association between HPV vaccine initiation and managed Medicaid insurance than between vaccine initiation and private insurance with the same carrier. In as much as Medicaid populations are at higher risk of HPV infection, this difference could be driven by parental or provider greater perceived benefit for Medicaid-insured girls and less perceived need in commercially-insured girls. Alternatively, there may be more hesitancy to vaccinate among commercially-insured families.

### Association of provider recommendation and human papillomavirus vaccination initiation among male adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States [^dc44ebee]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage among adolescents by provider recommendation status.

Study Design

The 2011–2016 National Immunization Survey-Teen data were used to assess HPV vaccination coverage among male adolescents by provider recommendation status. Multivariable logistic analyses were conducted to evaluate associations between HPV vaccination and provider recommendation status.

Results

HPV vaccination coverage among male adolescents increased from 8.3% in 2011 to 57.3% in 2016. Likewise, the prevalence of provider recommendation increased from 14.2% in 2011 to 65.5% in 2016. In 2016, HPV coverage was higher in male adolescents with a provider recommendation than in those without a provider recommendation (68.8% vs 35.4%). In multivariable logistic regression, characteristics independently associated with a higher likelihood of HPV vaccination included receipt of a provider recommendation, age 16–17 years, black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, any Medicaid insurance, ≥ 2 physician contacts in the previous 12 months, and urban or suburban residence. Participants with a mother with some college or a college degree, those with a mother aged 35–44 years, and those who did not have a well-child visit at age 11–12 years had a lower likelihood of HPV vaccination.

Conclusions

Receiving a provider recommendation for vaccination was significantly associated with receipt of HPV vaccine among male adolescents, indicating that a provider recommendation for vaccination is an important approach to increase vaccination coverage. Evidence-based strategies, such as standing orders and provider reminders, alone or in combination with health system interventions, are useful for increasing provider recommendations and HPV vaccination coverage among male adolescents.

### Early initiation of HPV vaccination and series completion in early and mid-adolescence [^5ef2075c]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been recommended in the United States since 2006 but rates remain suboptimal. State-based studies suggest that initiation in late childhood at ages 9 to 10 years compared with the recommended early adolescent ages of 11 to 12 years improves series completion. No study with national scope has explored the early initiation-HPV series completion relationship. This study addresses this knowledge gap and explores whether early initiation might improve series completion by increasing time to target completion age (time pathway) or by moving initiation to an earlier developmental stage (development pathway).

Methods

Using data from the National Immunization Survey-Teen 2017–2020, a retrospective cohort of 19575 15 to 17 year olds who initiated HPV vaccination between ages 9 and 12 years was assembled. Time pathway endpoints were series completion by ages 13 and 15 years. The development pathway endpoint was completion within 3 years of initiation.

Results

Early initiators were more likely to complete by ages 13 (74.0% vs 31.1%, P < .001) and 15 (91.7% vs 82.7%, P < .001) years but less likely to complete within 3 years (82.3% vs 84.9%, P = 0.007). The association of early initiation to completion was maintained in multivariable analyses for time pathway endpoints (age 13 years adjusted odds ratios [AOR] = 6.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.45–6.96, age 15 years = AOR 2.56; 95% CI, 2.14–3.14) but not the development pathway endpoint (AOR = 0.93; 95% CI, 0.80–1.07).

Conclusions

Moving routine HPV vaccination to ages 9 to 10 may improve vaccination coverage rates in early and mid-adolescence. Providers should be vigilant to patient interactions after HPV series initiation to optimize public health benefits of vaccination.

### HPV vaccination… [^3521b81e]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Protect your child from certain cancers later in life with HPV vaccine.
- CDC recommends 2 doses of HPV vaccine at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccination can be started at age 9 years. Introduction HPV vaccination provides safe, effective, and lasting protection against the HPV infections that most commonly cause cancer. The HPV vaccine series is most effective when given before a person is exposed to the virus. Every year in the United States, HPV causes about 36, 000 cases of cancer in both men and women. Keep Reading: Reasons to Get Vaccinated. Available vaccines There are several types of HPV vaccines. That's why HPV vaccine is recommended earlier rather than later. It protects your child long before they ever have contact with the virus. Gardasil-9 Gardasil-9 is the vaccine distributed in the United States. This vaccine protects against nine HPV types.

Recommendations Children ages 11–12 years should get 2 doses of HPV vaccine, given 6 to 12 months apart. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9. Only 2 doses are needed if the first dose was given before 15th birthday. Children 9–14 years old who have received 2 doses of HPV vaccine less than 5 months apart will need a third dose. People 15–26 years old who start the series later need 3 doses of HPV vaccine.
- The doses are given over 6 months.
- If your teen isn't vaccinated yet, talk to their doctor about doing so as soon as possible. People with weakened immune systems should get 3 doses if they are 9–26 years old. Who should get vaccinated
- HPV vaccination is recommended at ages 11–12 years. HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9 years. All preteens need HPV vaccination, so they are protected from HPV infections that can cause cancer later in life.
- Teens and young adults through age 26 years who didn't start or finish the HPV vaccine series also need HPV vaccination. To prevent fainting and injuries from fainting, teens should be seated or lying down during vaccination; they should also do the same for 15 minutes after getting the shot.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^ca7b9075]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Children and adults aged 9 through 26 years. HPV vaccination is routinely recommended at age 11 or 12 years; vaccination can be given starting at age 9 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for all persons through age 26 years who are not adequately vaccinated. †

Adults aged > 26 years. Catch-up HPV vaccination is not recommended for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for some adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated. (Box). HPV vaccines are not licensed for use in adults aged > 45 years.

BOX
Considerations for shared clinical decision-making regarding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of adults aged 27 through 45 years

Ideally, HPV vaccination should be given in early adolescence because vaccination is most effective before exposure to HPV through sexual activity. For adults aged 27 through 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated, * clinicians can consider discussing HPV vaccination with persons who are most likely to benefit. HPV vaccination does not need to be discussed with most adults aged > 26 years.

HPV is a very common sexually transmitted infection. Most HPV infections are transient and asymptomatic and cause no clinical problems.
Although new HPV infections are most commonly acquired in adolescence and young adulthood, some adults are at risk for acquiring new HPV infections. At any age, having a new sex partner is a risk factor for acquiring a new HPV infection.
Persons who are in a long-term, mutually monogamous sexual partnership are not likely to acquire a new HPV infection.
Most sexually active adults have been exposed to some HPV types, although not necessarily all of the HPV types targeted by vaccination.
No clinical antibody test can determine whether a person is already immune or still susceptible to any given HPV type.
HPV vaccine efficacy is high among persons who have not been exposed to vaccine-type HPV before vaccination.
Vaccine effectiveness might be low among persons with risk factors for HPV infection or disease (e.g. adults with multiple lifetime sex partners and likely previous infection with vaccine-type HPV), as well as among persons with certain immunocompromising conditions.
HPV vaccines are prophylactic (i.e. they prevent new HPV infections). They do not prevent progression of HPV infection to disease, decrease time to clearance of HPV infection, or treat HPV-related disease.

Vaccination coverage was assessed for each dose of the HPV vaccination series. For girls and boys, respectively, and for each vaccine series dose, HPV vaccination coverage estimates in 2013 were significantly higher compared with 2012 (Table 1).

To evaluate receipt of ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine by age 13 years among adolescent girls, data during 2007–2013 NIS-Teen survey years were combined and analyzed by birth cohort. †† Among girls, receipt of ≥ 1 dose of HPV by age 13 years has increased an average of 5.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.8%–9.0%) with each new birth cohort, reaching 46.8% (CI = 41.2%–52.5%) for the 2000 birth cohort (Figure). Missed opportunities to receive the HPV vaccine by age 13 years also were evaluated. A missed opportunity for adolescent girls was defined as a health care encounter occurring on or after the 11th birthday and before the 13th birthday and on or after March 23, 2007 (the publication date of the ACIP HPV4 recommendation for girls), during which the adolescent received at least one vaccine but did not receive the first dose of the HPV vaccine. The percentage of unvaccinated girls at age 13 years with at least one missed opportunity for HPV vaccination ranged from 9.3% (CI = 8.1%–10.8%) for the 1994 cohort to 83.7% (CI = 77.8%–88.2%) for the 2000 cohort (Figure). If all missed opportunities for HPV vaccination had been eliminated for the 2000 birth cohort, vaccination coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine could have reached 91.3% (CI = 87.9%–93.8%) by age 13 years, a 42.7 percentage-point difference from the actual coverage level.

### Providers' beliefs about the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in preventing cancer and their recommended age groups for vaccination: findings from a provider survey, 2012 [^fea7b3da]. Preventive Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was recommended in 2007 by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) to preadolescent and adolescent girls. Vaccination initiation was recommended at age 11–12 years with the option to start at age 9. Catchup vaccination was recommended to females aged 13–26 previously not vaccinated. However, vaccination coverage remains low. Studies show that the HPV vaccine can prevent cervical, vulvar, vaginal, anal and some oropharyngeal cancers and that provider recommendation of vaccines can improve low vaccination rates.

Methods

Using data from 2012 DocStyles, an annual, web-based survey of U.S. healthcare professionals including physicians and nurse practitioners (n = 1753), we examined providers' knowledge about the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in preventing cancer and their vaccine recommendation to all age-eligible females (9–26 years). Descriptive statistics and Chi-square tests were used to assess differences across specialties.

Results

Knowledge about HPV vaccine effectiveness in preventing cervical cancer was highly prevalent (96.9%), but less so for anal, vaginal, vulvar and oropharyngeal cancers. Only 14.5% of providers recommended the vaccine to all age-eligible females and 20.2% recommended it to females aged 11–26 years. Knowledge assessment of cancers associated with HPV and vaccination recommendations varied significantly among providers (p < 0.01). Providers more frequently recommended the vaccine to girls older than 11–12 years.

Conclusions

Improving providers' knowledge about HPV-associated cancers and the age for vaccination initiation, communicating messages focusing on the vaccine safety and benefits in cancer prevention and on the importance of its delivery prior to sexual onset, may improve HPV vaccine coverage.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — people with HIV: The Panel recommends that people with HIV receive a three-dose series (0, 1–2, and 6 months) because their immune response to vaccination might be attenuated (AIII), and catch-up HPV vaccination is recommended for people with HIV aged 13 to 26 years (AIII). Although routine vaccination beyond age 26 is not recommended, shared clinical decision-making regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for adults aged 27 to 45 years who are not adequately vaccinated and are at risk for a new HPV infection (AIII). For patients previously vaccinated with recombinant bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, some experts would give an additional full series (three doses) of the 9-valent vaccine (CIII), however no data exist to define who might benefit or how cost-effective this approach might be.

### Economic evaluation of human papillomavirus vaccination in the United Kingdom [^ad10e53a]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Age at vaccination

Figure 2shows that offering vaccination to girls aged 13 or 14 instead of 12 (as in the base case) increases the likely cost effectiveness of the programme, particularly if vaccine induced immunity is not life long. This is for two reasons: firstly, vaccinating at a slightly older age means that the delay to benefits being accrued is shorter and as health benefits are discounted this more rapid accrual of benefits is preferred. Secondly, if vaccine induced immunity is relatively short lived (10–20 years on average), and declines exponentially (as assumed) then delaying vaccination for a few years results in greater protection for women during the highest risk period for acquisition of human papillomavirus (late teens and 20s). It has not, however, been assumed that there are increased costs or a drop-off in coverage associated with vaccinating at a later age. Also, these findings depend on the low prevalence of human papillomavirus infection before age 14 in the UKand are not generalisable to countries in which sexual activity starts at an earlier age. The additional benefit of delaying vaccination by one or two years of life is most clearly seen for reduction in the incidence of warts, because this peaks in the early 20s and because the best fitting scenarios for warts related human papillomavirus types (6 and 11) are associated with a short duration of natural immunity. Extending vaccine protection by just a few years can therefore have a large effect on the acquisition of wart related human papillomavirus types.

In the United States, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that children aged 11–12 years receive tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap), meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (HPV vaccine can be started at age 9 years). A booster dose of MenACWY is recommended at age 16 years, and using shared clinical decision-making, adolescents and young adults aged 16–23 years may also receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB). ACIP also recommends that adolescents stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines, * acquire any missed childhood vaccines (catch-up vaccination), and receive an annual influenza vaccine †. Results from 2021 National Immunization Survey–Teen (NIS-Teen) revealed declines in MenACWY § and Tdap coverage among adolescents born in 2008; these persons were due for their routine adolescent vaccines in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing assessment of adolescent vaccination coverage can help guide progress in implementation of ACIP recommendations and identify populations and areas with low coverage.

### Requiring human papillomavirus vaccine for immigrant women [^a0c08002]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of 11- to 12-year-old girls, with catch-up vaccination for girls and women aged 13 to 26 years. Although compulsory HPV vaccination is not currently mandated for any U.S. population, immigrant women aged 11–26 years are now required to receive the first injection of the vaccine (the full series consists of three doses) as a result of the 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. According to this law, immigrants applying for visas to enter the United States or to adjust their immigration status must receive the inoculations that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends for U.S. residents. In the case of HPV, this law represents not only an undue burden on immigrant women, but also raises scientific and ethical questions regarding the benefit of vaccination in this population. Given these issues, immigrant women should not be required to provide documentation of HPV vaccination at the time of visa application or adjustment of immigration status.

### Uptake of human papillomavirus vaccine among adolescent males and females: immunization information system sentinel sites, 2009–2012 [^e9c013b9]. Academic Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination at age 11 or 12 years for girls since 2006 and for boys since 2011. We sought to describe adolescent HPV vaccination coverage, doses administered from 2009 to 2012, and age at first vaccination by sex.

Methods

Aggregate data were analyzed from 8 Immunization Information System sentinel sites on HPV vaccinations in children and adolescents aged 11 to 12 years, 13 to 15 years, and 16 to 18 years. Vaccination coverage by age group was reported for 2009 to 2012, and weekly doses administered were determined. Age at first HPV vaccination was calculated for girls in 2007 and 2011 and for boys in 2011.

Results

This analysis included data on 2.9 million adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. There were small increases in coverage for girls, with receipt of ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine reaching 27.1% of ages 11 to 12, 47.9% of ages 13 to 15, and 57.1% of ages 16 to 18 by December 31, 2012. Uptake of ≥ 1 dose in boys reached ∼18% for all age groups. Doses administered showed seasonal variation, with highest uptake before back to school among girls and steady increases in boys after the 2009 ACIP recommendation for permissive use. Doses administered to boys surpassed those administered to girls by September 2012. Among vaccinated girls, more received vaccine at the recommended age of 11 to 12 years in 2011 (74.2%) compared to 2007 (9.9%). In 2011, 27.3% of vaccinated boys received their first dose at age 11 to 12 years.

Conclusions

HPV vaccination coverage increased among adolescents between 2009 and 2012. However, increases among girls were small, and coverage for boys and girls remained below target levels.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) series completion and strategies — another prominent barrier specific to the completion of the HPV vaccine series used to be its 3-dose schedule; on the basis of 2014 NIS-Teen data, the CDC found 3-dose series completion rates among those who received ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine to be only 69.3% for girls and 57.8% for boys; coverage with at least 1 dose of HPV vaccine before 13 years of age could have reached 91.3% for girls born in 2000 if opportunities to administer the HPV vaccine when other vaccines were given had not been missed; strategies to improve completion include scheduling follow-up visits for the second and third doses at the time the initial dose is given, implementing standing orders, using every clinical opportunity to evaluate and deliver remaining vaccination doses, using electronic communication, and using recall/reminders, and more data are needed to understand the impact of the recently recommended 2-dose schedule.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2017 [^c11de4bc]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of persons aged 11–12 years with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY), and tetanus and reduced diphtheria toxoids and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap). A booster dose of MenACWY is recommended at age 16 years (1), and catch-up vaccination is recommended for hepatitis B vaccine (HepB), measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), and varicella vaccine (VAR) for adolescents whose childhood vaccinations are not up to date (UTD) (1). ACIP also recommends that clinicians may administer a serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB) series to adolescents and young adults aged 16–23 years, with a preferred age of 16–18 years (2). To estimate U.S. adolescent vaccination coverage, CDC analyzed data from the 2017 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) for 20,949 adolescents aged 13–17 years.* During 2016–2017, coverage increased for ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine (from 60.4% to 65.5%), ≥ 1 dose of MenACWY (82.2% to 85.1%), and ≥ 2 doses of MenACWY (39.1% to 44.3%). Coverage with Tdap remained stable at 88.7%. In 2017, 48.6% of adolescents were UTD with the HPV vaccine series (HPV UTD) compared with 43.4% in 2016. † On-time vaccination (receipt of ≥ 2 or ≥ 3 doses of HPV vaccine by age 13 years) also increased. As in 2016, ≥ 1-dose HPV vaccination coverage was lower among adolescents living in nonmetropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) (59.3%) than among those living in MSA principal cities (70.1%). § Although HPV vaccination initiation remains lower than coverage with MenACWY and Tdap, HPV vaccination coverage has increased an average of 5.1 percentage points annually since 2013, indicating that continued efforts to target unvaccinated teens and eliminate missed vaccination opportunities might lead to HPV vaccination coverage levels comparable to those of other routinely recommended adolescent vaccines.

### Gaps and opportunities to improve prevention of human papillomavirus-related cancers [^4d3f46b0]. Journal of Women's Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Primary Prevention through HPV Vaccination

HPV vaccination has been available in the United States since 2006 and is currently the most effective method of preventing infection. The latest nonavalent vaccine targets seven of the high-risk types detected in ∼90% of HPV-related cancers (Table 1). While vaccine-type HPV infection rates in both women and men have decreased since the initial introduction of the vaccine, vaccine implementation in the United States remains relatively low and inconsistent across genders, ages, regions, and racial and ethnic subgroups. Current guidelines recommend vaccinations for everyone through age 26, yet, in 2020, only 58.6% of adolescents were up-to-date on their HPV vaccination, despite CDC's recent reiteration of its previous guidelines recommending girls and boys ages 11 and 12 receive the vaccine.

The clinical and cost effectiveness of the nonavalent HPV vaccine as a public health tool has helped mitigate the barriers of individual patient costs and insurance coverage toward reaching national vaccine uptake goals. Federal assistance programs like Vaccines for Children have also been instrumental in improving access and reducing socioeconomic disparities seen for vaccinations against HPV, as it has for other vaccines such as diphtheria–tetanus–acellular pertussis and measles–mumps–rubella. Health departments charged with managing local program implementation should collaborate with recognized leaders of professional and community organizations to build public awareness and educate their constituents about vaccine safety and access. Altogether, they can combine efforts to ensure that health care providers, such as primary care physicians and pediatricians, are registered to participate in such programs, especially in underserved areas. Barring systemic challenges of costs and access, individuals must still choose to receive the HPV vaccine as a preventive measure for their health.

### National, regional, state, and selected local area vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13–17 years-United States, 2017 [^e34516e3]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In 2017, adolescent vaccination coverage with ≥ 1 dose of HPV vaccine, ≥ 1 and ≥ 2 doses of MenACWY, ≥ 2 doses of MMR, and ≥ 2 doses of VAR increased, while coverage with ≥ 1 dose of Tdap and ≥ 3 doses of HepB remained high. This report includes the first U.S. estimates of ≥ 1-dose MenB coverage. Unlike MenACWY, MenB is not routinely recommended for all adolescents, and thus, the low vaccination coverage in adolescents aged 17 years (14.5%) is not unexpected.

In December 2016, a 2-dose HPV vaccine schedule was recommended for persons starting the series at age < 15 years, based on data showing noninferior immunogenicity compared with 3 doses. This schedule might encourage on-time initiation of the series and facilitate completion; however, it is too early to assess its impact on vaccination coverage. The 5.1 percentage point annual increase in series initiation among all adolescents since 2013 is encouraging. Moreover, on-time vaccination (series completion by age 13 years) has increased approximately four percentage points in each successive birth cohort. Despite these improvements, HPV vaccination initiation remains lower than coverage with Tdap and MenACWY, suggesting ongoing challenges to providing all three vaccines during the same visit. Efforts are under way to promote and improve on-time vaccination, including implementing a new combined Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set measure for adolescent vaccines that assesses receipt of all three routinely recommended adolescent vaccines, including HPV vaccine series completion by age 13 years.

### Human papillomavirus vaccination for adults: updated recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^d67b6386]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2019). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Adolescents remain the most important focus of the HPV vaccination program in the United States. Recommendations harmonized across genders will simplify the immunization schedule and be more feasible to implement. HPV vaccination is most effective when given before exposure to any HPV, as in early adolescence. Clinical trials have indicated that HPV vaccines are safe and effective against infection and disease attributable to HPV vaccine types that recipients are not infected with at the time of vaccination.

Because HPV acquisition generally occurs soon after first sexual activity, vaccine effectiveness will be lower in older age groups because of prior infections. Some previously exposed adults will have developed natural immunity already. Exposure to HPV decreases among older age groups. Evidence suggests that although HPV vaccination is safe for adults aged 27 through 45 years, population benefit would be minimal; nevertheless, some adults who are not adequately vaccinated might be at risk for new HPV infection and might benefit from vaccination in this age range.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — 9vHPV 2‑dose schedule and completion of mixed series: Adolescents may complete the series "with 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine," and "The second dose should be administered 6 to 12 months after the first." If the first dose is given at "age 14 years," the individual "only needs 1 more dose > 6 months later to complete the series." For series started with quadrivalent vaccine, "A series begun with 4vHPV can be completed with 9vHPV," and "if a decision is made to give 9vHPV to a person who previously received a 2vHPV or 4vHPV series, the 2- or 3-dose regimen currently recommended for 9vHPV should be followed."

ACIP recommendations for HPV vaccination include the following:

Routine HPV vaccination for all adolescents at age 11 or 12 years.
Administering vaccine starting at age 9 years.
Catch-up vaccination through age 26 years for those not vaccinated previously.
Not using HPV vaccination for all adults aged > 26 years. Instead, shared clinical decision-making between a patient and a provider regarding HPV vaccination is recommended for certain adults aged 27–45 years not vaccinated previously.
A 2-dose vaccine schedule (at 0- and 6–12-month intervals) is recommended for persons who initiate vaccination before their 15th birthday.
A 3-dose vaccine schedule (at 0-, 1–2-, and 6-month intervals) for immunocompromised persons regardless of age of initiation.

HPV vaccines are not recommended for use in pregnant women. HPV vaccines can be administered regardless of history of anogenital warts, abnormal Pap test or HPV test, or anogenital precancer. Women who have received HPV vaccine should continue routine cervical cancer screening (see Cervical Cancer). HPV vaccine is available for eligible children and adolescents aged < 19 years through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program (additional information is available ator by calling CDC INFO 800-232-4636). For uninsured persons aged < 19 years, patient assistance programs are available from the vaccine manufacturers. Prelicensure and postlicensure safety evaluations have determined that the vaccine is well tolerated. With > 120 million doses of HPV vaccines distributed in the United States, robust data demonstrate that HPV vaccines are safe. Impact-monitoring studies in the United States have demonstrated reductions of genital warts as well as the HPV types contained within the quadrivalent vaccine. Settings that provide STI services should either administer the vaccine to eligible clients within the routine and catch-up age groups through age 26 years who have not started or completed the vaccine series, or link these persons to another facility equipped to provide the vaccine. Clinicians providing services to children, adolescents, and young adults should be knowledgeable about HPV and the vaccine. HPV vaccination has not been associated with initiation of sexual activity or sexual risk behaviors.

Abstaining from sexual activity is the most reliable method for preventing genital HPV infection. Persons can decrease their chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct condom use and limiting their number of sex partners. Although these interventions might not fully protect against HPV, they can decrease the chances of HPV acquisition and transmission.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination — HIV-specific age recommendation and approval status — states that HPV vaccination is recommended for males and females with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection aged 13 through 26 years (AIII). Current data do not support vaccination for those older than 26 years, and HPV vaccines are not approved for use in men or women older than 26 years, and women with HIV infection who have been vaccinated should also have routine cervical cancer screening because the vaccine does not prevent all HPV types that may be precursors to cervical cancer, and because the vaccine may be less effective in women with HIV infection (especially those with low CD4 cell counts) than in women without HIV infection. HPV vaccination prevents initial HPV infection and is ideally administered before sexual exposure to HPV.

Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Information for Clinicians CDC recommends HPV vaccination for children at ages 11 or 12 years to protect against HPV infections that can cause some cancers later in life. Vaccination can be started at age 9 and is recommended through age 26 years for those who did not get adequately vaccinated when they were younger. Research shows that healthcare professionals are parents' most trusted source of information about the HPV vaccine. CDC encourages healthcare professionals to recommend HPV vaccination in the same way and on the same day that they recommend other vaccines for adolescents.
