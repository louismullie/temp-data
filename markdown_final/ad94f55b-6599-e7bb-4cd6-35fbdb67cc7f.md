## Question

Venus stasis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about "Venus stasis". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the user meant "venous stasis" rather than "Venus stasis". Then, I should define venous stasis and its pathophysiology. Next, I will review clinical manifestations and classification, followed by diagnostic evaluation. After that, I need to outline evidence-based management, including compression, pharmacologic options, and interventional therapies. Finally, I should consider special populations, prognosis, and key takeaways, making sure I verify each claim against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "Venus stasis" does not map to a standard medical entity; wait, let me verify that the intended term is "venous stasis", which in clinical usage refers to chronic venous insufficiency and its cutaneous manifestation, stasis dermatitis, driven by venous hypertension and reflux [^9af24a58] [^f981f95b].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm the cascade from venous reflux to skin changes. Venous stasis arises from incompetent valves, venous obstruction, or calf-muscle pump failure, producing venous hypertension that activates endothelium, extravasates erythrocytes, and triggers inflammation with metalloproteinase activity, leading to edema, fibrosis, and stasis dermatitis; this mechanistic link is supported by observational and interventional data showing resolution of dermatitis after correction of venous hypertension [^8fc6392c] [^397ed7c2].

> Next, I should review clinical manifestations and classification. Let me think about the classic phenotype: bilateral, poorly demarcated erythematous, eczematous patches and plaques on the lower legs, especially the medial malleolus, with pruritus, scaling, xerosis, hyperpigmentation from hemosiderin deposition, and progression to lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulcers if untreated; CEAP classifies these as C4 skin changes, with C5 healed and C6 active ulcers, and pruritus is often the most bothersome symptom impacting quality of life [^397529b6] [^21cbbf44] [^b5e7d31d].

> I need to check the diagnostic approach. Initially, I thought duplex ultrasound might be the "gold standard" for all venous stasis, but wait, I should verify the context; duplex ultrasound is indeed the first-line modality to assess reflux and obstruction in chronic venous disease and is considered the gold standard for that purpose, whereas biopsy is reserved for atypical or refractory cases to exclude mimics, given healing risk; I should also remember to distinguish stasis dermatitis from cellulitis, which is often unilateral, tender, and acute, to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary antibiotics [^21cbbf44] [^dd3cf348] [^05269811].

> Now, I will outline management, starting with compression therapy. Hold on, I should confirm the strength of evidence: multiple high-quality guidelines recommend compression as first-line for symptomatic chronic venous disease and as a strong recommendation for venous ulcers, with stronger grades of compression generally more effective; layered systems outperform single layers, and compression reduces edema, pain, and recurrence, though adherence is often limited by discomfort and application difficulty [^fc33fb49] [^de8b591f] [^664c9b03].

> Let me consider pharmacologic adjuncts. I should double-check the role of pentoxifylline and venoactive agents. Pentoxifylline added to compression can modestly improve ulcer healing, and venoactive drugs such as micronized purified flavonoid fraction or horse chestnut seed extract can reduce edema and symptoms in CVD; ESVS suggests considering venoactive agents for persistent symptoms or when intervention is not pursued, while acknowledging variable evidence quality [^9c146536] [^a530b8a5].

> Next, I should review interventional options for refractory disease or correctable anatomy. Endovenous ablation and sclerotherapy reduce reflux and can improve symptoms and healing, with contemporary guidelines supporting ablation for truncal reflux and foam sclerotherapy in selected patients; for iliac vein obstruction, stenting is increasingly used in C4–C6 disease, with appropriate use criteria advising against stenting asymptomatic compression and emphasizing patient selection and staged strategies when combining superficial and deep interventions [^35706ead] [^e0610a88] [^7bf70824].

> I will now examine supportive skin care and ulcer management. Wait, let me verify the role of topical steroids and emollients: short courses of medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroids can calm eczematous inflammation in stasis dermatitis, and liberal emollients mitigate xerosis; for ulcers, moist wound dressings under compression are standard, and routine systemic antibiotics are not indicated without clinical infection, though bacterial colonization control may be considered case-by-case [^a43340a8] [^9c146536] [^664c9b03].

> But wait, what if the patient has obesity or post-thrombotic syndrome? I should confirm special considerations. Obesity contributes to venous hypertension via abdominal compression and inflammatory states, so weight reduction and exercise are first-line alongside compression; in post-thrombotic syndrome, early thrombus removal strategies may reduce severity, and lifelong compression is often needed to mitigate edema and skin changes, with anticoagulation tailored to the thrombotic history [^9c68272c] [^6a39f980].

> I should review prognosis and recurrence. Hold on, I should verify the figures: even with adherence, venous ulcer recurrence at 5 years is 26–51%, and compression reduces recurrence by about half; persistent hyperpigmentation and fibrosis may persist despite treatment, underscoring the need for long-term maintenance and surveillance [^49337894] [^664c9b03] [^b5e7d31d].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Venous stasis reflects chronic venous insufficiency with venous hypertension driving inflammatory skin changes; diagnosis relies on clinical recognition plus duplex ultrasound to define reflux or obstruction; compression is foundational; adjuncts like pentoxifylline, venoactives, and endovenous procedures are layered based on severity and anatomy; and misdiagnosis as cellulitis is common, so careful differentiation prevents overtreatment with antibiotics [^9af24a58] [^fc33fb49] [^05269811].

Venus stasis, more accurately termed **venous stasis** or **chronic venous insufficiency**, is a condition of impaired venous return in the lower limbs, leading to venous hypertension and progressive skin and soft-tissue changes [^b3fbd157]. It is most often due to **valvular incompetence** or **deep vein obstruction**, with risk factors including obesity, prolonged standing, prior DVT, and pregnancy [^8fc6392c] [^dd3cf348]. Clinically, it presents with edema, varicosities, hyperpigmentation, stasis dermatitis, and can progress to venous ulcers [^397529b6]; diagnosis relies on history, exam, and duplex ultrasound to assess reflux or obstruction [^dd3cf348]. Management centers on **compression therapy** to reduce edema and improve healing, with adjuncts such as leg elevation, skin care, and exercise; interventional options (ablation, sclerotherapy, or stenting) are considered for refractory cases or significant reflux/obstruction [^fc33fb49] [^664c9b03] [^e0610a88]. Prognosis depends on adherence and disease severity, with recurrence common without ongoing compression [^49337894].

---

## Pathophysiology

Venous stasis arises from **venous hypertension** due to:

- **Valvular incompetence**: Primary or secondary (post-thrombotic) valve failure causing reflux and ambulatory venous hypertension [^8fc6392c].

- **Venous obstruction**: Deep vein thrombosis or extrinsic compression (e.g. May-Thurner) impeding outflow [^7bf70824].

- **Calf muscle pump failure**: Reduced mobility or muscle weakness impairing venous return [^notfound].

These factors drive **inflammation**, extravasation of erythrocytes, and fibrosis, producing edema, hyperpigmentation, dermatitis, and ulceration [^2505a753].

---

## Clinical presentation

Venous stasis progresses through **clinical stages** (CEAP classification):

| **Ceap class** | **Clinical description** |
|-|-|
| C0 | No visible signs |
| C1 | Telangiectasias |
| C2 | Varicose veins |
| C3 | Edema |
| C4 | Skin changes (pigmentation, eczema) |
| C5 | Healed ulcer |
| C6 | Active ulcer |

---

Key features include:

- **Edema**: Typically pitting, worse with dependency, improving with elevation [^397529b6].

- **Hyperpigmentation**: Hemosiderin deposition ("brawny" discoloration) [^397529b6].

- **Stasis dermatitis**: Eczematous, pruritic, scaly plaques, often medial malleolus [^397529b6].

- **Lipodermatosclerosis**: Fibrotic, indurated skin with "inverted champagne bottle" leg shape [^notfound].

- **Venous ulcers**: Shallow, irregular ulcers over bony prominences, often medial malleolus [^d7fa85ba].

---

## Risk factors

Risk factors include:

- **Obesity**: Increases intra-abdominal pressure and venous obstruction [^9c68272c].

- **Prolonged standing or sitting**: Impairs calf pump function [^dd3cf348].

- **Prior DVT**: Causes valvular damage and reflux [^8fc6392c].

- **Pregnancy**: Hormonal and mechanical effects on veins [^dd3cf348].

- **Age**: Incidence rises with age due to valve degeneration [^96e07c79].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by:

- **History and examination**: Symptoms (aching, heaviness, pruritus), signs (edema, varicosities, dermatitis, ulcers) [^fb225991].

- **Duplex ultrasound**: Gold standard to assess reflux, obstruction, and valve competence [^21cbbf44].

- **CT/MR venography**: For suspected proximal obstruction or equivocal ultrasound [^dd3cf348].

---

## Management

### Conservative therapy

Conservative therapy is **first-line** and includes:

- **Compression therapy**: Graduated stockings or bandages (30–40 mmHg) reduce edema, improve healing, and prevent recurrence [^fc33fb49] [^664c9b03].

- **Leg elevation**: Above heart level to reduce edema [^e2ca3d5c].

- **Exercise**: Walking to enhance calf muscle pump function [^7d5b84a9].

- **Skin care**: Emollients, topical corticosteroids for dermatitis, and infection prevention [^a43340a8] [^9c146536].

---

### Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic options include **pentoxifylline** as an adjunct to compression to improve ulcer healing, and **venoactive agents** (e.g. micronized flavonoids) to reduce edema and symptoms, though evidence is mixed [^9c146536] [^a530b8a5].

---

### Interventional therapy

Interventional options are considered for **refractory disease** or significant reflux/obstruction:

- **Endovenous ablation**: Radiofrequency or laser ablation for superficial reflux [^cca2c97a].

- **Sclerotherapy**: Foam sclerotherapy for varicosities and tributary reflux [^835777ae].

- **Stenting**: For iliac vein obstruction (e.g. May-Thurner) [^7bf70824].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies with adherence and disease severity; **recurrence is common** without ongoing compression, and 5-year ulcer recurrence is 26–51% [^49337894]. Complications include chronic edema, persistent dermatitis, infection (cellulitis, osteomyelitis), and rarely malignant transformation (Marjolin ulcer) [^d7fa85ba].

---

Venous stasis is a chronic venous disease with **significant morbidity**; early recognition, compression, and risk-factor modification are essential to control symptoms, promote healing, and prevent recurrence [^fc33fb49].

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^49337894]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Venous ulcerations of the lower extremities are a significant complication in patients with advanced venous insufficiency. Although compression therapy remains the most frequently used treatment for venous ulcerations, with the healing of ulcers reported in approximately 70% of treatment-adherent patients, a significant portion of patients do not fully respond to this treatment. Compression stockings may be too painful for patients with stasis ulcers to don, so surgical treatments may be necessary (see Sect. 7 on treatments). After healing, the 5-year frequency for the recurrence of venous ulcerations ranges between 26 and 51%, with the exact value depending on the initial degree of ulceration. Moreover, healing does not guarantee the full restoration of proper function in patients, nor the resolution of discomfort or pain.

Conclusion

SD represents the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux and most commonly occurs in the lower extremities of elderly individuals. Cutaneous changes associated with SD are driven by inflammation. The typical clinical presentation involves erythematous and eczematous patches and plaques. Itch is one of the most troublesome symptoms and often leads to scratching that can aggravate wounds and increase the risk of skin infection. SD may also progress to chronic venous ulcerations with oozing and erythema. Accordingly, prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to preventing serious complications. However, diagnosis is challenging due to the resemblance of SD to other skin conditions. The cornerstone of treatment includes compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, together with topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes and associated signs and symptoms. No treatments are currently approved for alleviating the symptoms associated with SD; new therapeutic approaches that target inflammation in SD are thereby needed.

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^9af24a58]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stasis dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of the lower extremities. It typically occurs in older individuals and is the cutaneous manifestation of venous hypertension caused by venous reflux. Such retrograde venous blood flow is the result of incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or venous obstruction. Stasis dermatitis is eczematous. The associated impairment of venous valves may cause swelling of the legs, leading to serious conditions including venous ulcerations. Diagnosis can be challenging because of its clinical resemblance to other skin conditions and poor clinical recognition by physicians. The cornerstones of stasis dermatitis treatment are compression therapy to ameliorate pain and swelling, topical treatments to alleviate secondary skin changes, and interventional treatment options to correct the underlying causes of venous reflux. Given the central role of inflammation of the lower extremities in driving the cutaneous changes characteristic of stasis dermatitis, new therapeutic approaches that target the inflammation are under clinical evaluation in patients with stasis dermatitis.

### Inferior and superior vena cava reconstruction [^5ab67ffb]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Obstructions of the superior and inferior vena cava are prevalent etiologies of deep venous obstruction, presenting a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from life-threatening conditions to asymptomatic states. The etiological diversity inherent to these central venous obstructions necessitates a subtle approach to their diagnosis and management. This discrepancy in clinical presentations emphasizes the importance of a differentiated diagnostic and therapeutic strategy, tailored to the specific form of vena cava obstruction encountered. This article aims to delineate the various manifestations of vena cava obstruction and encourages specific diagnostic and treatment pathways.

### Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis: similar but different [^9e62b72d]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), the two clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism (VTE), constitute a major global burden of cardiovascular disease. They are often referred to as one disease but several patient characteristics, risk factors, real-world treatment, and clinical outcomes may differ substantially between PE and DVT alone.

Materials and Methods

We conducted a narrative review of the state-of-the-art literature on the topic of PE and DVT alone using PubMed, Google scholar, and MEDLINE databases and the most established international consensus statement guidelines for the management of VTE, focusing on the recommendations for diagnosis and treatment but also including epidemiological and clinical characteristics of VTE, highlighting similarities and differences between PE and DVT alone.

Results

Several patient characteristics, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and outcomes differ substantially between PE versus DVT alone. Nevertheless, recommendations for both diagnosis and treatment are strikingly similar in the current guidelines for the management of DVT and PE, except for the indication for advanced reperfusion therapies.

Conclusions

The differences in risk factors, clinical manifestations, and clinical outcomes between patients with PE versus DVT alone are only marginally addressed in the current consensus guidelines. More data is needed allowing proposal of evidence-based adjustments in the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these two manifestations of VTE. Tailored risk stratification and individualized management strategies for patients with PE and DVT alone may lead to a better prognosis, less recurrence and complications, and possibly to a gain of quality-adjusted life years in patients with VTE.

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^f981f95b]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Statis dermatitis (SD), also known as venous eczema, stasis eczema, venous SD, or gravitational dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin disease driven by underlying chronic venous insufficiency that typically affects the lower extremities of older individuals. In SD, alterations in the function of the deep venous plexus at the lower extremities cause blood to backflow to the superficial venous system, leading to venous hypertension, cutaneous inflammation, and a range of potential complications, including venous ulcers. This review describes the incidence, clinical presentation, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and treatment of SD. Literature was selected via a high-level PubMed search using keywords related to SD, such as "stasis dermatitis", "stasis ulcers", "venous ulcers", "venous hypertension", "venous stasis dermatitis", "venous eczema", "chronic venous insufficiency", "chronic venous disease", and "chronic venous insufficiency".

Epidemiology

Chronic venous disease, including chronic venous insufficiency, is a common disease that increases with age and is more prevalent in women. Estimates for the prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency vary widely, highlighting a knowledge gap in the extant epidemiological data, with the observed numbers often depending on the clinical characteristics and lifestyles of the populations examined. Geographically, the highest reported prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency is across Western countries, ranging from < 1 to 40% in women and from < 1 to 17% in men. A Saudi Arabian study estimated the overall prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency as about 45.6%. A Scottish study found the age-adjusted prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency to be 9% in men and 7% in women, with the prevalence increasing with age. In a cross-sectional study of chronic venous insufficiency in patients in 24 cities in Italy, only 22.7% of approximately 5200 adult participants demonstrated no visible signs of the disease. It is estimated that between 2 and 6 million individuals in the United States have advanced forms of chronic venous insufficiency, including swelling and skin changes, with about 500,000 individuals displaying painful venous ulcers. Approximately 37–44% of individuals with leg ulcers had been diagnosed with SD. SD is an advanced cutaneous presentation of chronic venous insufficiency that is more common in older patients; age is positively correlated with the number of insufficient venous segments. In one study, SD was identified in 1.4% of 773 individuals aged ≥ 15 years who had varicose veins. In another study, SD was found in 6.2% of 4099 individuals aged ≥ 65 years. Similar studies have found an SD prevalence of 5.9% in 68 individuals with a mean age of 74 years (range 50–91), increasing to 6.9% in 584 individuals with a mean age of 80 years (range 55–106). With the increasing age of the US population, rising rates of obesity, and more sedentary lifestyles, the prevalence of chronic venous insufficiency (and, consequently, SD) is expected to increase.

### Chronic venous disease. part 2: diagnosis and treatment [^b5a7f66d]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a common medical condition that results from venous hypertension of the limbs, leading to significant morbidity. The diagnosis is quite straightforward from patient history and obvious clinical manifestations. In the recent past, the availability of various invasive and noninvasive treatments has assisted in evaluation of such cases. Although compression therapy is the mainstay of management, newer surgical and other interventional techniques are now being considered for patients who do not respond to conventional medical management. The second part of this two-part review article will outline a diagnostic approach in cases of CVD and discuss the management principles encompassing conservative, pharmacological and interventional options.

### Stasis dermatitis: an overview of its clinical presentation, pathogenesis, and management [^664c9b03]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the case of venous ulcers, treatment options include management, mechanical modalities, wound therapy, medications, and/or surgery. Management options include the use of compression therapy, which is the standard treatment modality for long-term treatment for venous ulcers, or the use of dressings. Compression therapy reduces pain and edema, improves venous reflux, enhances ulcer healing, and prevents ulcer recurrence. Stockings or bandages can also be used. The use of various layers is more effective than single layers, with elastic systems being more efficacious than nonelastic ones. In patients with healed ulcers, compression stockings help reduce the risk of ulcer recurrence by about half. Topical dressings are recommended to promote moist wound healing and cover ulcers, although no dressing has been shown to be superior. The most commonly used drugs are oral analgesics (such as anti-inflammatory drugs, acetaminophen and metamizole) and topical anesthetic creams (such as prilocaine and lidocaine). Topical medications, which include pentoxifylline and phlebotonics, can be applied as monotherapies or in combination with compression therapy. Antibiotics and antiseptics can be used to slow bacterial colonization in venous ulcers, thereby improving wound healing; however, a review of systemic and topical antibiotics and antiseptics for venous ulcer treatment found no correlation between the routine use of oral antibiotics and ulcer healing. Surgical options, which include endovenous ablation and skin grafting, can also be utilized to promote healing and prevent ulcer recurrence. A large review study that evaluated 832 patients with advanced chronic venous insufficiency (CEAP clinical scores of 4–6) found that surgical intervention resulted in an ulcer healing rate of 92%, with recurrence rates as low as 4%. Surgical options have also been studied in comparison to non-surgical compression therapy where surgery reduced ulcer recurrence compared to non-surgical treatment after 4 years (31% vs 56%, respectively). In patients with recurring ulcers, the addition of ablative superficial surgery to standard treatment may be an option. Besides the addition of surgery for recurring ulcers, standard treatment with compression therapy remains the first-line treatment of choice for patients with venous ulcers.

Clinical Presentation

SD, as a cutaneous manifestation of chronic venous insufficiency caused by retrograde venous blood flow, is classified as C4 (changes in skin and subcutaneous tissue secondary to chronic venous disease) on the Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification of venous disorders. This is an internationally accepted standard for describing patients with chronic venous disorders based on the clinical manifestations, the current understanding of disease etiology, the involved anatomy, and the underlying venous pathology. The typical clinical presentation involves poorly demarcated erythematous and eczematous patches and plaques of the lower extremities, with the medial malleolus region being the most frequently and severely involved. The eczematous nature of SD is represented by scaling, erythema, and xerosis of the skin. These skin changes may extend to the foot as well as to the knee. Characteristic symptoms include pruritus (itch) on the medial ankle (which can extend to the shin), pain, lesional inflammation, scaling, and skin color changes and thickening. Itch is the most troublesome symptom, impacting patient quality of life (QOL) and leading to scratching that can aggravate wounds and increase risk of skin infection. Chronic scratching due to itching can also result in skin thickening and lichenification. Brown speckles (hyperpigmentation), the result of hemosiderin deposition, which is the byproduct of hemoglobin from extravasated erythrocytes, also represents a classic chronic sign (Fig. 1). SD may be associated with other typical presentations of chronic venous disease, including cramps, leg aching/pain, itching, swelling, and lipodermatosclerosis. Due to the disruption of the epidermal barrier, secondary infections may also occur, leading to superficial infections such as impetiginization, cellulitis, and erysipelas. Both cellulitis and erysipelas are skin infections caused by bacteria with the main difference being the depth of infection — erysipelas are more superficial, markedly affecting the face and lower limbs, while cellulitis reaches the deeper dermis and subcutaneous fat layers, markedly affecting the palm of the hands and the lower limbs. Importantly, if the underlying venous alterations remain untreated, the venous disease patient may develop chronic venous ulcerations along with oozing and erythema (Fig. 2). Patients with SD may also develop acroangiodermatitis (pseudo–Kaposi sarcoma), and a biopsy may be required to differentiate it from Kaposi sarcoma.

### Diagnosis and management of pelvic venous disorders in women [^6c51734e]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Pelvic venous reflux and obstruction can lead to chronic pelvic pain and extra-pelvic varicosities. This paper will discuss the contemporary understanding of this pathophysiology and its clinical manifestations. It will review evidence-based clinical and imaging criteria of pelvic venous disorders, data supporting benefit from venous interventions, criticisms of the available data and highlight evidence research gaps that exist. Finally, it will argue that comparative outcomes research utilizing standardized patient selection for embolization and stenting, embolization treatment strategies that eliminate the pelvic varices (at least to start), and clinically relevant outcome measures are necessary to establish the benefit of vascular treatments.

Treatments

The goals of current treatment options in patients with SD include addressing the clinical impact of the underlying venous insufficiency, edema, and inflammation (itch and pain), improving skin lesions, and healing ulcers (Table 2). Initial options for the treatment of SD include exercise, walking, and leg elevation, although such approaches are generally effective only for mild cases of SD. The cornerstone of treatment for SD remains compression therapy through bandages or stockings, using a high pressure of about 60 mmHg or a median pressure of about 30 mmHg, respectively, to reduce the ambulatory venous pressure and resultant hypertension. Although compression was demonstrated to alleviate swelling, pain, and stasis skin changes in patients with SD, this approach often fails due to nonadherence or loss of stocking elasticity after repeated use. Indeed, only about 50–60% of patients comply with compression therapy, with bandages being more challenging to apply correctly (versus stockings) without professional guidance. In addition, the synthetic rubber in compression stockings can result in allergic contact dermatitis of the lower extremities, further impacting treatment adherence. Topical dressings, such as the Unna boot, which is a bandage that contains moist zinc oxide, can also be utilized. Such dressings serve as non-elastic compressions that contain a topical treatment for SD. The Unna boot can also be combined with other treatments, including topical corticosteroids. Use of the Unna boot alleviates various SD symptoms, including cutaneous inflammation, pruritus, and eczema. One study found the use of the Unna boot over a topical ointment to be more efficacious than Unna boot compression alone.

### Venous interventions: controversies in the management of acute deep venous thrombosis and the role of the interventional radiologist [^f19c58b1]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is estimated to occur in 1 in 1000 persons annually in adult populations, with prevalence predicted to double by the year 2050. While acute DVT and pulmonary embolism are a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the long-term prognosis for patients with venous thromboembolism is in part determined by the development of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), which occurs in up to 50% of patients. PTS refers to a chronic syndrome complex, invariably characterized by intractable edema, pain, stasis dermatitis, and venous stasis ulceration when severe.

### Current approaches to venous ulcers and compression [^40048748]. Dermatologic Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Venous ulcers affect as many as 2.5 million people in the United States and can cause substantial pain and loss of function.

Objective

To review current approaches to venous ulcers and compression.

Method

Treatment options that have been proposed in the literature are discussed utilizing the Cochrane library database, Medline, and the author's clinical experience.

Results

Diagnostic findings and management strategies for venous ulcers are reviewed.

Conclusion

Good wound care and compression therapy will heal the majority of small venous ulcers of short duration. For ulcers that are slow to heal, other approaches such as venous surgery and grafting with conventional or bioengineered skin substitutes should be considered.

### Epidemiology of acute deep vein thrombosis [^d707a11a]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Although the factors leading to venous thrombosis have been known for over a century, Virchow's initial model of thrombosis has been extensively refined. Activated coagulation is now recognized to be of primary importance in venous thrombogenesis; the concept of venous injury has been expanded to include molecular changes in the endothelium; and stasis has been redefined as a largely permissive factor. Furthermore, it is now clear that venous thrombi undergo a dynamic evolution beginning early after their formation. The natural history of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a balance between recurrent thrombotic events and processes that restore the venous lumen, both of which have important implications for the development of complications. Although pulmonary embolism (PE) is clearly the most life threatening complication of acute DVT, the long term socio-economic consequences of the post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) have perhaps been underemphasized in clinical trials. The development of post-thrombotic manifestations is related to both residual venous obstruction and valvular incompetence. Recognition of the factors contributing to a poor outcome, including recurrent thrombotic events, the rate of recanalization, the global extent of venous reflux, and the anatomic distribution of reflux and obstruction is important, as there may be therapeutic alternatives to alter the natural history of acute DVT. The treatment alternatives will continue to expand with the introduction of new therapeutic drugs, for both systemic and catheter-directed therapy, and mechanical thrombectomy devices. The primary care physician is challenged with the task of correctly evaluating deep vein thrombosis and providing his patient with access to the most clinically appropriate, and cost-effective, diagnostic and management options available. This article will review the epidemiology of DVT, its risk factors and major complications.

### 2025 SCAI clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic venous disease: this statement was endorsed by the Society for Vascular Medicine (SVM) [^cb71719c]. Journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions (2025). High credibility.

SCAI chronic venous disease — background and methods state that chronic venous disease (CVD) affects over 25 million adults in the United States with quality-of-life symptoms, and treatments range from compression and wound care to invasive options. These guidelines are based on original systematic reviews with support from the Evidence Foundation and used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess certainty and formulate recommendations. The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong (the guideline panel recommends…) or conditional (the guideline panel suggests…), and two algorithms for the management of symptomatic varicose veins and venous ulcer disease were created to facilitate implementation.

Although no drugs are currently approved for the treatment of SD symptoms, several topical options are used to relieve the symptoms associated with SD. Skin care treatments for SD include non-soap cleansers, barrier preparations, and bland emollients. Moisturization through the liberal application of emollients is recommended to address the skin dryness that is associated with the concomitant xerosis. High- or mid-potency topical corticosteroids can also be used intermittently to relieve pruritus, although prolonged use may lead to cutaneous atrophy and systemic side effects. Topical calcineurin inhibitors are also an option given their effectiveness in other steroid-responsive dermatoses. Although topical tacrolimus (used off-label) has been shown to be effective for the treatment of SD, topical calcineurin inhibitors are associated with a burning sensation upon application and require patient education due to a box warning for an increased risk of lymphoma. Cutaneous hyperpigmentation often persists even if the chronic venous insufficiency is treated; although responses are often poor, noncoherent intense pulsed light or laser treatments do represent an approach to removing hyperpigmentation.

Multiple oral treatments have shown promise in improving some of the symptoms experienced by patients with SD. Oral pentoxifylline is often used with or without compression therapy to reduce leg pain and to increase the healing rate of venous ulcers. Pentoxifylline is an inhibitor of platelet aggregation that reduces blood viscosity, thereby improving microcirculation. Pentoxifylline has been shown to be effective for the treatment of venous ulcers when added to compression therapy. Edema may be reduced through the use of venoactive drugs, which reduce capillary permeability, increase venous tone, decrease blood viscosity and improve lymphatic drainage. Escin, a horse chestnut seed extract that stimulates F-series prostaglandins, is used to improve symptoms of chronic venous insufficiency on a short-term basis. Another venoactive drug, micronized purified flavonoid fraction, was shown to be more potent than other venoactive drugs at reducing ankle edema.

Diagnosis and Histopathology

Several risk factors were established with the development of venous insufficiency leading to SD, including older age, female sex, pregnancy, obesity, prolonged sitting or standing, heart failure, and family history of venous disease (Table 1). The association with pregnancy and obesity is due to extra stress placed on the patient's lower extremities. Patients who are unable to move may experience leg edema caused by venous stasis that is due to immobility itself and not to anatomical venous complications. Risk factors such as a sedentary lifestyle and obesity can be addressed, potentially resulting in disease improvement.

Table 1
Established risk factors for developing stasis dermatitis

SD is typically diagnosed by clinical evaluation of the affected skin and medical history. If the initial diagnosis is inconclusive, duplex ultrasounds can be used to detect the direction of blood flow, assess venous reflux, and identify potential venous obstructions. Widespread use of duplex ultrasound is supported by its accuracy, non-invasiveness, and cost-effectiveness. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can also be used to detect obstructions in proximal veins and surrounding structures. A diagnosis of SD can be confirmed through biopsy and demonstration of classic histological features of SD, including hemosiderin-laden macrophages, dermal fibrosis, extravasated erythrocytes, perivascular lymphocytic infiltration, and the proliferation of dilated blood vessels in the papillary dermis. Biopsies are generally avoided because the impaired blood flow in the affected areas of skin can result in poor healing and development of ulcers.

### Venous leg ulcers: a review of published assessment and treatment algorithms [^a005cc00]. Advances in Wound Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The literature search for venous insufficiency classifications and treatments was conducted in PubMed and Embase in June 2020. These databases have comprehensive global coverage of health, biology, nursing, and chemistry academic journals. The search strategy used the following keywords and terms: venous insufficiency, venous stasis, VLUs, stratification classification, algorithm, treatment, pathophysiology, and pathomechanism. Two hundred and fifty-nine articles were evaluated for applicability to the topic; 37 were selected as relevant to the topic and reviewed. Fourteen were included.

Articles found in the bibliographies of these 37 articles were also reviewed for possible inclusion (47 additional articles reviewed, 31 of which were included). Additional literature deemed generally relevant to cover the topic (but not related to an algorithm, a classification system, or a guideline/consensus document) and already available to the authors was also included (22 additional articles and 1 book chapter). In total, 106 articles and 1 book chapter were reviewed and 68 documents were cited.

Pathogenesis

Venous reflux that drives venous hypertension can be the result of incompetent venous valves, obstruction to venous flow, or failure of the lower extremity muscle pump and may occur in the superficial or deep venous systems. In a study of patients with chronic venous disease, primary valvular incompetence was present in 70–80% of cases; valvular incompetence was due to trauma or deep vein thrombosis in 18–25% of cases. In chronic venous insufficiency, increased venous hypertension initiates changes in the local subcutaneous tissue and skin, including activation of the endothelial cells, extravasation of red blood cells and macromolecules, diapedesis of leukocytes, and inflammatory changes that are often noted at and above the ankles. There is an accumulation of clinical evidence to support the concept that venous hypertension causes SD. One study that examined 360 lower limbs indicated a positive correlation between increased ambulatory venous pressure and severe skin damage. In another study, venous hypertension was found to be the only plausible cause of SD in patients with superficial venous insufficiency, with negative patch testing and without insufficiency of the deep veins. Interestingly, in this second study, surgical intervention targeting the venous pressure resulted in the complete and rapid resolution of SD for all patients who underwent surgery.

### Acute venous problems: integrating medical, surgical, and interventional treatments [^3d34104a]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

"Acute venous problems" refers to a group of disorders that affect the veins and result in sudden and severe symptoms. They can be classified based on the pathological triggering mechanisms, such as thrombosis and/or mechanical compression, and their consequences, including symptoms, signs, and complications. The management and therapeutic approach depend on the severity of the disease, the location, and the involvement of the vein segment. Although summarizing these conditions can be challenging, the objective of this narrative review was to provide an overview of the most common acute venous problems. This will include an exhaustive yet concise and practical description of each condition. The multidisciplinary approach remains one of the major advantages in dealing with these conditions, maximizing the results and the prevention of complications.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^73674c45]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Venous leg ulcer guideline development methodology — The Venous Ulcer Guidelines Committee was divided into six sub-committee sections (diagnosis; compression; surgery/endovascular; wound care; ancillary; and prevention) and developed key clinical questions: what is the best treatment for active (CEAP C6) venous ulcer, the best treatment for healed venous ulcer (CEAP C5), the best method for preventing recurrence of venous ulcers, and whether progression from CEAP C4 to CEAP C6/C5 can be prevented. The surgery/endovascular and compression sections were selected for a de novo development of specific guideline recommendations, and the committee commissioned an independent group to conduct two systematic reviews evaluating different compression strategies and endovascular and open surgical approaches with a priori protocols. To minimize heterogeneity, the review specified that language "all would be included", limited studies to randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials with cohort, and retrospective large observational case series published in peer-reviewed journals, and stated the target audience is specialists who treat vascular disease and wounds. The committee developed guidelines based on the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) system.

### Stasis dermatitis: pathophysiology, evaluation, and management [^397ed7c2]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Stasis dermatitis commonly occurs in older age. It is caused by venous hypertension resulting from retrograde flow due to incompetent venous valves, valve destruction, or obstruction of the venous system. Further tissue changes arise from an inflammatory process mediated by metalloproteinases, which are up-regulated by ferric ion from extravasated red blood cells. Stasis dermatitis presents initially as poorly demarcated erythematous plaques of the lower legs bilaterally, classically involving the medial malleolus. It is one of the spectrum of cutaneous findings that may result from chronic venous insufficiency. Its mimics include cellulitis, contact dermatitis, and pigmented purpuric dermatoses. Duplex ultrasound is useful in demonstrating venous reflux when the clinical diagnosis of stasis dermatitis is inadequate. Conservative treatment involves the use of compression therapy directed at improving ambulatory venous pressure. Interventional therapy currently includes minimally invasive techniques such as endovenous thermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, which have supplanted the use of open surgical techniques.

Burden of Disease

Chronic venous disease, including SD, is associated with pain and a reduced QOL, including limitations in physical function, sleep, and mobility. Reductions in physical functioning and mobility can limit the patient's ability to apply topical medications or to put on or take off compression stockings, thereby worsening the situation. Patients with SD also report social isolation and depression. Emotional and social well-being can be impacted by the cosmetic skin changes (including hyperpigmentation and scaling) typically observed. Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation can persist even after other signs and symptoms have resolved with therapy. A study of 2404 patients using the generic Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey questionnaire identified a significant correlation between the severity of venous disease and the decline in the affected patient's QOL. Similarly, a correlation was found between CEAP class and QOL using a disease-specific questionnaire. A study examining QOL in patients with advanced venous insufficiency found that patients suffered from severe pain and discomfort, with patients' overall level of independence being lower than that of healthy individuals. As previously noted, pruritus is one of the troublesome symptoms reported in SD. In a survey involving an elderly population, SD was the most commonly reported dermatitis to cause itch. Patients with pruritus of the lower extremities exhibited lower health-related QOL and higher leg pain ratings than those without pruritus. Compounding this issue, the itch in SD can be refractory to conventional therapies.

Chronic venous diseases, including SD, directly impact healthcare resources and are associated with a loss of annual workdays and an increase in overall treatment costs. In the United States, treatment costs of venous diseases are between US$2.5 and US$3 billion, with a loss of 2 million workdays per year. Overall, chronic venous diseases account for 1–3% of the total healthcare budgets in nations with developed healthcare systems, although there is not a robust body of literature that describes the economic impact of SD. Moreover, chronic venous insufficiency in general is often underdiagnosed and undertreated for prolonged periods of time, and the low recognition of SD within the healthcare system and a lack of dermatology services in many hospitals, emergency rooms, and urgent care settings further compounds the burden on the patient. Several healthcare specialists (including general physicians, dermatologists, geriatricians, vascular surgeons, and wound care specialists) may be involved in the initial interaction with and subsequent care of the patient.

### Diagnosis and treatment of venous ulcers [^d7fa85ba]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Venous ulcer, also known as stasis ulcer, is the most common etiology of lower extremity ulceration, affecting approximately 1 percent of the U.S. population. Possible causes of venous ulcers include inflammatory processes resulting in leukocyte activation, endothelial damage, platelet aggregation, and intracellular edema. The primary risk factors for venous ulcer development are older age, obesity, previous leg injuries, deep venous thrombosis, and phlebitis. On physical examination, venous ulcers are generally irregular, shallow, and located over bony prominences. Granulation tissue and fibrin are typically present in the ulcer base. Associated findings include lower extremity varicosities, edema, venous dermatitis, and lipodermatosclerosis. Venous ulcers are usually recurrent, and an open ulcer can persist for weeks to many years. Severe complications include cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and malignant change. Poor prognostic factors include large ulcer size and prolonged duration. Evidence-based treatment options for venous ulcers include leg elevation, compression therapy, dressings, pentoxifylline, and aspirin therapy. Surgical management may be considered for ulcers that are large in size, of prolonged duration, or refractory to conservative measures.

### Superficial venous disease-an updated review [^cca2c97a]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This review article provides an updated review of a relatively common pathology with various manifestations. Superficial venous diseases (SVDs) are a broad spectrum of venous vascular disease that predominantly affects the body's lower extremities. The most serious manifestation of this disease includes varicose veins, chronic venous insufficiency, stasis dermatitis, venous ulcers, superficial venous thrombosis, reticular veins, and spider telangiectasias.

Methods

The anatomy, pathophysiology, and risk factors of SVD were discussed during this review. The risk factors for developing SVD were related to race, age, sex, lifestyle, and certain genetic conditions as well as comorbid deep vein thrombosis. Various classification systems were listed, focusing on the most common one-the revised Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology classification. The clinical features including history and physical examination findings elicited in SVD were outlined.

Results

Imaging modalities utilized in SVD were highlighted. Duplex ultrasound is the first line in evaluating SVD but magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography venography, plethysmography, and conventional venography are feasible options in the event of an ambiguous venous duplex ultrasound study. Treatment options highlighted in this review ranged from conservative treatment with compression stockings, which could be primary or adjunctive to pharmacologic topical and systemic agents such as azelaic acid, diuretics, plant extracts, medical foods, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anticoagulants and skin substitutes for different stages of SVD. Interventional treatment modalities include thermal ablative techniques like radiofrequency ablationss, endovenous laser ablation, endovenous steam ablation, and endovenous microwave ablation as well as nonthermal strategies such as the Varithena (polidocanol microfoam) sclerotherapy, VenaSeal (cyanoacrylate) ablation, and Endovenous mechanochemical ablation. Surgical treatments are also available and include debridement, vein ligation, stripping, and skin grafting.

Conclusions

SVDs are prevalent and have varied manifestations predominantly in the lower extremities. Several studies highlight the growing clinical and financial burden of these diseases. This review provides an update on the pathophysiology, classification, clinical features, and imaging findings as well as the conservative, pharmacological, and interventional treatment options indicated for different SVD pathologies. It aims to expedite the timely deployment of therapies geared toward reducing the significant morbidity associated with SVD especially varicose veins, venous ulcers, and venous insufficiency, to improve the quality of life of these patients and prevent complications.

### Chronic venous disease. part 1: pathophysiology and clinical features [^b3fbd157]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic venous disease (CVD) is a commonly encountered condition in the dermatology outpatient department. If untreated, CVD may progress to chronic leg ulcer causing serious morbidity to the patient. It also affects the quality of life of the affected patient and contributes to loss of work productivity. The spectrum of clinical manifestations for CVD is myriad, ranging from asymptomatic varicose veins and pigmentation to ulceration and scarring. Awareness of spectrum of clinical presentations is required to identify, diagnose and manage CVD. Long-standing cases may develop ankle joint stiffness, fixed flexion deformity, periostitis and even Marjolin ulcer. Increased venous hypertension, thought to result from valve incompetence and failure of the calf muscle pump, is central to the pathophysiology of the development of CVD. Tissue oedema, hypoxia and subsequent fibrosis are major immediate contributing factors responsible for the clinical manifestations of CVD. Localized, chronic inflammation is now increasingly being recognized as a key player, directly responsible for stasis dermatitis and hypercoagulable state. The complete ramifications of persistent inflammation in CVD are yet to be understood and serious systemic morbidities such as arterial and cardiac disease are increasingly being recognized in association with CVD.

It has been estimated that chronic venous insufficiency affects 10 to 35 percent of the entire U.S. population and that 4 percent of people older than 65 have active venous ulcers. The high prevalence of the disease results in an annual expenditure of more than 1 billion dollars a year to the U.S. health care system. To have a rational approach toward patients with venous ulcers, it is important to understand the pathophysiology and clinical characteristics of the disease process, in order to initiate appropriate treatment and prevent venous ulcer recurrence.

### Consensus statement on the management of nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions from the VIVA foundation, the American Venous Forum, and the American Vein and Lymphatic Society [^7bf70824]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2024). Medium credibility.

A nonthrombotic iliac vein lesion (NIVL) is defined by extrinsic compression of the iliac vein, most typically occurring between arterial structures and the vertebral body of the spine. This compression results in intrinsic venous luminal stenosis (Figure 1 A), characterized by vessel wall fibrosis and intraluminal webs or spurs. Although comprehensive population-based prevalence studies are lacking, smaller computed tomography (CT)-based investigations have reported anatomic compression in up to 70% of the asymptomatic population. Symptoms of lower extremity chronic venous insufficiency or pelvic venous disease can develop secondary to NIVL. Factors that determine symptomatic manifestations of anatomic compression remain unclear. Symptoms may present along a spectrum, including asymmetrical edema, pain (manifested when walking or standing for extended periods of time), secondary varicose veins, and venous ulcerations. Prevalence estimates from single-center studies suggest that NIVL occurs in 53% to 87% of patients with Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology class 4 to 6 venous disease. Thus, patient selection based on symptoms is a key factor, given that anatomic compression has been observed in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

Figure 1.
Schematic rendering of nonthrombotic iliac vein lesion causes. A, Compression of the left common iliac vein by the left common iliac artery with collateral formation; and B, poststent placement.

Venous duplex ultrasound, insufficiency (reflux) examinations, and axial imaging are most commonly used to assess for the presence of a NIVL. Venography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) are the mainstays for endovascular assessment of NIVL and planning before stent placement. IVUS has become the primary modality by which NIVLs are evaluated and an important tool for the evaluation of lesion severity, as well as an adjunct to endovascular intervention. In appropriately selected patients with moderate or severe symptoms, stent placement (Figure 1 B) can result in improved pain, swelling, quality of life (QOL), and, when present, the healing of venous stasis ulcers. Stent patency is well preserved in the majority of cases, with a low incidence of clinically driven need for reintervention. However, inappropriate stent placement or inappropriate stent sizing can result in undesired outcomes, such as a lack of symptom improvement or stent migration.

Postoperative care

Effective postoperative management is a critical component of care for patients who have undergone venous stenting. Follow-up visits typically involve clinical evaluation, imaging studies, and patient-reported outcome measures. Generally, the first follow-up is recommended within the first month after the procedure, followed by subsequent visits at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter. These time frames facilitate the early identification of any immediate postoperative issues and the monitoring of stent patency over time.

Oral anticoagulation is generally recommended for patients after stent implantation to prevent in-stent stenosis or stent occlusion. The choice of agent and the duration of therapy should be individualized. Treatment may range from short term (3–6 months for NIVLs)to long term, depending on the patient's risk factors, the complexity of the reconstruction, and the presence of any stent-related issues. It is essential to strike a balance between the prevention of complications and the risk of bleeding associated with antithrombotic therapy. The role of antiplatelet therapy is less certain; in our practice, we typically opt for monotherapy, considering the lack of evidence for dual antiplatelet therapy and the heightened bleeding risk. Close collaboration with a hematologist is recommended to tailor antithrombotic treatment strategies on an individual basis.

In conjunction with pharmacotherapy, mechanical adjunctive measures such as intermittent pneumatic compression devices can be used perioperatively and afterwards to decrease thrombotic risks. Intermittent pneumatic compression increases venous peak velocity, time-averaged maximum velocity, and volume flowand enables emptying deep veins of the lower limb and preventing stasis.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^2505a753]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Venous disease pathophysiology — reflux from primary venous disease has a much higher prevalence in patients presenting with different stages of CVD, including venous ulcers, whereas obstruction from secondary venous disease and valvular reflux are associated with a much more rapid progression of disease and a higher rate of progression to venous ulceration; whether reflux or obstruction predominates clinically is unclear, but both conditions lead to increased ambulatory venous pressure. The fundamental basis for CVD and venous ulceration is inflammation within the venous circulation subjected to increased hydrostatic pressure resulting in increased ambulatory venous pressure, with inflammation involving leukocytes (in particular macrophages and monocytes), inflammatory modulators and chemokines, cytokine expression, growth factors, metalloproteinase activity, and regulatory pathways that perpetuate inflammation. The pathophysiologic process of primary venous disease leads to dilated tortuous, valve-insufficient varicose veins, venous hypertension, and associated clinical manifestations, whereas secondary venous disease involves inflammation, thrombosis, recanalization resulting in venous wall damage and dilation, and valve insufficiency; the clinical picture is that of the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS).

### Review of the current evidence for topical treatment for venous leg ulcers [^99bbe19b]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The development of a venous leg ulcer (VLU) represents the most severe clinical manifestation of a chronic venous disease. Despite major progress, our understanding of the VLU pathogenesis and wound healing biology has remained limited. Treatment of VLUs remains a serious challenge for physicians of different specialties. In the present review, we focused on describing the rationale and scientific basis for topical wound care in the management of VLUs.

Methods

A literature review was performed to summarize the methods with proven efficacy in VLU management. A systematic search was also performed to identify new evidence from the randomized controlled trials reported from 2014 to 2021. The scientific challenges, clinical practice concerns, economic obstacles, and possible directions for further research have been discussed.

Results

Hundreds of topical products have been advertised for the treatment of VLUs. However, the reported data on the topical treatment of venous ulcers are insufficient, scattered, and weak, with significant methodologic flaws. A total of 43 randomized controlled trials on the topical treatment of VLUs were reported from 2014 to 2021. Thus, the clinical practice guidelines require updating. We identified major gaps in knowledge and have provided suggestions for future research directions.

Conclusions

The American Venous Forum Research Committee would like to bring attention to the use of topical wound care for VLUs as a critical gap in knowledge and to encourage scientists, practitioners, and industry to collaborate to fill this gap.

### Paradigm shift and long-term results in the diagnosis and treatment of pelvic venous disorder [^5a25bc93]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center cohort study combining retrospective analysis of a randomized controlled trial and prospectively collected data
- **Key Findings**: Pelvic venous disorder exhibits a wide range of clinical, anatomical, and hemodynamic presentations, requiring personalized treatment approaches. A thorough preoperative assessment of the patient's predominant symptoms and the patterns of venous obstruction or reflux is essential to guide effective therapy. Tailored interventions — such as gonadal vein embolization, iliac vein stenting, or renal vein stenting — are associated with low complication and reintervention rates.
- **Take Home Message**: A patient-specific strategy — rooted in detailed venous mapping and tailored endovascular therapies — optimizes outcomes in pelvic venous disorder. Clinicians must prioritize individualized clinical, anatomical, and hemodynamic assessments over universal protocols to ensure good outcomes.

Pelvic venous disorder (PeVD) encompasses a spectrum of symptoms arising from venous dysfunction in the abdomen, pelvis, and drainage pathways. Clinical manifestations such as chronic pelvic pain (CPP), flank pain, hematuria, proteinuria, lower limb chronic venous disease (CVD), and dyspareunia have traditionally been attributed to isolated syndromes (eg, pelvic congestion, Nutcracker syndrome, or May-Thurner syndromes). However, these designations oversimplify the heterogeneous anatomical, hemodynamic, and clinical features of PeVD, potentially hindering accurate diagnosis and management.

The variability in PeVD presentations complicates the development of standardized treatment strategies, highlighting the need for a personalized approach that correlates clinical symptoms with specific venous pathology. This study evaluates a protocol that integrates the preoperative assessment of clinical manifestations with detailed anatomical and hemodynamic mapping — including venous obstruction and reflux patterns — to guide tailored interventions and address this complexity.

Our primary objectives were to assess long-term clinical outcomes — including symptom relief, quality-of-life improvement, and safety — after protocol-guided treatment and to analyze reintervention and complication rates. By emphasizing individualized care, this work aims to refine PeVD management and improve patient-centered outcomes.

Wound and infectious management

Areas of sclerotic cutaneous GVHD have particularly poor wound healing, particularly when ulcers develop on the lower extremities (Figure 17). Peripheral edema and concomitant venous stasis can further complicate healing and should be addressed with compression (if tolerated and not contraindicated by peripheral arterial disease). Because of this, it is important to aggressively manage new and developing wounds to prevent further deterioration. While supportive measures such as emollients, skin cleansers, wound dressings, and antimicrobial agents may be used, if severe, patients may require skin grafts. For severe ulcerations, interdisciplinary consultation with dermatology, plastic surgery, and wound care teams is advised. Chronically nonhealing wounds may also necessitate skin biopsy to evaluate for underlying skin cancer in the area.

To reduce the risk of infection of erosions and ulcerations in areas of sclerotic cutaneous GVHD, dilute acetic acid, dilute sodium hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid solutions may be used for cleansing the wound daily. Dressings with antimicrobial properties include those that contain silver, gentian violet, methylene blue, or iodine, among others. Patients should be counseled to moisturize the skin frequently with emollients and avoid trauma to the skin which can predispose to wounds developing.

GVHD-associated angiomatosis

Patients with chronic cutaneous GVHD can develop benign reactive vascular proliferations within areas of sclerosis, termed GVHD-associated angiomatosis. Developing a median of 44 months after transplant, this eruption is characterized by asymptomatic vascular papules and nodules, most frequently arising on the lower extremities and trunk (Figure 18). The clinical differential for such lesions can include angiomas, pyogenic granulomas, and angiokeratomas. The exact etiology is unclear and varying treatments have been attempted with some cases of success, including external-beam radiation, shave biopsy with electrocautery, and oral propranolol and sirolimus. Thalidomide was found to have no benefit.

Special Tests

Sclerotic and fascial cGVHD can often be difficult to diagnose, given its indolent nature and clinical overlap with other lower extremity disorders (Figure 14). MRI can be an additional tool to demonstrate active disease, detecting pathological changes in the deep soft tissues or heightened signal intensity in the superficial and deep fasciae. Furthermore, use of contrast may allow for estimating the degree of inflammation. Other techniques, such as high-frequency ultrasound, digital heat mapping, myotonometry, and durometry, have been explored in sclerotic GVHD. However, they have not been validated for routine use in clinical practice.

Differential Diagnosis

Cutaneous cGVHD is clinically heterogeneous, with a distinct differential diagnosis depending on the clinical manifestation (Figure 14). Lichen-planus-like cGVHD (Figure 15) can present similarly to a lichenoid drug eruption, tinea corporis, psoriasis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, secondary syphilis, mycosis fungoides, and, of course, idiopathic lichen planus. Lichenoid drug eruptions can be caused by common medications (e.g. ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and allopurinol) and may not develop until several months after drug initiation.

Deep sclerosis of the lower legs is challenging to diagnose and differentiate from chronic venous stasis, lipodermatosclerosis, and, less commonly, scleroderma, eosinophilic fasciitis, or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. A biopsy may be nondiagnostic, and the presence or absence of associated features (e.g. varicose veins, brawny hyperpigmentation in the setting of chronic venous stasis) is critical.

Until the past decade, venous disease was commonly underdiagnosed and undertreated due to lack of interest on the part of providers and to reluctance to undergo procedures on the part of patients. Modern venous interventions, improved diagnostic modalities, and increased awareness through education, training, and screening programs have all raised enthusiasm for venous disease in recent years. This has been crucial to gain control over a disease that affects a significant proportion of the population, with women being affected more than men. This article will discuss epidemiologic studies that highlight some of the gender-related issues and review the risk factors for venous disease. We will also discuss the physiologic venous changes that occur with pregnancy and highlight functional venous disease in women. Finally, we will review the indications for and treatment of superficial venous disease.

Superficial venous reflux can be a significant contributor to chronic venous stasis wounds of the lower extremity, the treatment of which can be costly both in terms of overall health care expenditure and lost working days for affected patients. Although commonly thought of as a benign process, superficial venous thrombosis is associated with several underlying pathologic processes, including malignancy and deep venous thrombosis.

Venous leg ulcers account for approximately 70% of all leg ulcers and affect 2.2 million Americans annually. After a comprehensive patient and wound assessment, compression therapy remains the cornerstone of standard care. Adjuvant care with topical or systemic agents is used for wounds that do not heal within 4 weeks. Once healed, long-term compression therapy with stockings or surgical intervention will reduce the incidence of recurrence. This continuing medical education article aims to outline optimal management for patients with venous leg ulcers, highlighting the role of a multidisciplinary team in delivering high quality care.

For patients with symptomatic varicose veins and/or chronic venous insufficiency, the SCAI guideline panel suggests compression therapy rather than no compression therapy (conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence). For patients with venous ulcers, the SCAI guideline panel recommends compression therapy rather than no compression therapy (strong recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence). Remarks indicate that some patients may prefer interventional alternatives such as sclerotherapy, phlebectomy, or ablation if appropriate, and that stronger grades of compression therapy may be more effective.

BACKGROUND

VLUs are a manifestation of long-term chronic venous disease (CVD), also termed chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) when describing the more advanced stages of the disease. This is defined as an abnormally functioning venous system caused by venous valvular incompetence. Venous outflow may or may not be obstructed, and the abnormal function may affect the superficial venous system, the deep venous system, or both. The development of this condition is influenced by multiple factors, including genetics, female sex, pregnancies, age, prolonged standing, trauma, and obesity. Some of these factors can be mitigated through lifestyle (increasing exercise, controlling body weight, and avoiding smoking), but others are not modifiable and many individuals will inevitably develop CVD over time. This condition is diagnosed based on history, clinical presentation, and diagnostic tests, with duplex ultrasound being the gold standard. Understanding how this disease progresses and how it can be slowed or prevented is critical in managing it.

An assessment tool to precisely describe cases of CVD has been developed with two parts: a classification of CVD and a severity scoring system. The classification system describes the stages of chronic venous disease using the Clinical manifestations, the Etiologic factors, the Anatomic distribution of disease, and the underlying Pathophysiologic findings (CEAP). The severity scoring is achieved by reporting the anatomic segments involved with either reflux or obstruction. This classification system was first published in 1995 9 following a consensus conference with international representation and endorsement by the joint councils of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the North American Chapter of the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery. The scale has been updated over time and published as the Revised CEAP classificationand the 2020 update of the CEAP classification system and reporting standards. Today, most published clinical articles on CVD use the CEAP classification system or at least some portion of it. Table 1 presents the CEAP classification system. Additional scoring systems intended to complement the CEAP were also proposed: a Venous Clinical Severity Score (0–3 grading scheme for nine attributes of CVD); a Venous Segmental Disease Score (based on venous segmental involvement with reflux or obstruction as determined by imaging), and a Venous Disability Score (to accommodate for differences between patients on what constitutes "usual activities"). The Venous Clinical Severity Score was revised in 2010 for better applicability.

Introduction — burden and outcomes in acute iliofemoral DVT note that patients often experience pulmonary embolism (PE), severe presenting limb symptoms, and poor long-term clinical outcomes, and despite markedly reduced PE risk with timely anticoagulant therapy, many develop postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) manifesting as limb pain, heaviness, swelling, fatigue, and venous stasis skin changes such as skin ulceration. A large (N = 1,149) prospective cohort study found that patients with acute iliofemoral DVT experience a 2.4 times increased risk of recurrent DVT compared with patients with less-extensive DVT, and another study documented frequent venous claudication, severe venous physiologic abnormalities, and impaired health-related quality of life.

Venous disease is the most common cause of leg ulcers. The refractory nature of venous ulcers affects the quality of life and work productivity of those persons afflicted. This, in combination with the high costs of long-term therapy, makes venous ulcers a major health problem in developed countries. Management of venous leg ulcers is based on understanding pathophysiologic abnormalities. In recent years, identifying prognostic factors for healing and developing novel therapeutic approaches for venous ulcers have offered valuable tools for the management of patients with this disorder.

### Safety and efficacy of venoplasty in MS: a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled phase II trial [^f1ed7689]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and degenerative demyelinating disease of the human CNS. While abundant scientific and clinical data support the involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of MS, the etiology and management of many clinical manifestations of the disease (e.g. fatigue and cognitive impairment) remain poorly understood. Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), described as a combination of extracranial venous structural and flow anomalies, had been proposed as contributing to the pathogenesis and disabling symptomsin MS, and subsequently in other conditions including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and Ménière disease. It had been postulated that impaired venous drainage would cause stasis leading to perivenular iron deposition triggering inflammation. This pathogenic hypothesis remains poorly supported, and venous narrowing has been found as frequently in healthy volunteers as in patients with MS. Multiple uncontrolled, unblinded studies and case series suggested that venous dilation with or without intravascular stenting could improve symptoms and modify the disease course in MS, and Ménière disease. These procedures were promoted through social media and were readily available through medical tourismdespite warnings by regulatory bodies including the US Food and Drug Administration about significant complications.

We conducted a randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, interventional trial in relapsing-remitting and progressive forms of MSto determine short- and long-term safety and efficacy on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and standard clinical and MRI outcomes up to 48 weeks.

### Medical management of venous ulcers [^e2ca3d5c]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Venous disease is the most common cause of chronic leg ulceration and represents an advanced clinical manifestation of venous insufficiency. Due to their frequency and chronicity, venous ulcers have a high socioeconomic impact, with treatment costs accounting for 1% of the health care budget in Western countries. The evaluation of patients with venous ulcers should include a thorough medical history for prior deep venous thrombosis, assessment for an hypercoagulable state, and a physical examination. Use of the CEAP (clinical, etiology, anatomy, pathophysiology) Classification System and the revised Venous Clinical Severity Scoring System is strongly recommended to characterize disease severity and assess response to treatment. This venous condition requires lifestyle modification, with affected individuals performing daily intervals of leg elevation to control edema; use of elastic compression garments; and moderate physical activity, such as walking wearing below-knee elastic stockings. Meticulous skin care, treatment of dermatitis, and prompt treatment of cellulitis are important aspects of medical management. The pharmacology of chronic venous insufficiency and venous ulcers include essentially two medications: pentoxifylline and phlebotropic agents. The micronized purified flavonoid fraction is an effective adjunct to compression therapy in patients with large, chronic ulceration.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® lower extremity chronic venous disease [^2a38f394]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Lower extremity venous insufficiency is a chronic medical condition resulting from primary valvular incompetence or, less commonly, prior deep venous thrombosis or extrinsic venous obstruction. Lower extremity chronic venous disease has a high prevalence with a related socioeconomic burden. In the United States, over 11 million males and 22 million females 40 to 80 years of age have varicose veins, with over 2 million adults having advanced chronic venous disease. The high cost to the health care system is related to the recurrent nature of venous ulcerative disease, with total treatment costs estimated > $2.5 billion per year in the United States, with at least 20,556 individuals with newly diagnosed venous ulcers yearly. Various diagnostic and treatment strategies are in place for lower extremity chronic venous disease and are discussed in this document. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### PRACTICE GUIDELINES chronic deep venous obstruction [^742ba726]. AVLS (2024). High credibility.

Non-thrombotic and post-thrombotic venous obstruction — clinical manifestations of femoroiliocaval veins (FICV) obstruction: Obstructions of the femoroiliocaval veins (FICV) cause chronic venous hypertension and high venous pressures in the tissues peripheral to the site of obstruction, which can result in inflammatory changes that can be a major cause of physical disability and chronic pain. The common clinical manifestations of chronic venous hypertension include pain in the lower extremities (LE), vulva, pelvis, or low back at rest, with standing or walking, and occasionally pain with intercourse. Lower extremity edema and/or lymphedema secondary to venous obstruction and venous hypertension may reduce physical activity due to the heaviness or stiffness of the lower extremities. In addition, FICV obstruction predisposes patients to recurring cellulitis of the lower extremity, and long-standing venous hypertension can lead to inflammatory skin changes including stasis dermatitis, which may progress to venous leg ulceration (VLU).

Several cutaneous disorders can present similarly to SD, leading to delayed or inaccurate diagnosis and subsequent disease mismanagement and the associated impact on patient anxiety and healthcare costs. Indeed, over 10% of the diagnoses of cellulitis are incorrect, with SD being the most common misdiagnosed condition. Cellulitis is associated with previous trauma or a disrupted epithelial barrier in the affected region, marked by unilateral erythematous plaque along with tenderness, swelling, and warmth. Cellulitis is often accompanied by a variety of systemic symptoms, including mild leukocytosis, fever, and, less commonly, regional lymphadenopathy and/or ascending lymphangitis. Indications of cellulitis also include a history of acute progression and improvement with antibiotics. However, SD is often bilateral, not associated with significant tenderness, and chronic and frequently occurs with pitting edema. However, unilateral presentations of SD may be observed when the venous insufficiency is limited to one extremity. Due to the many similarities between cellulitis and SD, patients with SD are often treated for recurrent cellulitis. Given that cellulitis is potentially a medical emergency, a misdiagnosis can result in unnecessary hospitalization and exposure to antibiotics. Not surprisingly, early consultation with a dermatologist was shown to improve the accuracy of diagnosis of inflammatory skin diseases in hospitalized patients.

Allergic contact dermatitis is also a risk factor in patients with a longer history of SD and ulcerations and is often mistaken for SD. Due to the breakdown of the epidermal barrier in patients with SD and frequent and extended use of topical treatments containing sensitizing ingredients, allergic contact dermatitis may present on a background of SD, further complicating the diagnosis. Patch testing is often needed to confirm allergic contact dermatitis. A patient's history, including their previous application of products, stockings, and dressings, is essential when determining which allergens to patch test. Autoeczematization, also known as an id reaction, which is the acute onset of a highly erythematous, pruritic, morbilliform, or papulovesicular eruption due to an exposure to a stimulus, commonly occurs with SD.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^fb225991]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Clinical evaluation — venous leg ulcers (Guideline 3.1) We recommend that for all patients with suspected leg ulcers fitting the definition of venous leg ulcer, clinical evaluation for evidence of chronic venous disease be performed. Clinical evaluation should differentiate primary, secondary, or congenital venous problems and establish presence or absence of venous reflux, obstruction, or both. A thorough medical history should be performed to identify symptoms potentially related to venous disease, including extremity pain, burning, aching, throbbing, cramps, heaviness, itching, tiredness, fatigue, and restless legs. Venous symptoms are usually exacerbated by limb dependency and relieved by rest or elevation. Medical history should also include risk factor assessment for venous disease, including age, body mass index, prior venous thromboembolism, family history of venous thromboembolism, family history of varicose veins, episodes of superficial thrombophlebitis, spontaneous venous rupture, prior use of compression therapy, prior venous operative interventions, use of venotonic medications, presence of other systemic diseases associated with leg wounds, and other possible associated medical factors that may contribute to nonhealing leg wounds. Physical examination for signs of venous disease should include inspection for telangiectasia, varicose veins, edema, chronic venous skin changes (skin discoloration, inflammation, eczema, hyperpigmentation, malleolar flare, corona phlebectatica, atrophie blanche, lipodermatosclerosis), healed ulcer, and active ulcer; palpation for varicosity; palpable venous cord, tenderness, induration, edema, and pulses; auscultation for bruit and reflux; and evaluation of ankle mobility.

Lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — low pretest probability (PTP ≤ 10%): The ASH guideline panel recommends using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding DVT in a population with low prevalence/PTP (≤ 10%), followed by proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole-leg ultrasound if D-dimer is positive, and recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose DVT and against additional testing following negative proximal or whole-leg ultrasound. Validated clinical decision rules were used to assess clinical probability of DVT for a first episode; if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used, this corresponds to the "unlikely DVT" category. If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, and a negative D-dimer rules out DVT and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required. The strategy assumes that test results are obtained under optimal conditions, and suboptimal D-dimer or ultrasound results may require repeat testing.

Iliac vein and inferior vena cava (IVC) stenting — appropriateness and evidence are summarized as follows: Treatment of asymptomatic iliac vein compression, such as May-Thurner disease, as an incidental finding by imaging or for CEAP C1 disease was deemed never appropriate, and for symptomatic C2 disease with or without superficial truncal disease, the panelists indicated that stenting as first-line therapy was rarely appropriate. Endovascular treatment of chronic iliac vein and IVC obstructive disease is increasingly used, but the panelists concurred that research and evidence in this area are lacking; systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that iliac vein and IVC stenting is safe; results in a high technical success rate; and is associated with long-term stent patency, with studies consisting primarily of C3 to C6 cases and the quality of evidence having a low rating by systematic review and considered weak evidence by American and European guidelines and a consortium of venous societies with presentation to the Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee. Symptoms associated with venous obstruction are more likely to involve heaviness and aching relieved or improved with leg elevation, and venous claudication is another clinical manifestation. In the presence of coexisting superficial truncal reflux, the panelists rated that it may be appropriate to treat the iliac vein and IVC as first-line therapy for advanced chronic venous insufficiency (C4-C6), although it remains unclear whether stenting should be done first or used subsequently or concomitantly with treatment of superficial disease, and the strategy of treating the superficial system first may be preferred because of fewer procedural risks.

Disclaimer

The Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) develops evidenced-based clinical practice guidelines as a resource to assist members in the practice of vascular surgery. The guideline recommendations contained herein are based on a recent review of published evidence. They reflect the available body of evidence, and their applicability reflects the limitations of that data and are subject to reassessment and revision as new knowledge emerges. Given these limitations, clinical practice guidelines do not represent a statement of the standard of care, nor do they substitute for clinician judgment or supplant patient preference or shared decision-making. The Society of Vascular Surgery recognizes that departure from guidelines may be warranted when, in the reasonable judgment of the treating clinician, such course of action is indicated by the clinical presentation of the patient, limitations of available resources, advances in knowledge or technology, or patient preference. The reader must rely solely on their own judgment to determine what practices and procedures, whether included in this practice guideline or not, are appropriate for them, their patient, their institution, or their practice.

### A geriatrician's approach to managing the complex older adult with obesity [^cdafe8c6]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombosis, stasis, and lymphedema

Obesity increases the risk of thrombosis and CVD due to vascular compression, venous stasis, underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the inflammatory and hypercoagulable state, and insulin resistance. Clinical presentations such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, chronic venous stasis, varicose veins, superficial thrombophlebitis, lipodermatosclerosis, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, iliofemoral venous obstruction, pelvic venous disorder, post‐thrombotic syndrome, and lymphedema and lipedema are often seen in older adults with obesity. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension manifests in older adults with exertional shortness of breath, fatigue, decline in exercise tolerance, and, sometimes, chest pain. This condition may necessitate anticoagulation and endarterectomy.

Lipodermatosclerosis arising due to hyperpigmentation resulting from venous stasis would require compression stockings, leg elevation, and weight loss. Lymphedema requires a multidisciplinary treatment involving lymphedema therapists along with physical therapists, as effective management can improve quality of life, self‐esteem, and mobility.

Obesity‐related cancer

There is sufficient evidence that obesity has been linked to the following 13 cancers: cancer of the esophagus (adenocarcinoma); gastric cardia; colon and rectum; liver; gallbladder; pancreas; meningioma; postmenopausal breast; endometrium; ovary; kidney; thyroid; and multiple myeloma. The plausible explanation is obesity‐related inflammation, insulin resistance, adipokines, and altered gut microbiome. This further highlights importance of recommending healthy body weight and screening for cancers such as colon and breast, which are often under‐screened in adults with obesity, while also highlighting the need for higher vigilance for other obesity‐related cancers. Adiposity, physical activity, diet, and alcohol intake can further influence cancer recurrence and overall survival, highlighting the importance of addressing obesity and alcohol use among cancer survivors. This is particularly important among postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, as excess adiposity affects cancer recurrence and increases cardiovascular mortality.

### What's new: management of venous leg ulcers: approach to venous leg ulcers [^ccda5bc8]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Leg ulcerations are a common problem, with an estimated prevalence of 1% to 2% in the adult population. Venous leg ulcers are primarily treated in outpatient settings and often are managed by dermatologists. Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of leg ulcers combined with available evidence-based data will provide an update on this topic. A systematized approach and the judicious use of expensive advanced therapeutics are critical. Specialized arterial and venous studies are most commonly noninvasive. The ankle brachial pressure index can be performed with a handheld Doppler unit at the bedside by most clinicians. The vascular laboratory results and duplex Doppler findings are used to identify segmental defects and potential operative candidates. Studies of the venous system can also predict a subset of patients who may benefit from surgery. Successful leg ulcer management requires an interdisciplinary team to make the correct diagnosis, assess the vascular supply, and identify other modifiable factors to optimize healing. The aim of this continuing medical education article is to provide an update on the management of venous leg ulcers. Part I is focused on the approach to venous ulcer diagnostic testing.

Calcium dobesilate — clinical benefit and safety in chronic venous disease: In adults with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) including CEAP C2, a systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported calcium dobesilate suggested as more effective than placebo in improving symptoms, with higher efficacy in more severe disease. In adults with chronic venous disease (CVD), a systematic review and meta-analysis of 45 RCTs with a separated analysis of 17 observational studies reported calcium dobesilate the most effective treatment in reducing leg volume. Safety data from a review state the risk of an adverse event with calcium dobesilate is low, with 13 known cases of agranulocytosis, less than incidence in the general population.

Adjunct thrombus-removal management: We recommend that early thrombus removal strategies as an adjunct to conventional management. We recommend that patients managed with early thrombus removal be treated with a standard course of conventional anticoagulation after the procedure. We recommend that all patients be treated with knee-high compression stockings (30 to 40 mm Hg) for at least 2 years after the procedure.

### Venous ablation therapy: indications and outcomes [^e50e5904]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Venous disease has long been recognized as a progressive, debilitating, and recurrent problem. Until recently, venous insufficiency was often undertreated due to a lack of therapeutic modalities. During the past decade, an explosion in the treatment options has occurred. Endovenous ablation therapy has nearly replaced the conventional surgical treatments for patients with superficial venous insufficiency. Dramatic changes in therapy are also available for deep venous thrombosis but are not the subject of this review. These newer techniques are much less invasive and consequently have reduced risks of wound complications or bleeding. In addition, they can be performed easily in the office setting with local anesthesia. Higher-risk patients can now be considered for these less invasive treatments to reduce their ambulatory venous hypertension. With the lower procedural risks and the dramatically shortened recovery times, earlier intervention can be entertained. This helps prevent the development of venous stasis ulceration and other sequelae of progressive venous insufficiency.

Compression therapy vs intervention — panel input indicated insufficient high Quality of Evidence to determine whether compression stockings are effective as the primary treatment for symptomatic varicose veins or if one stocking is better, although some studies reported symptom improvement. Reported side effects included discomfort, appearance, and application difficulty with compliance limited by itching and irritation, and the overall certainty of the evidence of effects was low with significant heterogeneity of data.

### Postprocedural management of patients undergoing endovascular therapy for acute and chronic lower-extremity deep venous disease [^0ea9e5d8]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Endovascular therapy for acute and chronic lower-extremity deep venous disease seeks to improve patency and flow to ameliorate severe symptoms, prevent the postthrombotic syndrome, and treat existing chronic venous disease. Close postprocedure monitoring in the weeks to months following the intervention with implementation of an anticoagulation and symptom management strategy maximizes the likelihood of a durable result. This article outlines several such strategies based on the presenting pathology, results of the intervention, and biological characteristics of the patient.
