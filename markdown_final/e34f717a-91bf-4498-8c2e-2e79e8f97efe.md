## Question

Can a KUB detect a small bowel obstruction?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a KUB can detect a small bowel obstruction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a KUB actually shows and which radiographic signs suggest SBO. Then, I should review the diagnostic accuracy of plain films and their limitations. Next, I will check current guideline recommendations versus historical practice. After that, I need to compare KUB to CT in terms of actionable information and outcomes. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like water-soluble contrast follow-through and resource-limited settings before synthesizing a clear recommendation [^116xqD16] [^114wNzTP] [^114oJRNW] [^11769Xvp].

> Let me first clarify definitions so I don't conflate modalities. A KUB in this context is simply a plain abdominal radiograph used to assess bowel gas patterns, not a dedicated urinary tract study, and in suspected SBO it may show dilated small-bowel loops, step-ladder air–fluid levels, paucity of colonic gas, and occasionally the "string of pearls" sign on upright or decubitus views, all of which are suggestive but not pathognomonic for obstruction [^116WAVtH] [^111rryqn].

> Now, I should confirm diagnostic performance because that determines how much I can rely on a KUB. The sensitivity and specificity of plain abdominal radiography for SBO hover around 60–70%, which means a substantial miss rate and frequent false positives; moreover, plain films do not characterize the cause, level, severity, or ischemic risk, which are pivotal for management decisions [^116WAVtH]. Hold on, let me verify current consensus on this limitation: contemporary pathways increasingly view plain films as low-yield for initial SBO work-up, precisely because they lack etiologic and severity detail needed to triage patients safely and efficiently [^11769Xvp] [^114wNzTP].

> Wait, guidelines have evolved, so I should double-check the trajectory. Historically, some guidance endorsed plain films early in evaluation, and older WSES statements even described obtaining supine and erect abdominal X-rays as the first step after basic labs in adhesive SBO, which might suggest a role for KUB in all patients at presentation; but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions because more recent, higher-credibility guidance from WSES (2018) specifically recommends avoiding abdominal X-rays given their limited value and emphasizing CT instead, marking a clear shift away from routine KUB in suspected SBO [^116ws9Fc] [^111PWk9T] [^114wNzTP].

> Next, I should review first-line imaging recommendations to ensure I don't misstate the standard of care. EAST recommends CT abdomen/pelvis for all patients with suspected SBO because it provides incremental information over X-rays, including grade, severity, etiology, and complications; similarly, the ACR Appropriateness Criteria prioritize CT as the key diagnostic test, recognizing that exam and labs alone are insufficient, and that plain films add little value to decisions that alter outcomes [^114oJRNW] [^11769Xvp]. I need to ensure consistency with WSES 2018, which also recommends CT early, often with water-soluble contrast when appropriate, to define level, cause, and signs of ischemia guiding urgent surgical intervention [^113Ewzaq].

> I will now examine the comparative diagnostic and prognostic utility of CT, since that bears on whether KUB is adequate. Helical CT has strong test characteristics for diagnosing SBO and approximately 90% accuracy for predicting strangulation and the need for urgent surgery, while also identifying transition point, cause, and complications; this is exactly the information KUB cannot reliably provide and is the rationale for CT-first strategies [^112mRChz] [^114oJRNW]. But wait, what if there are data suggesting CT is less helpful in predicting emergent laparotomy? A prospective study integrating CT and Gastrografin reported CT was "disappointing" for predicting emergent laparotomy, yet this conflicts with the broader guideline-based evidence base and multi-decade experience demonstrating CT's decisive role; given this, I should weigh the totality of evidence and align with guideline consensus favoring CT for triage, etiologic diagnosis, and detection of ischemia [^111Vsy3B] [^11769Xvp] [^114wNzTP] [^114oJRNW].

> Let me consider special circumstances where KUB might still play a role, so I don't overstate the dismissal of plain films. In adhesive SBO managed nonoperatively, a water-soluble contrast challenge can be both prognostic and possibly therapeutic; here, serial abdominal radiographs are used to document contrast progression to the colon within about 4–24 hours, which predicts resolution with high sensitivity and specificity, whereas failure of contrast to reach the colon by 24 hours strongly predicts failure of nonoperative management and the need to escalate care [^111GPdXD] [^116U7Dsr]. I should confirm that even these protocols typically rely on CT early for diagnosis and risk stratification, with plain films reserved for follow-up of contrast transit rather than primary diagnosis, which maintains the principle that KUB is adjunctive, not definitive, in SBO evaluation [^112mRChz] [^11769Xvp].

> Hold on, I should verify if there are patient- or system-level exceptions. In resource-limited settings lacking immediate CT, or in selected populations where CT is temporarily contraindicated, KUB may serve as an initial screen, but its limited accuracy necessitates caution and close clinical reassessment; alternatives such as ultrasound or MRI may be considered when available, though each carries logistical and diagnostic constraints in SBO, reinforcing that CT remains the preferred modality whenever feasible [^115y4Bkk] [^11769Xvp]. In elderly patients, I need to ensure contrast use is balanced against renal function and overall frailty, but this affects how we deliver CT rather than resurrecting KUB as a reliable stand-alone diagnostic test for SBO [^114MSqEp].

> Synthesizing this, I should be precise: Yes, a KUB can detect signs suggestive of small bowel obstruction, such as dilated loops and air–fluid levels, and occasionally the string of pearls, but its sensitivity and specificity are only about 60–70% and it does not define cause, severity, or ischemic risk, so it is not a reliable primary test for diagnosing and managing suspected SBO; current high-credibility guidelines recommend CT with IV contrast as the preferred first-line imaging modality, with KUB reserved mainly for adjunctive roles such as tracking water-soluble contrast progression during nonoperative management or in settings where CT is unavailable [^116WAVtH] [^114wNzTP] [^114oJRNW] [^11769Xvp] [^111GPdXD].

No, KUB cannot reliably diagnose small bowel obstruction (SBO) because it has **limited sensitivity and specificity** [^116WAVtH] and cannot identify the cause or complications [^114wNzTP]. KUB may show nonspecific findings such as dilated loops or air-fluid levels [^111rryqn], but these are often inconclusive or missed, especially in early or partial obstruction. CT is the **preferred imaging** for suspected SBO [^114oJRNW] because it accurately detects obstruction, localizes the transition point [^116xqD16], identifies the cause, and detects complications like ischemia or perforation [^111kdrKV]. KUB is not recommended as a first-line test for SBO and should only be used when CT is unavailable or contraindicated [^11769Xvp].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of KUB for SBO

KUB has **limited diagnostic accuracy** for SBO, with sensitivity and specificity around 60–70% [^116WAVtH]. Nor can it reliably identify the cause, severity [^114wNzTP], or complications such as ischemia or perforation [^116xqD16]. It may show dilated loops, air-fluid levels [^111rryqn], or absence of colonic gas, but these findings are nonspecific and can be missed, particularly in early or partial obstruction.

---

## Limitations of KUB in diagnosing SBO

KUB has several **significant limitations** in diagnosing SBO:

- **Limited sensitivity and specificity**: Approximately 60–70% [^116WAVtH], leading to false negatives and positives.
- **Inability to identify cause**: Cannot determine the underlying cause or severity [^114wNzTP] of obstruction.
- **Inability to detect complications**: Cannot reliably identify ischemia, perforation [^111kdrKV], or other complications [^114wNzTP].
- **Radiation exposure**: Repeated KUBs increase radiation exposure, particularly concerning in children [^113ztGtS].

---

## Comparison with other imaging modalities

CT is the **preferred imaging modality** for suspected SBO [^114oJRNW], with sensitivity and specificity of 90–95% [^11769Xvp]. It accurately identifies the presence, location, and cause of obstruction [^111kdrKV] and detects complications such as ischemia [^113Ewzaq] or perforation. Ultrasound and MRI are alternatives [^115y4Bkk] when CT is contraindicated, but they have logistical limitations and lower accuracy.

| **Attribute** | **KUB** | **CT** | **Ultrasound** | **MRI** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | 60–70% | 90–95% | Variable | High |
| Specificity | 60–70% | 90–95% | Variable | High |
| Advantages | - Quick <br/> - Widely available | - High accuracy <br/> - Identifies cause and complications | - No radiation <br/> - Bedside | - No radiation <br/> - High soft-tissue contrast |
| Limitations | - Limited accuracy <br/> - Cannot identify cause or complications [^116WAVtH] | - Radiation exposure <br/> - Contrast risks [^114oJRNW] | - Operator-dependent <br/> - Limited by bowel gas [^115y4Bkk] | - Limited availability <br/> - Longer scan time [^115y4Bkk] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines recommend CT as the **preferred imaging modality** for suspected SBO [^114oJRNW] due to its high accuracy and ability to identify complications [^11769Xvp]. KUB is not recommended as a first-line diagnostic tool for SBO [^114wNzTP], and its use should be limited to situations in which CT is unavailable or contraindicated.

---

## Clinical scenarios where KUB may still be useful

Despite its limitations, KUB may still be useful in certain clinical scenarios:

- **Initial screening**: Rapid initial screening in resource-limited settings where CT is unavailable [^116WAVtH].
- **Follow-up imaging**: Monitoring progression or resolution of obstruction in stable patients [^116qE3dr].
- **Contraindications to CT**: Patients with severe contrast allergies or pregnancy [^115y4Bkk].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

KUB has **limited diagnostic accuracy** [^116WAVtH] for SBO and cannot reliably identify the cause or complications. CT is the **preferred imaging modality** [^11769Xvp] for suspected SBO because it is highly accurate and identifies complications. KUB should only be used when CT is unavailable or contraindicated [^114wNzTP].

Abdominal plain radiography is often used as the first-line imaging technique for patients with suspected small bowel obstruction (SBO). However, its diagnostic value in patients with an SBO in a virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) has not been specifically studied. Although plain radiography remains a complementary tool to initial clinical assessment, it has limited value. The sensitivity and specificity of plain X-rays for SBO are approximately 60–70%. Importantly, plain radiographs do not provide additional information on the etiology of the obstruction or the need for emergency surgery.

- **Water-soluble contrast**: Water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA) imaging plays a significant role in managing adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) when a CT scan is not required. WSCA has demonstrated both prognostic and potential therapeutic value for small bowel obstruction management. Several studies have shown promising results in the management of ASBO. The appearance of contrast in the colon within 4–24 hours after administration had a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 98% in predicting the resolution of SBO with conservative therapy. If the contrast does not reach the colon on an abdominal X-ray taken 24 hours after administration, it is a strong indicator of the failure of non-operative management.

Only two studies have reported the use of WSCA imaging in SBO-VA. Collom et al. found that WSCA was used less frequently in patients with SBO-VA (35.6%) compared to those with SBO after previous surgery (52.2%). A possible explanation for this lower usage is that an adhesive etiology in SBO-VA cannot be assumed, necessitating a CT scan to further evaluate the condition.

### Small bowel obstruction: The role of computed tomography in its diagnosis and management with reference to other imaging modalities [^116xqD16]. European Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a leading cause of acute surgical admissions for abdominal pain. There is an increasing tendency for initial conservative management rather than immediate operative intervention, as a proportion of cases will resolve spontaneously. This trend has resulted in a growing reliance on radiological investigations to reassure the surgeon that medical therapy can be safely instituted. The responsibility, therefore, rests with radiologists to guide their surgical colleagues by correctly interpreting the plain abdominal radiograph and suggesting appropriate further investigation if warranted.

Recently, computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as the test of choice to define the level and cause of acute small bowel obstruction and to identify complications such as ischaemia and perforation, which will prompt surgical intervention. This review discusses the utility of early CT in the diagnosis of acute small bowel obstruction and outlines its impact on patient management.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^112mRChz]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Helical CT scans not only have good test characteristics for diagnosing small bowel obstruction but also have approximately 90% accuracy in predicting strangulation and the need for urgent surgery. The diagnostic value of CT scans can be enhanced with the use of water-soluble contrast. As with water-soluble contrast studies, the progression of the contrast can be evaluated by X-ray 24 hours after the CT scan.

Although adhesions are not directly visible on CT scans, a CT scan can accurately differentiate between different causes of bowel obstruction by excluding other causes. The working group therefore considers CT scans to be the preferred imaging technique if there is any doubt about the diagnosis of ASBO, and to assess the need for urgent surgery.

A CT scan should help differentiate between a complete obstruction of the bowel and facilitate the decision for a trial of non-operative management versus a decision to proceed to surgery. It may also help define the location of the obstruction (e.g. high in the jejunum or deep in the pelvis). Signs of a closed loop, bowel ischemia, and free fluid suggest the need for surgery without delay. Additionally, radiological and clinical scores can be used to predict the need for surgery as described above.

- **Ultrasound and MRI**: Although the working group considered CT scans to be the preferred technique for diagnosing ASBO, ultrasound and MRI might be useful in specific situations. Ultrasound is operator-dependent, but in experienced hands, it can provide more information than plain X-rays and is also available in emergency settings.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^112o6KZE]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

CT scan is highly diagnostic in SBO and has great value in all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high-grade SBO. However, CT scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process, except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis. CT can confirm the presence of complete obstruction and allow the diagnosis of the cause of SBO. It can also exclude a non-adhesional pathology and assess the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90%, and an NPV of nearly 100%.

IV contrast is necessary; oral is not. Water-soluble contrast follow-through is valuable in patients undergoing initial non-operative conservative management in order to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery. This investigation is safer than barium in cases of perforation and peritoneal spread and has possible therapeutic value in the case of adhesive small intestine obstruction. MRI use should be restricted to those patients having CT or iodine contrast contraindications.

- **Conservative treatment and timing for surgery**: The management of small bowel obstruction caused by adhesions is controversial because surgery can induce new adhesions, whereas conservative treatment does not remove the cause of the obstruction. Conservative treatment involves nasogastric intubation, intravenous fluid administration, and clinical observation. Strangulation of the bowel requires immediate surgery, but intestinal ischemia can be difficult to determine clinically.

Patients with ASBO treated nonsurgically have a shorter hospital stay; however, they have a higher recurrence rate and a shorter time to readmission, although the risk of new surgically treated episodes of ASBO is the same. (Level of Evidence 2b).

All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b, GoR C).

CT scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain film are not conclusive for a small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b, GoR B).

The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead to a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a, GoR B).

MRI and US are of limited value for ASBO and should be limited to patients with contraindications for CT scan/iodine contrast (Level of Evidence 2c, GoR C).

In patients undergoing initial non-operative conservative management, a water-soluble contrast follow-through should be performed to rule out complete ASBO and predict the need for surgery (Level of Evidence 1b, GoR A).

Adhesional postoperative small bowel obstruction is characterized by the presence of abdominal pain, vomiting, distention, and obstipation in conjunction with confirmatory imaging.

SBO can be classified according to completeness: partial vs. complete (or high grade vs. low grade), according to etiology: adhesional vs. non-adhesional, and according to timing: early vs. late (more than 30 days after surgery).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® suspected small-bowel obstruction [^11769Xvp]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Small-bowel obstruction is a common cause of abdominal pain and accounts for a significant proportion of hospital admissions. Radiologic imaging plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of small-bowel obstruction, as neither patient presentation, clinical examination, nor laboratory testing are sufficiently sensitive or specific enough to diagnose or guide management. This document focuses on the imaging evaluation of the two most commonly encountered clinical scenarios related to small-bowel obstruction: the acute presentation and the more indolent, low-grade, or intermittent presentation. It aims to clarify the appropriate utilization of the many imaging procedures available and commonly employed in these clinical settings.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions, reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies, such as the RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and the GRADE system, to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### The relevance of free fluid between intestinal loops detected by sonography in the clinical assessment of small bowel obstruction in adults [^114AWy2G]. European Journal of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The main role of the radiologist in managing patients with suspected small bowel obstruction is to help triage patients into those needing immediate surgical intervention and those requiring medical therapy or delayed surgery. Ultrasound examination is usually considered unhelpful in bowel obstruction due to air in the intestinal lumen that interferes with evaluating the intestinal loops. However, some authors have recently highlighted the increasingly important role of sonography in acute abdominal disease. The aim of our report is to demonstrate the value of free fluid detected by ultrasound in differentiating between low and high-grade small bowel obstruction.

- **Materials and methods**: The study is based on 742 consecutive patients presenting with acute abdomen symptoms. All patients underwent initial serial abdominal plain film and ultrasound examinations prior to any medical intervention. We reviewed the imaging findings of 150 cases in which small bowel obstruction was clinically suspected and confirmed at surgery. We considered the following radiographic and ultrasound findings: dilatation of small bowel loops, bowel wall thickness, presence of air-fluid levels, thickness of valvulae conniventes, evidence of peristalsis, and the presence and echogenicity of extraluminal fluid. We examined the value of extraluminal peritoneal fluid at ultrasound examination in differentiating low and high-grade small bowel obstruction based on surgical outcomes.

- **Results**: In 46 patients, altered peristaltic activity, thin bowel walls, and fluid-filled loops with hyperechoic spots in the bowel were observed.

### Localized postinflammatory hyperpigmentation with abdominal wall protrusion [^1144uz67]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 2: What is the most sensitive diagnostic test to help confirm the diagnosis?**

A. CT abdomen and pelvis – Incorrect. A CT scan may be done to exclude a true abdominal hernia or other intra-abdominal pathology; however, it is not necessary and is not the most sensitive test. Our patient's imaging showed a small incidental umbilical hernia with no evidence of lateral wall defect.

B. Electromyography (EMG) – Correct. Postherpetic pseudohernia is a motor complication of herpes zoster resulting from ventral nerve root denervation, leading to paralysis of the ipsilateral abdominal wall musculature. EMG is a highly sensitive diagnostic modality that can detect this acute denervation, supporting the clinical diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies can also be combined with EMG to rule out other neuropathies. In cases of pseudohernia, nerve conduction studies are often normal. In this case, electrodiagnostic studies were deemed unnecessary given the close temporal correlation between rash onset and abdominal protrusion.

C. Skin biopsy – Incorrect. A biopsy would reveal patchy epidermal or dermal melanosis consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and would not provide additional diagnostic information. Of note, a skin biopsy may be used to aid the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathy; however, postherpetic pseudohernia is due to motor neuropathy.

D. Herpes serology – Incorrect. Serologic testing is not reliable for diagnosing acute herpes zoster. Varicella zoster virus cannot be confirmed through serology in these cases.

### Can radiographers be trained to triage CT colonography for extracolonic findings [^116rMfXj]. European Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The learning curve data provide insights into radiographers' ability to triage CT colonography for extracolonic findings. The case sensitivity learning curves for E3 and E4 for individual radiographers, as well as for all eight radiographers combined, are represented graphically. Specifically, these curves illustrate average sensitivity for E3 cases and individual radiographers, as well as for E4 cases. The learning curves for specificity and reading times are also detailed, indicating performance variations over time for individual radiographers.

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot reveals a direct relationship between increased sensitivity (true positives) and a rise in false positives. This is highlighted in the ROC space, where each point corresponds to a specific time point in the learning process, showcasing the trajectory of average sensitivity for E3 and E4 combined against the false positive rate for cases without E3 and E4 lesions.

Significantly, a positive learning effect was observed in triaging E3 cases for three radiographers. For cases combining E3 and E4, two radiographers demonstrated significant learning. However, no radiographers achieved a significant learning effect for identifying E4 cases only or in terms of specificity. This data indicates variable learning outcomes and proficiency among radiographers in triaging different case types.

### Applying deep-learning algorithm interpreting kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) X-rays to detect colon cancer [^115vWKEs]. Journal of Imaging Informatics in Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Early screening is crucial in reducing the mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening methods, including fecal occult blood tests (FOBT) and colonoscopy, are primarily limited by low patient compliance and the invasive nature of the procedures. Several advanced imaging techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and histological imaging have been integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the detection of CRC. However, there are still limitations due to the challenges associated with image acquisition and cost.

The kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB) radiograph, which is inexpensive and widely used for abdominal assessments in emergency settings, shows potential for detecting CRC when enhanced using advanced techniques. This study aimed to develop a deep learning model (DLM) to detect CRC using KUB radiographs.

This retrospective study was conducted using data from the Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH) between January 2011 and December 2020, including patients with at least one KUB radiograph. Patients were divided into development (n = 28,055), tuning (n = 11,234), and internal validation (n = 16,875) sets. An additional 15,876 patients were collected from a community hospital as the external validation set.

A 121-layer DenseNet convolutional network was trained to classify KUB images for CRC detection. The model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves, with sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) as metrics.

### Can artificial intelligence pass the fellowship of the Royal College of Radiologists examination? Multi-reader diagnostic accuracy study [^115zrtzG]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first time an "artificial intelligence candidate" has been invited to take part in a (mock) FRCR examination. Assuming that the college would provide special dispensation to account for the artificial intelligence candidate's lack of experience in interpreting skull, spine, and abdominal radiographs, a pass mark (> 90% correct) would have been achieved in two of the 10 mock examinations. However, if dispensation was not granted, the artificial intelligence candidate would not pass any of the mock examinations.

In this scenario, the artificial intelligence candidate would be best served by adopting a strategy of assigning non-interpretable images as "normal", which would have allowed it to pass one of the 10 mock examinations. The artificial intelligence candidate can take solace in the fact that this was a particularly challenging set of rapid reporting examinations, with the average human radiologist counterpart passing only four of the 10 mock examinations. If these examination marks were moderated to account for the level of difficulty, as they would be in the real FRCR examination, the pass rates may have been higher.

Although the artificial intelligence candidate did not outperform most of the radiologists, its accuracy was relatively high considering the case mix and complexity. For the radiographs in which image analysis was possible, the artificial intelligence candidate had a sensitivity of 83.6%, a specificity of 75.2%, and an overall accuracy of 79.5% compared with the summary estimate of radiologists.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO Working Group [^114iKks5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

However, no randomized controlled trial comparing open to laparoscopic adhesiolysis exists at the time of writing, and both the precise indications and specific outcomes of laparoscopic adhesiolysis for adhesive small bowel obstruction (SBO) remain poorly understood. The only RCT on laparoscopic adhesiolysis assessed the incidence of chronic abdominal pain after randomization to laparoscopic adhesiolysis or no treatment during diagnostic laparoscopy, and it failed to demonstrate any significant differences in terms of pain or discomfort.

Data from a retrospective clinical controlled trial suggest that laparoscopy seems feasible and better in terms of hospital stay and mortality reduction.

In a retrospective analysis, Grafen et al. compared the outcomes of laparoscopic management of ASBO to both exploratory laparotomy and secondary conversion to open surgery. Ninety-three patients were divided into successful laparoscopy (71%), secondary conversion (26%), and primary laparotomy (3%). The first group had more simple adhesions, fewer prior operations, lower ASA scores, and the shortest operative time, as well as the duration of both intensive care unit and hospital stay; moreover, they were younger and had a shorter duration of SBO prior to their operation. Despite that, mortality was 6%, regardless of operative technique. Moreover, the authors found that patients who only had prior appendectomy or cholecystectomy could all be managed laparoscopically without need for secondary conversion. On the other hand, a prolonged ileus (mean 4.3 days) with progressive abdominal distension and a higher number of or more demanding previous operations were associated with other outcomes.

### Ultrasound of the abdominal wall: What lies beneath [^116r1mDX]. Clinical Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Clinically equivocal abdominal wall lesions often pose diagnostic dilemmas for clinicians. It can be equally challenging to appreciate the nature of abdominal wall lesions found incidentally on abdominal ultrasound examinations. Ultrasound is a non-ionizing, cost-effective, and easily accessible investigation for such lesions. It is widely used and has the added advantage of being a dynamic investigation. However, imaging with ultrasound is operator-dependent and relies on technical skills. It is important to understand the imaging of normal anatomy and to be familiar with the imaging appearance of lesions. We present a review of various lesions seen during ultrasound examinations of the abdominal wall or as incidental findings on abdominal ultrasound.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for intra-abdominal abscess, specifically in the context of diagnostic imaging, ACR 2018 guidelines recommend obtaining contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis. This is advised to evaluate for atypical and opportunistic abdominal infections, visceral pathologies, and tumors in patients with abdominal pain and neutropenia.

### Multidetector-row computed tomography diagnosis of small bowel obstruction: Can coronal reformations replace axial images [^1152UiFd]. Emergency Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

The feasibility of diagnosing small bowel obstruction on multidetector-row computed tomography (MDCT) using coronal reformations alone is evaluated. Three radiologists with subspecialty training in abdominal imaging reviewed abdominopelvic CT scans of 67 patients in consensus. Thirty-four patients had surgically proven small bowel obstruction. The remaining 33 patients underwent CT for other reasons and had no intestinal obstruction. The images were displayed in either axial or coronal planes and were reviewed on separate days. Each CT was evaluated for the presence of small bowel obstruction and its etiology when applicable.

- **Diagnostic findings**: Thirty-three (100%) of 33 patients were correctly diagnosed not to have intestinal obstruction on coronal images. Thirty-four (100%) of 34 patients were correctly diagnosed with small bowel obstruction on both forms of image display.

- **Discrepancies**: There were five patients where the final surgical diagnosis for the etiology of small bowel obstruction did not agree with the interpretation of either the coronal or axial images; however, in all five patients, the interpretations of axial and coronal images were similar. In only one patient did the etiology of small bowel obstruction based on the coronal images not agree with that of axial images and the surgical result; however, the site of small bowel obstruction was correctly diagnosed.

- **Advantages of coronal reformations**: There were approximately 20% fewer images in the coronal reformation data set, and the radiologists found review of these images easier for localizing the zone of transition in small bowel obstruction.

Very high diagnostic accuracy can be achieved using coronally reformed images.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2013 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^116ws9Fc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

After an accurate physical examination and the evaluation of WBC, lactate, electrolytes, and BUN/Creatinine, the first step of diagnostic work-up for ASBO is a supine and erect plain abdominal X-ray, which can show multiple air-fluid levels, distension of small bowel loops, and the absence of gas in the colonic section. All patients being evaluated for small bowel obstruction should have plain films (Level of Evidence 2b GoR C).

- **Secondary evaluation**: A CT scan is highly diagnostic in small bowel obstruction (SBO) and is valuable for all patients with inconclusive plain films for complete or high-grade SBO. However, CT scans should not be routinely performed in the decision-making process except when clinical history, physical examination, and plain films are not conclusive for small bowel obstruction diagnosis (Level of Evidence 2b GoR B). A CT scan often confirms the presence of complete obstruction, identifies the cause of SBO, excludes non-adhesional pathology, and assesses the occurrence of strangulation with a sensitivity and specificity higher than 90% and an NPV of nearly 100%. The association of CT scan signs of bowel ischemia should lead to a low threshold for surgical intervention (Level of Evidence 2a GoR B).

- **Ultrasound**: This has limited value in bowel obstruction or in patients with a distended bowel because air may obscure the underlying findings. Usual ultrasound findings include distention, peristalsis (for differential diagnosis of ileus vs. mechanical SBO), differences in mucosal folds around the transition point, and free fluid (sign of ischemia).

MRI use should be restricted in the evaluation of small bowel obstructions.

### The utility of computed tomography in acute small bowel obstruction [^115D4d9a]. Clinical Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a significant cause of acute surgical admissions. Surgeons tend to favor an initial trial of conservative management. Due to the unreliability of clinical signs in accurately predicting which patients require early intervention, there is an increasing tendency to utilize imaging investigations, particularly computed tomography (CT), to help define the severity, cause, and complications of acute small bowel obstruction. The aim of this pictorial review is to demonstrate the contribution CT can make to the management of these patients.

### Ray sum image: its efficacy in renal tract calculus detection [^117QQeFb]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

To determine the efficacy of a ray sum image derived from computed tomography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (CT KUB) in detecting renal tract calculi and whether this can replace the baseline abdominal radiograph (AXR), a retrospective study was conducted. This study took place at a tertiary referral center and examined adult patients referred for urolithiasis who had undergone AXR within 24 hours of the diagnostic CT KUB. Both AXR and ray sum images for calculus visibility were reviewed blindly by two readers. Various factors were analyzed to determine their effect on the AXR and ray sum sensitivity, including anteroposterior thickness of the patient, presence of excess gas/faecal material, calculus size, location, and mean attenuation.

A total of 152 calculi were examined, showing ray sum image sensitivity at 44% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 36–52) and AXR sensitivity at 30% (95% CI: 22–38). Calculus size and mean attenuation significantly affected the sensitivities of both ray sum and AXR. There was substantial agreement between the two techniques with κ (Kappa) = 0.70 (95% CI: 0.58–0.81, p < 0.001).

In conclusion, the ray sum image, as a post-processed image derived from the CT KUB dataset, may be a viable alternative to the baseline AXR in patients with CT-proven urolithiasis. This alternative could reduce patient radiation dose and streamline workflow in busy radiology and emergency departments.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^116Wh8ao]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

In summary, a systematic review and meta-analysis of imaging, clinical, and laboratory variables of patients with small bowel obstruction identified six potential predictors strongly associated with the need for surgery. Five of these predictors were positively associated, and one was negatively associated; three were derived from CT scans. Additionally, three predictors were strongly associated with ischemia at surgery, all positively and with two derived from CT scans.

The development of future multivariable models to guide the management of small bowel obstruction should concentrate on variables that display strong evidence of potential utility. Factors that have not been investigated sufficiently in the primary literature but enjoy considerable clinical support should also be considered.

### Small bowel obstruction: Computed tomography features and pitfalls [^111kdrKV]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2006). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) has become established as an ideal form of imaging in small bowel obstruction (SBO), especially with modern-day multiplanar imaging that is now widely available. CT can confirm the presence of SBO; show the site, level, and cause of obstruction accurately; and detect strangulation. It is important to recognize the common and unusual causes, but also conditions that mimic SBO. This review illustrates a spectrum of causes and discusses conditions that mimic SBO, their differentiation, and the limitations of CT in the assessment of suspected SBO.

Based on the etiologic findings in the presented studies, fear of the previously assumed high rate of malignancies is not justified. As a consequence, the need to perform surgical exploration in every patient with SBO-VA can also be waived. Nevertheless, non-invasive diagnostics with high accuracy for detection of malignancy or follow-up is mandatory as approximately one in ten cases of SBO-VA is still caused by malignancy.

- **Role of training, experience, and previous exposure**: The accuracy of individual participants, determined by averaging the values of the misestimation in all their observations, was not related to the specialty (misestimation by 106 mL (79–133) in surgeons, 92 mL (67–111) in gastroenterologists, 86 mL (64–126) in internists, and 87 mL (55–102) by radiologists; p = 0.322), training status (misestimation by 96 mL (85–104) in staff versus 78 mL (70–106) in residents; p = 0.297) (Figure 5), or years of experience (R = 0.073; p = 0.618). The accuracy of the observations was independent of the order of presentation of the images (R = −0.111; p < 0.001; Figure S1). No differences in accuracy were observed between the two randomization sequences presented (misestimation by 75 mL (62–87) and 62 mL (52–73), respectively; p = 0.107).

		**Figure 5**: Individual accuracy in gas content estimations. For each observer (n = 48; x‐axis) the figure shows absolute misestimation value (mean value of the 60 images; y‐axis).

- **Differences between paired observations (basal versus distension)**: Gas volume measured by CT in the images obtained in the same patients during episodes of abdominal distension differed by 39 mL (29–66) from those during basal conditions, and this difference was misestimated by 107 mL (94–119) in the plain AP projections. In 38% of the cases with an increase detected by CT during distension episodes, the estimated volume was smaller; in 40% of the cases with a decrease detected by CT, the estimated volume was greater (Figure 6).

### Primary angiosarcoma of the bladder in a young female [^113W4Q5z]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Our case report pertains to a 32-year-old woman initially presenting with left flank pain and gross haematuria throughout her urinary stream. CT of her kidney/ureter/bladder (CT KUB) revealed ureteric dilatation to the level of the bladder without evidence of renal calculus, and subsequently, a stent was inserted. She represented a month later with contralateral flank pain, and a transurethral resection of bladder tumour was performed. Histopathological diagnosis was epithelioid angiosarcoma. Further imaging (MRI pelvis) revealed that the tumour arose from the posterior bladder wall with local invasion and regional lymph node metastasis. Ifosfamide and epirubicin chemotherapy with single-fraction radiotherapy induced significant reduction in tumour bulk, although this initial response was followed by the development of symptoms suggestive of disease progression. She died 19 months after the initial diagnosis with persistent pulmonary and vertebral metastases, although no autopsy was performed.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2017 update of the evidence-based guidelines from the World Society of Emergency Surgery ASBO working group [^112QB3NV]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). High credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a leading cause of surgical emergencies, particularly those requiring emergent operations. In the UK, small bowel obstruction is the indication for 51% of all emergency laparotomies. Scott et al. reported on seven emergency surgical procedures that account for 80% of all general surgery emergency admissions, morbidity, deaths, and healthcare expenditures in the United States. Adhesive small bowel obstruction was the most common diagnosis for both the top 2 (small bowel resection) and top 5 (adhesiolysis) procedures. Post-operative adhesions are the leading cause of small bowel obstructions, accounting for 60% of cases.

ASBO causes considerable harm, resulting in an average of 8 days of hospitalization and an in-hospital mortality rate of 3% per episode. Between 20% and 30% of patients with adhesive small bowel obstruction require operative treatment. The length of hospitalization and morbidity depend on the need for surgical intervention. Average hospitalization after surgical treatment of ASBO is 16 days, compared to 5 days following non-operative treatment. Associated costs in a Dutch study in 2016 were estimated at €16,305 for surgical and €2,227 for non-operative treatment.

Although adhesive small bowel obstruction is a common condition, its prevention and treatment are often characterized by surgeons' personal preferences rather than standardized evidence-based protocols. There is a significant amount of conflicting and low-quality evidence in publications regarding the treatment of adhesive small bowel obstruction.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^114MSqEp]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Elderly patients with small bowel obstruction face specific challenges in diagnosis and treatment, raising questions about their benefit from advancements in management. This patient population includes a diverse group, from vital elderly individuals with enough resilience for surgery to frail elderly patients at high risk of complications without even undergoing surgery.

Elderly patients often present atypical clinical features, leading to delayed diagnosis and disease progression at initial presentation. Additionally, most elderly patients have reduced renal function, increasing the risk of contrast nephropathy from contrast-enhanced CT, especially when fluid intake is diminished as in small bowel obstruction. The limited physiological reserves and frailty in elderly patients contribute to worse outcomes, such as functional decline, more complications, and prolonged hospital stays, regardless of the treatment approach.

- **High age and common co-morbidities**: Conditions such as diabetes mellitus have been identified as independent risk factors for mortality in small bowel obstruction. Little is known about how starvation treatment may interfere with the necessity to continue medication for chronic diseases and pre-existing nutritional deficiencies, which challenge the management of elderly patients with small bowel obstruction.

Regarding goal settings, frail elderly patients often prioritize quality of life over prolonged life, implying the need for a more balanced decision-making approach.

The aim of this study was to determine the predictive value of various signs and symptoms for small bowel obstruction (SBO) in patients with prior abdominal surgery.

- **Methods**: This was a secondary analysis of a previously reported prospective study of ultrasonography for SBO. Patients with prior abdominal surgery were identified, and presenting signs and symptoms were compared to the CT diagnosis of SBO.

- **Results**: No signs or symptoms were predictive of SBO.

- **Conclusion**: No constellation of signs and symptoms can be used to reliably exclude an SBO in patients with prior abdominal surgery.

### Small bowel obstruction in the elderly: A plea for comprehensive acute geriatric care [^11642J1j]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

This narrative review incorporates scoping aspects because a formal systematic review and meta-analysis were not feasible due to a paucity of studies on small bowel obstruction in elderly patients.

- **Search strategy**: PubMed, the Cochrane Database, and EMBASE were searched from inception to January 2018. A senior medical librarian verified the search strategy for completeness. In PubMed, studies were identified using MeSH terms such as 'intestinal obstruction', 'small intestine', 'ileum', 'jejunum', and 'aged', alongside free-text searches with terms like 'small bowel obstruction', 'elderly', 'old', 'eldest', and 'geriatric'. A similar search strategy was employed in EMBASE, followed by the identification and removal of duplicates. The Cochrane Database search for reviews on small bowel obstruction yielded three studies, but none specifically focused on the elderly.

One hundred twenty studies from EMBASE and PubMed were deemed eligible for full-text screening. Thirteen studies underwent qualitative analysis, with two studies specifically targeting elderly patients. The Cochrane Database search did not reveal any relevant papers. The primary reasons for exclusion were studies that did not involve elderly patients or did not address small bowel obstruction. To ensure our review contained essential geriatric themes and considerations affecting the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction, the search was expanded to include more general studies on elderly patients.

### The clothes maketh the SIGN [^111rryqn]. Insights into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

In some instances of small bowel obstruction, little or no air is present, and the distended bowel loops are predominantly fluid-filled. Thus, the supine abdominal radiographs may not demonstrate air distension of the bowel. However, upright or decubitus radiographs may demonstrate air-fluid levels or the "string of pearls sign". The obliquely oriented row of air bubbles represents small amounts of air trapped between the valvulae conniventes along the superior wall of the predominantly fluid-filled, dilated small bowel loops. The meniscal effect of the surrounding fluid gives the trapped air an ovoid or rounded appearance — a "string of pearls" appearance.

- **Figure 11**: Plain film of the abdomen in a 52-year-old woman with abdominal pain and vomiting. Rows of air bubbles represent small amounts of air trapped between the valvulae conniventes of fluid-filled, dilated small bowel loops, producing a "string of pearls" appearance.

### Improving the management of acute adhesive small bowel obstruction with CT-scan and water-soluble contrast medium: a prospective study [^111Vsy3B]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2009). Low credibility.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction is usually managed nonoperatively, but there is still debate over the optimal duration of nonoperative management and the factors that predict failure of medical treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate an algorithm using CT-scans and Gastrografin in the management of small bowel obstruction.

In a prospective study, each patient admitted for small bowel obstruction underwent a physical examination, a plain film, and a CT-scan evaluation. Patients underwent emergency surgical exploration when bowel ischemia was suspected. Other patients received oral Gastrografin, and a second plain abdominal radiograph was done after 12 hours. In patients with clinical improvement, the nasogastric tube was removed and an immediate liquid diet was resumed. Other patients were referred for surgery.

In total, 118 patients with 123 episodes of small bowel obstruction were included. Thirty-six (29%) required immediate surgery because they presented clinical characteristics of bowel ischemia (36/36; 100%) or a defect in vascularization of the small bowel on CT-scan (5/36; 14%). The 87 remaining patients were managed nonoperatively, of which 28 deteriorated and were referred for surgery. The 59 other patients showed clinical improvement.

This study demonstrated the diagnostic role of Gastrografin® in discriminating between partial and complete small bowel obstruction. CT-scans were disappointing in their ability to predict the necessity of emergent laparotomies. We therefore recommend the use of Gastrografin® in guiding management decisions for small bowel obstruction.

### Small bowel obstruction in the emergency department: MDCT features of common and uncommon causes [^113me3nM]. Clinical Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction is a common condition encountered by radiologists in the emergency department. Though intestinal adhesions and obstructed hernias are the most common causes of acute small bowel obstruction, a variety of uncommon and rare conditions can also cause acute and subacute bowel obstruction. Imaging plays a key role in the workup of bowel obstruction by identifying the cause, level, and degree of the obstruction. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of the multi-detector computed tomography features of common and uncommon causes of acute and subacute small bowel obstruction.

### Bologna guidelines for diagnosis and management of adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO): 2010 evidence-based guidelines of the World Society of Emergency Surgery [^1117Dxrt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

In another recently developed model for predicting the risk of strangulated small bowel obstruction (SBO), six variables correlated with small bowel resection: history of pain lasting 4 days or more, guarding, C-reactive protein level of at least 75 mg/l, leucocyte count 10 × 10(9)/l or greater, free intraperitoneal fluid volume of at least 500 mL on computed tomography (CT), and reduction of CT small bowel wall contrast enhancement.

A further multivariate predictive model of surgical operation in SBO showed free intraperitoneal fluid, mesenteric edema, lack of the "small bowel feces sign" at CT, and history of vomiting to be significant predictors of the need for operative exploration.

In a retrospective study of 53 patients with ASBO treated using a long nasointestinal tube (LT), complete SBO (no evidence of air within the large bowel) and increased serum creatine phosphokinase (≥ 130 IU/L) were independent predictive factors for LT decompression failure.

A recent prospective study aimed to evaluate an algorithm using CT scans and Gastrografin in the management of small bowel obstruction. Severe abdominal pain (VAS > 4), abdominal guarding, raised white cell count (WCC), and devascularized bowel at CT predict the need for emergent laparotomy at the time of admission. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the diagnostic role of Gastrografin in discriminating between partial and complete small bowel obstruction, while CT scans were disappointing in their ability to predict the necessity of emergent laparotomies.

Again, two systematic reviews confirmed the value of water-soluble contrast medium in predicting the need for surgical intervention in small bowel obstruction.

An algorithm for the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the patient with ASBO is presented. The initial diagnosis of ASBO is of utmost importance, as failure to diagnose or a delayed diagnosis represents 70% of malpractice claims related to ASBO.

- **Algorithm for diagnosis and treatment of ASBO**: The primary goals in the initial evaluation of patients in whom adhesive small bowel obstruction is suspected include differentiating between adhesive small bowel obstruction and other causes of bowel obstruction, assessing the need for urgent surgical exploration, and identifying and preventing complications from bowel obstruction.

- **History taking and physical examination**: In a patient suspected of ASBO, history-taking includes an assessment of potential causes of bowel obstruction (such as previous operations or radiotherapy) and nutritional status. Signs of dehydration should also be assessed. ASBO is traditionally clinically diagnosed in a patient with symptoms like intermittent colicky abdominal pain, distention, and nausea (with or without vomiting), as well as the absence of stools. Although the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction is fairly certain when all these symptoms are present, certain pitfalls can result in delayed or misdiagnosis. For instance, in patients with incomplete obstruction, watery diarrhea may be present, leading to an episode of ASBO being mistaken for gastroenteritis. Stools might also be present in patients with a relatively high obstruction.

### Does baseline radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder help facilitate stone management in patients presenting to the emergency department with renal colic [^11636BgB]. Journal of Endourology (2013). Low credibility.

A baseline kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) radiograph, at the time of computed tomography (CT) for ureteral stones, might aid interpretation of future KUBs. The CT scout radiograph might render the baseline KUB redundant, however. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of baseline KUB for patients with ureteral stones.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients with ureteral stones were retrospectively identified. All had a baseline KUB in addition to CT and were reassessed after 4 to 60 days with KUB. Each patient's imaging was randomized 1:1 into either "KUB&CT" or "CT" groups. Three urologists independently assessed the imaging: CT (with scout film) and baseline KUB in the KUB&CT group, but only the CT (not KUB) in the CT group. Definitive stone assessment on follow-up KUB was defined as all three reviewers answering either Yes or No (not Indeterminate) to the question of stone passage or migration.

- **Results**: Of 154 stones, the mean diameter was 4.8 ± 2.1 mm, density was 914 ± 300 Hounsfield units (HU), with 54.4% in the distal ureter. Stone visibility was 60.4% on KUB vs. 43.5% on scout film (P < 0.001). Scout film visibility favored the CT group (52.7% vs. 35.0%, P = 0.027). After adjusting for body mass index, skin-to-stone distance, size, density, and location, definitive assessment rates were higher in the KUB&CT group (P = 0.047). When reviewers reassessed the CT group using the baseline KUB, they were able to do so definitively in an additional 16 (21.6%, P < 0.001). Definitive assessments were associated with higher rates of stone visibility on scout film.

### An apricot story: View through a keyhole [^115D3cPK]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Very few cases of small bowel obstruction due to ingested fruits have been described in literature, and most of these have been managed by laparotomy. Laparoscopic-assisted surgery can effectively deal with such impacted foreign bodies, thereby avoiding a formal laparotomy.

- **Case presentation**: A 75-year-old lady was admitted via the Accident and Emergency to the surgical ward with a three-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Investigations were suggestive of acute small bowel obstruction. On laparoscopy, there was an area of sudden change in caliber of the small bowel with a dilated proximal and collapsed distal segment in the distal jejunum. A foreign body, a dried undigested apricot, was extracted by mini-laparotomy.

- **Discussion**: Small bowel obstruction is a frequent cause of emergency surgery, and the aetiology may include food bolus obstruction. Diagnosis is usually confirmed intra-operatively. A foreign body impacted in the small bowel can be removed by open or laparoscopic methods.

- **Conclusion**: Generally, laparotomy is performed for diagnosis and management in acute bowel obstruction, but with increasing expertise, laparoscopy can be equally effective, offering all the other advantages of a minimal access approach.

### Bowel obstruction: A narrative review for all physicians [^111GPdXD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Water-soluble contrast administration X-ray

A water-soluble contrast enema has 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity in diagnosing large bowel obstruction but cannot distinguish different large bowel obstruction causes.

A small bowel follow-through with water-soluble contrast is widely used in patients for adhesive small bowel obstruction non-operative management. Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have established the utility of water-soluble contrast agents in the diagnostic work-up of adhesive small bowel obstruction. If the contrast has not reached the colon on an abdominal X-ray 24 hours after administration, then this is highly indicative of non-operative management failure. Multiple studies have shown that the use of water-soluble contrast agents accurately predicts the need for surgery with an active therapeutic role.

The administration of water-soluble contrast agents in adhesive small bowel obstruction is safe in terms of morbidity and mortality, but adverse effects due to their use have been reported. Potential life-threatening complications are aspiration pneumonia and pulmonary edema. To avoid these complications, the contrast medium should be administered when the stomach has been adequately decompressed through a nasogastric tube. Another potential adverse effect is that water-soluble contrast agents, because of higher osmolarity, may further dehydrate a patient with small bowel obstruction, shifting fluids into the bowel lumen. In some children and elderly adults, the loss of plasma fluid may be sufficient to cause a shock-like state.

### Computed tomography patterns in small bowel obstruction after open distal gastric bypass [^114fewyU]. Obesity Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Life-threatening small bowel obstruction (SBO) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass can present with surprisingly minimal laboratory and plain x-ray findings. Based on a 10-year (1994–2003) experience of 1,409 open distal gastric bypasses, we present clinical and radiological findings in 29 patients with unusual forms of bowel obstruction.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was conducted. A radiologist experienced in reviewing these in gastric bypass patients reviewed all computed tomography (CT) scans.

- **Results**: CT findings revealed the normal appearance and seven recurring patterns of small bowel obstruction. These include: 1) intussusception, 2) internal hernia through Petersen's space, 3) through Petersen's space and the mesenteric defect at enteroenterostomy, 4) through the mesenteric defect from the entero-enterostomy, 5) isolated biliary limb obstruction, 6) segmental non-anastomotic ischemia, and 7) internal hernia through bands.

- **Clinical findings**: One patient had peritonitis, and another had free air on a plain film. WBC count was normal in 20 out of 27 patients (74%), including 5 out of 6 (83%) with dead bowel. Nine out of 14 patients (62%) had "non-specific" findings on x-rays. Of these, seven had an internal hernia (two with volvulus and two with dead bowel), one had biliopancreatic limb obstruction, and one had peritonitis.

Patients with SBO after distal gastric bypass may present with vague complaints and confusing laboratory and non-specific findings on x-rays. Delayed diagnosis can have catastrophic consequences. CT imaging with oral and intravenous contrast can be life-saving and should be utilized promptly.

### Small bowel obstruction: What a gastroenterologist needs to know [^113PG3fg]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2023). Low credibility.

Intrabdominal adhesions and intestinal hernias are the most common causes of small bowel obstruction. Small bowel diseases, which lead to small bowel obstruction, are rarer and pose significant challenges for gastroenterologists in terms of diagnosis and treatment. This review focuses on small bowel diseases predisposing to small bowel obstruction and explores their diagnostic and therapeutic challenges.

Diagnosis of partial small bowel obstruction causes has improved with the use of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) enterography. For fibrostenotic Crohn's strictures and NSAID diaphragm disease, endoscopic balloon dilatation can delay the necessity for surgery if the lesion is short and accessible. However, many patients may still inevitably require surgical intervention. Biologic therapy may lower the need for surgery in cases of symptomatic small bowel Crohn's disease where the strictures are mainly inflammatory. In chronic radiation enteropathy, only cases of refractory small bowel obstruction and those with nutritional difficulties necessitate surgery.

Small bowel diseases causing bowel obstruction are often challenging to diagnose and usually require numerous investigations over time, which often lead to surgical intervention. The use of biologics and endoscopic balloon dilatation can help delay and, in some cases, prevent surgery.

### Does KUB play a role in the diagnosis of bladder bowel dysfunction [^113ztGtS]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2024). Low credibility.

Kidney ureter bladder radiography (KUB) is widely used for the evaluation of constipation in children with bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD); however, there is varying evidence to support its routine diagnostic use. One drawback to KUB is radiation exposure. The dangers of radiation in children are well-documented, and per the principle "As Low As Reasonably Achievable", non-beneficial radiation should be avoided. This risk is especially high in children who undergo repeated imaging in the follow-up of constipation treatment.

- **Objective**: We sought to assess the utility of KUB in diagnosing children with BBD by comparing it to four diagnostic tests and/or validated instruments: the Dysfunctional Voiding Symptom Score (DVSS), Rome IV criteria, rectal diameter on ultrasound (RD), and the Bristol Stool Form Score (BSFS).

- **Study design**: We prospectively enrolled a cohort of patients presenting to an academic pediatric urology practice with symptoms of BBD. Severity of stool burden on KUB (mild, moderate, or severe), RD on ultrasound (≥ 3.4 cm), DVSS, Rome IV, and BSFS were obtained for each patient. All imaging was interpreted by a pediatric radiologist and pediatric urologist. The primary outcomes were the association between the four diagnostic tests and KUB stool burden. Bivariate analysis of all individual variables versus KUB was performed, as well as multivariate regressions to determine if multiple measures were predictive of KUB stool burden when combined.

- **Results**: Between October 2020 and May 2022, 50 patients were enrolled. All children were under the age of 18.

### Cysview [^116VrV55]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For rigid cystoscopy, conduct biopsy and/or resection of suspicious lesions via transurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) only after completing both white and blue light cystoscopic examinations with bladder mapping. Using standard cystoscopic practices, obtain biopsies of abnormal areas identified during either the white or blue light examination and perform resections. Always verify the completeness of the resections under both white and blue light before finalizing the TURB procedure.

### Prognostic factors to identify resolution of small bowel obstruction without need for operative management: Systematic review [^117MtE7H]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Despite this work, no model has been implemented widely, and surgeons still rely on their clinical impression combined with imaging findings, suggesting that the models lack external validity or are difficult to implement in daily practice. We aimed to facilitate model development via meta-analysis, which allows the mathematical synthesis of potential predictor variables investigated across multiple studies and centres. At the same time, it is statistically undesirable to meta-analyse a limited number of studies unless they are very large and have sufficient outcomes. This drove our a priori decision to limit meta-analysis to variables reported in five or more individual studies.

For example, several small single-centre studies have suggested that water-soluble contrast follow-through (WSCFT, usually "Gastrografin") may not only diagnose the presence and site of small bowel obstruction but may also have both prognostic and therapeutic implications. A 2016 meta-analysis found that WSCFT reduced subsequent surgery significantly (OR 0.55) and was 92% sensitive and 93% specific for predicting non-operative management. We particularly wished to investigate this variable since it appears to be widely implemented by surgeons in daily practice. However, we were unable to identify sufficient primary research to allow meta-analysis.

Our review does have limitations. We selected articles that investigated potential imaging predictors of surgery and of ischemia at surgery. While we also chose to analyse non-imaging variables, any research that investigated these in the absence of sufficient data could not be effectively meta-analysed.

### An apricot story: View through a keyhole [^113SXt64]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Very few cases of small bowel obstruction due to ingested fruits have been described in the literature, and most of these have been managed by a laparotomy. Laparoscopic-assisted surgery can effectively deal with such impacted foreign bodies, thereby avoiding a formal laparotomy.

- **Case presentation**: A 75-year-old lady was admitted via the Accident and Emergency to the surgical ward with a three-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting. Investigations were suggestive of acute small bowel obstruction. On laparoscopy, there was an area of sudden change in calibre of the small bowel, with a dilated proximal and collapsed distal segment in the distal jejunum. A foreign body, dried undigested apricot, was extracted by mini-laparotomy.

- **Discussion**: Small bowel obstruction is a frequent cause of emergency surgery, and the aetiology may include food bolus obstruction. Diagnosis is usually confirmed intra-operatively. A foreign body impacted in the small bowel can be removed by open or laparoscopic methods.

- **Conclusion**: Generally, laparotomy is performed for diagnosis and management in acute bowel obstruction, but with increasing expertise, laparoscopy can be equally effective with all the other advantages of a minimal access approach.

### Sbo action: Conservative small bowel obstruction management in the absence of standard contrast agents on outcomes [^112P1uUM]. The British Journal of Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

This study provides prospective multicentre "real-life" data on the non-operative management (NOM) of patients presenting with an acute small bowel obstruction (aSBO). The overall success of NOM was 81.6%. The use of water-soluble contrast agents (WSCA) was widespread, despite a reported shortage, with 62.3% of patients receiving a contrast challenge. However, repeated contrast challenges showed diminishing resolution rates, suggesting limited therapeutic benefit beyond the initial administration.

A comparison of this cohort to previous UK reports provides an interesting contrast. The National Audit of Small Bowel Obstruction (NASBO) report showed that 31.0% of patients with aSBO received WSCA compared to 62.3% in the present study, reflecting a broader adoption of WSCA in aSBO management. This finding underscores the pragmatic and adaptable nature of clinical practice, where hospitals and clinicians likely implemented local strategies to maintain access to contrast agents despite reported supply chain challenges. Although it is difficult to determine the precise impact of the perceived shortage on decision-making, this study highlights how real-world data collection can provide unexpected insights into resource utilization and the resilience of clinical workflows during periods of uncertainty. However, one finding that has remained constant is the high rate of plain abdominal radiography prior to CT, contrary to recommendations from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death and the American College of Radiology, which advocate for early CT as the preferred diagnostic modality.

### Dual-energy KUB radiographic examination for the detection of renal calculus [^113qgY6W]. Academic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

The dual-energy radiographic technique has been proved to be clinically useful in the thorax. Herein, we attempt to apply this technique to the abdomen and pelvis in the context of renal colic. The visibility of renal calculi was assessed using various dual-energy peak kilovoltage combination radiographs applied to standard phantoms. This technique demonstrates a higher-than-acceptable radiation dosage required to optimize the image quality, and the optimized diagnostic quality is inferior to that of the standard Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder radiograph.

The dual-energy radiographic technique could not better identify the radiopaque renal calculi. Limiting technical considerations include the increased subcutaneous and peritoneal adipose tissue and the limited contrast between the soft tissue and underlying calculi.

### Diagnosis and management of small bowel obstruction in virgin abdomen: A WSES position paper [^113wZ7dX]. World journal of emergency surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Although several aspects in the diagnosis and treatment of small bowel obstruction in a virgin abdomen (SBO-VA) have not been clearly described in the few available studies, the overall results are comparable to the results of studies on small bowel obstruction (SBO) in patients with a history of previous abdominal surgeries. We, therefore, propose that patients with a virgin abdomen could be treated according to existing guidelines for SBO and adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO).

### Bowel obstruction: A narrative review for all physicians [^116qE3dr]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography with intravenous contrast is superior to that of conventional abdominal radiography and ultrasound. In addition to its higher sensitivity and specificity, an important advantage of computed tomography is its ability to provide information about the underlying cause of obstruction or to provide information about an alternative diagnosis if no signs of bowel obstruction are present. Computed tomography leads to more accurate management and assistance in preoperative planning.

- **ASBO caused by single band adhesion**: Computed tomography scan evidence illustrates the condition. Positive oral contrast material is not needed in the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction with computed tomography because the intraluminal fluid and gas already present within the obstructed bowel are excellent contrast agents. If positive oral contrast material has been given in patients with small bowel obstruction, then a delayed abdominal radiograph during non-operative management can assess if the contrast material has progressed to the colon.

When doubts about the large bowel obstruction diagnosis persist, a water-soluble rectal contrast agent can be administered to better visualize obstruction. Computed tomography can also accurately stage neoplastic bowel obstruction and identify superimposed complications such as intestinal perforation and peritonitis.

In the case of bowel obstruction, it is critical to identify ischemia and necrosis — especially in adhesive small bowel obstruction and sigmoid volvulus. Computed tomography provides an excellent evaluation in these scenarios.

### Relistor [^113Ljcpp]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Relistor is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction and those at increased risk of re-obstruction, due to the potential for gastrointestinal perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction, or those at increased risk of re-obstruction, should avoid using Relistor.

### A systematic review of outcomes reported in small bowel obstruction research [^117G2eah]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a condition commonly treated by general surgeons. The evidence base for its treatment is limited, partly due to variable reporting of outcomes in the literature. The aim of this study was to identify commonly used outcomes in SBO research.

- **Methods**: This review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017065538). Searches were performed on MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify prospective cohort or randomized trials reporting outcomes of interventions in SBO. Studies addressing diagnostics, pediatric populations, and SBO due to malignancy were excluded. Studies were screened for inclusion, and study and outcome characteristics were extracted into a pre-designed pro forma and mapped onto the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) framework.

- **Results**: A total of 1222 studies were screened for eligibility, 74 full-text articles were retrieved, and 51 studies were included in the synthesis. A total of 50 different outcomes were used. The duration of hospital stay was the most frequently reported outcome (n = 21 studies). Resolution of SBO was reported in 12 studies but only defined in eight studies, which used six different definitions. Patient-reported outcomes were reported in only four studies.

- **Conclusions**: There is a high degree of variation in the outcomes reported in SBO research. There is a clear need for a core outcome set and the development of a patient-reported outcome measure.

### Correlation of ureteral stone measurements by CT and plain film radiography: Utility of the KUB [^113rr6dh]. Journal of Endourology (2003). Low credibility.

The practice of utilizing helical CT to evaluate patients suspected of renal colic is increasing. Little is known about the accuracy of CT in estimating stone size or the utility of an accompanying plain abdominal radiograph (KUB film). The purpose of our study was to compare ureteral stone size estimation by helical CT and plain film and determine whether a KUB film provides additional information useful in patient management.

Thirty consecutive patients (17 male, 13 female) having both a helical CT and a KUB study for evaluation of renal colic secondary to ureteral calculi comprised the study population. Calculus number, location, and dimensions were determined from these images. Stone dimensions were measured using electronic calipers on a picture archiving and communications system. Information found by KUB and CT was compared, and both sets of stone measurements were correlated with patient outcome.

The mean maximal stone transverse diameter and length were similar on CT and plain film: 5.8 mm vs. 5.8 mm and 9.5 mm vs. 8.9 mm, respectively (P = 0.57 and 0.29, respectively). The mean anteroposterior stone diameter on CT of 6.8 mm was statistically greater than the transverse diameter as measured by both CT and KUB, which were 5.8 mm and 5.8 mm (P = 0.0002 and 0.0007, respectively). Eleven patients spontaneously passed their stones, while 19 patients required intervention. Patient outcome, as predicted by transverse stone width, was similar for CT and KUB data.
