## Question

postpartum BNP cutoff

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about BNP cutoffs in the postpartum period, including diagnostic thresholds, prognostic interpretation, and how to integrate BNP with echocardiography and clinical context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the physiologic changes in BNP around delivery and the immediate postpartum. Then, I should verify the best diagnostic thresholds from pregnancy-specific data versus general HF guidelines. Next, I will examine prognostic implications and how serial BNP informs risk. After that, I need to integrate BNP with echocardiography and consider confounders like obesity, preeclampsia, and renal function. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise approach and state the bottom-line recommendations with appropriate caveats and citations [^113wsKXx] [^1124SRSW].

> Let me first confirm the physiologic context, because I need to ensure I'm not overcalling disease in normal postpartum physiology. BNP and NT-proBNP rise transiently after delivery, peaking within 24–48 hours, and then generally normalize by 6–12 weeks postpartum; in healthy pregnancies, median BNP remains low, around 19–20 pg/mL, with a modest early postpartum bump that still stays below conventional HF thresholds, so any elevation above these physiologic ranges should prompt careful evaluation rather than reflex diagnosis of heart failure [^1113X2Xa] [^113PSZFB] [^114q4vo6].

> Now, I should verify the best diagnostic threshold for suspected heart failure in the postpartum period. A pregnancy-specific ROC analysis identified an optimal BNP cutoff of 111 pg/mL with 95% sensitivity and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.1, which practically rules out heart failure when BNP is below this value; importantly, this cohort excluded women with known cardiac disease, so it applies to suspected new-onset disease in the peripartum window [^112i4yMq]. Wait, let me verify consistency with broader guidance: expert panels suggest an upper reference limit of 50 pg/mL in asymptomatic pregnancy and endorse BNP < 100 pg/mL as having high negative predictive value for cardiovascular dysfunction, which aligns with the concept that values below ~100 pg/mL are reassuring in this population [^1124SRSW] [^116zkxaU].

> Hold on, I should also anchor to general HF standards to avoid overreliance on a single study. In acute care settings, BNP < 100 pg/mL or NT-proBNP < 300 pg/mL provide excellent rule-out performance for acute HF, and these thresholds are commonly applied in pregnancy and postpartum when the clinical picture is compatible; however, I need to emphasize that pregnancy-specific data support a slightly lower BNP threshold (~111 pg/mL) for optimal sensitivity in this unique population, so using < 100 pg/mL is conservative and safe, while values in the 100–400 pg/mL range warrant echocardiography and clinical correlation rather than automatic diagnosis [^111eKzvo] [^1116JVjh].

> Next, I will examine prognostic interpretation, because I need to ensure we don't miss risk stratification opportunities. In women with preexisting cardiac disease, BNP ≤ 100 pg/mL conferred a 100% negative predictive value for adverse cardiac events during pregnancy, underscoring the power of low values to reassure; conversely, higher BNP levels correlate with worse outcomes and can track disease trajectory when measured serially, which is particularly relevant in peripartum cardiomyopathy where early BNP magnitude relates to recovery likelihood [^111CUJtE] [^113ztrow]. Let me double-check the PPCM signal: lower BNP at presentation associates with higher likelihood of LV recovery at 6 months, reinforcing the prognostic value of baseline BNP in this phenotype [^113ztrow].

> I will now integrate BNP with echocardiography, because biomarkers alone cannot establish the diagnosis. Echocardiography remains the definitive test to confirm structural or functional cardiac abnormalities in suspected peripartum heart failure, and contemporary pathways recommend natriuretic peptide measurement as an initial triage, followed by urgent echocardiography when levels are elevated or clinical suspicion is high; this sequence helps avoid delays in diagnosing PPCM or other cardiomyopathies while preventing unnecessary imaging in very low-risk patients [^116zkxaU] [^11157t7F] [^112Kydho]. Wait, let me verify guideline alignment: major society guidance supports natriuretic peptide testing to support diagnosis or exclusion of HF, with echocardiography as the next diagnostic step when indicated, which fits the peripartum workflow well [^113wsKXx] [^111VTuRa].

> But wait, what if confounders are present; I need to check how they modify interpretation. Obesity lowers natriuretic peptide concentrations, so a "normal" BNP in an obese postpartum patient does not exclude heart failure; in such cases, a lower threshold for concern and a lower threshold to image are prudent. Preeclampsia and hypertensive disorders can elevate BNP and NT-proBNP, reflecting ventricular strain rather than primary cardiomyopathy, so elevations must be interpreted in the hypertensive context and not equated with PPCM without imaging. Renal dysfunction also elevates natriuretic peptides, so I should adjust expectations upward and rely more on clinical and echocardiographic correlation when eGFR is reduced [^1124SRSW] [^114q4vo6] [^111eKzvo].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I should confirm it aligns with both physiology and evidence. In a symptomatic postpartum patient, I would obtain BNP; if BNP is less than about 100 pg/mL, I would feel comfortable that heart failure is unlikely and prioritize other causes of dyspnea or edema, while remaining vigilant if clinical suspicion is high. If BNP is 100–400 pg/mL, I would order urgent echocardiography and integrate vitals, exam, ECG, and labs to refine pretest probability. If BNP exceeds roughly 400 pg/mL, I would treat this as high probability of heart failure and expedite echocardiography, cardiology involvement, and guideline-directed therapy as indicated; I should double-check that this tiered approach mirrors both pregnancy-specific ROC findings and general HF rule-in thresholds, which it does [^112i4yMq] [^111eKzvo] [^1116JVjh].

> I should also consider serial BNP use for monitoring and prognostication, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment titration. Serial measurements can help track response and risk, with falling BNP generally portending better outcomes; however, guideline statements caution that rigid BNP-targeted therapy algorithms have not consistently improved outcomes, so I would use serial values to inform clinical judgment and prognosis discussions rather than as standalone therapeutic targets in this population [^113L2PHH] [^115v8F31] [^116Q1rTr].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise and clinically actionable. For postpartum patients with suspected heart failure, BNP less than 100 pg/mL strongly argues against heart failure and can be used to defer echocardiography when clinical suspicion is low; BNP around 100–400 pg/mL should prompt echocardiography and careful clinical correlation; BNP greater than about 400 pg/mL suggests a high likelihood of heart failure and should trigger expedited cardiac evaluation and management. These thresholds should be interpreted alongside obesity, preeclampsia, and renal function, and in the context of the unique postpartum physiology that permits transient mild elevations, to avoid both under- and overdiagnosis of peripartum cardiomyopathy or other cardiomyopathies [^112i4yMq] [^111eKzvo] [^1124SRSW] [^1113X2Xa].

The most evidence-based BNP cutoff for postpartum heart failure is **111 pg/mL** [^112i4yMq], which provides 95% sensitivity and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.1 for ruling out heart failure in the immediate postpartum period. For NT-proBNP, use **< 300 pg/mL** [^111eKzvo] to rule out heart failure and **≥ 400 pg/mL** to support the diagnosis, with awareness of lower specificity in this population [^1124SRSW]. Always interpret values in clinical context and confirm with echocardiography when elevated or when suspicion remains high [^1124SRSW].

## Evidence-based BNP cutoff values in the postpartum period

### BNP cutoff values

- **Optimal BNP cutoff**: 111 pg/mL (95% CI 78–291 pg/mL) [^112i4yMq] provides 95% sensitivity, 62% specificity, positive likelihood ratio 2.5, and negative likelihood ratio 0.1 for diagnosing heart failure in pregnant and postpartum women without pre-existing cardiac disease.

- **Clinical utility**: This cutoff is highly sensitive, making it useful for ruling out heart failure in symptomatic postpartum patients [^112i4yMq].

- **Limitations**: Specificity is moderate; elevated BNP alone does not confirm heart failure and must be interpreted with clinical findings and echocardiography [^117Ka9nV].

---

### NT-proBNP cutoff values

- **Rule-out threshold**: < 300 pg/mL [^111eKzvo] has high negative predictive value for excluding heart failure in acute settings, including postpartum patients [^116ZDFFi].

- **Rule-in threshold**: ≥ 400 pg/mL supports the diagnosis of heart failure, but specificity is lower in postpartum patients due to physiological changes and comorbidities such as preeclampsia [^1168Gy4U] [^114q4vo6].

- **Clinical utility**: NT-proBNP is useful for ruling out heart failure, but elevated levels require careful interpretation and confirmation with echocardiography [^1124SRSW].

---

## Physiological changes influencing BNP levels postpartum

Physiological changes in the immediate postpartum period can affect BNP levels:

- **Hemodynamic shifts**: Rapid changes in blood volume, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance occur postpartum, potentially influencing BNP levels [^116fstFN].

- **Hormonal fluctuations**: Hormonal changes postpartum may affect BNP secretion and metabolism [^1113X2Xa].

- **Renal function**: Changes in renal function postpartum can influence BNP clearance and levels [^114q4vo6].

---

## Clinical implications of elevated BNP levels postpartum

Elevated BNP levels in the postpartum period have important clinical implications:

- **Heart failure diagnosis**: Elevated BNP levels support the diagnosis of heart failure, including peripartum cardiomyopathy, but must be confirmed with echocardiography and clinical assessment [^116zkxaU].

- **Risk stratification**: Elevated BNP levels are associated with increased risk of adverse maternal outcomes, including persistent cardiac dysfunction and recurrent heart failure [^113ztrow].

- **Monitoring and management**: Serial BNP measurements can guide clinical management and monitor response to therapy in postpartum heart failure [^1124SRSW].

---

## Limitations and considerations

While BNP is a useful biomarker, several limitations must be considered:

- **Specificity**: BNP levels can be elevated in conditions other than heart failure, such as renal dysfunction, pulmonary hypertension, and preeclampsia, reducing specificity [^112qzpHw] [^114q4vo6].

- **Individual variability**: BNP levels vary among individuals, necessitating careful interpretation in clinical context [^114q4vo6].

- **Assay variability**: Different assays may yield varying results, emphasizing the need for standardized testing methods [^116ceBPw].

## Summary of evidence-based BNP cutoff values postpartum

| **Biomarker** | **Cutoff value** | **Clinical utility** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| BNP | 111 pg/mL | High sensitivity for ruling out heart failure | Moderate specificity; false positives possible |
| NT-proBNP | < 300 pg/mL | High negative predictive value for excluding heart failure | Lower specificity; elevated in other conditions |

---

The most evidence-based BNP cutoff for postpartum heart failure is **111 pg/mL** [^112i4yMq], offering high sensitivity for ruling out heart failure. For NT-proBNP, **< 300 pg/mL** [^1116JVjh] rules out heart failure, whereas **≥ 400 pg/mL** supports the diagnosis but with lower specificity. Always interpret values in clinical context and confirm with echocardiography when elevated or when suspicion remains high [^116zkxaU].

Objective

To evaluate the performance of B-type natriuretic peptide as a diagnostic tool for heart failure in pregnant or postpartum women with singleton gestations.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective study of diagnostic accuracy. We identified pregnant and postpartum women with B-type natriuretic peptide and echocardiography performed at an obstetric teaching hospital from 2007 to 2018. Women with known cardiac disease or multiple gestation were excluded. A panel of two cardiovascular disease experts, blinded to B-type natriuretic peptide values, determined the diagnosis of heart failure by consensus. Their judgement was based on detailed clinical features and parameters at the time of presentation with suspected heart failure. Where consensus could not be reached, differences were adjudicated by a third expert. A receiver operating characteristic curve estimated the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of B-type natriuretic peptide at various thresholds.

Results

In total, 22 pregnant and 38 postpartum women were included in the cohort. Average age was 32 ± 6.8 years. The most common clinical features at the time of presentation with suspected heart failure included preeclampsia (33/60, 55%), dyspnea (50/60, 83%), chest discomfort (34/60, 58%), and bilateral lower extremity edema (32/60, 53%). In total, 39 (65%) women had heart failure. The median B-type natriuretic peptide level was 326 pg/mL (interquartile range 200.5–390.5) in women with heart failure, as compared with 75.5 pg/mL (interquartile range 19–245) in women without heart failure (P < .01). The estimated optimal B-type natriuretic peptide cutoff was 111 (95% CI 78–291) pg/mL. Using this threshold, 45 (75%) women had an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide, which yielded a 95% sensitivity (95% CI 83–99), 62% specificity (95% CI 38–82), a positive likelihood ratio of 2.5 (95% CI 1.4–4.3), and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.1 (95% CI 0.0–0.3) for heart failure.

Conclusions

B-type natriuretic peptide is a useful clinical tool to evaluate pregnant and postpartum women with suspected heart failure.

Natriuretic peptides and suggestions for clinical practice (Central Illustration)

1 In healthy asymptomatic pregnant individuals, natriuretic peptides should not be routinely measured. Central Illustration The Utilization of Cardiac Biomarkers During Pregnancy: Suggestions for Clinical Practice
2 To prevent delayed diagnosis of heart failure, we suggest measuring natriuretic peptides in pregnant or postpartum individuals with new clinical symptoms or suggestive signs of heart failure a) The suggested upper reference limit for BNP is 50 pg/mL, with no significant trimester-related differences. b) The suggested upper reference limit for NT-proBNP is 200 pg/mL in the first and second trimester and 150 pg/mL in the third trimester and postpartum period.
3 In individuals with established cardiovascular disease who are at risk for heart failure during pregnancy (eg, CHD, pre-existing cardiomyopathy, significant valvular disease), measuring natriuretic peptides prior to conception (when feasible) or early in pregnancy, followed by serial natriuretic peptide measurement throughout each trimester and the early postpartum period, should be considered. Values should be measured in the event of symptoms suggestive of heart failure. Such approach may help guide clinical management and distinguish the symptoms of normal pregnancy from those of hemodynamic decompensation. a) Low concentrations (BNP [< 100 pg/mL] or NT-proBNP [< 128 pg/mL]) have a high negative predictive value; thus, concentrations below these thresholds make cardiovascular dysfunction unlikely, based on limited data. b) An elevated BNP or NT-proBNP should prompt further clinical evaluation, although elevations can be observed without clear clinical consequence. For such patients, an echocardiogram is a reasonable next step. c) Lower thresholds for abnormal natriuretic peptide levels should be considered with obesity, though there are very limited data to guide use during pregnancy. A normal value does not preclude the diagnosis of heart failure in the obese population and should be clinically correlated.

### Maternal heart failure [^116zkxaU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

A pure clinical evaluation of pregnant patients with suspected HF often does not suffice in steering physicians to a diagnosis of HF; ECG, BNP, and echocardiogram, with the possible addition of chest X‐ray in the setting of pulmonary complaints, are needed. The utility of BNP in diagnosing HF in pregnant populations has been elucidated. Median BNP levels in normal pregnancies rest at 19 to 20 pg/mL which is increased from nonpregnancy levels (median 10 pg/mL) but still lower than levels correlating to congestive HF in the general population. For mothers with preeclampsia this level is elevated even further. Mean peak BNP levels are higher in pregnant women with heart disease than in those without known heart disease, and studies suggest that by using certain cutoffs and serial BNP levels, clinicians can better detect adverse cardiac events during pregnancy. Similarly, this method has shown promise in diagnosing superimposed cardiac processes in women with known preeclampsia related HF. A BNP level of ≤ 100 pg/mL has a 100% negative predictive value for identifying cardiac events during pregnancy. A threshold of 111 pg/mL as an "elevated" BNP level to predict HF in pregnant or postpartum women exhibited 95% sensitivity and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.1, but this study was conducted only in women with no known cardiac disease proceeding through a singleton pregnancy. Echocardiography serves the same utility in pregnant women as in the general population and can detect structural or physiologic changes to the heart, which may be because of either expected pregnancy‐related alterations or cardiovascular disease.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy

Natriuretic peptides elevate during incident heart failure from acute peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) as with acute heart failure in the context of other dilated cardiomyopathies. PPCM patients who present with lower BNP (727 ± 634 pg/mL vs 26,887 ± 1,600 pg/mL, P < 0.001) concentrations at incident presentation are more likely to recover left ventricular function at 6 months after diagnosis of PPCM than those with higher levels, highlighting the potential prognostic value of natriuretic peptides. In a multicenter cohort study of individuals with PPCM, a median NT-proBNP concentration at diagnosis of < 2,585 pg/mL was associated with a higher event-free survival than in individuals with higher values (P = 0.018). Interestingly, while PPCM is a disease of late pregnancy and early postpartum, a small study of first trimester biomarkers among women without pre-existing cardiovascular disease (CVD) found higher NT-proBNP levels (115.5 pg/mL [82.9–176.9]) among women who later developed PPCM (n = 4) than among those with healthy pregnancies both after matching for baseline demographic variables (n = 17, NT-proBNP 56.1 pg/mL [38.7–40.1]) and after matching additionally for blood pressure and pregnancy weight gain (n = 16, NT-proBNP 37.6 pg/mL [23.3–53.8]). However, further study is needed, potentially utilizing later gestational time points, to determine whether NT-proBNP may be able to identify women at elevated risk for future development of PPCM.

Peripartum heart failure in the absence of LV dysfunction

It has now been increasingly recognized that heart failure can develop during pregnancy and the postpartum period even in the absence of LV dysfunction among individuals without pre-existing CVD. During such acute heart failure presentations, BNP levels have been found to be elevated above normal values but to a lesser degree than patients who develop classic PPCM with systolic dysfunction (363 ± 270 vs 801 ± 416 pg/mL, P < 0.001).

Use of natriuretic peptides for the assessment of heart failure in pregnancy

Both BNP and NT-proBNP retain their negative predictive value to exclude heart failure in pregnancy and peripartum period such that low concentrations help to exclude the diagnosis. However, the positive predictive value of natriuretic peptides for heart failure is generally lower. In one study of healthy pregnant individuals, mean BNP levels during late pregnancy were higher than nonpregnant values (18 pg/mL, 95% CI: 0–45 pg/mL vs 12 pg/mL, 95% CI: 0–28 pg/mL, P < 0.001) with a further transient increase to 43 pg/mL (95% CI: 0–113 pg/mL) early postpartum. At 1 month postpartum, levels remained higher than those of nonpregnant controls (16 pg/mL vs 12 pg/mL, P = 0.001). Of the 773 asymptomatic pregnant individuals studied, 6.1% had BNP levels exceeding 100 pg/mL (the conventional upper reference limit for heart failure) and 1% had BNP levels ≥ 200 pg/mL, all during the early postpartum period. Among individuals with elevated BNP values, one demonstrated echocardiographic evidence of diastolic dysfunction, but all others remained without decrement in systolic function or clinical heart failure. Concentrations of BNP were negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin and positively correlated with creatinine. Thus, while low BNP concentrations during pregnancy and puerperium can provide reassurance with respect to the absence of current clinical cardiovascular decompensation, significant elevations do not necessarily signify clinically evident ventricular dysfunction.

Preeclampsia

Several small studies have reported higher natriuretic peptide concentrations among pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia than among normotensive pregnancies, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. Individuals with early-onset preeclampsia and those with severe features exhibit higher values than those with milder disease and normotensive pregnancies. Studies further suggest a correlation between both NT-proBNP and BNP concentrations and echocardiographic assessments of left ventricular wall thickness and mass, and it has been hypothesized that elevated natriuretic peptide concentrations reflect subclinical left ventricular dysfunction among preeclamptic individuals. BNP levels at the time of hospital admission have also been found to be higher among preeclamptic individuals who develop pulmonary edema than among those who do not (55.4 pg/mL vs 42.0 pg/mL, P = 0.008).

### Peripartum HFpEF: identification of a novel phenotype and the Need for Cardio-obstetrics management [^11157t7F]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Diagnostic Pathway for Peripartum Cardiomyopathy and the Need for Cardio-Obstetrics Follow-Up

The figure illustrates the diagnostic pathway for peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) based on the ESC working group's recommendations. It prompts the exploration of potentially new phenotypes of peripartum heart failure and the importance of follow-up visits for patients who display elevated natriuretic peptides alongside preserved ejection fraction. This underscores the need for further research and the development of clearer recommendations to address these aspects. Adapted from Bauersachs et al. Eur J Heart Fail. 2019;21(7):827–843.

Blood tests in symptomatic patients should include measuring natriuretic peptides, such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), which are often elevated in PPCM. It should be noted that normal pregnancy is not usually associated with significant or pronounced elevation of B-type natriuretic peptide BNP and NT-proBNP levels. According to the ESC recommendation, the main utility of natriuretic peptides is to help rule out HF. A BNP level below 100 pg/mL and an NT-proBNP level below 300 pg/mL provide a high probability of ruling out HF. These cutoff values serve as a useful reference in clinical practice to help differentiate patients who are less likely to have HF. However, it's worth emphasizing that these cutoff values may not be specific to PPCM and should be interpreted in the context of the overall clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation. In a subset of patients with HF, especially those who are obese (a group strongly associated with PPCM), some may exhibit normal BNP levels. In such cases, it is advisable to consider ordering an echocardiogram primarily for patients displaying signs and symptoms of HF, even when BNP levels remain normal. Additional blood tests may be performed to help exclude other potential causes and aid in the differential diagnosis of PPCM. Imaging studies, particularly echocardiography, play a key role in diagnosing PPCM by assessing LV systolic function, evaluating chamber dimensions, and identifying any structural abnormalities. Other imaging modalities, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, may be employed in certain cases to provide further characterization of cardiac function and tissue characteristics. The combination of these diagnostic tests aids in confirming the diagnosis of PPCM and guiding appropriate management strategies.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115jbq9q]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Heart failure management in pregnancy — nonpharmacological strategies across preconception, pregnancy, and postpartum include preconception genetic counseling/testing and risk assessment with echocardiography, close maternal and fetal monitoring during pregnancy with consideration of routine third-trimester echocardiography and natriuretic peptide monitoring that "may have some value", surveillance for preeclampsia, and multidisciplinary planning for decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock including hemodynamic monitoring and mechanical circulatory support; postpartum care emphasizes shared decision-making about breastfeeding and that in decompensated heart failure or cardiogenic shock management "should include hemodynamic monitoring and mechanical circulatory support as appropriate".

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^111HWqTK]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — recovery of left ventricular (LV) function — shows that recovery (ejection fraction [EF] ≥ 50%) has been reported in 45% to 78% of US women, most commonly within the first 6 months after diagnosis. Ventricular dilatation with an initial LV end-diastolic dimension > 5.6 cm is associated with less recovery, while predictors of recovery include higher initial EF, gestational hypertension, breastfeeding, postpartum diagnosis, lack of troponin elevation, lower BNP, absence of LV thrombus, and nonblack ethnicity. In a small series of 7 women, contractile reserve was associated with recovery, and withdrawal of heart failure therapy did not appear linked to clinical deterioration over 29 months of follow-up.

### The utilization and interpretation of cardiac biomarkers during pregnancy: expert panel [^116jowwk]. JACC: Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Cardiac biomarkers are widely used in the nonpregnant population when acute cardiovascular (CV) pathology is suspected; however, the behavior of these biomarkers in the context of pregnancy is less well understood. Pregnant individuals often have symptoms that mimic those of cardiac dysfunction, and complications of pregnancy may include CV disease. This paper will summarize our current knowledge on the use of cardiac biomarkers in pregnancy and provide suggestions on how to use these tools in clinical practice based on the available evidence. Natriuretic peptides and troponin should not be measured routinely in uncomplicated pregnancy, where values should remain low as in the nonpregnant population. In the context of pre-existing or suspected CV disease, these biomarkers retain their negative predictive value. Elevations of both natriuretic peptides and troponin may occur without clear clinical significance in the immediate postpartum period. Elevations of these markers should always prompt further investigation into possible CV pathology.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment as a quality measure in the pregnancy and postpartum period [^11384pZZ]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
Screenshot of CVD Risk Assessment Algorithm in Electronic Health Record

The figure depicts a screenshot of the risk assessment algorithm in the EPIC EHR in which, clinicians see the elements that are part of the CVD risk assessment algorithm. In the EHR, a banner appears if the risk assessment to indicate to the clinician that a CVD risk assessment is needed for that patient. Most of the elements are prepopulated, but they can be changed by the clinician. Based on the selections (yes/no) by the clinician, the risk score is automatically calculated. CVD = cardiovascular disease; EHR = electronic health record.

Figure 2
Cardiovascular Disease Algorithm Risk Assessment Toolkit

The figure depicts the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) CVD risk assessment algorithm toolkit that was integrated into our EHR. The arrows depict the direction of flow based on the risk factors and the output results based on the selection. A combination of each of the different factors can trigger an output of risks or no risks, which results in further follow-up. BMI = body mass index; BNP = brain natriuretic peptide; BP = blood pressure; CBC = complete blood count; CTA = computed tomography angiography; CVD = cardiovascular disease; CXR = chest x-ray; EHR = electronic health record; EKG = electrocardiogram (also known as ECG); HF = heart failure; HR = heart rate; MFM = maternal-fetal medicine physician; NYHA = New York Heart Association; oxygen sat = oxygen saturation; RR = respiration rate; TSH = thyroid-stimulating hormone.

Technical Expert Panel

To guide the use of the algorithm as a quality measure, we convened a national 12-member technical expert panel (TEP) involving general obstetricians, cardiologists, epidemiologists, and patient representatives. The TEP met virtually 4 times during the study period and provided input on elements of the algorithm, integration of the algorithm in the EHR, and measures such as the appropriate brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test cutoffs. Construct and content validity of the CVD risk assessment tool were reviewed by the TEP via discussions on inclusions/exclusions of the patient population.

Healthy pregnancy

Despite significant hemodynamic changes with pregnancy and normative cardiac chamber dilatation, BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations remain stable throughout the trimesters. In a series of 116 patients with serial BNP and NT-proBNP measured during pregnancy and the immediate postpartum period, natriuretic peptide levels increased within 48 hours postpartum, with a mean BNP of 85 ± 71 pg/mL and a mean NT-proBNP of 158 ± 167 pg/mL. Left ventricular and left atrial volumes similarly increased, but there were no differences in measures of diastolic function 48 hours postpartum as compared with the nonpregnant state and no reported adverse outcomes. Values returned to their presumed nonpregnant values (as assessed 6–12 months postpartum) by 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. In a study of 260 healthy pregnant individuals, Dockree et al reported a 95% upper reference limit for BNP of 50 pg/mL with no significant trimester-related differences. BNP degradation is influenced by neprilysin, which is released by the placenta into the maternal circulation. The authors proposed that because of excess placenta-derived circulating neprilysin, the sensitivity of BNP might be reduced and NT-proBNP (which is not a target of neprilysin) may be a more robust marker during pregnancy. More data regarding this interesting hypothesis are needed. The upper reference limit for NT-proBNP in the same study was 200 pg/mL in the first and second trimester and 150 pg/mL in the third, suggesting an effect of hemodilution with the increased volume of later pregnancy.

Regarding specific circumstances for heart failure, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend to consider initiating anticoagulation at diagnosis until 6–8 weeks postpartum in patients with acute HF caused by peripartum cardiomyopathy and LVEF < 30%.

### Cardiomyopathy in pregnancy [^1113GiEL]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiomyopathy during pregnancy is uncommon but potentially catastrophic to maternal health, accounting for up to 11% of maternal deaths. Peripartum cardiomyopathy is diagnosed in women without a history of heart disease 1 month before delivery or within 5 months postpartum. About half of all women will have full myocardial recovery within 6 months of diagnosis, but complications such as severe heart failure or death are not rare. African-American women have higher rates of diagnosis and adverse events. Women with preexisting cardiomyopathy, such as dilated or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, followed closely during pregnancy often tolerate pregnancy and delivery. Risk factors for adverse outcomes include functional status at baseline, severity of systolic dysfunction or outflow tract gradient, or history of prior cardiac event, such as arrhythmia or stroke. The level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) can be used to risk stratify women for adverse events. Pregnant women with cardiomyopathy should be followed closely by a multidisciplinary team comprised of nurses, obstetricians, neonatologists, cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and cardiac surgeons.

### B-type natriuretic peptide in pregnant women with heart disease [^111CUJtE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

The objectives of this study were to examine: 1) B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) response to pregnancy in women with heart disease; and 2) the relationship between BNP levels and adverse maternal cardiac events during pregnancy.

Background

Pregnancy imposes a hemodynamic stress on the heart. BNP might be a useful biomarker to assess the ability of the heart to adapt to the hemodynamic load of pregnancy.

Methods

This was a prospective study of women with structural heart disease seen at our center. Serial clinical data and plasma BNP measurements were obtained during the first trimester, third trimester, and after delivery (> 6 weeks).

Results

Seventy-eight pregnant women were studied; 66 women with heart disease (age 31 ± 5 years), and 12 healthy women (age 33 ± 5 years). During pregnancy, the median peak BNP level was higher in women with heart disease compared with control subjects (median 79, interquartile range 51 to 152 pg/ml vs. median 35, interquartile range 21 to 43 pg/ml, p < 0.001). In women with heart disease, those with subaortic ventricular dysfunction had higher BNP levels (p = 0.03). A BNP > 100 pg/ml was measured in all women with events during pregnancy (n = 8). Sixteen women had increased BNP levels during pregnancy but did not have clinical events. None of the women with BNP ≤ 100 pg/ml had events. BNP ≤ 100 pg/ml had a negative predictive value of 100% for identifying events during pregnancy.

Conclusions

Many pregnant women with heart disease have increased BNP levels during pregnancy. Incorporating serial BNP levels in into clinical practice can be helpful, specifically in adjudicating suspected adverse cardiac events during pregnancy.

### Pregnancy in a healthy population: dynamics of NTproBNP and hs-cTroponin T [^116ZDFFi]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the intraindividual changes of heart biomarker levels during and after pregnancy and to evaluate existing cut-off levels for heart failure or myocardial ischaemia in pregnant women.

Method

A total of 196 healthy pregnant women were recruited from maternal outpatient clinics and included in the study. Blood samples were obtained on four occasions: at 10–12 gestational weeks (gw), 20–25 gw, after delivery and 6 months postpartum and analysed for N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) and high sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTNT). Echocardiography ruled out existing cardiac disease. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated.

Results

There were significant changes in NTproBNP between the measurements with the highest NTproBNP at 10–12 gw and the lowest value being at 20–25 gw, (with eGFR being the highest). Hs-cTNT was significantly higher at the peripartum measurement compared with the other measurements (p < 0.05). Regardless, the 95th percentile for both biomarkers was below cut-off levels of 300ng/L for NTproBNP and 14ng/L for hs-cTNT. There was an association between NTproBNP above the upper limit of normal of 125ng/L and eGFR (p = 0.04) and between hs-cTNT > 5.0ng/L and time from delivery to blood sample (p = 0.001) at the peripartum measurement. Both were associated with the use of oxytocin.

Conclusion

Existing cut-off values for ruling out heart failure (NTproBNP < 300ng/L) and myocardial ischaemia (hs-cTNT < 14ng/L) are applicable during pregnancy and after delivery. Elevated levels mandate further attention on cardiac symptoms and renal function.

### Trending cardiac biomarkers during pregnancy in women with cardiovascular disease [^1163Xokv]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinical utility of cardiac biomarker testing during pregnancy in women with preexisting cardiac disease is not well known. We studied the levels and temporal trends of NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) and hs-cTnI (high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) throughout pregnancy in women with preexisting cardiac disease and sought to assess the association between NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI and pregnancy outcomes.

Methods

Three hundred seven pregnant women with preexisting cardiac disease were prospectively recruited. Mixed-effects linear regression analysis was used to compare the NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI levels between time periods and subgroups. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for maternal age and CARPREG II (Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy) risk score assessed the association between NT-proBNP levels and adverse events.

Results

Geometric mean NT-proBNP (95% CI) was stable through pregnancy with a transient significant increase with labor and delivery (101.4 pg/mL [87.1–118.1], 90.2 pg/mL [78.5–103.6], 153.6 pg/mL [126.8–186.1], and 112.2 pg/mL [94.2–133.7] for first/second trimester, third trimester, labor/delivery and postpartum, respectively). We observed a statistically significant difference in the NT-proBNP between women with preserved versus decreased systemic ventricular function, structurally normal versus abnormal heart, modified World Health Organization class 1, 2 versus modified World Health Organization class 3, 4 and no congenital heart disease versus congenital heart disease. Compared to those without events, median (interquartile range) NT-proBNP levels were significantly higher in those who had heart failure (204 pg/mL [51–450] versus 55 pg/mL [31–97]; P = 0.001) and preeclampsia (98 pg/mL [40–319] versus 55 pg/mL [31–99]; P = 0.027). NT-proBNP, adjusted for age and CARPREG II risk score, was significantly associated with combined heart failure and preeclampsia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.48–3.10] per log NT-proBNP increase; P < 0.001). NT-proBNP < 200 pg/mL had a specificity of 91% and negative predictive value of 95% in predicting combined heart failure and preeclampsia.

Conclusions

NT-proBNP remains steady over the course of pregnancy with a transient increase during labor and delivery with higher levels in subgroups of stable cardiac patients. NT-proBNP level of 200 pg/mL can be used in the diagnosis of heart failure/preeclampsia in the pregnant cardiac population.

### Universal cardiovascular disease risk assessment in pregnancy: call to actionExpert panel [^116dx4Gt]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

A solution

Consensus obtained through development of CVD toolkits and patient safety bundles indicate that the key step to lowering cardiovascular-related maternal mortality is the implementation of screening and clinician and patient education on cardiovascular health strategies in all care settings for pregnant and postpartum patients. Integration of a cardiovascular risk assessment tool to routine pregnancy/postpartum care may identify patients at risk of complications allowing for timely interventions. These patients may not otherwise be alerted of their increased CVD risk or get diagnosed with underlying CVD during pregnancy, delivery, hospitalization, or during the postpartum period (Central Illustration).

Central Illustration
Universal Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment in Pregnancy and Postpartum

The process of integrating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk assessment begins by involving healthcare providers during the pregnancy and postpartum period to conduct and complete the risk assessment. This assessment captures patient symptom data, vital signs, physical exam data, and CVD risk factors. Based on the risk assessment output, patients could be identified as 'at risk' for CVD, and the algorithm recommends follow-up diagnostic tests and referral pathways, as well as continued patient education and counseling. EKG = electrocardiogram; ECHO = echocardiogram; BNP = B-type natriuretic peptide; NT-proBNP = N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide.

### Pregnancy in a healthy population: dynamics of NTproBNP and hs-cTroponin T [^115Ki2Nu]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pregnancy is a state of volume overload and cause changes in the circulatory systems. Delivery is a strenuous physical effort and pain, and the use of oxytocin for labour augmentation, anaesthesia, operative delivery and postpartum haemorrhage may affect the circulation. When acute cardiac symptoms occur in previously healthy individuals, heart biomarkers are used to discriminate between benign cause and cardiac-related diagnoses. NTproBNP (N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide) is used for diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification with a high negative predictive value for ruling out heart failure, a condition associated with volume overload of the ventricles. In patients with heart failure, NTproBNP is a strong predictor of mortality. High-sensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTNT) is a commonly used biomarker for detecting cardiac myocyte damage and is elevated in ischaemic heart disease and also increases after extreme exercise, such as running a marathon, or even minor exertion, such as spinning for 1 hour. Pregnancy is associated with changes in physical and haemodynamic parameters in healthy women. The increase in plasma volume and renal excretion during normal pregnancy may affect the levels of heart biomarkers used for ruling out heart failure (NTproBNP) or myocardial ischaemia (hs-cTNT). Both biomarkers are affected by age and renal function.NTproBNP is also related to body mass index (BMI), sexual hormone binding globulin and ethnicity. The aim of this prospective observational study was to consecutively evaluate normal changes in levels of NTproBNP and hs-cTNT during and after pregnancy in prepregnancy healthy women and compare them to proposed cut-off levels.

### Morphofunctional cardiac changes in pregnant women: associations with biomarkers [^112YfwKe]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The blood volume increases by approximately 40% in pregnancy, leading to morphological and functional cardiac changes, such as increased left ventricular (LV) mass, increased left atrial (LA) volumeand significantly reduced early to late diastolic transmitral flow velocity ratio (E/A)by the onset of labour. A further increase in cardiac output may occur during labour because autotransfusion of 300–500 mL of blood from the uterus into the systemic circulation occurs after each uterine contraction. The uterine body volume, approximately 1000 cm 3 before delivery, decreases to 440 cm 3 on postpartum day 7 in healthy women. As water and sodium accumulated in the interstitial space during pregnancy shift into the circulation, the blood volume may increase further during the first few days postpartum and cardiac load may therefore reach the maximum during this period. This may explain the transient rise in N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) on postpartum day 3and why heart failure is most likely to occur within 1 week after childbirth among women with structural heart diseases. However, there have been no reports addressing the immediately postpartum cardiac morphofunction within 1 week after childbirth.

Heart failure can occur in pregnant women. Clinical symptoms associated with heart failure, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and oedema, are relatively common even in healthy pregnant women. It is considered beneficial to screen pregnant women at higher risk of heart failure before echocardiography using biomarkers, such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/NT-proBNP and troponin I. Elevated levels of both troponin I and NT-proBNP are seen in patients with heart failure caused by peripartum cardiomyopathy, and high-sensitivity troponin T retains prognostic value in patients with chronic heart failure. However, there have been few studies regarding the associations between biomarker levels and echocardiography findings in pregnancy.

This longitudinal prospective study was conducted to characterise changes in cardiac structures and function in normal pregnancies, especially during the period immediately postpartum when cardiac load may reach the maximum, in association with changes in five biomarkers and to determine which biomarkers changed with changes in cardiac morphology and function.

### Natriuretic peptides: role in the diagnosis and management of heart failure: a scientific statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology, Heart Failure Society of America and Japanese heart failure society [^111eKzvo]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Natriuretic peptide testing for suspected acute heart failure — diagnostic thresholds and interpretation include the following: In suspected acute heart failure, a BNP cut-off concentration of 100 pg/mL provides an excellent negative predictive value to exclude acute heart failure, whereas higher values (> 400 pg/mL) deliver excellent positive predictive value. For NT-proBNP, age-dependent rule-in cut-offs are preferred (450/900/1800 pg/mL), and independent of age an NT-proBNP concentration < 300 pg/mL provides a very high negative predictive value for heart failure. When using rule-in thresholds, identification of any potential relevant confounder should be required, and patients with levels in the gray zone need extra physician attention and ancillary testing, such as chest x-ray and echocardiography. A change of 25%–30% or more from presentation usually indicates a change in clinical status, and individualized interpretation of biomarker levels, particularly in special populations and in the setting of comorbidities, is recommended.

### Maternal heart failure [^116fstFN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Maternal Cardiovascular Physiology

During pregnancy, anatomic and physiologic hemodynamic changes within the maternal cardiovascular system are orchestrated to support the health and safety of the mother and her fetus. Increases in plasma volume (leading to physiologic anemia) and maternal heart rate occur, and arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance decrease. Cardiac output (CO) increases, beginning in early pregnancy beause of an increase in stroke volume, and is maintained further by way of tachycardia (Figure 1). Twin pregnancies exhibit an additional 15% higher CO throughout pregnancy. Increased left ventricular dimensions, aortocaval compression, and hypercoagulability also play a role in the dynamic alterations observed.

Figure 1
Changes in maternal cardiovascular physiology.

Upward arrows display physiologic increases and downward arrows display physiologic decreases. ANP indicates atrial natriuretic peptide; BNP, B‐type natriuretic peptide; BP, blood pressure; CO, cardiac output; HR, heart rate; SV, stroke volume; and SVR, systemic vascular resistance.

As labor begins, additional factors amplify the divergence from nonpregnant cardiovascular physiology; uterine contractions force a large volume of blood away from the uterus into general circulation, raising preload and CO in turn, and pain and anxiety increase sympathetic tone, raising blood pressure, heart rate, and CO as well. Within an hour of delivery, heart rate and CO return to prelabor levels, although still elevated above baseline nonpregnant levels. Stroke volume, heart rate, and cardiac output decrease dramatically over the first 2 weeks postpartum. Within the first 6 weeks postpartum, there is a persistent shift in the balance of the autonomic nervous system and endothelial reactions as they aim to reapproximate the non‐pregnant state. Atrial natriuretic peptide and B‐type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels further increase postpartum, mediating diuresis after delivery. The physiologic stress that these continuous adaptions create can both reveal previously undiagnosed cardiovascular disease in some and lead to development of new cardiac conditions in others, ultimately putting mothers at an increased risk of developing HF throughout their pregnancy course.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115BHomm]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — diagnostic approach, multidisciplinary care, and tests: To confirm PPCM, a full history, physical examination, and diagnostic testing should be completed to exclude prior heart disease and other causes of cardiomyopathy, and for the classic definition the history should confirm onset of heart failure in the last months of pregnancy or the months after delivery with cardiac evaluation confirming LV dysfunction. Usual heart failure symptoms should prompt evaluation during the puerperium, symptoms may mimic normal pregnancy or other cardiopulmonary disease, and pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia has been found in up to 68% of patients presenting with PPCM. Timely diagnosis should occur to prevent treatment delay, multidisciplinary care should include specified specialists, and in suspected familial cases genetic testing and counseling could be helpful. The usual laboratory assessment for suspected cardiomyopathies should be completed, a chest radiograph should be performed to rule out other causes of dyspnea and to assess congestion, and an ECG should be performed to assess arrhythmias and LV hypertrophy, sinus tachycardia, and nonspecific ST–T–wave abnormalities. Natriuretic peptide levels are usually elevated, measurement of cardiac troponin at diagnosis can be considered given its moderate predictive ability for ventricular recovery with inverse correlation to LV recovery, and inflammatory markers are usually elevated but their role in diagnosis or prognosis is uncertain.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of peripartum cardiomyopathy: a position statement from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology study group on peripartum cardiomyopathy [^112Kydho]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Medium credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a potentially life-threatening condition typically presenting as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in the last month of pregnancy or in the months following delivery in women without another known cause of heart failure. This updated position statement summarizes the knowledge about pathophysiological mechanisms, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of PPCM. As shortness of breath, fatigue and leg oedema are common in the peripartum period, a high index of suspicion is required to not miss the diagnosis. Measurement of natriuretic peptides, electrocardiography and echocardiography are recommended to promptly diagnose or exclude heart failure/PPCM. Important differential diagnoses include pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, hypertensive heart disease during pregnancy, and pre-existing heart disease. A genetic contribution is present in up to 20% of PPCM, in particular titin truncating variant. PPCM is associated with high morbidity and mortality, but also with a high probability of partial and often full recovery. Use of guideline-directed pharmacological therapy for HFrEF is recommended in all patients respecting contraindications during pregnancy/lactation. The oxidative stress-mediated cleavage of the hormone prolactin into a cardiotoxic fragment has been identified as a driver of PPCM pathophysiology. Pharmacological blockade of prolactin release using bromocriptine as a disease-specific therapy in addition to standard therapy for heart failure treatment has shown promising results in two clinical trials. Thresholds for devices (implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy and implanted long-term ventricular assist devices) are higher in PPCM than in other conditions because of the high rate of recovery. The important role of education and counselling around contraception and future pregnancies is emphasised.

### Peripartum cardiomyopathy: current management and future perspectives [^115iaykL]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Biomarkers for diagnosis and risk stratification of peripartum cardiomyopathy

Diagnosis of PPCM is often delayed and complicated by the fact that symptoms of heart failure to some degree overlap with normal pregnancy-associated discomfort. In addition, most PPCM patients are initially not seen by cardiologists. Biomarkers would help to identify PPCM patients early and refer them to expert physicians for further diagnostic assessment. Of note, biomarker-screens around pregnancy need controls exactly matched to pregnancy stage since many hormones, growth factors, and enzymes display highly specific kinetic pattern throughout pregnancy and postpartum (Table 1). So far, NT-proBNP, an unspecific marker for pregnancy complications such as preeclampsia as well as for heart failure and other diseases, is markedly elevated in most PPCM patients with little overlap to healthy peripartum women (Table 1). MiR-146a is specifically increased in the serum of PPCM patients compared with healthy postpartum women and patients with DCM (Table 1). sFlt1, a biomarker for preeclampsia that is supposed to clear rapidly after delivery, is significantly increased in PPCM patients as are asymmetric dimethyl arginine and Cathepsin D activity (Table 1). Failure to normalize a biomarker profile including NT-proBNP, oxLDL, interferon-g, and prolactin is associated with adverse outcome in PPCM patients. In turn, creatine-kinase and C-reactive protein are increased by delivery stress in healthy postpartum women and troponin T, a marker for cardiac injury, is often within normal ranges in PPCM patients (Table 1) and therefore less suited as biomarkers for PPCM.

Table 1
Overview of biomarkers analysed in peripartum cardiomyopathy patients

Taken together, currently NT-proBNP is the only commercially available marker for efficient screening of peripartum heart failure (Table 1). However, it is not specific for PPCM and may be elevated in other conditions such as preeclampsia and pulmonary embolism. MiR-146a is a disease specific potential candidate, but overall there is an urgent need for better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for PPCM.

### Longitudinal changes in the B-type natriuretic peptide levels in normal pregnancy and postpartum [^113PSZFB]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Normal levels of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) are not well established in pregnancy. We obtained longitudinal BNP levels in 29 healthy pregnant women in each trimester and postpartum period, and compared these levels to the 25 nonpregnant controls. There were no significant differences among the cases and controls with respect to weight, diastolic blood pressure, and ethnicity. A total of 116 BNP values were obtained during pregnancy. The median (and range) BNP level during pregnancy was 19 (10–143) pg/ml versus 10 (10–37) pg/ml in the nonpregnant controls (p = 0.003). However, there were no statistically significant differences in the median BNP levels at various stages of pregnancy: first trimester 20 (10–115) pg/ml versus the second trimester 18 (10–112) pg/ml (p = 0.8), second trimester 18 pg/ml versus third trimester 26 (10–143) pg/ml (p = 0.06), and third trimester 26 pg/ml versus postpartum18 (10–62) pg/ml (p = 0.08). There were no significant differences between the BNP levels throughout the trimesters and postpartum period. Pregnant BNP levels were approximately twice as high as the nonpregnant BNP levels. Our study is unique in evaluating longitudinal changes in BNP levels in normal pregnancies and the postpartum period in comparison with healthy, nonpregnant controls. It demonstrates that pregnant BNP levels are approximately 2-fold higher than their nonpregnant counterparts, and do not significantly fluctuate during pregnancy. In conclusion, pregnancy is associated with a significant, but small increase in the BNP levels compared with nonpregnant women.

### Morphofunctional cardiac changes in pregnant women: associations with biomarkers [^116nRLfD]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Interestingly, postpartum hs-TnI and CK-MB levels were significantly higher in women with VD than CS (figure 3, table 4). As CK-MB is expressed in the uterine muscle and its blood level increases after VD, as was seen in this study but not after CS, the elevated CK-MB may have been derived from the uterine muscle that experienced labour pains. In contrast to CK-MB, TnI is only expressed in the cardiac muscleand is considered as a biomarker suggesting myocardial damage. The hs-TnI increased significantly after VD as well as CS in this study. In an earlier report on perinatal changes in TnI, a significant increase in TnI level was observed in women after uneventful VD. It was speculated that minimal myocardial damage was more likely to occur during parturition with VD than CS.

There have been few studies regarding the associations between biomarker levels and echocardiography findings in pregnancy. Only a few previous reports addressed the associations between biomarker levels and echocardiographic measurements in pregnant women. These reports dealt with only NT-proBNP/BNP levels in pregnant women. To our knowledge, there have been no reports addressing the association of cardiac status on echocardiography with cardiac troponin and eGFR in pregnant women. A significant positive correlation was observed between eGFR and e′ as an index of LV relaxation in this study, consistent with findings in non-pregnant subjects. This suggested that reduced eGFR reflects decreased e' causing increased E/e' as an index of LV end-diastolic pressure. Pulmonary congestion as a sign of heart failure may be likely to occur under such conditions with increased LV end-diastolic pressure.

Limitations of this study

Early suspicion of heart failure is required to prevent major adverse events, such as death or the necessity for heart transplantation occurring in peripartum cardiomyopathy. Elevated levels of both troponin I and NT-proBNP are seen in patients diagnosed with peripartum cardiomyopathy. This study suggested that hs-TnI, BNP/NT-proBNP and eGFR reflected cardiac load/overload and myocardial relaxation in pregnant women, although the correlations were not sufficiently strong for biomarkers to predict cardiac status on echocardiography. As no women with heart failure were included in this study, we were not able to determine clinical usefulness of hs-TnI and BNP/NT-proBNP in pregnant women.

### Third-trimester NT-proBNP for pre-eclampsia risk prediction: a comparison with sFlt-1 / PlGF in a population-based cohort [^114BVjnr]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Pre-eclampsia causes significant maternal and fetal morbidity and is associated with postpartum cardiovascular disease. Vice versa, this syndrome, especially when manifesting preterm, shares numerous risk factors with cardiovascular diseases. Natriuretic peptides, such as brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and its inert byproduct N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are established markers for cardiac congestion and guide heart failure management outside of pregnancy.

During pregnancy, the value of angiogenetic markers, particularly the ratio of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor (sFlt-1/PlGF), is well established for pre-eclampsia prediction, effectively identifying individuals at risk within 4 weeks of assessment. Recently, our group has demonstrated that high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I enhances pre-eclampsia prediction. Elevated natriuretic peptides have been reported at the time of pre-eclampsia diagnosis, especially when the disease manifests preterm. Conversely, an inverse relationship between first-trimester NT-proBNP levels and the risk of pre-eclampsia has been observed.

This reversal of the direction of the association between natriuretic peptide levels and pre-eclampsia risk across gestation remains poorly understood. In nonpregnant individuals, NT-proBNP levels increase weeks before the onset of cardiovascular events. Subclinical cardiac pathologies, such as diastolic dysfunction, often precede the manifestation of pre-eclampsia. This suggests that natriuretic peptides could have analogous value when measured in temporal proximity to pre-eclampsia onset.

We hypothesized that elevated NT-proBNP levels in the early third trimester may precede the clinical manifestation of pre-eclampsia and provide additional value for short-term prediction within the 4-week window validated for sFlt-1/PlGF.

### Association of peripartum troponin I levels with left ventricular relaxation in women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [^116gCSJ9]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Both BNP/NT-proBNP and hs-TnI exhibited peak values immediately postpartum in both women with HDP and with NCP, consistent with the results of previous studies.BNP is bioactive and cardioprotective, improving LV diastolic function, and may be secreted in response to atrioventricular stretching to alleviate cardiac load, perhaps simply reflecting the changes in heart morphology in pregnancy. The level of hs-TnI also reflects cardiac changes in morphology at the time of blood sampling, similar to BNP/NT-proBNP (figure 3). In addition, as hs-TnI reflects LV fibrosis and cardiac myocyte damage, it was reasonable that higher hs-TnI around childbirth predicted sustained reduction of e' in this study.

A significantly positive correlation was observed between eGFR and e' in this study, consistent with findings in non-pregnant subjects. This suggested that reduced eGFR was likely to accompany increased E/e', an index of LV end-diastolic pressure, as shown in figures 1 and 2. Pulmonary congestion as a sign of heart failure may be likely to occur under such conditions with increased LV end-diastolic pressure. HDP is a prominent risk factor for heart failure in pregnancy, and both pulmonary congestion and impaired renal function indeed occur more often in HDP than NCP. Thus, reduced eGFR can be considered as a sign of impaired renal function and as a precursor of pulmonary congestion in pregnancy. In addition, persistent postpartum reduced eGFR may be a risk factor of heart failure in future life.

Study limitations

The low prevalence rate of HDP (approximately 5.0%), delayed referral of patients with HDP to our hospital and acute worsening of the patient's condition followed by emergent caesarean section resulted in missing data in some women with HDP in this study. Because LV diastolic dysfunction is usually the result of impaired LV relaxation, we did not use the proposed diastolic function criteria of Nagueh et al for difference in age of subjects and used only e' as an index of LV diastolic function in this study. These factors may have distorted the results.

Pregnancy is increasingly common in women with congenital heart disease (CHD), but little is known about long-term cardiovascular outcome after pregnancy in these patients. We studied the incidence of cardiovascular events 1-year postpartum and compared cardiac function prepregnancy and 1-year postpartum in women with CHD.

Methods

From our national, prospective multicenter cohort study, 172 women were studied. Follow-up with clinical evaluation and echocardiography and NT-proBNP measurement were performed during pregnancy and 12 months postpartum. Cardiovascular events were defined as need for an urgent invasive cardiovascular procedure, heart failure, arrhythmia, thromboembolic events, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, cardiac death, endocarditis, and aortic dissection.

Results

Cardiovascular events were observed after 11 pregnancies (6.4%). Women with cardiovascular events postpartum had significant higher NT-proBNP values at 20-week gestation (191 [137–288] vs 102.5 [57–167]; p = 0.049) and 1-year postpartum compared with women without cardiovascular events postpartum (306 [129–592] vs 105 [54–187] pg/mL; p = 0.014). Women with cardiovascular events during pregnancy were at higher risk for late cardiovascular events (HR 7.1; 95% CI 2.0–25.3; p = 0.003). In women with cardiovascular events during pregnancy, subpulmonary end-diastolic diameter had significantly increased 1-year postpartum (39.0 [36.0–48.0] to 44.0 [40.0–50.0]; p = 0.028). No other significant differences were found in cardiac function or size 1-year postpartum compared with preconception values.

Conclusions

Cardiovascular events are relatively rare 1 year after pregnancy in women with CHD. Women with cardiovascular events during pregnancy are prone to develop cardiovascular events 1-year postpartum and have increased subpulmonary ventricular diameter compared with preconception values.

Diagnostic algorithm for heart failure (HF) and ejection fraction (EF) classification — In patients with suspected HF, assessment includes clinical history, physical examination, and ECG and labs; natriuretic peptide testing uses NT-proBNP ≥ 125 pg/mL or BNP ≥ 35 pg/mL; transthoracic echocardiography is obtained with additional testing if necessary; after HF diagnosis is confirmed, determine cause and classify as HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 40%), HFmrEF (LVEF 41%-49%), or HFpEF (LVEF ≥ 50%); then evaluate for precipitating factors and initiate treatment.

HF and pregnancy — epidemiology and risk in cardiomyopathy: Among women with non–peripartum cardiomyopathy, major cardiovascular events occurred in 39% (United States) and 35% (Canada) of pregnancies, with 1% and 7% mortality, respectively, and previous cardiac events, NYHA class III to IV, or LVEF < 40% markedly increased maternal and fetal risks. The ROPAC registry describes outcomes for 1321 women with structural heart disease and reports that women with pregnancy or peripartum cardiomyopathy had the highest mortality rate (2.4%). Subsequent pregnancy after peripartum cardiomyopathy has been associated with further decreases in LV function and adverse outcomes, with the strongest prognostic determinant being LVEF < 50% before a subsequent pregnancy. A systematic review found that among 93 subsequent pregnancies with persistent LV dysfunction, 48% had further LVEF deterioration, 49% HF symptoms, and 16% mortality, whereas among 98 with recovered LV function before subsequent pregnancy, these rates were 27%, 32%, and 0%, respectively. Most women present with HF within 1 month postpartum, the incidence in the United States is 1 in 1000 to 8000 deliveries, and a 100-patient US registry showed 93% transplant/LVAD-free 1-year survival.

Screening and prognostication using natriuretic peptides — STOP-HF and predischarge use show that in the STOP-HF study, participants in the intervention group with BNP levels ≥ 50 pg/mL underwent echocardiography and referral to a cardiovascular specialist and BNP-based screening reduced the composite endpoint of incident asymptomatic LV dysfunction or overt HF; additionally, predischarge BNP and NT-proBNP levels are strong predictors of the risk of death or hospital readmission for HF, and although decreases during treatment are associated with better outcomes than no change or a rise, targeting a certain threshold, value, or relative change during hospitalization has not been shown to be consistently effective in improving outcomes.

### Results of cardiovascular testing among pregnant and postpartum persons undergoing standardized cardiovascular risk assessment [^112wvyMN]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States, accounting for one in three pregnancy-related deaths. A standardized CVD Risk Assessment can guide clinicians in identifying patients at risk for CVD.

Objective

The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a standardized CVD risk assessment yields more abnormal findings on follow-up CVD testing among pregnant and postpartum patients compared to assessments based on clinician judgment alone.

Study Design

A retrospective chart review was performed across three geographically and ethnically diverse hospital networks that had implemented the CVD Risk Assessment algorithm. The analysis included a total of 31,232 pregnant and postpartum patients who had presented for obstetric care visit from September 2020 to August 2024. We calculated the proportion of patients with abnormal composite brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), electrocardiogram (EKG), and/or echocardiogram test results by risk assessment group, and a two Proportion Z-Test was conducted to compare proportions. We then calculated the odds of having abnormal tests for each risk assessment group.

Results

Standardized CVD risk assessment yielded more abnormal composite test results than clinician judgment alone (6.9% vs. 4.2%; p < .0001). There was a greater proportion of abnormal test results among the risk-positive than the risk-negative group (23.4% vs. 6.6%; P < .0001). Patients assessed for CVD had 1.69 times the odds of having an abnormal test than those tested based on clinician judgment alone (P < .0001). Risk-positive patients had 4.31 times the odds of having an abnormal test than risk-negative patients (P < .0001).

Conclusion

Implementing a standardized CVD Risk Assessment algorithm may enhance the detection of cardiovascular disease in pregnant and postpartum patients with previously unknown CVD or at risk of developing CVD, providing a valuable tool that complements clinician judgment for improved perinatal outcomes.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy anticoagulation and bromocriptine considerations: Pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state even in the absence of cardiovascular complications, and in acute HF due to peripartum cardiomyopathy the incidence of intracardiac thrombi has been reported to be around 16% to 17%, with 9% thromboembolic events in 2 separate cohorts. Women with an intracardiac thrombus or a thromboembolic event receive anticoagulation as per standard of care; women with severely depressed LVEF (< 30%) in the setting of acute HF caused by peripartum cardiomyopathy can be considered for anticoagulation, especially in the first 6 to 8 weeks postpartum. If bromocriptine is used for postpartum women with severe acute HF caused by peripartum cardiomyopathy and LVEF < 35%, it should be accompanied by at least prophylactic-dose anticoagulation, while the efficacy and safety of bromocriptine currently remains uncertain and further randomized placebo-controlled trials are required.

### Morphofunctional cardiac changes in pregnant women: associations with biomarkers [^112H6iFu]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

The IVC diameter was significantly reduced in the third trimester compared with that in the first trimester and increased abruptly showing the peak value immediately after childbirth. Reduced IVC diameter in the third trimester may have resulted from compression by the enlarged gravid uterus. Lifting of IVC compression occurring immediately after childbirth may have caused an abrupt increase in venous blood return to the heart. This may have placed further strain on the heart that had adapted to tolerate the physiological increase in circulating blood volume in pregnancy. This together with the increased circulating blood volume perhaps occurring in the early postpartum period may have additively contributed to significant increases in hs-TnI, BNP/NT-proBNP and CK-MB levels occurring in the early postpartum period in healthy women.

BNP reached the maximum in the early postpartum period and exhibited a significant positive correlation with LA volume index in this study, consistent with the physiological role of BNP as a bioactive natriuretic hormone; BNP is produced in cardiomyocytes and released into the circulation in response to ventricular stretching, reducing preload and afterload. However, there may have been a somewhat different implication in the present study that the hs-TnI exhibited a significant increase immediately postpartum within 1 week after childbirth and was significantly correlated with LA volume index and LV mass index even in normal pregnant women. In an animal model, increased external load initially induced cardiac hypertrophy with preserved contractility and sustained overload eventually led to heart failure through pathological cardiac remodellingwith low capillary density and replacement with fibrosis. Replacement myocardial fibrosis is associated with increased plasma hs-TnI concentration. Cardiac troponin can reflect myocyte injury and predict the outcome of heart failure in fields outside obstetrics. The significant rise in hs-TnI occurring in the early postpartum period in this study suggested that transient myocyte injury with or without pathological cardiac remodelling occurred even in normal pregnant women postpartum. This was supported by a recent study indicating that a significant proportion of women with apparently normal pregnancies showed cardiovascular maladaptation to the volume-overloaded state at term.

### Peripartum cardiomyopathy: from genetics to management [^112dowqL]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a disease that occurs globally in all ethnic groups and should be suspected in any peripartum women presenting with symptoms and signs of heart failure, towards the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery, with confirmed left ventricular dysfunction. After good history taking, all women should be thoroughly assessed, and alternative causes should be excluded. Urgent cardiac investigations with electrocardiogram and natriuretic peptide measurement (if available) should be performed. Echocardiography follows as the next step in investigation. Patients with abnormal cardiac investigations should be urgently referred to a cardiology team for expert management. Referral for genetic work-up should be considered if there is a family history of cardiomyopathy or sudden death. PPCM is a disease with substantial maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Maternal mortality rates range widely, from 0% to 30%, depending on the ethnic background and geographic region. Just under half of women experience myocardial recovery. Remarkable advances in the comprehension of the pathogenesis and in patient management and therapy have been achieved, largely due to team efforts and close collaboration between basic scientists, cardiologists, intensive care specialists, and obstetricians. This review summarizes current knowledge of PPCM genetics, pathophysiology, diagnostic approach, management, and outcome.

### B-type natriuretic peptide for diagnosis of heart failure in emergency department patients: a critical appraisal [^112qzpHw]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of heart failure in the outpatient setting can be difficult. A rapid assay for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been advocated for the diagnosis of heart failure, using a single cutoff of 100 pg/mL. BNP is produced by both the right and left cardiac ventricles and is elevated in a variety of conditions, including heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, pulmonary embolism, left ventricular hypertrophy, renal failure, circulatory overload, acute coronary syndromes, atrial fibrillation, lung cancer, and sepsis. This multitude of causes of BNP elevation imposes limits on its diagnostic use for heart failure. The literature on the use of BNP testing for diagnosis of heart failure is reviewed, and improved guidelines for its interpretation are suggested.

The optimal cut-off BNP level for distinguishing low-risk versus high-cardiac risk

Two meta-analyses published in 2009 could not define the optimal cut-off value for BNP and NT-proBNP due to wide variation between studies. A more recent meta-analysis suggested that the screening BNP cut point was 30 pg/mL for predicting cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction within 30 days of non-cardiac vascular surgery with 95% sensitivity and 44% specificity. This level is quite consistent with other studies using BNP to predict cardiovascular events in asymptomatic patients which is similar to the task of preoperative cardiac evaluation of asymptomatic surgical patients. Excess risk was apparent at BNP levels well below current thresholds used to diagnose acute heart failure: In a large cohort study on asymptomatic patients who started without diagnosis of heart failure, BNP values above 20.0 pg/mL for men and 23.3 pg/mL for women were associated with multivariable-adjusted HRs of 1.62 for death, 1.76 for a first major cardiovascular event and 3.07 for heart failure during a mean follow-up of 5.2 years. Similar BNP threshold of increasing cardiac risk were found in several other large cohort studies. A review suggested that the optimal cut points for excluding heart failure in asymptomatic patients are BNP < 20 pg/mL and NT-proBNP < 125 pg/mLwhich has been supported by the recent PROBE-HF study. Furthermore, studies have shown that BNP > 20 pg/mL produced 87% sensitivity, 37% specificity and a negative predictive accuracy of 90% at detecting silent ischaemic heart disease in patients with diabetes. Heart failure and ischaemic heart disease are well-established risk factors of perioperative cardiac complications and are part of the RCRI. Based on converging results from several lines of related research discussed above, BNP cut-off value is likely around 20–30 pg/mL and NT-proBNP cut-off value is likely around 125 pg/mLfor preoperative screening purposes in moderate to high-risk patients. The convergence of results from several related lines of research further suggests that the cut-off value of BNP for vascular surgerical patients may be similar to non-vascular surgical patients. Some study also suggests normal NT-Pro-BNP levels should be stratified by age and gender to improve the negative predictive values of cardiovascular diseases.

Appendix 3 — Suggested thresholds for structural heart disease and evidence of increased filling pressures list morphology, systolic and diastolic function, and biomarker cutoffs. Morphology thresholds include left atrial volume index (LAVI) ≥ 29 mL/m2, left ventricular mass index (LVMI) > 116/95 g/m2, relative wall thickness (RWT) > 0.42, and LV wall thickness ≥ 12 mm. Ventricular systolic function thresholds include left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 50% and global longitudinal strain (GLS) ≤ 16%. Ventricular diastolic function thresholds include average E/e′ ≥ 15 for increased filling pressures, septal e′ < 7 cm/s, lateral e′ < 10 cm/s, tricuspid regurgitation (TR) velocity > 2.8 m/s, and estimated pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure > 35 mm Hg. Biomarker thresholds include brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) ≥ 35 pg/mL and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) ≥ 125 pg/mL. Notes state that cutoffs for natriuretic peptide levels may have lower specificity in older patients or in atrial fibrillation (AF) or chronic kidney disease (CKD), that higher cutoff values are recommended for the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) in these patients, and that population screening cutoffs for pre-HF (Stage B HF) may be < 99% reference limits and need definition according to the at-risk population.

### BNP and NT-proBNP thresholds for the assessment of prognosis in patients without heart Failure [^1128YP8W]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal-pro hormone brain natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) enable risk stratification, diagnosing, and monitoring of heart failure patients. An additional prognostic value for BNP/NT-proBNP in nonheart failure patients and general population cohorts is described in the literature, but specific cut-off levels are only described for heart failure patients.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine thresholds for risk stratification in nonheart failure patients.

Methods

Based on the Essen Coronary Artery Disease registry we excluded patients with known heart failure or elevated BNP/NT-pro BNP levels. The resulting cohort was divided into a derivation and validation cohort using random sampling. The prognostic value of BNP/NT-proBNP of incident mortality was evaluated in the derivation cohort using univariate and multivariable cox regression analysis. In receiver operating characteristic analysis and corresponding area under the curve the optimal threshold was determined using Youdens J index. The findings were verified in the validation cohort.

Results

A total of 3,690 patients (age 62.9 ± 12.5 years, 71% male, 68% patients with coronary artery disease) were included. During a mean follow-up of 2.6 ± 3.4 years (median 1.2 [IQR: 0.4–2.88]), 169 deaths of any cause occurred. Based on Youden's J index, BNP-thresholds of 9.6 and 29pg/ml and NT-proBNP thresholds of 65 and 77pg/ml for men and women, respectively, were determined. BNP/NT-proBNP levels above these thresholds were associated with increased mortality in the derivation cohort (HR: 2.44 [95% CI: 1.32–4.53], P = 0.005). The predictive value was confirmed in the validation cohort (HR: 2.78 [95% CI: 1.26–6.14], P = 0.01).

Conclusions

We here describe sex-specific BNP/NT-proBNP thresholds that allow prediction of impaired survival in patients without heart failure, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

### Hypertensive pregnancy disorder, an under-recognized women specific risk factor for heart failure? [^113g9Q9q]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) including pregnancy‐induced hypertension, preeclampsia and HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count), occur in almost 10% of gestations and are a major cause of maternal death. Preeclampsia, a multi‐organ pregnancy disorder characterized by endothelial dysfunction, hypertension and multi‐organ hypoperfusion, occurs in 3–4% of gestations in the Western world. Any HDP is a marker of future CV disease (CVD) risk including cerebral vascular accidents, cardiac atherosclerotic event, atrial fibrillation, heart failure and cardiac death with a dose effect risk resulting in the highest risk being present in early‐ and preterm‐ preeclampsia. Conventional risk factors for heart failure include hypertension, coronary artery disease (CAD), myocardial infarction, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and renal disease, all of which are highly present after HDP. Worse profiles in CV risk continue as early as 1 year postpartum after preeclampsia including higher levels of blood pressure (BP), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, markers of insulin resistance and body mass index (BMI). Hypertension after preeclampsia explained 64% of the increased risk of CAD and 49% of the increased risk of heart failure in these women.

Screening

There is general agreement that women who suffered from HDP should undergo CV screening starting as early as possible to make women aware of their increased CV risk and allow appropriate prevention. Although the exact modality of screening and protocol of intervention has not been standardized, mainly due to limited available evidence‐based clinical research on antenatal and postnatal care, recent evidence suggests a potential role for early BP control with angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors. Whether this will result in improved reverse remodelling and prevention of heart failure is subject for future research. Established and cost‐effective prevention strategies should be implemented in regular clinical care.

### Long-term postpartum cardiac function and its association with preeclampsia [^115aem9s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder that affects up to 5% of all pregnant women and is the most common medical complication of pregnancy. 1 Although preeclampsia was previously considered only a peripartum disease, it is now recognized as a risk factor for the long‐term development of cardiovascular disease. In a 2017 meta‐analysis of 22 studies and 6.4 million women, preeclampsia was associated with a fourfold increase in the development of postpartum heart failure and a twofold increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and death caused by cardiovascular disease. 2 In addition, a 2019 study of 149 712 women likewise reported a 2.77% rate of first‐time cardiovascular events including heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular deaths in the first 9 years after a delivery complicated by preeclampsia as opposed to a 1.4% rate in women after an uncomplicated pregnancy. 3 We have previously observed that women diagnosed with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia are twice as likely to be admitted with new‐onset heart failure within 90 days of delivery as women with normotensive pregnancies. 4

The mechanisms underlying preeclampsia‐induced postpartum heart failure are poorly understood. Although biomarkers such as soluble fms‐like tyrosine kinase 1 and placental growth factor are associated with antepartum cardiac dysfunction, they are unlikely to play a mechanistic role in the development of postpartum cardiac dysfunction, as their levels return to normal within 72 hours after a delivery complicated by preeclampsia. 5

One mechanistic possibility is dysregulated activin A signaling. Activin A is a glycoprotein growth factor normally involved in cellular differentiation and proliferation. Abnormal activin A regulation may contribute to fibrosis in preclinical models, 6, 7 and lead clinically to hypertension and heart failure. 8, 9, 10 During pregnancy, activin A is produced by the placenta and by other cell types, such as macrophages, and circulating levels are highest at term. The role of activin A in the development of postpartum cardiac dysfunction, however, remains unclear.

Acute heart failure — testing recommendation and clinical utility: In acute HF care settings, natriuretic peptide testing has the potential to augment physicians' decision making across the spectrum of care, and natriuretic peptides have the advantages of objectivity, reproducibility, and widespread availability with evidence they define risk better than clinician judgment alone; importantly, natriuretic peptides should be measured in all patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of new-onset or worsening HF.

Heart failure natriuretic peptide testing — diagnostic context and caveats indicate that a substantial evidence base supports the use of natriuretic peptide biomarkers for excluding HF as a cause of symptoms in ambulatory and emergency department settings, and in the emergency setting BNP and NT-proBNP levels have higher sensitivity than specificity and may be more useful for ruling out HF than ruling in HF; measurement in the ambulatory setting can provide incremental diagnostic value when dyspnea etiology is unclear, but obesity is associated with lower levels of BNP and NT-proBNP thereby reducing their diagnostic sensitivity.

Introduction

An estimated 800 000 people in the UK currently have heart failure, with more than 250 000 new cases every year. Incidence increases with age and is highest in adults aged more than 75 years. The aging population and improved survival of people with ischaemic heart disease are likely to lead to a continuing increase in the prevalence of heart failure. Overall, a general practitioner with a patient population of 2000 will care for about 40–50 patients with heart failure and see two or three new cases each year.

Since heart failure may be reversible with appropriate treatment in the early stages of disease, early diagnosis is important. Considering the low prevalence of heart failure, however, general practitioners are unlikely to have enough experience to identify more subtle signs. Although heart failure is often diagnosed by general practitioners, on the basis of clinical signs, symptoms, and the results of 12 lead electrocardiography, the diagnosis is only confirmed by echocardiography in about one third of cases. Cardiologists generally perform better than general practitioners in using electrocardiography to rule out chronic heart failure (CHF); however, electrocardiography is not a reliable test to diagnose CHF because of its non-specific nature. Therefore, recent guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and the European Society for Cardiology (ESC) on the initial diagnosis of CHF and referral for echocardiography recommend the use of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) tests in combination with clinical assessment.

BNP is a protein produced by heart muscle cells as a prohormone (proBNP) and released into the cardiovascular system in response to ventricular dilation and pressure overload. The prohormone is split by a protease and secreted as the physiologically active C terminal fragment (BNP) and the inactive N terminal fragment (NTproBNP), which has a longer half life than BNP.

No clear consensus exists about the appropriate BNP threshold for diagnosing CHF. The 2016 ESC guidelines recommend an upper limit of normal of 35 pg/mL for BNP and 125 pg/mL for NTproBNP in the non-acute setting to exclude heart failure. In the acute setting, higher values should be used (BNP < 100 pg/mL, NTproBNP < 300 pg/mL). In contrast, NICE suggests a BNP threshold of 100 pg/mL and an NTproBNP threshold of 400 pg/mL for referral of patients with suspected heart failure.

### Morphofunctional cardiac changes in pregnant women: associations with biomarkers [^112EwE4v]. Open Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This longitudinal study was performed to determine changes in echocardiography parameters in association with various biomarker levels in pregnancy/postpartum.

Methods

Fifty-one healthy pregnant women underwent echocardiography with simultaneous determination of blood levels of five biomarkers at each of the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy, immediately postpartum within 1week after childbirth and approximately 1month postpartum. Data on 255 echocardiography scans (five times per woman) and biomarkers were analysed.

Results

Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left atrial (LA) volume index and left ventricular (LV) mass index increased with advancing gestation and reached the maximum immediately postpartum concomitant with the highest brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) and creatine kinase MB levels. The inferior vena cava diameter was significantly reduced in the third trimester compared with that in the first trimester and the peak occurred immediately after childbirth. In 255 paired measurements, hs-TnI level was significantly positively correlated with LA volume index and LV mass index; BNP and NT-proBNP were significantly positively correlated with LA volume index and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was significantly positively correlated with the average of early diastolic septal and lateral mitral annular velocity (e').

Conclusions

Maximal cardiac changes in morphology occurred postpartum within 1week after childbirth, not during pregnancy. BNP/NT-proBNP, hs-TnI and eGFR reflected cardiac changes in pregnancy.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2021). High credibility.

Heart failure continuum — proposed revised stages define At risk for heart failure (HF) (Stage A) as "Patients at risk for HF, but without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF and without structural cardiac changes or elevated biomarkers of heart disease", including those with "hypertension, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, known exposure to cardiotoxins, a positive family history of cardiomyopathy, or genetic cardiomyopathy", noting that "risk factor intervention may be warranted". Pre-HF (Stage B) includes "Patients without current or prior symptoms or signs of HF with evidence of one of the following:" structural heart disease (e.g., "left ventricular hypertrophy", "cardiac chamber enlargement", "ventricular wall motion abnormality", and myocardial tissue abnormalities by cardiac magnetic resonance), abnormal cardiac function ("reduced left or right ventricular systolic function, evidence of increased filling pressures… abnormal diastolic dysfunction", which "can be characterized by reduced EF, abnormal ventricular strain, or other noninvasive or invasive modalities"), or biomarkers ("Elevated natriuretic peptide levels (for levels, refer to Table 8) or elevated cardiac troponin levels (> 99th percentile in a normal reference population)"). Heart failure (Stage C) is "Patients with current or prior symptoms and/or signs of HF caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality". The document adds that "we did not specifically include genetic markers in the definition of pre-HF or Stage B HF", and that natriuretic peptide "cutoffs… represent thresholds lower than inclusion criteria used in some clinical trials", with thresholds that "may have lower specificity especially in older patients, or patients with atrial fibrillation or CKD", and "Usually, higher cutoff values are recommended for the diagnosis of HF in these patients".

6 USE OF NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES IN HEART FAILURE

The area where most is known about the role of natriuretic peptides is in patients with heart failure. The use of natriuretic peptides for the diagnosis of heart failure is now common and standard practice. Given the overwhelming evidence that natriuretic peptide levels are raised in heart failure, the definition of heart failure incorporates raised natriuretic peptides as a key aspect of making the diagnosis. What is less clear, however, is the precise threshold to be used to rule in or rule out a diagnosis. Currently, the European Society of Cardiology guidelines use a value of BNP < 35 pg/mL or NT‐proBNP < 125 pg/mL to rule out heart failure in a non‐acute setting. In the acute setting, values of BNP < 100 pg/mL or NT‐proBNP < 300 pg/mL are suggested as appropriate thresholds to rule out heart failure. These thresholds apply to patients in sinus rhythm; however, as will be discussed later, a number of other conditions can raise natriuretic peptides and lower natriuretic peptides, and therefore care must be taken into account when interpreting high or low levels (Figure 2). Currently, guidelines do not give any guidance on how these levels should be adjusted according to factors known to influence natriuretic peptides and therefore alter the sensitivity and specificity of a cut‐off threshold value for ruling out or ruling in heart failure. Some suggestions for age and sex‐related cut‐offs have been made but are not universally used. The one comorbidity where there is more consensus about adjusting the cut‐off is in the presence of atrial fibrillation. It is suggested that thresholds are increased by 50–100% in the presence of atrial fibrillation. There is currently no evidence to support different cut‐offs according to whether heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction is suspected.

Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Heart failure diagnostic evaluation — laboratory testing and natriuretic peptides: Thyroid-function tests should be measured; a fasting transferrin saturation is useful to screen for hemochromatosis and magnetic resonance imaging may be needed to confirm iron overload; screening for human immunodeficiency virus should be considered in patients who are at high risk; assays for connective tissue diseases and for pheochromocytoma should be performed if suspected; and serum titers of Chagas disease antibodies should be checked in nonischemic cardiomyopathy with travel or immigration from an endemic region. Elevated plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have been associated with reduced LVEF, LVH, elevated LV filling pressures, and acute MI and ischemia and are sensitive to age, sex, weight, and renal function; elevated levels lend support to a diagnosis of abnormal ventricular function or hemodynamics causing symptomatic heart failure. Trials suggest utility in the urgent-care setting to differentiate dyspnea due to heart failure from other causes and suggest that use may reduce both the time to hospital discharge and the cost of treatment, but BNP levels tend to be less elevated in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction than in heart failure with low ejection fraction, are lower in obese patients, and may be elevated meaningfully in women and in people over 60 years of age who do not have heart failure; elevations may lend weight to a suspected diagnosis or trigger consideration of heart failure when unknown but should not be used in isolation to confirm or exclude the presence of heart failure.

### B-type natriuretic peptides and echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function [^115ZRtFN]. JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Echocardiography and the B-type natriuretic peptides (BNPs) provide powerful incremental assessment of cardiac function, clinical status, and outcome across the spectrum of cardiac disease. There is strong evidence to support their integrated use in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or BNP may guide more effective use of echocardiography in screening for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction; Doppler echocardiography improves the accuracy of heart failure diagnosis in the setting of intermediate BNP or NT-proBNP levels. Combined assessment of peptides and echocardiography provides more powerful stratification of risk across all stages of heart failure, and integrated use of both tests may identify subjects with valvular disease at greatest risk for progression and guide decision-making for timely intervention.

Heart failure diagnostics and prognosis — natriuretic peptides: Natriuretic peptides play a central role in both the diagnosis of heart failure (HF) and the assessment of short- and long-term prognosis, and their plasma measurement (BNP and NT-proBNP) constitutes a marker of disease severity and a predictor of prognosis. Given HF is a clinical syndrome with recognizable signs and symptoms where additional diagnostics are valuable, abundant data support natriuretic peptides for establishing the diagnosis of HF in many clinical settings, including initial diagnosis in ambulatory patients with undifferentiated symptoms such as fatigue or dyspnea on exertion.

### Natriuretic peptides to differentiate constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ceBPw]. Clinical Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assessed the diagnostic utility of natriuretic peptides to differentiate CP and RCM. However, our study has some limitations. First, given that two different assay types were used for the measurement of BNP levels, it is possible that this could have influenced the estimates of diagnostic accuracy of BNP. Thus, these values should be considered exploratory only. Second, the gold standard for the CP and RCM diagnosis varied across studies. However, the diagnostic yield of these methods is reasonably adequate to diagnose these disorders. Third, the effect of other factors (age, obesity, atrial fibrillation, and diuretic therapy) that could affect the determination of natriuretic peptides have not been adequately evaluated in the included studies. Fourth, women were underrepresented across included studies. Thus, our results may not generalizable to the female population. Fifth, heterogeneity was moderate for pooled BNP levels across studies. Finally, given that our study included a small sample size for BNP and NT‐proBNP assays, limiting the generalizability of our findings.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic use — measurement of natriuretic peptides is guideline-endorsed, but BNP-guided treatment has mixed outcome effects; in GUIDE-IT, NT-proBNP-guided therapy did not improve outcomes versus usual care, and target attainment of NT-proBNP < 1000 pg/mL was similar between arms. Guidelines "provide a Class I recommendation for measuring BNP or NT-proBNP for diagnosis or prognosis assessment in the management of chronic HF", and the GUIDE-IT multicenter randomized trial in high-risk HFrEF compared NT-proBNP-guided therapy with optimal medical therapy but "failed to show a benefit of NT-proBNP-guided therapy over usual care", with "no significant difference in the proportions of patients achieving the target of NT-proBNP < 1000 pg/mL at 12 months". A GUIDE-IT substudy found that "patients with NT-proBNP levels less than 1000 pg/mL 90 days after randomization had better outcomes, regardless of achieved GDMT". Contemporary guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) additions — "ARNIs, sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and ivabradine" — have shown clinical benefit accompanied by "reductions in NT-proBNP/BNP levels".

### Evaluation of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels in normal and preeclamptic women [^116tfMVS]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is synthesized in cardiac ventricles in response to volume expansion. This study evaluated BNP levels to determine trends during pregnancy, and to assess BNP as a diagnostic tool in preeclampsia.

Study Design

We studied 163 BNP levels in 118 pregnant women, ranging from first trimester to term. An additional 34 patients with preeclampsia were studied and compared to 25 normal control patients at term. Plasma BNP values were determined using a standard assay.

Results

The median BNP levels during the 1st, 2nd, 3rd trimester, and at term were equivalent (18.4, 17.9, 15.5, and 17.8 pg/mL, respectively, P = .796). The median BNP levels in normal patients, mild preeclamptics, and severe preeclamptics were 17.8, 21.1, and 101 pg/mL, respectively, with the severe group being significantly higher than the mild group (P = .003) and any phase of normal pregnancy (P < .001 in each case). A BNP cut-off of < 40.6 pg/mL had a negative predictive value of 92% in excluding preeclampsia.

Conclusion

In normal pregnancies, median BNP values are < 20 pg/mL, and stable throughout gestation. In severe preeclampsia BNP levels are elevated. This may reflect ventricular stress and/or subclinical cardiac dysfunction associated with preeclampsia.

### Long-term prognosis, subsequent pregnancy, contraception and overall management of peripartum cardiomyopathy: practical guidance paper from the heart failure association of the European Society of Cardiology study group on peripartum cardiomyopathy [^116uh8Dw]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy is an idiopathic cardiomyopathy presenting with heart failure secondary to left ventricular systolic dysfunction towards the end of pregnancy or in the months following delivery, where no other cause for heart failure is identified. Outcome varies from full recovery to residual left ventricular systolic dysfunction and even death. Many women return to their physician to acquire information on their long-term prognosis, to seek medical advice regarding contraception, or when planning a subsequent pregnancy. This position paper summarizes current evidence for long-term outcome, risk stratification of further pregnancies and overall management. Based on the best available evidence, as well as the clinical experience of the European Society of Cardiology Study Group on Peripartum Cardiomyopathy members, a consensus on pre- and postpartum management algorithms for women undergoing a subsequent pregnancy is presented.

### Prospective observational study of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels in obese and nonobese women during pregnancy [^114eM3rv]. American Journal of Perinatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a marker of ventricular dysfunction, varies by body mass index (BMI) outside of pregnancy. This study aimed to determine whether obesity affects NT-proBNP levels in pregnancy.

Study Design

This was a prospective observational study of healthy pregnant people in the third trimester (3TM) and postpartum (PP). Patients were excluded if they had significant medical comorbidities or if their fetuses had anomalies, growth restriction or aneuploidy. NT-proBNP was measured at 28 weeks (3TM), predelivery (PD), 1 to 2 days PP (immediate postpartum [IPP]), and 4 to 6 weeks PP (delayed postpartum [DPP]). LogNT-proBNP levels were analyzed using linear mixed effects models, including BMI < or ≥ 30, time, and time-by-BMI interactions.

Results

Fifty-five people (28 [51%] with BMI ≥ 30 and 27 [49%] with BMI < 30) were enrolled. A greater proportion of obese than nonobese subjects developed hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (50 vs. 15%, p = 0.010) and obese patients had higher systolic blood pressures at all time points (p < 0.05). NT-proBNP levels (median [interquartile range] in pg/mL) were 18 (6–28) versus 26 (17–48) at 3TM, 16 (3–38) versus 43 (21–60) at PD, 58 (20–102) versus 63 (38–155) at IPP, and 33 (27–56) versus 23 (8–42) at DPP for obese compared with nonobese patients. In linear mixed effects models, logNT-proBNP was lower in obese patients at 3TM (β = -0.89 [95% confidence interval, CI: -1.51, -0.26]) and PD (β = -1.05 [95% CI: -1.72, -0.38]). The logNT-proBNP trends over time differed by BMI category, with higher values in obese patients at both PP time points compared with the 3TM (IPP β = 1.24 [95% CI: 0.75, 1.73]; DPP β = 1.08 [95% CI: 0.52, 1.63]), but only IPP for nonobese patients (β = 0.87 [95% CI: 0.36, 1.38]).

Conclusion

Obese patients had lower NT-proBNP levels than nonobese patients during pregnancy but not PP. The prolonged PP elevation in NT-proBNP in obese patients suggests that their PP cardiac recovery may be more prolonged.

Key Points

· NT-proBNP levels are lower in obese than nonobese patients during pregnancy. · Levels remain elevated in obese, but not nonobese, patients up to 4 to 6 weeks' postpartum. · A lower threshold for concern regarding NT-proBNP levels may be needed in obese pregnant people.

Journal of Cardiac Failure (2023). High credibility.

Therapeutic approach using natriuretic peptides in heart failure — It is easy to understand the logic for measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP as a support of clinical judgement, and both are unmistakably prognostic in acute and chronic heart failure; however, ambiguity and ambivalence remain regarding how to alter treatment based on abnormal concentrations. In acute heart failure, post-treatment natriuretic peptide values may inform alternative treatment strategies, but such strategies have not been validated. In chronic heart failure, lower NT-proBNP concentrations are linked to superior outcomes and reversal of cardiac remodeling, yet an algorithmic biomarker-based outpatient treatment approach remains elusive. Addition of other biomarkers such as ANP, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin, or soluble ST2 to NT-proBNP or BNP may help to better understand underlying pathophysiology and risk in chronic heart failure.

2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA heart failure guideline — use of biomarkers for prevention, initial diagnosis, and risk stratification states the following recommendations: In patients presenting with dyspnea, measurement of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is useful to support a diagnosis or exclusion of heart failure (HF) (1 A). In patients with chronic HF, measurements of BNP or NT-proBNP levels are recommended for risk stratification (1 A). In patients hospitalized for HF, measurement of BNP or NT-proBNP levels at admission is recommended to establish prognosis (1 A). In patients at risk of developing HF, BNP or NT-proBNP–based screening followed by team-based care, including a cardiovascular specialist, can be useful to prevent the development of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction or new-onset HF (2a B-R). In patients hospitalized for HF, a predischarge BNP or NT-proBNP level can be useful to inform the trajectory of the patient and establish a postdischarge prognosis (2a B-NR).

### 2020 ACC / AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115TYAoF]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

ACC/AHA native valvular heart disease — pre-pregnancy intervention planning: In symptomatic women with severe VHD who are considering pregnancy, intervention before pregnancy is recommended on the basis of standard indications. In women who require a valve intervention before pregnancy, the choice of prosthetic valve should be based on a shared decision-making process that accounts for the patient's values and preferences, including discussion of the risks of mechanical valves during pregnancy and the reduced durability of bioprosthetic valves in young women. In asymptomatic women with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS) (mitral valve area ≤ 1.5 cm2; Stage C1) who are considering pregnancy, percutaneous balloon mitral commissurotomy (PMBC) at a Comprehensive Valve Center is reasonable before pregnancy for those who have favorable valve morphology. In women of childbearing age who require valve replacement, bioprosthetic valves are preferred over mechanical valves because of the increased maternal and fetal risks of mechanical heart valves in pregnancy. In asymptomatic women with severe aortic stenosis (AS) (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, Stage C1) who are considering pregnancy, valve intervention before pregnancy is reasonable. In asymptomatic women with severe AS (aortic velocity ≥ 4.0 m/s or mean pressure gradient ≥ 40 mm Hg, Stage C1) who are considering pregnancy, do not meet COR 1 criteria for intervention, and have a preconception evaluation confirming the absence of symptoms (including normal exercise stress testing and serum BNP measurements), medical management during pregnancy may be considered to avoid prosthetic valve replacement. In asymptomatic women with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) (Stage C1) and a valve suitable for repair who are considering pregnancy, valve repair before pregnancy at a Comprehensive Valve Center may be considered but only after detailed discussion with the patient about the risks and benefits of the surgery and its effect on future pregnancies.

### The association between postpartum aspirin use and NT-proBNP levels as a marker for maternal cardiac health: a randomized-controlled trial [^114Ah7m8]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare levels of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a marker of cardiac strain, and clinical outcomes in patients at risk of preeclampsia randomized to continuation of low-dose aspirin (LDA) versus placebo for 6 weeks postpartum.

Study Design

This double-blinded randomized-controlled trial included patients at risk of preeclampsia randomized in a 1:1 fashion to LDA (81 mg) versus placebo for 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome was NT-proBNP levels at the postpartum visit. A sample size of 90 was required to detect a clinically significant difference in NT-proBNP between LDA and placebo with 80% power. A sample size of 110 subjects was planned due to anticipated loss to follow-up in the postpartum period. Pre-specified secondary outcomes were postpartum preeclampsia, eclampsia, hospital readmission, initiation or titration of blood pressure medications, and blood transfusion. The primary outcome was compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Secondary outcomes are reported as counts (%) and were compared using Fisher's exact test after adjusting for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction.

Results

From July 2023 to May 2024, 110 participants were randomly assigned to LDA (n = 55) or placebo (n = 55). Baseline demographics were similar between groups. There was no difference in the primary outcome of NT-proBNP levels between groups (median (IQR), 36.5 ng/mL (36.0, 61.0) vs. 39.5 ng/mL ((36.0, 74.0), p = 0.49). Rates of postpartum preeclampsia in patients randomized to LDA vs. placebo (5.6% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.32) were numerically but not statistically significantly lower, with similar rates of hospital readmission and bleeding complications. There were no cases of postpartum eclampsia or blood transfusion.

Conclusions

Continuation of LDA after delivery was not associated with decreased NT-proBNP levels compared to placebo. Additional studies powered to detect differences in maternal outcomes are needed to evaluate the role of LDA in the postpartum period.

### BNP and congestive heart failure [^111HiKKp]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a peptide hormone secreted chiefly by ventricular myocytes, plays a key role in volume homeostasis. The plasma concentration of BNP is raised in various pathological states, especially heart failure. Many studies suggest that measurement of plasma BNP has clinical utility for excluding a diagnosis of heart failure in patients with dyspnea or fluid retention and for providing prognostic information in those with heart failure or other cardiac disease. It may also be of value in identifying patients after myocardial infarction in whom further assessment of cardiac function is likely to be worthwhile. Preliminary evidence suggests that measuring the plasma concentration of BNP may be useful in fine tuning therapy for heart failure. Artificially raising the circulating levels of BNP shows considerable promise as a treatment for heart failure. With simpler assay methods now available, it is likely that many physicians will measure plasma BNP to aid them in the diagnosis, risk stratification, and monitoring of their patients with heart failure or other cardiac dysfunction.

### Application of the American Heart Association / American college of cardiology / Heart Failure Society of America heart failure staging guidelines in adults with chronic kidney disease [^113Gg5eR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2) has been shown to be independently associated with nearly doubling in the risk of incident heart failure (HF). Patients with both CKD and HF have substantially higher rates of HF hospitalization, more rapid loss of kidney function, and higher mortality risk than those with either disease alone. Improved strategies to aid in diagnosis and to guide prognostication and treatment in these populations is of high value. The 2013 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure proposed a staging system to diagnose HF in all people. These HF stages range from: healthy, stage A (presence of HF risk factors), stage B (asymptomatic structural heart disease or pre‐HF), stage C (symptomatic HF), and stage D (symptomatic HF requiring advanced therapies) and are intended to help clinicians prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with HF (Figure 1).

Figure 1
2013 and 2022 HF staging criteria using American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Heart Failure Society of America Guidelines for the Management of Heart Failure.

*High‐sensitivity troponin ≥ 10 ng/L in women and ≥ 15 ng/L in men and N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide ≥ 125 pg/mL. BNP indicates B‐type natriuretic peptide; EF, ejection fraction; HF, heart failure; LAD, left atrial dilation; and LVH, left ventricular hypertrophy.

These guidelines were recently updated in 2022 to include the use of cardiac biomarkers with proposed thresholds of troponin (hsTnT [high‐sensitivity troponin T]) ≥ 10 ng/L in women and ≥ 15 ng/L in men and NT‐proBNP (N‐terminal pro‐B‐type natriuretic peptide) ≥ 125 pg/mL in stage B HF. Although these are proposed biomarker thresholds, the guidelines caution interpretation in people with CKD, leaving uncertainty in their application in a significant and growing population of at‐risk individuals world‐wide.

Heart failure prevention — BNP screening trial (STOP-HF): In patients at risk of HF (identified by hypertension, diabetes, or known vascular disease) without established left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction or symptomatic HF at baseline, screening with B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and intervening on those with levels ≥ 50 pg/ mL (echocardiography and referral to a cardiovascular specialist) reduced a composite endpoint of asymptomatic LV dysfunction.

Significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of peripartum cardiomyopathy, especially hormonal and genetic mechanisms, has been made. Specific criteria should be used for diagnosis, but the disease remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Both long-term and recurrent pregnancy prognoses depend on recovery of cardiac function. Data from large registries and randomized controlled trials of evidence-based therapeutics hold promise for future improved clinical outcomes.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114fNnMj]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) family planning — Patients with PPCM whose ventricular function does not normalize should be counseled against a subsequent pregnancy because it carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality; even with normalized ventricular function, women with a history of PPCM should be counseled that a subsequent pregnancy carries a 20% risk of recurrent HF and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and dobutamine stress testing has been recommended in women with apparent recovery of LV function who are considering a pregnancy to assess contractile reserve and further risk stratify recurrence potential, but this has not been validated prospectively.

### Current diagnostic and treatment strategies for specific dilated cardiomyopathies: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^113HtxLo]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Key treatment strategies for peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) — Consensus recommendations state that guideline-directed medical therapy known to benefit patients with LV dysfunction and HF should be considered, taking into account pregnancy and breastfeeding safety (Level of Evidence B); the duration of standard HF medications in PPCM should be indefinite when LV function fails to normalize (Level of Evidence C); and patients whose ventricular function does not normalize after pregnancy should be counseled against a subsequent pregnancy because it carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality (Level of Evidence B). The list also states that cardiac device therapy with an ICD, CRT, or both should be considered.
