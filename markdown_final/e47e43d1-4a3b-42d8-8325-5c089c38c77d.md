## Question

Causes of. Elevated BiiRubin.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of elevated bilirubin, organized by pathophysiology and with a practical diagnostic approach. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the bilirubin metabolism pathway to anchor the differential. Then, I should categorize etiologies into pre-hepatic, hepatic, and post-hepatic causes. Next, I will consider special populations such as neonates, ICU patients, and those on specific drugs. After that, I should outline a stepwise diagnostic algorithm including fractionation, labs, and imaging. Finally, I will flag red flags and prognosis to guide urgency and follow-up, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and key reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational physiology so I don't jump to conclusions. Bilirubin is generated from heme catabolism, circulates as water-insoluble unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin bound to albumin, undergoes hepatic uptake and conjugation by UGT1A1, and is excreted into bile as conjugated (direct) bilirubin; any disruption in production, uptake, conjugation, or excretion can raise measured total bilirubin, so I need to keep these steps in mind as I classify causes [^112RBbyZ] [^113iG5vj].

> I will now examine pre-hepatic causes, where overproduction of unconjugated bilirubin outpaces hepatic processing. Hemolysis is the classic driver, whether intravascular or extravascular, and can be due to autoimmune hemolysis, hemoglobinopathies, enzyme defects, or transfusion reactions; ineffective erythropoiesis and large hematoma resorption also contribute, and in these settings the direct fraction is typically normal or only mildly elevated, so I should double-check for anemia, reticulocytosis, and hemolysis labs when indirect bilirubin predominates [^114qp9im] [^113iG5vj]. Wait, let me verify the neonatal angle: in newborns, hemolysis from DAT-positive isoimmunization or G6PD deficiency increases bilirubin production and neurotoxicity risk, so early jaundice within 24 hours should trigger a hemolysis workup and closer monitoring per AAP guidance [^115ebwvN] [^114gTqHs] [^115HX92y].

> Next, I should review hepatic causes, and I need to separate impaired conjugation from hepatocellular injury and cholestasis. Gilbert syndrome is common and benign, with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia that can rise with fasting or intercurrent illness. Crigler–Najjar syndromes represent severe UGT1A1 deficiency and can cause marked indirect hyperbilirubinemia with risk of encephalopathy in type I, so I should confirm normal liver enzymes and consider genotyping if the pattern fits [^113iG5vj] [^1149keDS]. Hold on, I should verify drug effects: protease inhibitors like atazanavir and indinavir can elevate unconjugated bilirubin via UGT1A1 and transporter inhibition, and newer data suggest OATP1B1/3 inhibition may be a major contributor with atazanavir, so I must distinguish expected benign hyperbilirubinemia from hepatotoxicity when evaluating these patients [^112yic8T] [^116p7H8H] [^111MNhHv].

> For conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, I need to ensure I'm thinking cholestasis or hepatocellular injury rather than overproduction. Viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis, ischemic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, and infiltrative diseases can all impair excretion and cause a direct-predominant pattern. I should confirm this with cholestatic enzyme elevations and appropriate serologies, and remember that in drug development, Hy's Law signals serious hepatotoxic risk when ALT exceeds 3× ULN with bilirubin above 2× ULN without another cause [^114qp9im] [^111AfHzz]. But wait, what if the cholestasis is intrahepatic rather than extrahepatic? Primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, sepsis-associated cholestasis, TPN cholestasis, and benign postoperative jaundice can all raise direct bilirubin, so I should correlate with GGT, imaging, and clinical context before labeling it obstructive [^114Kk3U6] [^113BpbEZ].

> Now, I will consider post-hepatic obstruction, because missing a surgically correctable cause would be a mistake. Extrahepatic biliary obstruction from choledocholithiasis, malignant biliary obstruction, strictures, or AIDS cholangiopathy typically produces a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia with dilated ducts on imaging; I should confirm with right upper quadrant ultrasound first and escalate to MRCP or ERCP if ductal dilation is present or suspicion remains high [^114qp9im] [^113BpbEZ]. Hold on, I should verify that an isolated alkaline phosphatase rise gets confirmed as hepatic with GGT before I chase obstruction, to avoid misclassification [^114Kk3U6].

> Let me think about special populations, starting with neonates, because the threshold for action differs. Physiologic jaundice is common and unconjugated, but jaundice within 24 hours, a rapid rise in bilirubin, or persistence beyond 2 weeks in formula-fed or 3–4 weeks in breastfed infants mandates measurement of total and direct bilirubin to exclude cholestasis; a direct bilirubin above 1.0 mg/dL is abnormal and warrants urgent evaluation for biliary atresia and other causes [^116ESYnj]. I should double-check for hemolysis using DAT and clinical risk factors, and use phototherapy or exchange transfusion per AAP thresholds to prevent bilirubin neurotoxicity, especially when hemolysis is present [^114gTqHs] [^111y5X1n].

> In the ICU, I need to ensure I'm not overlooking multifactorial etiologies. Sepsis-associated cholestasis, ischemic hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and parenteral nutrition are frequent culprits, and bilirubin serves as a stable marker of liver dysfunction and prognosis; however, I should confirm that early bilirubin kinetics may lag in ischemic injury, so integrating clinical context and other markers is essential [^115JuCqn] [^1168E8GG]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought bilirubin would reliably rise early in shock liver, but I should correct that: bilirubin can be a late marker in hypoxic liver injury, so indocyanine green clearance or other functional tests may outperform bilirubin early on in that specific phenotype [^115JuCqn].

> I should also review drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia more broadly, because not all cases reflect true hepatotoxicity. Some agents raise bilirubin by enzyme or transporter inhibition without hepatocellular injury, whereas others fulfill Hy's Law and signal severe DILI. Careful medication reconciliation, fractionation, and correlation with ALT, AST, and ALP help me distinguish benign bilirubin elevations from dangerous drug effects and guide continuation or discontinuation decisions [^111AfHzz] [^111xNTs2]. Hold on, I should verify specific labels too: atazanavir commonly causes unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia via UGT1A1 and transporter effects, and abiraterone carries explicit monitoring and interruption rules for hepatotoxicity, which I should apply rigorously in practice [^112yic8T] [^115TGHKN].

> Next, I should review a pragmatic diagnostic algorithm so I don't miss key steps. First, fractionate total bilirubin into direct and indirect; predominant indirect hyperbilirubinemia pushes me toward hemolysis or impaired conjugation, whereas predominant direct hyperbilirubinemia points to hepatocellular disease or cholestasis/obstruction, prompting early imaging if direct bilirubin is elevated [^113iG5vj] [^113BpbEZ]. I need to check CBC, reticulocytes, LDH, and haptoglobin for hemolysis; AST, ALT, ALP, and GGT for liver injury pattern; PT/INR and albumin for synthetic function; and then tailor serologies and autoimmune markers based on the pattern and history, escalating to ultrasound and MRCP/ERCP or liver biopsy when indicated [^114Kk3U6] [^113BpbEZ]. If the patient is on atazanavir and has isolated indirect hyperbilirubinemia with normal enzymes, I should confirm that this fits expected pharmacokinetics rather than liver injury before changing therapy [^112yic8T] [^116p7H8H].

> I should confirm red flags that mandate urgent action so I don't under-triage. Acute liver failure features such as INR above 1.5 with encephalopathy, rapidly rising bilirubin with transaminase surges, or a Hy's Law pattern during drug therapy warrant immediate hepatology consultation and transplant center referral; in neonates, early jaundice, a bilirubin rise exceeding 0.3 mg/dL/hour in the first day or 0.2 mg/dL/hour thereafter, or any direct bilirubin above 1.0 mg/dL should trigger expedited evaluation and treatment to prevent neurotoxicity [^114Kk3U6] [^111AfHzz] [^114gTqHs] [^116ESYnj]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not overcalling obstruction solely on bilirubin; ductal dilation on imaging plus cholestatic enzymes strengthens the case for mechanical obstruction and the need for ERCP or intervention [^113BpbEZ].

> Finally, I need to ensure I contextualize prognosis and benign variants. Gilbert syndrome is prevalent and benign, though it can accentuate drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia. Conversely, in cirrhosis and ACLF, hyperbilirubinemia reflects synthetic failure and correlates with poor outcomes, so I should interpret the same number very differently depending on the clinical context and trajectory [^113iG5vj] [^1147pTFE]. Let me reconsider any temptation to ascribe antioxidant benefits to elevated bilirubin in adults. While observational data suggest inverse associations with cardiometabolic risk, confounding is likely, so I should avoid overinterpreting bilirubin as causal and focus on the underlying liver or hematologic disease driving the elevation [^116eTuuz].

Elevated bilirubin (hyperbilirubinemia) results from **increased production** (hemolysis, hematoma resorption), **impaired conjugation** (Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar, neonatal immaturity), or **reduced excretion** (hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, biliary obstruction, sepsis, drugs) [^112RBbyZ] [^113iG5vj]. Evaluation should start with **fractionated bilirubin** [^113iG5vj], liver enzymes, and a **CBC** [^115Txxj6] to distinguish unconjugated from conjugated causes, then proceed to imaging and targeted tests based on results [^113BpbEZ]. Management is cause-specific: treat hemolysis, remove offending drugs, relieve obstruction, or address liver disease; neonatal jaundice requires risk-based phototherapy and exchange transfusion when indicated [^111y5X1n] [^111nx2o9].

---

## Physiological basis of bilirubin metabolism

Bilirubin is a **yellow pigment** derived from heme breakdown [^112RBbyZ]; it circulates as unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, which is water-insoluble and albumin-bound, and is converted in the liver to water-soluble conjugated (direct) bilirubin via UGT1A1 before excretion into bile [^112RBbyZ]. Disruption at production, conjugation, or excretion can cause hyperbilirubinemia [^113iG5vj].

---

## Classification of hyperbilirubinemia

Hyperbilirubinemia is classified as **unconjugated (indirect)** [^113iG5vj], **conjugated (direct)** [^113BpbEZ], or **mixed**, based on the predominant fraction [^113BpbEZ].

| **Type** | **Mechanism** | **Common causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Unconjugated | Increased production or impaired conjugation | - Hemolysis <br/> - Gilbert syndrome <br/> - Crigler-Najjar <br/> - Neonatal immaturity [^113iG5vj] [^112RBbyZ] |
| Conjugated | Reduced excretion or hepatocellular injury | - Hepatitis <br/> - Cholestasis <br/> - Biliary obstruction <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - Drug-induced liver injury [^113iG5vj] [^113BpbEZ] |
| Mixed | Combination of mechanisms | - Severe liver disease <br/> - Sepsis <br/> - Advanced biliary obstruction [^notfound] |

## Causes of elevated bilirubin

### Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia reflects **increased production** or **impaired conjugation** [^113iG5vj].

- **Hemolysis**: Autoimmune, hereditary, or acquired hemolytic anemias increase bilirubin load [^112WABNi].
- **Gilbert syndrome**: Mild UGT1A1 deficiency causing benign fluctuations, especially with fasting or stress [^113iG5vj].
- **Crigler-Najjar syndrome**: Severe UGT1A1 deficiency (type I) or milder forms (type II) [^notfound].
- **Neonatal jaundice**: Immature conjugation and increased hemolysis in newborns [^111qYedE].
- **Resorption of large hematomas**: Increased bilirubin load from RBC breakdown [^114qp9im].

---

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia

Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia reflects **impaired excretion** or **hepatocellular injury** [^113iG5vj].

- **Hepatitis**: Viral (HBV, HCV), alcoholic, autoimmune, or drug-induced [^1155asMt].
- **Cholestasis**: Intrahepatic (PBC, PSC) or extrahepatic (gallstones, strictures, tumors) [^114qp9im].
- **Sepsis**: Cholestasis and hepatocellular injury from systemic infection [^115JuCqn].
- **Drug-induced liver injury**: Direct toxicity or cholestatic injury [^112yic8T].
- **Inherited disorders**: Dubin-Johnson and Rotor syndromes (impaired canalicular excretion) [^1149keDS].

---

### Mixed hyperbilirubinemia

Mixed hyperbilirubinemia reflects combined mechanisms, typically in **severe liver disease**, **advanced biliary obstruction**, or **sepsis** [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnostic approach

A structured approach begins with **history, examination, and laboratory testing** [^115Txxj6].

- **Fractionated bilirubin**: Differentiate unconjugated vs conjugated [^113iG5vj].
- **Liver enzymes**: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT to assess hepatocellular vs cholestatic injury [^1155asMt].
- **Complete blood count**: Evaluate hemolysis or anemia [^112XLmib].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound, CT, or MRCP for obstruction or structural disease [^115Txxj6].
- **Additional tests**: Viral serologies, autoimmune markers, genetic testing as indicated [^1155asMt].

---

## Clinical significance and complications

Elevated bilirubin signals underlying disease; **unconjugated bilirubin** can cross the blood-brain barrier and cause kernicterus in neonates [^111B5Tyb], whereas **conjugated hyperbilirubinemia** reflects hepatobiliary disease and may progress to liver failure if untreated [^113iG5vj].

---

## Management strategies

Management targets the **underlying cause**:

- **Hemolysis**: Treat the cause, transfuse as needed, phototherapy for neonates [^117DmQNe].
- **Gilbert syndrome**: Reassurance, avoid triggers [^117C8yTD].
- **Hepatitis**: Antivirals, immunosuppression, or supportive care [^notfound].
- **Cholestasis/obstruction**: Relieve obstruction (ERCP, surgery), treat underlying disease [^112qi7TB].
- **Drug-induced injury**: Stop offending agent, supportive care [^115Q7rVJ].

---

Elevated bilirubin reflects disturbances in production, conjugation, or excretion; a **stepwise evaluation** with fractionated bilirubin, liver enzymes, and imaging guides diagnosis and management, with treatment tailored to the cause [^112RBbyZ].

### Jaundice in the intensive care unit [^1168E8GG]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia, or jaundice, is common in the ICU, with incidence up to 40% among critically ill patients. Unfortunately, it is poorly understood in the critically ill, and too often presents a diagnostic dilemma to the ICU physician. Causes of jaundice in the ICU are multiple; the etiology in any given patient, multifactorial. Acute jaundice can be a harbinger or marker of sepsis, multisystem organ failure (MSOF), or a reflection of transient hypotension (shock liver), right-sided heart failure, the metabolic breakdown of red blood cells, or pharmacologic toxicity. Acute ICU jaundice is best divided into obstructive and nonobstructive. This stratification directs subsequent management and therapeutic decisions.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, AAP 2022 guidelines recommend to measure total serum bilirubin if the transcutaneous bilirubin exceeds or is within 3 mg/dL of the phototherapy treatment threshold or if the transcutaneous bilirubin is ≥ 15 mg/dL.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^115SQBtF]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Synthesis of results

Results from all of the studies were pooled to provide rate estimates of categorical and specific etiologies of cholestasis. Rate estimates for etiologic categories were calculated from the number of subjects used in the entire review. Rate estimates for specific infectious and metabolic etiologies used the total number of subjects reported with specific infectious and metabolic disorders as the denominator.

Sources of bias across studies

Variability in diagnostic evaluations and the potential for overestimation of INH represent possible sources for bias. The identification of multiple etiologies in individual patients as well as inconsistencies and vagaries in nomenclature were potential sources of error when studies were combined. In some cases, delayed clinical presentation may have affected diagnostic accuracy.

### Association between elevated serum bilirubin levels with preserved lung function under conditions of exposure to air pollution [^116Mp5pG]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main finding of this study is the positive association between total serum bilirubin concentrations and lung function in subjects exposed to elevated levels of air pollution. Our relatively large study sample (n = 15,605) was comprised of apparently healthy individuals residing in a major metropolitan area, supporting the likelihood that our findings are applicable to other large urban areas worldwide.

Our results of elevated serum bilirubin levels being associated with improved lung function are compatible with the findings in Swiss and South Korean populations that also described positive associations between serum bilirubin levels and lung function in healthy populations. Moreover, there was an association between a lower risk of respiratory disease and all-cause mortality in patients with normal-range bilirubin levels, while relatively higher levels of bilirubin were associated with a lower risk of respiratory diseases. In another study, bilirubin levels were associated with a longer 6-min walk distance and a better quality of life.

Bilirubin is known as a potential antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties. Elevated bilirubin levels have cytoprotective properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative effects. These effects seem to be mediated by an elevated heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) activity which may be moderated by genetic variations or environmental factors. The role of HO-1 in correlation with the environment was shown in some other studies as well. Moreover, environmental cadmium moderates diabetes type 2 through HO-1 activity and the effect of environmental toxins, such as cigarette smoke, silica, and asbestos on different lung diseases seem to be mediated by bilirubin derivate HO-1. In contrast to all of these studies that correlated bilirubin with the environment or the effect of bilirubin on functional parameters of respiration, we extended these investigations and looked at how bilirubin levels and pulmonary function test findings were correlated to environmental pollutants.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes / transporters [^111AfHzz]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Bilirubin, the product of heme breakdown from red blood cells, is exclusively eliminated by the liver. Thus, circulating bilirubin is widely used as a diagnostic biomarker for liver function. Large postmarketing studies of patients with drug‐induced liver injury (DILI) show that ∼10% of subjects with hyperbilirubinemia or jaundice die or require a liver transplant. 1, 2, 3 In the setting of a clinical trial of a new drug candidate, elevations in serum bilirubin may also indicate severe liver injury with global hepatic dysfunction. The 2009 US Food and Drug Administration guidance on assessing liver safety in clinical trials defines the "Hy's Law Case" as a trial subject who experiences a hepatocellular injury with concomitant elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3× the upper limit of normal (ULN) and serum total bilirubin (TB) elevation > 2× ULN when there is no more likely cause than the study drug. The existence of Hy's Law Cases in a clinical trial database is interpreted as indicating that the study drug is capable of causing liver failure, a conclusion that can lead to termination of the development program, requirement of extended clinical trials to assess risk management strategies, or restricted indications. Therefore, the observation of hyperbilirubinemia during clinical trials or postmarketing can raise concern about irreversible liver injury with serious regulatory consequences.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^116ESYnj]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

KAS 9 — evaluation of prolonged jaundice: For breastfed infants who are still jaundiced at 3 to 4 weeks of age, and for formula-fed infants who are still jaundiced at 2 weeks of age, the total and direct-reacting (or conjugated) bilirubin concentrations should be measured to identify possible pathologic cholestasis (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Recommendation). A direct serum bilirubin concentration > 1.0 mg/dL is defined as abnormal, whereas a cutoff of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL has been used for conjugated bilirubin; nearly all (> 99%) infants with a single elevation of direct or conjugated bilirubin do not have biliary atresia, and the positive predictive value can be greatly improved with a repeat measurement within a few days to 2 weeks. A direct bilirubin concentration of > 20% of the total is no longer regarded as necessary for the diagnosis of cholestasis. When prolonged jaundice occurs, clinicians should also review the newborn screening results, and in formula-fed infants with any prolonged jaundice, or in breastfed infants with direct or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, consultation with a gastroenterologist or other expert is recommended.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^115ebwvN]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia management — KAS 4 directs: "All infants should be visually assessed for jaundice at least every 12 hours following delivery until discharge. TSB or TcB should be measured as soon as possible for infants noted to be jaundiced < 24 hours after birth" (Aggregate Evidence Quality Grade X, Strong Recommendation). The rationale notes that onset of jaundice within 24 h of birth is more likely to be caused by hemolysis and to need treatment, and that the benefits are likely to exceed harms, especially in the first 24 h. Potential harms include that assessment can interfere with sleep and disturb the infant and family members, and parents may have preferences regarding frequency or timing as long as examinations occur at least every 12 h.

### NASPGHAN guidelines for training in pediatric gastroenterology [^115yJQHk]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Medium credibility.

NASPGHAN hepatology training — importance and medical knowledge emphasize that because diseases of the liver and biliary tract have a significant impact on children, trainees in pediatric gastroenterology should have comprehensive exposure to the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders, their complications, and their pathophysiology; trainees should understand the normal structure and function of the liver and biliary tree and the prevalence, natural history, age-appropriate differential diagnoses, and genetic and other risk factors of hepatobiliary disorders; caring for children with hepatobiliary disease requires understanding of both common and rare causes including infectious, metabolic, genetic, anatomic, immunologic, and toxic; trainees should understand varying clinical manifestations including issues unique to pediatric hepatobiliary disorders (eg, effects on growth, nutrition, puberty, psychosocial functioning); and trainees also should have a complete understanding of diagnostic criteria that distinguish liver and biliary diseases with common patterns of presentation (eg, cholestasis, neonatal cholestasis, elevated aminotransferases, hepatomegaly, hepatosplenomegaly, acute liver failure, direct or indirect hyperbilirubinemia, ascites) including differences in affected populations, results of laboratory evaluations, histopathology, radiologic studies, and disease course.

### Cannabidiol (Epidiolex) [^117AbP9B]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Monitoring

In general, transaminase elevations of greater than 3 times the ULN in the presence of elevated bilirubin without an alternative explanation are an important predictor of severe liver injury. Early identification of elevated liver enzymes may decrease the risk of a serious outcome. Patients with elevated baseline transaminase levels above 3 times the ULN, accompanied by elevations in bilirubin above 2 times the ULN, should be evaluated prior to initiation of EPIDIOLEX treatment.

Prior to starting treatment with EPIDIOLEX, obtain serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin levels. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should be obtained at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months after initiation of treatment with EPIDIOLEX, and periodically thereafter or as clinically indicated. Serum transaminases and total bilirubin levels should also be obtained within 1 month following changes in EPIDIOLEX dosage and addition of or changes in medications that are known to impact the liver. Consider more frequent monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin in patients who are taking valproate or who have elevated liver enzymes at baseline.

If a patient develops clinical signs or symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction (e.g., unexplained nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine), promptly measure serum transaminases and total bilirubin and interrupt or discontinue treatment with EPIDIOLEX, as appropriate. Discontinue EPIDIOLEX in any patients with elevations of transaminase levels greater than 3 times the ULN and bilirubin levels greater than 2 times the ULN. Patients with sustained transaminase elevations of greater than 5 times the ULN should also have treatment discontinued. Patients with prolonged elevations of serum transaminases should be evaluated for other possible causes. Consider dosage adjustment of any coadministered medication that is known to affect the liver (e.g., valproate and clobazam).

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^111cQhJw]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Higher serum bilirubin within the normal range may be associated with lower mortality and risk of COPD exacerbations, a reduced incidence in COPD diagnosis and improved lung function Interventional trials are needed to test if medications that raise serum bilirubin levels can safely improve COPD outcomes.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia [^112GAG71]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

The majority of newborns is affected by jaundice after birth. While most jaundice is physiologic, severe hyperbilirubinemia can lead to serious complications, such as chronic bilirubin encephalopathy. Hyperbilirubinemia typically results from increased bilirubin production, impaired clearance, excessive reabsorption, or a combination of these factors. Systematic risk assessment and screening are recommended for all infants to prevent neurologic injury from hyperbilirubinemia. Infants born prematurely and those with risk factors for bilirubin neurotoxicity warrant closer monitoring. Phototherapy is usually effective in lowering bilirubin levels, and exchange transfusion is rarely performed.

Results and discussion

Study selection

The results of the literature search are shown in the Fig. 1. Searches of Medline and EMBASE databases yielded 193 references. An additional 44 citations were found by extensively searching the bibliographies of selected articles. From the 237 studies identified, 180 studies were excluded after a cursory review of the title, abstract, and, when necessary, the results section. The full text of the remaining 57 articles was reviewed in detail. Forty of the remaining studies were excluded: 11 reports failed to report specific diagnoses; 6 reports had inclusion criteria that were too narrow; 6 reports included patients without conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; 6 reports were not case series or cohort studies; 5 reports had subjects with previously identified disease processes; 2 failed to include a detailed clinical evaluation; 1 each had vague inclusion criteria, non-consecutive patients, included the same patient population from another selected study, or had a sample size of less than 10. The remaining 17 studies comprise this review.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^112vix3M]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and higher serum bilirubin levels have been associated with improved COPD outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the association between serum bilirubin levels and lung function (FEV 1), prevalence/incidence of COPD, acute exacerbations of COPD, respiratory health status, and mortality.

Methods

MEDLINE® and Embase were searched using Ovid® (search updated October 1st, 2019). We included studies that measured serum bilirubin levels and outcomes of interest in adults with or without underlying lung disease. We excluded studies of those with liver disease or drug-induced elevations in bilirubin. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa scale to assess individual study risk of bias (ROB) and the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-Evidence Based Practice tool to assess overall strength of evidence (SOE). Two authors independently determined eligibility, performed data abstraction, assessed ROB, and determined SOE.

Results

Thirteen studies (5 low risk of bias, 3 moderate and 5 high risk) were included. We found low strength of evidence for the association between higher bilirubin levels and lower risk of acute exacerbations of COPD (2 studies), mortality (3 studies), COPD diagnosis (4 studies), and lung function (FEV 1) (8 studies). We found insufficient evidence on the relationship between serum bilirubin and respiratory health status/exercise capacity (1 study) and airflow obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC ratio) (4 studies).

Conclusion

Higher bilirubin levels may be associated with lower mortality and improved COPD outcomes. Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the effect of medications that raise serum bilirubin on COPD outcomes. PROSPERO registration: CRD42019145747.

### Inhibition of OATP1B1 / 3 rather than UGT1A1 may Be the major cause of the bilirubin elevation after atazanavir administration [^111MNhHv]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

The hyperbilirubinemia after atazanavir administration does not indicate liver injury. It is widely believed that the observed total bilirubin elevation is primarily due to UGT1A1 inhibition as it is mainly driven by the elevation of unconjugated bilirubin level. Indeed, the percentage of conjugated bilirubin in total bilirubin was reduced in atazanavir/r treatments. The observed large bilirubin elevation in atazanavir treatments also suggested that bilirubin appears to be more sensitive to UGT1A1 inhibition than other substrates, even though UGT1A1 is generally a low‐affinity and high‐capacity enzyme.

Because multiple steps and pathways are involved in bilirubin disposition, it was suggested to interpret the observed changes in bilirubin levels cautiously. In fact, discrepancies exist in observed bilirubin interactions if they were attributed to only UGT1A1 inhibition. For example, sorafenib is one of the strongest UGT1A1 inhibitors, which increased the AUC of SN‐38 as a UGT1A1 substrate 1.67–2.20‐fold. As sorafenib and atazanavir have comparable inhibitory potency (Appendix A, Table A2), therefore, it is expected that the frequency of hyperbilirubinemia would be similar in patients taking sorafenib and the ones taking atazanavir. However, less than 10% of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma treated with sorafenib had grades 1 and 2 bilirubin elevations and none had grades 3 and 4 bilirubin elevations, whereas ~40% of patients treated with atazanavir had grade 3 or higher bilirubin elevations. Also, Peer et al.reported minimal total bilirubin elevation in UGT1A1 extensive metabolizers (EM) and ~0.1 mg/dL elevation in PM after sorafenib treatment, which was much lower than those observed in atazanavir treatments.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^115Q7rVJ]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HBV/HIV coinfection — ARV-associated transaminase elevations and evaluation: Some ARV agents (especially older drugs, such as nevirapine, tipranavir, and high-dose ritonavir) can increase liver transaminase levels, and the incidence and magnitude of these increases were higher with HBV/HIV coinfection than with HIV mono-infection. Nevertheless, some experts suspend the suspected agent(s) when the serum alanine transferase (ALT) level increases to 5 to 10 times the upper limit of normal, or at a lower threshold if the person has symptoms of hepatitis and/or new elevations in bilirubin. However, increased transaminase levels in people with HBV/HIV coinfection may indicate HBeAg (hepatitis B e antigen) seroconversion due to immune reconstitution; thus, the cause of the elevations should be investigated before medications are discontinued, HBeAg seroconversion should be evaluated by testing for HBeAg and anti-HBe as well as HBV DNA levels, and other causes of ALT elevation — such as HCV or HIV coinfection, alcohol use, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and hepatotoxicity from non-ARV agents — should also be considered.

### Jaundice and breastfeeding [^112rHZGL]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Optimal management of breastfeeding does not eliminate neonatal jaundice and elevated serum bilirubin concentrations. Rather, it leads to a pattern of hyperbilirubinemia that is normal and, possibly, beneficial to infants. Excessive frequency of exaggerated jaundice in a hospital or community population of breastfed infants may be a warning that breastfeeding policies and support are not ideal for the establishment of good breastfeeding practices. The challenge to clinicians is to differentiate normal patterns of jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia from those that indicate an abnormality or place an infant at risk.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia management: clinical assessment of bilirubin production [^1165cAeS]. Seminars in Perinatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The predominant cause of elevated total/plasma bilirubin (TB) levels is from an increase in bilirubin production primarily because of ongoing hemolysis. If undiagnosed or untreated, the risk for developing extreme neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and possibly bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND) is increased. Since carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin are produced in equimolar amounts during the heme catabolic process, measurements of end-tidal CO levels, corrected for ambient CO (ETCOc) can be used as a direct indicator of ongoing hemolysis. A newly developed point-of-care ETCOc device has been shown to be a useful for identifying hemolysis-associated hyperbilirubinemia in newborns. This review summarizes the biology of bilirubin production, the clinical utility of a novel device to identify neonates undergoing hemolysis, and a brief introduction on the use of ETCOc measurements in a cohort of neonates in China.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^111Zqb9T]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — summary statements on abnormal liver chemistries state that liver chemistries including ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are markers of liver injury, not liver function, and should be referred to as liver chemistries, or liver tests; albumin, bilirubin, and prothrombin time are markers of hepatocellular function that can be influenced by extrahepatic factors; elevations of AST and/or ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest hepatocellular injury and are the abnormal liver chemistries that require assessment and potential evaluation; ALT is a more specific marker of hepatic injury than AST; and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of hepatic origin may be confirmed by elevation of gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) or fractionation of alkaline phosphatase.

### Bilirubin as an indicator of cardiometabolic health: a cross-sectional analysis in the UK biobank [^112JivdU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Mildly elevated bilirubin, a by-product of hemoglobin breakdown, might mitigate cardiometabolic risk factors including adiposity, dyslipidemia, and high blood pressure (BP). We investigated the cross-sectional relationship between (total) bilirubin and baseline cardiometabolic risk factors in 467,519 UK Biobank study participants.

Methods

We used multivariable-adjusted linear regression to estimate associations between bilirubin levels and risk factors of cardiometabolic diseases including body mass index (BMI), waist and hip circumferences (WC, HC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), fat mass (FM), and trunk FM, and the blood lipids: apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apolipoprotein B (apoB), apoB/apoA-I, lipoprotein (a), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL/HDL, TC/HDL, triglycerides (TG). Log-transformed bilirubin was modelled with restricted cubic splines and predicted mean values with 99% confidence intervals (CI) for each risk marker were estimated, separately. Second, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction to in turn six anthropometric traits (height, weight, BMI, WC, HC, and WHR) and all above lipids. Last, we estimated associations (99%CI) between bilirubin and three components of the metabolic syndrome, i.e. WC, TG, and BP using logistic regression.

Results

After multivariable adjustments, higher levels of bilirubin were inversely associated with indicators of general adiposity (BMI and FM) and of body fat distribution (WC, HC, WHR, and trunk FM) in both men and women. For example, women with mildly elevated bilirubin (95 th percentile equal to 15.0 µmol/L), compared to women with low bilirubin (5 th percentile equal to 4.5 µmol/L), had on average a 2.0 kg/m 2 (99% CI 1.9–2.1) lower BMI. Inverse associations were also observed with dyslipidemia among men and women. For example, mildly elevated bilirubin among men (95 th percentile equal to 19.4 µmol/L) compared to low levels of bilirubin (5 th percentile equal to 5.5 µmol/L) were associated with approx. 0.55 mmol/L (99% CI 0.53–0.56) lower TG levels, with similar inverse associations among women. Multiple-trait analyses using PCA confirmed single-trait analyses. Men and women with mildly elevated bilirubin levels ≥ 17.1 µmol/L, compared to low-normal bilirubin < 10 µmol/L had 13% (99% CI 8%-18%) and 11% (99% CI 4%-17%) lower odds of exceeding systolic BP levels of ≥ 130 mm Hg, respectively.

Conclusions

Higher levels of bilirubin were inversely associated with cardiometabolic risk factors including adiposity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117C8yTD]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Except in the neonatal period, the majority of measurable bilirubin should be conjugated, even in individuals with significant liver disease. Hence if the majority of the elevated bilirubin comprises the unconjugated fraction then the cause, in the absence of haemolysis, is virtually always Gilbert's syndrome. As Gilbert's syndrome is not associated with liver disease or ill health, any such individuals should be fully reassured. In the neonatal period, there may be a physiological increase in total bilirubin, which is unconjugated. This may be pathological if high or prolonged. In neonates and infants in whom the conjugated bilirubin is > 25 μmol/L, referral to a paediatrician for urgent assessment of possible liver disease is essential.

Albumin is a protein that is produced only in the liver and has multiple biological actions, including maintenance of oncotic pressure, binding of other substances (such as fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroid hormone and drugs), metabolism of compounds, including lipids, and antioxidant properties. As albumin is only produced by the liver, the serum albumin concentration is often considered as a marker of the synthetic function of the liver. However, overinterpretation of the measured concentrations of albumin as a marker of the severity of liver disease is not always merited. Albumin concentrations are reduced in many clinical situations, including sepsis, systemic inflammatory disorders, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption and gastrointestinal protein loss.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults | AAFP… [^112WABNi]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice occurs when the serum bilirubin level exceeds 3 mg per dL. It can be difficult to detect by physical examination alone. 4, 6 Jaundice occurs when there are disruptions along this metabolic pathway, causing an increase in unconjugated bilirubin or conjugated bilirubin. Unconjugated Hyperbilirubinemia INCREASED BILIRUBIN PRODUCTION Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is usually a result of too much bilirubin presented to the conjugating machinery. Increased red blood cell breakdown may be caused by red blood cell membrane disorders, 9 red blood cell enzyme disorders, 10 hemoglobin disorders, 11 autoimmune red blood cell destruction, 12 or some cancers.

The excess turnover of red blood cells results in increased heme metabolism, producing large amounts of bilirubin that overwhelm the conjugating machinery, leading to decreased excretion and clinical jaundice. 13 This is a benign condition that may be exacerbated by physical or emotional stress such as illness, strenuous exercise, or fasting. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a more severe variant of the same enzyme deficiency. 13 Patients with impaired conjugation due to low levels of the bilirubin-UGT enzyme are particularly susceptible to jaundice from medications that inhibit this enzyme, such as protease inhibitors. 6 Table 1 lists the causes of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. 5, 7, 9–12. Drug-induced liver injury has multiple potential mechanisms, including direct hepatocellular toxicity and activation of an immune response that advances the inflammatory cascade, inhibiting bilirubin transport into canaliculi, which causes cholestasis.

20 Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder, is associated with a loss of function of a cellular transporter responsible for moving dietary copper into liver canaliculi. Elevated liver copper levels affect hepatic lipid metabolism, which leads to steatosis and cholestasis. 21 Additional causes of intrahepatic hyperbilirubinemia include autoimmune disorders, such as autoimmune hepatitis and the rare autoimmune condition primary biliary cirrhosis, which occurs most commonly in middle-aged women. Both conditions are associated with inflammation, which disrupts the transport of bilirubin within the liver. 3.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^1149UGfc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) standards. Our protocol was registered in PROSPERO (registration number CRD42019145747).

Data sources and searches

We searched MEDLINE® and Embase databases using Ovid® (search updated October 1st, 2019) for peer-reviewed, English language studies. The search strategy for the MEDLINE® search is provided in Additional file 1: Appendix 1.

Study selection

Two authors (AKB and DMM) independently reviewed each study at the abstract and full-text level to determine eligibility. Disagreements were resolved through discussion and evaluation by a third reviewer, if needed.

Reports were eligible if they were randomized or observational (cohort, cross-sectional, case control) studies that enrolled participants greater than 18 years of age. We did not exclude studies based on pulmonary function or pulmonary diagnoses and included studies conducted in both general populations and in samples restricted to those with obstructive lung disease. We excluded case reports and case series, studies published in only abstract form, and those without a full text publication in English. We did not have a numerical cutoff for bilirubin levels because there are no defined criteria for what constitutes a pathologic elevation in bilirubin, but we excluded studies evaluating elevations in serum bilirubin in the context of hepatobiliary diseases and drug-induced liver injury. Eligible studies reported serum bilirubin levels and any outcome of interest related to our three key questions.

Outcome measures

We examined clinically important outcomes by cross sectional measures and longitudinal measures. Clinical effect sizes are included in Additional file 1: Appendix 2.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in children [^115Vx4qz]. Pediatrics in Review (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of anatomic, infectious, autoimmune, and metabolic diseases can lead to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, both in the newborn period and later in childhood. The pediatric practitioner is most likely to encounter conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period. It is crucial to maintain a high degree of suspicion for cholestasis in the persistently jaundiced newborn. The goal is recognition of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia between 2 and 4 weeks after birth, allowing for the prompt identification and management of infants who have biliary atresia, which remains the most common cause of neonatal cholestasis.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2017 guidelines recommend to measure total and conjugated serum bilirubin for the evaluation of cholestasis in any formula-fed infant noted to be jaundiced after 2 weeks of age.
Consider observing otherwise well-appearing breastfed infants clinically until 3 weeks of age. Measure total and conjugated serum bilirubin if they appear icteric at that time.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^111ctzqU]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia are numerous. Because of the consequences of untimely correction of EHBA as well as the potential consequences of untreated galactosemia, hypothyroidism and other etiologies associated with this problem, clinical evaluation needs to be prompt, focused, and complete. While specific symptoms may narrow the diagnostic possibilities, a complete history and physical examination, diagnostic imaging and laboratory investigations directed at the more common etiologies is required to make a prompt, definitive diagnosis. This systematic review provides evidence to direct the investigation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

### Assessment of UGT polymorphisms and neonatal jaundice [^112qqg88]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Elevation of the serum bilirubin level is a common, if not universal, finding during the first week of life. This can be a transient phenomenon that resolves spontaneously or can signify a serious or even life-threatening condition. There are many causes of hyperbilirubinemia and related therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diseases in which there is a primary disorder of the metabolism of bilirubin will be reviewed regarding their clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. These disorders-Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar Syndrome-both involve abnormalities in bilirubin conjugation secondary to deficiency of bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase. The purpose of this article is to review the current understanding of the genetic polymorphisms that result in these diseases and discuss recent advances in diagnosis and treatment.

### Effect of bilirubin and Gilbert syndrome on health: cohort analysis of observational, genetic, and mendelian randomisation associations [^116eTuuz]. BMJ Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Bilirubin is a breakdown product of haemoglobin and is widely measured as part of routine liver function testing. Bilirubin is known to have antioxidant properties and can reduce cellular exposure to reactive oxygen species in various in vitro and model animal systems. Additionally, observational studies have identified protective effects of increasing bilirubin concentrations on a wide range of outcomes. In particular, observational estimates have suggested large protective associations (eg, higher bilirubin concentrations were associated with lower odds) of myocardial infarctions and strokes.

Despite these studies, the evidence that bilirubin is causal for these outcomes remains limited. Concentrations of bilirubin are known to be altered by overall health state, liver function, obesity, and lifestyle traits such as smoking and alcohol intake. In the context of decompensated cirrhosis, hyperbilirubinaemia reflects synthetic dysfunction, hepatic failure, and can also be nephrotoxic. Due to these associations, measured bilirubin concentrations are highly likely to be confounded by health state. An association between health state (eg, low body mass index) and both high bilirubin levels and outcomes of interest (eg, cardiovascular disease) means that reported observations might not be causal, and bilirubin merely reflects a marker of health state.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^113EquiN]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Jaundice in adults can be an indicator of significant underlying disease. It is caused by elevated serum bilirubin levels in the unconjugated or conjugated form. The evaluation of jaundice relies on the history and physical examination. The initial laboratory evaluation should include fractionated bilirubin, a complete blood count, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, ?-glutamyltransferase, prothrombin time and/or international normalized ratio, albumin, and protein. Imaging with ultrasonography or computed tomography can differentiate between extrahepatic obstructive and intrahepatic parenchymal disorders. Ultrasonography is the least invasive and least expensive imaging method. A more extensive evaluation may include additional cancer screening, biliary imaging, autoimmune antibody assays, and liver biopsy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs with increased bilirubin production caused by red blood cell destruction, such as hemolytic disorders, and disorders of impaired bilirubin conjugation, such as Gilbert syndrome. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs in disorders of hepatocellular damage, such as viral and alcoholic hepatitis, and cholestatic disorders, such as choledocholithiasis and neoplastic obstruction of the biliary tree.

### Clinical practice guideline revision: management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation [^111y5X1n]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

AAP hyperbilirubinemia guideline — scope and updates since 2004 emphasize universal predischarge screening and refined treatment thresholds: The 2004 guideline focused on infants ≥ 35 weeks' gestation and clarified distinctions between "hyperbilirubinemia risk factors" and "hyperbilirubinemia neurotoxicity risk factors", adding universal predischarge bilirubin screening with measures of total serum bilirubin (TSB) or transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) linked to specific follow-up. Hazardous hyperbilirubinemia was defined as TSB ≥ 30 mg/dL, and its incidence decreased in at least 3 large US health systems after adoption of universal predischarge bilirubin screening with closer postdischarge follow-up. Because newer evidence was insufficient to set fully new thresholds, the committee began with the previous AAP guidelines, raised the phototherapy thresholds by a narrow range considered to be safe, revised the risk-assessment approach based on the hour-specific bilirubin concentration, and defined rapid response to elevated bilirubin concentrations as "escalation of care".

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113LJvTk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, and prothrombin time interpretation includes that an elevated GGT suggests that the alkaline phosphatase elevation is of hepatic origin, alkaline phosphatase levels increase in children and the elderly, especially females over 50 years of age, and the total serum bilirubin is usually < 1.1 mg/dl with an elevated direct bilirubin indicating hepatocellular dysfunction or cholestasis; fractionation of total bilirubin is most helpful when the ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase levels are normal or near normal, and if the total bilirubin is elevated and fractionation shows the majority of the elevation is unconjugated bilirubin, hepatocellular disease is unlikely; albumin is a plasma protein exclusively synthesized by the liver with a circulating half-life of 3 weeks, a reduction in albumin (normal ≥ 3.5 g/dl) usually indicates liver disease of more than 3 weeks duration, and prothrombin time may be prolonged in patients with severe liver disease of < 24 h duration.

Hyperbilirubinemia — bilirubin measurement and consultation triggers state that the direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin concentration should not be subtracted from the total serum bilirubin concentration when using Figs 2 or 3. If the direct-reacting or conjugated fraction of the TSB exceeds 50% of the TSB, consultation with a knowledgeable specialist (eg, pediatric gastroenterologist or neonatologist) is recommended, and the figure caption also advises to consult an expert. Infants < 24 hours old with a TSB at or above the phototherapy threshold are likely to have a hemolytic process and should be evaluated for hemolytic disease.

### Review of bilirubin neurotoxicity I: molecular biology and neuropathology of disease [^111B5Tyb]. Pediatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite the availability of successful prevention strategies to prevent excessive hyperbilirubinemia, the neurological sequelae of bilirubin neurotoxicity (BNTx) still occur throughout the world. Kernicterus, encephalopathy due to BNTx, is now understood to be a spectrum of severity and phenotypes known as kernicterus spectrum disorder (KSD). A better understanding of the selective neuropathology and molecular biology of BNTx and using consistent clinical definitions of KSDs as outcome measure can lead to more accurately predicting the risk and causes of BNTx and KSDs. In Part I of our two-part review, we will summarize current and recent advances in the understanding of the selective neuropathology and molecular biology of the disease. Herein we emphasize the role of unbound, free unconjugated bilirubin as well as genetic contributions to the susceptibility BNTx and the development of KSDs. In Part II, we focus on current and possible novel methods to prevent BNTx and ABE and treat ABE and KSDs.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin clearance [^1163DvT3]. Pediatric Research (2016). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of hyperbilirubinemia may be caused by increased bilirubin production or decreased bilirubin clearance. Reduced hepatic bilirubin clearance can be due to defective (i) unconjugated bilirubin uptake and intrahepatic storage, (ii) conjugation of glucuronic acid to bilirubin (e.g. Gilbert syndrome, Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Lucey-Driscoll syndrome, breast milk jaundice), (iii) bilirubin excretion into bile (Dubin-Johnson syndrome), or (iv) conjugated bilirubin re-uptake (Rotor syndrome). In this review, the molecular mechanisms and clinical manifestations of these conditions are described, as well as current approaches to diagnosis and therapy.

5.3 Hepatotoxicity

In postmarketing experience, there have been ZYTIGA-associated severe hepatic toxicity, including fulminant hepatitis, acute liver failure and deaths [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

In the combined data of 5 randomized clinical trials, grade 3–4 ALT or AST increases (at least 5 × ULN) were reported in 6% of 2230 patients who received ZYTIGA, typically during the first 3 months after starting treatment. Patients whose baseline ALT or AST were elevated were more likely to experience liver test elevation than those beginning with normal values. Treatment discontinuation due to ALT and AST increases or abnormal hepatic function occurred in 1.1% of 2230 patients taking ZYTIGA. In these clinical trials, no deaths clearly related to ZYTIGA were reported due to hepatotoxicity events.

Measure serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and bilirubin levels prior to starting treatment with ZYTIGA, every two weeks for the first three months of treatment and monthly thereafter. In patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment receiving a reduced ZYTIGA dose of 250 mg, measure ALT, AST, and bilirubin prior to the start of treatment, every week for the first month, every two weeks for the following two months of treatment and monthly thereafter. Promptly measure serum total bilirubin, AST, and ALT if clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of hepatotoxicity develop. Elevations of AST, ALT, or bilirubin from the patient's baseline should prompt more frequent monitoring. If at any time AST or ALT rise above five times the ULN, or the bilirubin rises above three times the ULN, interrupt ZYTIGA treatment and closely monitor liver function.

Re-treatment with ZYTIGA at a reduced dose level may take place only after return of liver function tests to the patient's baseline or to AST and ALT less than or equal to 2.5 × ULN and total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 × ULN [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Permanently discontinue ZYTIGA for patients who develop a concurrent elevation of ALT greater than 3 × ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2 × ULN in the absence of biliary obstruction or other causes responsible for the concurrent elevation [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

The safety of ZYTIGA re-treatment of patients who develop AST or ALT greater than or equal to 20 × ULN and/or bilirubin greater than or equal to 10 × ULN is unknown.

### Hyperbilirubinemia, hemolysis, and increased bilirubin neurotoxicity [^115HX92y]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Increased hemolysis in the presence of severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia appears to augment the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity. The mechanism of this intensifying effect is uncertain. In direct antiglobulin titer (DAT) positive, isoimmune hemolytic disease, the bilirubin threshold at which neurotoxicity occurs appears to be lower than in DAT-negative hyperbilirubinemia. In other hemolytic conditions, the hemolysis may simply facilitate the development of extremely high serum bilirubin levels. Whether the hemolytic process per se exerts an independent effect or whether a very rapid rise in serum bilirubin might lead to greater penetration of the blood-brain barrier is unclear. In this review, we survey the synergistic role of hemolysis associated with severe hyperbilirubinemia in the potentiation of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity and suggest methods of identifying at-risk babies with increased hemolysis to allow for their increased surveillance.

### Critical care hepatology: definitions, incidence, prognosis and role of liver failure in critically ill patients [^115JuCqn]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Prognostic clinical features

Serum bilirubin is a stable and prevailing marker of liver impairment in the ICU. Its concentration is influenced by bilirubin synthesis, transport, uptake, conjugation and excretion. Ischemic and sepsis-associated cholestasis, drug-induced liver injury and parenteral nutrition are predominant causes of hyperbilirubinemia in the ICU. Bilirubin is a marker of liver dysfunction and a powerful prognostic factor. It has been shown to be linked to infections in surgical patients, to an increased mortality among trauma patients, sepsis or hematological malignancies, to a poor prognosis among ARDS patients, or simply to a worse outcome in the ICU (summarized in Table 3).

Table 3
Summary of the incidence and the overall mortality associated with increased bilirubin in ICU patients as reported in the literature

OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval, ICU intensive care unit, ARDS acute respiratory distress syndrome, N.d not documented, TA transaminases, AST aspartate aminotransferase, CA cardiac arrest

*Increase of 2 mg/dl from baseline

OR for complications, not for mortality

*Within the first 2 days after ICU admission

**OR for unfavorable neurological outcome, not for mortality

In the case of cholestasis, total bile acids are also an independent prognostic factor of disease severity. An elevation of 5.2 µmol/l of total bile acids from baseline data demonstrated discriminating value, while mortality was specifically augmented with increases > 10 µmol/l. Horvatits et al. suggested that bile acids could be a better prognostic factor than bilirubin in the ICU. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether the elevation of bile acids in critically ill patients is a distinct pathophysiological entity or a compensatory mechanism.

Regarding hypoxic liver injury, the indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate is an effective tool for assessing liver function. In an observational study with 97 patients, a cutoff value of 9% 48 h after ICU admission demonstrated a significant prognostic accuracy for 28-day mortality. In contrast, bilirubin, due to the later peak time, might not be a reliable marker and is elevated in only one-third of patients with hypoxic liver injury. The indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate outperforms bilirubin as a more sensitive combined indicator of perfusion and excretory liver function in the ICU.

Finally, underlying and concomitant syndromes will impact the outcome, such as sepsis or need for organ support. Moreover, the presence of coagulopathy or hepatic encephalopathy has been shown to predict mortality in critically ill patients with hypoxic liver injury. As expected, the severity of organ failure results in higher mortality rates.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^114C1wUF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice is common and usually not concerning when it is secondary to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, below the neurotoxic level, and resolves early. Primary care providers should be vigilant, however, about evaluating infants in whom jaundice presents early, is prolonged beyond 2 weeks of life, or presents at high levels. Even in well-appearing infants, fractionated (direct and indirect) bilirubin levels should be obtained in these clinical scenarios to evaluate for potential cholestasis. This review presents an approach to the evaluation of a jaundiced infant and discusses diagnosis and management of several causes of neonatal cholestasis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: an unexpected cause [^117E5NEu]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common cause for newborn hospital admission. Although the cause of hyperbilirubinemia is usually benign and self-limited, there is always a large differential diagnosis. Atypical presenting signs and symptoms, such as significant anemia or bleeding, should encourage further evaluation for underlying disorders, such as inherited coagulation defects. This article describes the case of a 5-day-old infant who presented to the emergency department with hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and ecchymoses from birth trauma. His hospital course is described, along with a review on the background, evaluation, management, and complications of hemophilia A.

### Systems pharmacology modeling of drug-induced hyperbilirubinemia: differentiating hepatotoxicity and inhibition of enzymes / transporters [^111xNTs2]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Elevations in serum bilirubin during drug treatment may indicate global liver dysfunction and a high risk of liver failure. However, drugs also can increase serum bilirubin in the absence of hepatic injury by inhibiting specific enzymes/transporters. We constructed a mechanistic model of bilirubin disposition based on known functional polymorphisms in bilirubin metabolism/transport. Using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model‐predicted drug exposure and enzyme/transporter inhibition constants determined in vitro, our model correctly predicted indinavir‐mediated hyperbilirubinemia in humans and rats. Nelfinavir was predicted not to cause hyperbilirubinemia, consistent with clinical observations. We next examined a new drug candidate that caused both elevations in serum bilirubin and biochemical evidence of liver injury in rats. Simulations suggest that bilirubin elevation primarily resulted from inhibition of transporters rather than global liver dysfunction. We conclude that mechanistic modeling of bilirubin can help elucidate underlying mechanisms of drug‐induced hyperbilirubinemia, and thereby distinguish benign from clinically important elevations in serum bilirubin.

### Serum bilirubin and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a systematic review [^114hHtjY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant and higher serum bilirubin levels have been associated with improved COPD outcomes. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the association between serum bilirubin levels and lung function (FEV 1), prevalence/incidence of COPD, acute exacerbations of COPD, respiratory health status, and mortality.

Methods

MEDLINE® and Embase were searched using Ovid® (search updated October 1st, 2019). We included studies that measured serum bilirubin levels and outcomes of interest in adults with or without underlying lung disease. We excluded studies of those with liver disease or drug-induced elevations in bilirubin. We used the Newcastle–Ottawa scale to assess individual study risk of bias (ROB) and the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality — Evidence Based Practice tool to assess overall strength of evidence (SOE). Two authors independently determined eligibility, performed data abstraction, assessed ROB, and determined SOE.

Results

Thirteen studies (5 low risk of bias, 3 moderate and 5 high risk) were included. We found low strength of evidence for the association between higher bilirubin levels and lower risk of acute exacerbations of COPD (2 studies), mortality (3 studies), COPD diagnosis (4 studies), and lung function (FEV 1) (8 studies). We found insufficient evidence on the relationship between serum bilirubin and respiratory health status/exercise capacity (1 study) and airflow obstruction (FEV 1 /FVC ratio) (4 studies).

Conclusion

Higher bilirubin levels may be associated with lower mortality and improved COPD outcomes. Randomized trials are needed to evaluate the effect of medications that raise serum bilirubin on COPD outcomes.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^114Kk3U6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Neonatal cholestasis [^115K5C5A]. NeoReviews (2013). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice is a common presenting feature of neonatal hepatobiliary and metabolic dysfunction. Any infant who remains jaundiced beyond age 2 to 3 weeks should have the serum bilirubin level fractionated into a conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) portion. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is never physiologic or normal. The differential diagnosis of cholestasis is extensive, and a step-wise approach based on the initial history and physical examination is useful to rapidly identify the underlying etiology. Early recognition of neonatal cholestasis is essential to ensure timely treatment and optimal prognosis. Even when specific treatment is not available, infants who have cholestasis benefit from early medical management and optimization of nutrition. Future studies are necessary to determine the most reliable and cost-effective method of universal screening for neonatal cholestasis.

### Association between elevated serum bilirubin levels with preserved lung function under conditions of exposure to air pollution [^111wTHVp]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The key finding of this study was that elevated serum bilirubin concentrations are associated with preserved lung function in healthy individuals exposed to elevated levels of air pollution. Bilirubin should be further studied as a surrogate marker for lung function in respiratory diseases in which there are elevated levels of oxidative stress.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1155asMt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Inhibition of OATP1B1 / 3 rather than UGT1A1 may Be the major cause of the bilirubin elevation after atazanavir administration [^116p7H8H]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the reasons why the bilirubin and atazanavir interaction has been commonly believed to be mediated by UGT1A1 inhibition is that the total bilirubin elevation was primarily driven by the unconjugated bilirubin elevation, although the high potency of atazanavir inhibition against OATP1B1/3 has been well recognized. It is expected that the percentage of conjugated bilirubin increases after atazanavir administration if OATP1B1/3 inhibition has a significant contribution to the interaction as conjugated bilirubin is also a substrate of OATP1B1/3. In fact, ~2‐fold elevation of conjugated bilirubin was observed with atazanavir/r, indicating that OATP1B1/3 did contribute to the interaction. The observed data showed that the percentage of conjugated bilirubin in total bilirubin decreased. However, this is likely due to a greater increase in unconjugated bilirubin levels caused by the synergistic effect of simultaneous inhibition of both UGT1A1 and OATP1B1/3, as compared with the increase in conjugated bilirubin with inhibition of only OATP1B1/3. As the increased conjugated bilirubin concentration is still much less than 2 mg/dL and less than 20% of total bilirubin, the clinical symptom is shown as hyperbilirubinemia rather than conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in patients treated with atazanavir.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the 2000s: what should we do next? [^113T214o]. American Journal of Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Changes in healthcare policy mandating early discharge of healthy, full-term infants and the higher prevalence of breast-feeding of newborns have contributed to an increased number of term infants being readmitted to the hospital for hyperbilirubinemia. At high levels, total serum bilirubin causes kernicterus, which is associated with severe neurological sequelae. This article provides a review of prior studies that have examined whether and at what levels total serum bilirubin affects neurodevelopmental outcome in term infants. In addition, the article reviews some approaches in the literature that suggest means of preventing high levels of hyperbilirubinemia in term infants.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: where do we stand? [^115deK9W]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

In this review, we have summarized the recent reports of COVID-19-related liver injury, data that are obviously changing rapidly day by day. Although the pathophysiology behind liver injury in COVID-19 remains unresolved, several theories have been proposed, but a multifactorial mechanism seems most likely. Undoubtedly, the available clinical data so far show that the incidence of liver impairment in COVID-19 ranged from 6–61%, mainly indicated by abnormal ALT/AST levels (Table 1). However, most of the cases experienced a mild AST/ALT elevation (usually < 3× ULN), accompanied by slightly elevated bilirubin levels. Since ACE2 receptors are expressed especially in the bile ducts, one may suppose that patients should have some degree of cholestasis or jaundice. However, this seems not to be the case in everyday practice and, remarkably, even ICU patients did not present with elevated ALP/GGT.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^113iG5vj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Elevation of total bilirubin level — evaluation and interpretation: Elevated serum total bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. The first step in investigating elevated bilirubin is determining conjugated (direct) vs. unconjugated (indirect) hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated unconjugated or indirect bilirubin is due to over-production, decreased hepatic uptake, or decreased hepatic conjugation. In Gilbert's syndrome, affecting 3–7% of the US population, total bilirubin levels almost never exceed 6 mg/dl and are usually < 3 mg/dl; fasting or significant illness can increase the unconjugated bilirubin by 2- to 3-fold and will decrease with eating or administration of phenobarbital. In hemolysis, hemolysis infrequently causes a bilirubin level > 5 mg/dl unless co-existent renal disease, liver disease, or severe acute hemolysis is present. In asymptomatic, healthy individuals with mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (< 4 mg/dl), evaluation should exclude medications that cause hyperbilirubinemia, exclude evidence of hemolysis, and confirm normal serum transaminases and alkaline phosphatase levels; if these are found, then a presumptive diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can be made and additional evaluation is not routinely necessary.

### Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia [^116XW4Zq]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Neonatal indirect hyperbilirubinemia (IHB) is caused by an imbalance in bilirubin production and elimination. Approximately 60% of term and 80% of preterm infants develop jaundice in the first week of age. This review seeks to provide the reader with a thorough understanding of the physiology of bilirubin, etiology of IHB, and management of severe IHB. Phototherapy and exchange transfusion remain the mainstays of treatment for severe IHB. Noninvasive screening tools, innovative treatments, and a better understanding of how prematurity and genetics contribute to severe IHB have improved our understanding of IHB and may help eliminate the hazards associated with severe IHB, including kernicterus spectrum disorder.

### Serum bilirubin and ischaemic stroke: a review of literature [^113PD2N9]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Summaries and perspectives

The emerging roles serum bilirubin plays in IS as reviewed above imply that the mechanisms through which bilirubin influences IS before and after stroke onset are different. A large number of studies support the notion that bilirubin is involved in antioxidation defense mechanisms and a higher level of serum bilirubin in the normal range was associated with a decreased risk of IS. However, these findings are based on prestroke situations. After stroke occurs, the negative influence of high levels of serum bilirubin on patients' outcome possibly reflects the intensity of initial oxidative stress. AIS patients with higher levels of bilirubin had larger cerebral infarcts, more prominent brain oedema and more severe reperfusion injuries with poorer functional outcomes than those with lower bilirubin levels. On the other hand, elevated bilirubin can protect neurons from oxidative stress injury within a certain concentration range, and the underlying mechanism has been well illustrated previously. Experimental evidence has shown that serum bilirubin seems to account for neuroprotection offered by HO, because the neurotoxic effect of HO deletion is reversed by restoring even low concentrations of bilirubin.

However, the specific mechanism bilirubin uses in IS is still unclear. Studies on the relationship between serum bilirubin and prognosis of IS have not reached a consistent conclusion. This also applies to the relationship between levels of serum bilirubin and risks for IS in bilirubin metabolism-related diseases (such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, metabolic syndrome and so on). Whether multifaceted intervention achieving the BP, lipid and glycaemia control targets can attenuate the increased risk of IS associated with low BIL is uncertain. These issues need to be further explored.

### Inherited disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation: new insights into molecular mechanisms and consequences [^1149keDS]. Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Inherited disorders of bilirubin metabolism might reduce bilirubin uptake by hepatocytes, bilirubin conjugation, or secretion of bilirubin into bile. Reductions in uptake could increase levels of unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin (Rotor syndrome). Defects in bilirubin conjugation could increase levels of unconjugated bilirubin; the effects can be benign and frequent (Gilbert syndrome) or rare but severe, increasing the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy (Crigler-Najjar syndrome). Impairment of bilirubin secretion leads to accumulation of conjugated bilirubin (Dubin-Johnson syndrome). We review the genetic causes and pathophysiology of disorders of bilirubin transport and conjugation as well as clinical and therapeutic aspects. We also discuss the possible mechanisms by which hyperbilirubinemia protects against cardiovascular disease and the metabolic syndrome and the effects of specific genetic variants on drug metabolism and cancer development.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hyperbilirubinemia [^113RoB3n]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Jaundice, the physical finding associated with hyperbilirubinemia, results when the liver is unable to properly metabolize or excrete bilirubin. The purpose of this review is to examine some of the most common causes of jaundice in adults, provide insight into the diagnostic evaluation of jaundice, and review information on the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Recent Findings

An elevated level of bilirubin almost always indicates the presence of an underlying disease state. The best approach to evaluating a patient with jaundice is to start with a careful history and physical examination, followed by imaging assessment of the biliary tree and liver. There are algorithm models that incorporate bilirubin levels in their predictor models for outcomes in patients with chronic liver disease (i.e., the model for end-stage liver disease). However, there are few studies that have examined the outcomes of patients with jaundice.

Summary

Evaluation of patients with jaundice starts with a careful history and physical examination, followed by directed imaging of the biliary tree and liver. Although jaundice is generally believed to be a serious medical condition, there is little literature that addresses outcomes in patients with jaundice.

### Targeting inflammation to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in people with HIV infection [^113567yG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Bilirubin

Bilirubin has been shown to have antiatherogenic characteristics attributed, in part, to its antioxidant properties. 142 Individuals with Gilbert syndrome, who have a hereditary inability to conjugate bilirubin and elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin as a result, have lower rates of stroke, coronary artery disease, and other inflammatory conditions. 143 This property has been studied as a possible intervention to reduce the risk of CVD for HIV‐negative individuals with diabetes mellitus. Through the use of pharmacological interventions, which increase serum bilirubin levels, several studies have shown a decrease in CVD with elevated bilirubin levels in patients with diabetes mellitus. 144, 145, 146 More recently, analyses of 96,381 participants in the Veterans Aging Cohort Study, one‐third of whom were HIV positive, showed that an elevated bilirubin level is inversely correlated with CVD among both HIV‐positive and ‐negative individuals. 147 Bilirubin elevations are common during treatment with the protease inhibitor, atazanavir. In a prospective RCT on CIMT, elevated bilirubin in study participants receiving atazanavir appeared to favorably influence CIMT progression rates. 148 These findings raise the interesting prospect of harnessing the protective effect of elevated bilirubin to reduce cardiovascular risk in PLWH.

### Jaundice (hyperbilirubinemia) in cancer… [^112qi7TB]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

When red blood cells break down, bilirubin is formed. Bilirubin is part of the bile fluid produced by the liver. A normal liver metabolizes bilirubin to keep blood levels low. When liver cells are damaged or when cancer has spread to the liver or bile ducts, the function of the liver is reduced. The bilirubin level in the blood then increases, which causes jaundice. Three broad types of liver damage can lead to jaundice: Prehepatic causes occur from massive breakdown of red blood cells, producing bilirubin in such large quantities that the liver is unable to keep up with its processing. Consequently, large amounts of unprocessed bilirubin pass through the liver and into the blood. Hepatic causes refer to direct damage to the liver cells themselves from such causes as hepatitis virus infection, toxins like alcohol, some chemotherapy drugs, and cancer of the liver. Posthepatic causes occur after bilirubin has been processed in the liver but is unable to pass out of it.

This occurs in patients with gallstones or cancers blocking bile ducts, leading to a backlog of bile, which then spills into the bloodstream. Patients with hyperbilirubinemia also have dark yellow urine, pale stools, and skin itching. Some people have nausea, vomiting, and pain in the abdomen, as well as vague symptoms like headache, weight loss, and abdominal bloating. The liver removes toxic substances from the body. When the liver cannot work well, toxic ammonia also builds up in the blood stream and it can go to the brain, leading to poor brain function. This is called hepatic encephalopathy, which causes confusion, fatigue, and drowsiness. Cancers that arise from the liver, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, or spread to the liver, such as pancreatic or colon cancer, are the most common causes of jaundice among patients with cancer. Treatment of jaundice is based on the cause of the elevated bilirubin level.

If it is caused by viral hepatitis, the doctor may prescribe antiviral medications. In cases of blockage of the bile ducts, surgery may be performed to remove the gall bladder or the tumor causing the blockage. Using an ERCP procedure, a doctor may insert plastic or metal tubes called stents inside the bile ducts to prevent them from collapsing and ensure normal bile flow.

### Bilirubin production and the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity [^111qYedE]. Seminars in Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

Neonatal jaundice usually occurs in the transitional period after birth, presenting as an elevation of circulating bilirubin. Bilirubin neurotoxicity can occur if the levels of bilirubin become excessive (hyperbilirubinemia). This pathologic phenotype of newborn jaundice can develop because of excessive bilirubin production or impaired conjugation, with the risk for developing bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, depending on the degree of the resultant bilirubin load. The plasma bilirubin level thus can be used to assess an infant's risk for developing bilirubin neurotoxicity relative to an infant's age in hours. Because all infants have an impaired conjugation ability, infants at greatest risk are those who have increased bilirubin production rates, because of hemolysis, for example. Therefore, developing potential preventive strategies as well as noninvasive technologies to treat and to identify infants with increased bilirubin production rates, respectively, are tantamount to reducing the incidence of bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction.

### Unusual case of immune haemolytic disease causing severe neonatal cholestasis in a newborn [^11558j4C]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia is a very common entity witnessed in most of the newborns. Rarely are there events where the bilirubin levels reach extreme values mandating invasive therapy. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia when solely present is easy to manage and diagnose the common aetiological factors associated with it. The issue arises when we come across a mixed picture of conjugated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and puts us in a dilemma as to what are we treating. Our case highlights a similar picture where we witnessed the highest documented levels of total bilirubin but to our surprise the major component of which was direct bilirubin. This report takes us through the differentials which were ruled out and our management strategies for solving this rare mystery.

### Prevalence and burden of illness of treated hemolytic neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in a privately insured population in the United States [^111nx2o9]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NHB), a common condition in newborn infants, results from elevated blood bilirubin levels. The excessive bilirubin manifests as yellowing of the skin and the normally white outer layer of the eyeballs. While most cases resolve quickly without intervention, NHB is a common reason for inpatient readmissions, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The prevalence of NHB is not precisely known, however, estimates suggest that approximately 50% full-term and 80% preterm newborns develop some form of NHB. High-risk NHB occurs in 8–9% of neonates during the first week after birth.

The origin of NHB may be physiologic or pathologic. Physiologic NHB may be caused by neonate immaturity and the resulting inability to cope with elevated levels of bilirubin. This benign form resolves itself in 2–3 weeks following birth, and usually without treatment. Pathologic NHB may be caused by hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN), red blood cell (RBC) enzyme deficiency, or impaired bilirubin excretion. HDN results from incompatibilities between maternal and fetal blood types (Rh, ABO or a minor blood group), which may cause ruptures in fetal RBCs and elevated bilirubin levels. Hemolytic NHB usually appears within 24 h after birth.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clinical practice guidelines address the assessment, screening, and treatment of NHB among infants at ≥ 35 weeks of gestation. Risk assessment and treatment nomograms based on total serum bilirubin level, postnatal age in hours, and gestational age of the newborn with the presence or absence of risk factors are available to guide patient management. Similar guidelines are not available for neonates at less than 35 weeks of gestation because of scant evidence-based data, differences in clinical manifestations and unclear treatment outcomes.

When treatment is indicated, AAP guidelines recommend phototherapy as the initial treatment. In cases where bilirubin levels continue to increase despite phototherapy, the guidelines recommend adding exchange transfusion of whole blood to the treatment regimen, typically in the NICU. For hemolytic cases, AAP guidelines recommend the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as adjunctive therapy when bilirubin levels continue to rise despite intensive phototherapy. These challenges in management of high-risk hyperbilirubinemia substantially increase the urgency for safer and more effective screening and/or treatment options, especially when viewed against the knowledge that the permanent sequelae of kernicterus spectrum disorders (KSDs) might be prevented.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the term newborn [^112wbpQY]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is one of the most common problems encountered in term newborns. Historically, management guidelines were derived from studies on bilirubin toxicity in infants with hemolytic disease. More recent recommendations support the use of less intensive therapy in healthy term newborns with jaundice. Phototherapy should be instituted when the total serum bilirubin level is at or above 15 mg per dL (257 micromol per L) in infants 25 to 48 hours old, 18 mg per dL (308 micromol per L) in infants 49 to 72 hours old, and 20 mg per dL (342 micromol per L) in infants older than 72 hours. Few term newborns with hyperbilirubinemia have serious underlying pathology. Jaundice is considered pathologic if it presents within the first 24 hours after birth, the total serum bilirubin level rises by more than 5 mg per dL (86 micromol per L) per day or is higher than 17 mg per dL (290 micromol per L), or an infant has signs and symptoms suggestive of serious illness. The management goals are to exclude pathologic causes of hyperbilirubinemia and initiate treatment to prevent bilirubin neurotoxicity.

### Plasma bilirubin and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity are inversely related in dyslipidemic patients with metabolic syndrome: relevance to oxidative stress [^114aA1Sc]. Atherosclerosis (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Subnormal levels of plasma bilirubin levels are associated with premature coronary artery disease and cardiovascular morbidity. Plasma gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity is linked to bilirubin level in hepatic disease and elevated GGT is equally associated with hepatic steatosis, a frequent feature of metabolic syndrome (MS). In order to assess the potential relationship between GGT activity and bilirubin levels in subjects exhibiting features of the metabolic syndrome, we determined circulating bilirubin levels and GGT activity in a cohort of dyslipidemic patients.

Methods and Results

This cross-sectional study involved patients (n = 1433) displaying atherogenic dyslipidemia in primary prevention referred to our Prevention Center. Among these patients, 25% presented with MS as defined by recent NCEP ATP III criteria. Circulating levels of transaminases, as well as GGT activity, were elevated in MS patients; by contrast, bilirubin concentrations were significantly lower in such patients as compared to those lacking this syndrome (p < 10–4 for all comparisons). Comparisons of patient groups on the basis of the number of MS criteria which were concomitantly present revealed a progressive decrease in mean bilirubin levels; this reduction paralleled a progressive increase in mean GGT activity as a function of the number of MS components in the overall population (p value for trend < 10–4).

Conclusion

Elevation in systemic GGT activity, which is characterized by extended generation of ROS, together with potentially deficient bilirubin-mediated antioxidative capacity of plasma, may therefore constitute key components of the systemic oxidative stress typical of metabolic syndrome.

### False-positive paracetamol levels in a patient with hyperbilirubinaemia: clinical perspectives [^1176bv4e]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

​Serum concentrations of paracetamol are measured to investigate the cause of acute hepatitis, monitor the clearance of paracetamol from the body and to determine if supratherapeutic levels warrant treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). ​A 49-year-old man treated for ischaemic colitis developed worsening renal and liver function tests. As part of the investigation of hepatorenal failure, paracetamol levels were requested, which were elevated at 14 mg/L (normal < 4 mg/L) resulting in treatment with NAC. Despite treatment, levels of paracetamol remained elevated and the link between hyperbilirubinemia and false-positive paracetamol levels was identified. ​Bilirubin and its by-products have intense absorbance in the ultraviolet and visible regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, causing interference in the enzymatic colorimetric assay most commonly used to measure paracetamol concentration, resulting in false-positive paracetamol levels. Laboratories correct for this interference above a predetermined bilirubin concentration, termed the Icteric Index; however, in our case this interference occurred at a lower level of hyperbilirubinaemia than previously identified as significant. This interaction was found to be more significant at lower bilirubin levels when low or no paracetamol levels were present in the serum, resulting in a change to laboratory practice and development of a 'Sliding Scale' approach to analysis. ​Concurrent bilirubin or Icteric Index measurement is recommended for all laboratories that use the enzymatic colorimetric assay for paracetamol measurement. Lower Icteric Index or bilirubin thresholds are required when low or no paracetamol levels are present in the serum to prevent false-positive paracetamol results. We describe a new 'Sliding Scale' approach to analysis, and highlight an important interaction for clinicians to be aware of.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

### Evaluation of transcutaneous bilirubin levels in healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies: a pilot study [^111oE3AL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussions

In our study, we demonstrated that transcutaneous bilirubin (TcB) levels measured from different maternal skin sites were significantly higher in women with preeclampsia and pre-eclampsia with severe features compared to the control group. Furthermore, TcB values showed a stepwise increase in parallel with the severity of the disease. In contrast, total serum bilirubin (TsB) levels did not differ significantly among the control, preeclampsia, and pre-eclampsia with severe features groups. These findings suggest that TcB measurement may serve as a valuable non-invasive tool in the classification of preeclampsia.

While transcutaneous bilirubin levels were significantly elevated in women with preeclampsia, total serum bilirubin levels remained within normal limits and did not differ significantly among groups. This divergence may reflect the subclinical accumulation of bilirubin in tissue compartments that is not captured by serum measurements, possibly due to efficient hepatic clearance or early-stage hemolysis. Additionally, the observed elevation in LDH without corresponding reductions in hemoglobin may indicate subclinical hemolytic activity or hepatic dysfunction, which precedes measurable changes in red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels.

Conditions that affect bilirubin metabolism may lead to elevated serum bilirubin concentrations. When blood bilirubin levels exceed 1 mg/dL, bilirubin begins to accumulate in tissues rich in elastic fibers, such as the skin and conjunctiva. At serum levels above 2.5 mg/dL, a yellowish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes becomes apparent. In adults, hyperbilirubinemia alone does not indicate a poor prognosis, as the body possesses effective detoxification mechanisms.

Pre-hepatic hyperbilirubinemia refers to elevated bilirubin levels resulting from excessive bilirubin production. The most common cause is accelerated hemolysis. When the rate of bilirubin production exceeds the liver's capacity for uptake and excretion, serum unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels rise, while conjugated bilirubin levels remain normal or only mildly elevated. In the presence of elevated bilirubin levels, hepatic injury is typically absent if there is no disruption in aminotransferase levels, albumin concentration, or prothrombin activity. Moreover, increased bilirubin concentrations are not considered a sensitive marker of liver damage. A healthy liver is capable of conjugating up to twice the daily production of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) without causing an increase in total bilirubin concentrations. Additionally, the hepatic clearance rate of bilirubin exceeds its production rate by up to tenfold.

### Circulating markers of liver function and cardiovascular disease risk [^112GFrQG]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum concentrations of various liver enzymes and other nonenzymatic proteins and metabolites of heme metabolism (eg, bilirubin) is often undertaken in clinical practice. Measurement of these liver function tests is simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive. However, interpreting the liver function test results in patients without evidence of liver disease is often challenging. Concentrations of some of liver enzymes, such as γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of liver-derived metabolites, such as bilirubin, may be influenced by metabolic processes beyond the liver, sometimes making interpretation of the test results difficult. This scenario frequently occurs both in individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease and in patients with known cardiovascular disease, often resulting in the clinicians ignoring the test results. In this brief review, we discuss the evidence for associations between key serum liver function tests and cardiovascular disease risk and where associations are robust; we provide an interpretation for possible mechanistic links between the liver function test and cardiovascular disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, more specifically with respect to bilirubin measurement, ESPGHAN/NASPGHAN 2017 guidelines recommend to view conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (> 1.0 mg/dL, 17 mcmol/L) as pathological and obtain further diagnostic evaluation.

### Clinical approach to patients with obstructive jaundice [^111XyaWC]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Obstructive jaundice is a clinical symptom that results from cholestasis. Cholestasis can be extrahepatic or intrahepatic and is typically associated with biochemical abnormalities in the liver function tests. Once these abnormalities are identified, more extensive imaging tests can be performed to determine the nature, etiology, and level of obstruction. This information is essential for clinicians as they decide on management and treatment strategies.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the setting of antiviral therapy [^112yic8T]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common side effect of antiviral medications. The mechanisms underlying its development are multiple and unique to each therapy. During administration of antiviral medications, the hyperbilirubinemia observed in the absence of liver injury is most frequently manifested by isolated increases in the indirect-reacting fraction. Relevant mechanisms leading to indirect hyperbilirubinemia in this setting include hemolysis, decreased hepatic bilirubin clearance as a result of impairment of bilirubin conjugation, or circumstances in which both processes occur simultaneously. Underlying genetic susceptibilities may potentiate these side effects of antiviral therapy. Conjugated (direct-reacting) hyperbilirubinemia can be a consequence of generalized hepatocellular injury, selective cholestatic defects, biliary obstruction, or, rarely, genetic disorders of bilirubin transport. In the specific setting of antiviral therapy, preexisting liver disease or antiviral hepatotoxicity, such as is encountered with the use of the nucleoside and non-nucleoside human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase inhibitors, are the most frequent causes of direct-reacting or mixed direct- and indirect-reacting hyperbilirubinemia. Modification in antiviral drug choice or dose may be required in cases of liver injury or of brisk hemolysis leading to significant anemia. The mild indirect hyperbilirubinemia associated with impairment in conjugation tends to be well tolerated and of little consequence. The decision to continue or discontinue antiviral therapy in the face of hyperbilirubinemia should be made after an assessment of the cause of the elevated bilirubin level and a thorough assessment of the risks and benefits of antiviral therapy.

### An approach to the management of hyperbilirubinemia in the preterm infant less than 35 weeks of gestation [^113ucFkm]. Journal of Perinatology (2012). Low credibility.

We provide an approach to the use of phototherapy and exchange transfusion in the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterm infants of < 35 weeks of gestation. Because there are limited data for evidence-based recommendations, these recommendations are, of necessity, consensus-based. The recommended treatment levels are based on operational thresholds for bilirubin levels and represent those levels beyond which it is assumed that treatment will likely do more good than harm. Long-term follow-up of a large population will be needed to evaluate whether or not these recommendations should be modified.

### Serum bilirubin and ischaemic stroke: a review of literature [^112zDYNz]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the second-leading cause of mortality and the leading cause of long-term disability worldwide. Once ischaemia occurs, excessive oxidative stress ensues and leads to structural and functional damage to the brain, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ischaemic brain damage, especially throughout the acute phase of ischaemic stroke (IS). Compared with other organs, human brain has few sources of endogenous antioxidants, which poses it more vulnerable to oxidative injury. Recently, a number of therapeutics with antioxidants have shown encouraging results in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). Bilirubin, a compound used to diagnose conditions such as hepatobiliary disorders, haemolytic anaemiaand dyserythropoiesis, also known as a potential toxic factor causing severe brain damage in newborns, is not only the end product of the heme catabolic pathway but also the most potent endogenous antioxidant. It has been shown to protect from diverse diseases associated with increased oxidative stress, such as IS. In addition, accumulating evidence has shown that bilirubin harbours anti-inflammatory, neuroprotectiveand platelet activation inhibitingeffects. In this review, we have summarised available evidence regarding the correlation between circulating bilirubin levels and risks of IS as well as the prognosis of AIS in order to verify the usefulness of bilirubin serving as a biomarker for stroke occurrence and prognosis.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

### Hyperbilirubinemia in the term newborn… [^113ZqYGr]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

1, 2 However, hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn period can be associated with severe illnesses such as hemolytic disease, metabolic and endocrine disorders, anatomic abnormalities of the liver, and infections. Jaundice typically results from the deposition of unconjugated bilirubin pigment in the skin and mucus membranes. Depending on the underlying etiology, this condition may present throughout the neonatal period. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, the primary focus of this article, is the most common form of jaundice encountered by family physicians. The separate topic of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is beyond the scope of this article. Risk Factors for Hyperbilirubinemia Infants without identified risk factors rarely have total serum bilirubin levels above 12 mg per dL. As the number of risk factors increases, the potential to develop markedly elevated bilirubin levels also increases.

2 Common risk factors for hyperbilirubinemia include fetal-maternal blood group incompatibility, prematurity, and a previously affected sibling. 2–4 Cephalohematomas, bruising, and trauma from instrumented delivery may increase the risk for serum bilirubin elevation. Delayed meconium passage also increases the risk. Infants with risk factors should be monitored closely during the first days to weeks of life. | Maternal factors Blood type ABO or Rh incompatibility Breastfeeding Drugs: diazepam, oxytocin Ethnicity: Asian, Native American Maternal illness: gestational diabetes|Neonatal factors Birth trauma: cephalohematoma, cutaneous bruising, instrumented delivery Drugs: sulfisoxazole acetyl with erythromycin ethylsuccinate, chloramphenicol Excessive weight loss after birth Infections: TORCH Infrequent feedings Male gender Polycythemia Prematurity Previous sibling with hyperbilirubinemia.

The precise role of bilirubin in the development of kernicterus is not completely understood. If the serum unconjugated bilirubin level exceeds the binding capacity of albumin, unbound lipid-soluble bilirubin crosses the blood-brain barrier. Albumin-bound bilirubin may also cross the blood-brain barrier if damage has occurred because of asphyxia, acidosis, hypoxia, hypoperfusion, hyperosmolality, or sepsis in the newborn.

### Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in the neonate and young infant [^116pxvo2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2018). Low credibility.

Cholestatic jaundice in the first few weeks of life may herald potentially life-threatening pathology. It is therefore incumbent upon the pediatric practitioner to have a high index of suspicion for severe disease when investigating jaundice in a young infant. This article outlines the epidemiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and diagnostic workup for both the most common and the most severe causes of cholestasis in the neonatal period.

### Evaluation of transcutaneous bilirubin levels in healthy and preeclamptic pregnancies: a pilot study [^113RbtaL]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy defined by the new onset of hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation, accompanied by proteinuria and/or signs of maternal organ dysfunction. It complicates approximately 2–8% of all pregnancies and is responsible for at least 17% of maternal deaths worldwide. PE may progress to multiorgan failure and maternal mortality, and it is a major contributor to fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality due to compromised placental perfusion and preterm delivery. Despite extensive research efforts, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of PE remain incompletely elucidated.

Due to its involvement in diverse pathological pathways and its heterogeneous clinical manifestations, PE is frequently described as a "disease of theories". The clinical course of PE can deteriorate rapidly and unpredictably, and currently, the only definitive treatment is delivery. The potential for life-threatening complications — such as acute renal injury, hepatic dysfunction, and neurological, cardiac, or hematologic involvement — has intensified efforts to enhance early diagnosis and risk prediction. Nevertheless, existing predictive tools remain suboptimal. A 2024 study reported a predictive accuracy of only 41% for term PE at a 10% false-positive rate, highlighting the limitations of current diagnostic strategies. Consequently, ongoing research continues to seek improvements in the prediction, diagnosis, and management of PE.

The pathophysiology of PE is characterized by abnormal placental perfusion, tissue hypoxia, and subsequent cellular injury. This injury is commonly associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), a well-established marker of cellular damage. Hemolysis is also a prominent feature, resulting in erythrocyte destruction and the release of bilirubin, a breakdown product of hemoglobin catabolism. Heme is enzymatically degraded by heme oxygenase (HO) into ferrous iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. While bilirubin possesses notable antioxidant properties, it may exert cytotoxic effects when present at elevated concentrations. In the circulation, bilirubin binds tightly to albumin and is transported to the liver, where it undergoes conjugation by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, increasing its solubility and facilitating biliary excretion. Elevated levels of indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin typically reflect hemolysis or impaired hepatic conjugation, whereas increased direct (conjugated) bilirubin suggests biliary obstruction or impaired hepatic excretory function.

### Quantitative systems toxicology identifies independent mechanisms for hepatotoxicity and bilirubin elevations due to AKR1C3 inhibitor BAY1128688 [^116MiUTa]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2023). Medium credibility.

BAY1128688 is a selective inhibitor of AKR1C3, investigated recently in a trial that was prematurely terminated due to drug-induced liver injury. These unexpected observations prompted use of the quantitative systems toxicology model, DILIsym, to determine possible mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Using mechanistic in vitro toxicity data as well as clinical exposure data, DILIsym predicted the potential for BAY1128688 to cause liver toxicity (elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) and elevations in serum bilirubin. Initial simulations overpredicted hepatotoxicity and bilirubin elevations, so the BAY1128688 representation within DILIsym underwent optimization. The liver partition coefficient K p was altered to align simulated bilirubin elevations with those observed clinically. Altering the mode of bile acid canalicular and basolateral efflux inhibition was necessary to accurately predict ALT elevations. Optimization results support that bilirubin elevations observed early during treatment are due to altered bilirubin metabolism and transporter inhibition, which is independent of liver injury. The modeling further supports that on-treatment ALT elevations result from inhibition of bile acid transporters, particularly the bile salt excretory pump, leading to accumulation of toxic bile acids. The predicted dose-dependent intrinsic hepatotoxicity may increase patient susceptibility to an adaptive immune response, accounting for ALT elevations observed after completion of treatment. These BAY1128688 simulations provide insight into the mechanisms behind hepatotoxicity and bilirubin elevations and may inform the potential risk posed by future compounds.

### Hyperbilirubinemia: subcortical mechanisms of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction [^1155jJAg]. Pediatric Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Although development of the full syndrome of kernicterus is relatively rare, neonatal jaundice continues to occur frequently. Controversy remains concerning whether or not infants with moderate elevations in bilirubin are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders in later childhood. Sites of brain pathology associated with bilirubin neurotoxicity are identified and well established. Based on these regions of brain involvement, we apply neuroscientific principles of brain-behavior relationships to predict types of cognitive features that may accompany hyperbilirubinemia. We address a range of neurodevelopmental abnormalities that can arise as a function of elevated neonatal bilirubin levels affecting these brain regions, even in the absence of full kernicterus syndrome. Moreover, we explain the neuropathologic mechanisms that would drive these abnormalities. We thus attempt to establish a blueprint for future investigations of these conditions, to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes.

### The patient presenting with isolated hyperbilirubinemia [^114SbPka]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2009). Low credibility.

Hyperbilirubinemia is a common laboratory finding in clinical practice, being found in several haematological and liver diseases as well as in familial conditions (5–10% in Western countries). Although most of the familial forms of hyperbilirubinemia are classically viewed as benign conditions, they have gained an increased interest in the last few years since recent data have indicated that subjects with an impaired bilirubin metabolism may have an increased susceptibility to drug toxicity. The authors briefly review the main steps of bilirubin metabolism, with a special emphasis on the emerging concepts on the molecular mechanisms of regulation by nuclear receptors (NRs) and genetic factors. Then the different forms of isolated hyperbilirubinemia occurring in both adults and paediatrics are systematically analysed, and a new categorisation is also proposed in light of the recent advances in bilirubin research. Finally, a diagnostic algorithm is discussed, along with a correct approach to its management, in order to avoid unnecessary medical investigations.

### Evaluation of jaundice in adults [^115Txxj6]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Jaundice is an indication of hyperbilirubinemia and is caused by derangements in bilirubin metabolism. It is typically apparent when serum bilirubin levels exceed 3 mg/dL and can indicate serious underlying disease of the liver or biliary tract. A comprehensive medical history, review of systems, and physical examination are essential for differentiating potential causes such as alcoholic liver disease, biliary strictures, choledocholithiasis, drug-induced liver injury, hemolysis, or hepatitis. Initial laboratory evaluation should include assays for bilirubin (total and fractionated), a complete blood cell count, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time, and international normalized ratio. Measuring fractionated bilirubin allows for determination of whether the hyperbilirubinemia is conjugated or unconjugated. Ultrasonography of the abdomen, computed tomography with intravenous contrast media, and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are first-line options for patients presenting with jaundice, depending on the suspected underlying etiology. If the etiology of jaundice is unclear despite laboratory testing and imaging, liver biopsy may be required to establish the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of the disease.

### Jaundice in the adult patient [^116MrcMJ]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Jaundice in an adult patient can be caused by a wide variety of benign or life-threatening disorders. Organizing the differential diagnosis by prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic causes may help make the work-up more manageable. Prehepatic causes of jaundice include hemolysis and hematoma resorption, which lead to elevated levels of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. Intrahepatic disorders can lead to unconjugated or conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. The conjugated (direct) bilirubin level is often elevated by alcohol, infectious hepatitis, drug reactions, and autoimmune disorders. Posthepatic disorders also can cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Gallstone formation is the most common and benign posthepatic process that causes jaundice; however, the differential diagnosis also includes serious conditions such as biliary tract infection, pancreatitis, and malignancies. The laboratory work-up should begin with a urine test for bilirubin, which indicates that conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is present. If the complete blood count and initial tests for liver function and infectious hepatitis are unrevealing, the work-up typically proceeds to abdominal imaging by ultrasonography or computed tomographic scanning. In a few instances, more invasive procedures such as cholangiography or liver biopsy may be needed to arrive at a diagnosis.

### AASLD practice guidance on acute-on-chronic liver failure and the management of critically ill patients with cirrhosis [^1147pTFE]. Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

AASLD practice guidance — definition and core elements of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF): We suggest that the presence of all of the following elements are minimum critical components for the definition of ACLF: (1) acute onset with rapid deterioration in clinical condition, (2) the presence of liver failure defined by elevated bilirubin and elevated INR in patients with chronic liver disease with or without cirrhosis, and (3) the presence of at least one extrahepatic (neurologic, circulatory, respiratory, or renal) organ failure. Although specific criteria to define ACLF vary by region, organ failure is common to all ACLF definitions, and there are three major definitions with a fourth by the World Gastroenterology Organization; thresholds used in definitions include coagulopathy with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.5–2.5 or above and bilirubin cutoffs of 5–12 mg/dL. Critically ill patients with cirrhosis are at a high risk of mortality within 1–3 months.

### Association of SLCO1B1 genetic variants with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia: a consolidated analysis of 36 studies [^114pQ2sN]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, commonly known as jaundice, is a prevalent condition affecting both premature and full-term infants, often leading to hospitalization within the first week of life. It is estimated that approximately 60% of term infants and about 80% of preterm infants experience jaundice, with the highest risk observed in infants born before 35 weeks gestation. Severe neonatal jaundice (SNJ) presents a critical global health challenge, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). The prevalence of jaundice among hospitalized neonates in these regions ranges form 0.73–3.34%, with approximately 14.26% of jaundiced neonates classified as having SNJ. This highlights a substantial healthcare burden. Clinical complications associated with neonatal jaundice include bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction, kernicterus, and acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE). The necessity for exchange blood transfusions (EBT) can also arise in severe cases. Rates of EBT range between 0.74% and 3.81%, while ABE occurs with a frequency of 0.16–2.75%.

The diagnosis of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia primarily relies on a physical examination and the assessment of serum bilirubin levels, with jaundice becoming clinically evident when bilirubin levels exceed 85 µmol/dl (5 mg/dl). Key indicators of pathological jaundice include early onset, elevated bilirubin levels, and significant clinical symptoms. The pathophysiology of hyperbilirubinemia stems from an imbalance between bilirubin production and elimination. While low bilirubin levels are generally considered harmless and may even confer antioxidant benefits, elevated levels pose serious risks, potentially leading to bilirubin encephalopathy and central nervous system complications. Treatment strategies for jaundice are determined by its severity and underlying cause. Common interventions include phototherapy, exchange transfusion in critical cases, and enhanced feeding techniques. Prolonged unconjugated bilirubin levels that remain untreated can lead to bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND) and, in severe cases, may result in death from kernicterus. Jaundice generally resolves within a week in the absence of complications such as inadequate oral intake, hypoxia, fetal-maternal blood group incompatibility, infection, sepsis, or hepatic disorders.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^116mvcWW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevation in aminotransferase levels.

The commonest liver test abnormalities reported are mild to moderate elevations in ALT and AST levels (seen in 14–53% of cases). Significant elevations of ALT and AST are commoner in those with other digestive symptoms. Raised liver aminotransferases are associated with significantly longer hospital stays. A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 5,771 adult COVID-19 patients found AST to increase initially followed by ALT. Aspartate transaminase abnormalities were associated with the highest risk of mortality. Although ALT is more specific to the liver, higher AST levels may be associated with injury to other organs or because of mitochondrial injury and should thus be interpreted with caution.

Elevations in bilirubin levels.

Elevated bilirubin levels are observed in 20–40% of patients and 10% had very high levels. Bilirubin levels are significantly higher in those with severe disease and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Most of the studies do not indicate whether the hypebilirubinemia is of the direct or indirect type. A study from Spain found a biphasic pattern of hyperbilirubinemia, initially hepatocellular and later cholestatic in type. This suggests that the elevation of bilirubin may be because of both direct hepatic injury and cholestasis. In addition to the increase in serum total bilirubin levels, raised conjugated bilirubin levels and conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin ratios were observed in COVID-19 patients. The high bilirubin levels may also be related to hemolysis. Further studies would delineate the predominant pathogenesis of elevated bilirubin levels in COVID-19.

### Etiologies of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in infancy: a systematic review of 1692 subjects [^11134N7L]. BMC Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Limitations

Infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia presents with persistent jaundice as part of a clinical constellation that may include other symptoms based on the underlying etiology. The differential diagnosis is broad and requires timely evaluation. The data presented in this review suggest that INH, EHBA, and infection (with CMV being the most common infection) account for 63.36% of all cases of infants presenting with elevated serum concentrations of conjugated bilirubin.

The diagnostic evaluation should be guided by symptomatology and may include various imaging studies and serologic, hematologic, and urine investigations for various infections and endocrinopathies, as well as genetic testing for inborn errors of metabolism. While the definitive diagnosis of EHBA requires a percutaneous liver biopsy, ongoing research is investigating less invasive methods of differentiating EHBA from other etiologies of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Inconsistency of the diagnostic approach is a major limitation of this review. While there are general guidelines directing the evaluation of an infant with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, reports published prior to establishment of these guidelines are included in the present review. Moreover, diagnostic practices vary by country and multiple studies focused on the ability of a specific radiologic test to differentiate EHBA from other causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Together, these conditions may introduce inherent disparities in evaluation and may contribute to bias among these studies.

Variability in sample populations is also a potential source of bias. While 12 countries and 5 continents are represented, there is no data from Eastern Europe or South America. Disorders that may be uniquely prevalent in these areas may be underrepresented. Finally, summary data that includes subjects from all over the world may be less relevant to any specific country given the uneven distribution of etiologies between developed and developing countries as well as diseases endemic to the East and West.

Finally, the use of the category of INH to include all idiopathic cases of infantile conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a potential source of bias in this review. While Ipek et. al defined INH as conjugated hyperbilirubinemia that persists beyond 3 months without another identifiable cause, multiple studies did not specifically use the term INH or provide a definition.

Evaluating elevated direct-reacting or conjugated bilirubin — laboratory practices and interpretation: In some laboratories, either a direct or conjugated bilirubin concentration is measured whenever a TSB is measured, direct and conjugated bilirubin are different, direct bilirubin concentrations are higher and more variable than conjugated bilirubin and tend to increase with the TSB, and reference ranges for direct bilirubin measurements vary by clinical laboratory.
