## Question

can we do a steroid injection to shoulder with out X-ray

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a shoulder steroid injection can be performed without X-ray guidance, and under what circumstances that is reasonable and safe. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "without X-ray" really means in practice — does that imply landmark-guided or ultrasound-guided injections. Then, I should verify the comparative evidence on image guidance versus landmark-guided injections for shoulder pain conditions. Next, I will review accuracy data by injection site and technique. After that, I need to check guideline positions and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, condition-specific recommendation and note exceptions where imaging is preferred or required.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate modalities. "Without X-ray" in this context typically means either landmark-guided ("blind") injection or ultrasound-guided injection, since ultrasound does not involve ionizing radiation, whereas X-ray or fluoroscopy does. So the real question is whether landmark-guided injections are acceptable compared with image-guided options, and whether ultrasound meaningfully changes outcomes or safety in a way that mandates its use.

> Next, I should review the highest-quality comparative evidence. The 2021 Cochrane review of 19 randomized trials found that ultrasound-guided shoulder injections probably provide little or no clinically important benefit over landmark-guided injections for pain or function at 3–6 weeks, and low-certainty evidence suggested no clear reduction in adverse events with ultrasound guidance, concluding that the added cost of image guidance appears unjustified based on current outcomes data [^116o2cEE]. Wait, let me verify consistency with earlier work. The 2012 Cochrane review similarly found no significant advantage of ultrasound over landmark or intramuscular injection for pain, function, or safety, reinforcing that imaging does not reliably translate into better patient-relevant outcomes in shoulder pain syndromes [^1167AWgC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — accuracy and outcomes are not identical. I need to check whether improved needle placement with ultrasound actually changes clinical results. Multiple randomized trials show ultrasound increases accuracy for glenohumeral and subacromial injections, yet fail to demonstrate clinically meaningful superiority in pain or function versus landmark techniques, including in adhesive capsulitis and subacromial impingement, which supports a disconnect between technical accuracy and patient-centered benefit in many shoulder conditions [^114JUjnu] [^117Tv6ej] [^117DvyXr]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought landmark-guided glenohumeral injections were only about 45% accurate; let me reconsider — more recent work shows that with refined landmark approaches, accuracy can approach 78–94% in experienced hands, which helps explain why outcomes may still be acceptable despite lower technical precision than ultrasound [^116CxwTE] [^112d5brj].

> I should confirm guideline positions to ensure my interpretation aligns with consensus. Contemporary multisociety pain guidelines state that ultrasound increases accuracy and can reduce procedural pain, but emphasize that there is little evidence to mandate image guidance for improved patient outcomes across shoulder indications, and that clinicians should use the modality with which they are most experienced and comfortable, balancing cost, access, and patient-specific factors [^115nb56B] [^115kH4Ru]. The AAOS guidance for rotator cuff–related pain supports considering a single corticosteroid injection for short-term improvement without specifying image guidance as mandatory, again reflecting that outcomes are acceptable with appropriately performed landmark injections in routine care [^115G1EWS] [^117HsVJs].

> Let me think about site-specific nuances, because accuracy varies by target. For subacromial-subdeltoid bursa injections, landmark approaches can be highly accurate when performed correctly, and randomized data show no consistent superiority of ultrasound over landmark for pain or function, supporting the use of landmark technique when operators are skilled and anatomy is straightforward [^113v1qE9] [^117Tv6ej]. For glenohumeral joint injections, accuracy is more variable with landmarks, but even when ultrasound improves accuracy, randomized trials in frozen shoulder have not shown better clinical outcomes than landmark-guided injections, suggesting that landmark injections remain reasonable in many patients [^114JUjnu]. But wait, what if the target is the biceps tendon sheath or a complex peri-tendinous site? Here, guidelines and data favor ultrasound because accuracy and outcomes are notably better than landmark techniques, so I should recommend ultrasound for these technically demanding targets [^114R48Az] [^111BPNKk].

> I need to ensure safety is addressed. Serious adverse events are rare with shoulder injections regardless of guidance, and major complications like infection or tendon rupture are uncommon but can occur; they are more related to technique, sterility, and injection into tendon substance than to whether imaging was used. Systemic corticosteroid effects such as transient hyperglycemia or HPA axis suppression are possible but are not shown to be more frequent with landmark versus image-guided injections in the appendicular skeleton, and fracture risk has not been linked to cumulative injection dose in large cohort data, which reassures me that judicious landmark injections are not inherently unsafe when performed properly [^1174Lit2] [^1167k7Zw] [^113JYMFM] [^114zuUK2]. I should double-check that avoiding intratendinous injection and using sterile technique are emphasized regardless of guidance modality, which they are in primary care and sports medicine guidance [^116o2cEE].

> Next, I should review practical dosing and interval considerations so I don't over- or under-treat. Evidence and guidelines support that 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for shoulder intra-articular and subacromial injections, and that repeating injections should be spaced by at least 2–3 weeks, typically no more often than every 3 months, with shared decision-making about repeats based on response and risk profile [^115nb56B] [^115kH4Ru] [^117STssm]. Let me verify that this aligns with pragmatic trials; yes, large trials have used 20–40 mg triamcinolone or equivalent with acceptable short-term benefits and no clear dose-response advantage at higher doses, reinforcing the preference for lower effective doses [^1173PnZ9] [^116jLceC].

> I will now examine condition-specific scenarios where I should be cautious about relying solely on landmarks. In patients with marked obesity, atypical anatomy, revision injections after failed landmark attempts, or when the clinical target is uncertain (for example, distinguishing biceps from rotator cuff or AC joint pain), ultrasound improves accuracy and may reduce repeated attempts, so image guidance is reasonable even if it does not guarantee superior outcomes in every study [^115nb56B] [^1142b5Xq]. Hold on, I should verify pediatric and young adult contexts; guidelines for juvenile idiopathic arthritis conditionally recommend image guidance for difficult-to-access joints including the shoulder, which supports a lower threshold for ultrasound in less experienced hands or complex anatomy [^114Wi89o].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, shoulder steroid injections can be performed without X-ray guidance. Landmark-guided injections are acceptable and supported by evidence and guidelines for many common shoulder pain conditions, with the caveat that operator experience, patient anatomy, and the specific target matter. Ultrasound increases accuracy and may reduce procedural pain, but high-quality evidence does not show consistent, clinically important improvements in pain or function over landmark-guided injections for most shoulder indications, so routine image guidance is not mandated. Use ultrasound selectively for technically challenging targets like the biceps tendon sheath, for patients with challenging anatomy, after failed landmark attempts, or when training and resources make it feasible without undue delay or cost [^116Grb9k] [^115nb56B] [^114R48Az].

---

In most cases, **shoulder steroid injections can be performed without X-ray guidance** [^1167AWgC], as landmark-based injections are standard in primary care and sports medicine [^116o2cEE]. Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy and may reduce procedural pain [^115nb56B], but **does not consistently improve short-term outcomes** over landmark-guided injections [^116Grb9k] [^114JUjnu]. X-ray or fluoroscopy is reserved for complex anatomy, prior failed injections, or when precise joint targeting is critical [^114Wi89o]. Serious complications are rare; clinicians should use sterile technique, avoid tendon injection, and tailor guidance to patient factors and experience [^116Grb9k].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting injections without X-ray guidance

Multiple studies and reviews show that **landmark-guided shoulder injections are effective and safe** for common conditions such as subacromial impingement, rotator cuff tendinopathy, and adhesive capsulitis:

- **Cochrane review (2021)**: Ultrasound-guided injections offer little or no clinically important benefit over landmark-guided injections for pain or function at 3–6 weeks [^116Grb9k].

- **Randomized controlled trials**: No significant differences in pain or function between ultrasound-guided and landmark-guided injections for subacromial impingement or adhesive capsulitis [^117Tv6ej] [^114JUjnu].

- **Systematic reviews**: Similar short-term outcomes between ultrasound-guided and landmark-guided injections, with no consistent superiority of imaging guidance [^1167AWgC] [^116Grb9k].

---

## Accuracy of landmark-guided injections

Accuracy varies by technique and experience, but **experienced clinicians achieve high rates**:

- **Subacromial injections**: Accuracy ranges from 70–92% depending on approach and experience [^117DvyXr] [^113v1qE9].

- **Glenohumeral injections**: Accuracy ranges from 71–100% with experienced providers [^114JUjnu] [^116CxwTE].

- **Biceps tendon sheath**: Landmark accuracy is lower (~27%), favoring ultrasound when targeting this structure [^111BPNKk].

---

## Clinical outcomes: landmark-guided vs. image-guided injections

Outcomes are **generally comparable** between landmark- and image-guided injections:

| **Outcome measure** | **Landmark-guided** | **Image-guided** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Pain relief | Effective short-term relief | Similar relief | No significant difference [^116Grb9k] [^1167AWgC] |
| Functional improvement | Effective short-term improvement | Similar improvement | No significant difference [^116Grb9k] [^1167AWgC] |
| Accuracy | Moderate to high (70–92%) | High (90–100%) | Slight advantage to image guidance [^117DvyXr] [^112d5brj] |
| Complications | Rare and similar | Rare and similar | No significant difference [^116Grb9k] [^1167AWgC] |

---

## Safety considerations and complications

Serious complications are rare; **common issues are mild and self-limited**:

- **Local effects**: Transient pain flare, skin atrophy, depigmentation, infection (rare) [^1174Lit2].

- **Systemic effects**: Temporary hyperglycemia, adrenal suppression (rare with single doses) [^115THbhk].

- **Tendon rupture**: Rare, often related to direct tendon injection or pre-existing degeneration [^113JYMFM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines support landmark-guided injections as standard care, with **image guidance reserved for specific scenarios**:

- **AAFP**: Landmark-guided injections are appropriate for most shoulder conditions; ultrasound may improve accuracy but does not consistently improve outcomes [^116TUc9a].

- **AAOS**: Single corticosteroid injection can be considered for short-term pain relief in rotator cuff disease; guidance method not specified [^115G1EWS].

- **Multisociety guidelines**: Use the modality with which the clinician is most experienced; ultrasound increases accuracy but does not consistently improve outcomes [^115nb56B].

---

## Situations where X-ray or imaging guidance may be beneficial

Imaging guidance is **helpful in select scenarios**:

- **Complex anatomy**: Revision surgery, significant deformity, or obesity.

- **Failed landmark injections**: Persistent symptoms after accurate landmark injection.

- **Precise targeting**: Glenohumeral joint in adhesive capsulitis, biceps tendon sheath, or AC joint [^114R48Az] [^112E8DTM].

- **Training**: Ultrasound is useful for teaching and verifying placement [^116TUc9a].

---

## Summary of evidence

Overall, **landmark-guided shoulder steroid injections are effective and safe** for most patients, with outcomes comparable to image-guided injections. Ultrasound improves accuracy and may reduce procedural pain, but does not consistently improve short-term outcomes. X-ray or fluoroscopy is rarely needed and is reserved for complex cases or when precise joint targeting is critical [^116Grb9k] [^115nb56B] [^114Wi89o].

---

Shoulder steroid injections can be performed **without X-ray guidance**, as landmark-guided injections are effective and safe for most patients. Imaging guidance may improve accuracy but does not consistently improve short-term outcomes, and should be reserved for specific clinical scenarios.

Injected substances

For therapeutic injections, steroids are most commonly employed. Triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg/ml) or methylpredinosolone acetate (40 mg/ml) are widely used in North America at a dose ranging from 10 mg or less for small articulations to 40 mg for large articulations. In Europe, cortivazol (3.75 mg/1.5 ml) is the most frequently administered formulation. These different steroids have a tendency to form particles, which can be source of deleterious effects or complications. For this reason, it is recommended to substitute a non-particulate steroid, such as dexamethasone sodium phosphate (10 mg/ml), in specific circumstances that are beyond the scope of this paper. Steroids can be mixed with a liberal amount of local anaesthetic.

For diagnostic injections, the injectate is iodinated contrast medium (at a concentration of 240 mgI/ml or less) for CT arthrography, and a dilution of 1/200 to 1/250 of gadolinium chelates in iodinated contrast medium or sterile saline (reaching a concentration of 0.0020–0.0025 mmol/ml) for MR arthrography. Although not approved by the United States Food and Drug Association, mixing iodinated contrast media with gadolinium chelates has been done for many years now in North America and other countries with no harmful effects. On the other hand, ready-to-inject preparations are commercialised in most European countries and should thus be favoured.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) dosing, imaging selection, injection intervals, efficacy duration, and adverse effects are summarized for musculoskeletal injections. US requires expertise; hence the physician should employ the imaging modality with which they are most experienced and comfortable. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. For dosing, a dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg TA for shoulder IACS, the most commonly used dose for hip IACS was 40 mg TA or MPA, and triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. For frequency, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks between injections, up to 3 months, and overall, IACS results in short-term (4 weeks to 3 months) pain relief. Adverse effects from IACS are related to the procedure and corticosteroid exposure and include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage, reduction of BMD, and PJI.

### The use and safety of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain in general practice: a retrospective cohort study [^116NJU8y]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Guidelines for shoulder pain in general practice recommend treatment with corticosteroid injections (CSI) if initial pain management fails. However, little is known about the actual use and safety of CSIs in treatment by general practitioners (GP).

Objective

The objective of this study was to gain insight into the use and safety of CSIs for patients with a new episode of shoulder pain in general practice.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a healthcare database containing the electronic medical records of approximately 200,000 patients in general practice. A search algorithm was constructed to identify patients with a new episode of shoulder pain between January 2012 and December 2017. Data on the use of CSIs in 2 random samples (n = 1,000) were manually validated for a 12-month period after the diagnosis.

Results

In total, 26% of the patients with a new episode of shoulder pain received a CSI. The patient's age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.04) and a history of shoulder pain (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.13–2.12) were significantly associated with the administration of a CSI. Half of the patients received the CSI in the first consultation. The patient's age was positively associated with the likelihood of receiving the CSI in the first consultation (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.02). No serious adverse reactions were recorded by the GP.

Conclusion

In contrast to the guidelines, CSIs were frequently administered in the first consultation. Older patients and patients with a history of shoulder pain were more likely to receive a CSI for shoulder pain.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^111HTWLH]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Limitations of study

Firstly, without a no-treatment group the role of the true placebo effect cannot be separated from the placebo response including all non-specific and contextual effects. Exploring the specific influence from the natural history and from concomitant physiotherapy would have been of particular interest. However, with all factors equal except the specific part of the treatments in question, we conclude that the observation of comparable outcomes in all three groups excludes a specific effect of deposit lavage or corticosteroid injection at four months in this study.

Secondly, the large number of treatment switchers after the four month follow-up makes estimating the true effectiveness of the experimental treatments at the later follow-ups difficult. The point of primary interest for the determination of treatment effectiveness in this study, however, was the four month result, which we selected because earlier studies with repeated measurements over the first six months have shown that the main effect from lavage can be expected early. The frequent occurrence of treatment switching is by itself an important finding, as it reflects an insufficient effectiveness of the study treatments.

Thirdly, the lower limit for inclusion was a 5 mm deposit, and one may argue that lavage is more effective in larger calcifications. Separate analysis of 124 patients with a large deposit (≥ 12.5 mm), however, showed comparable results between treatment groups (supplementary table D). Although the study was not powered for this analysis, the differences between the groups were small and we think it unlikely that analysis of a larger group would have changed this result.

Fourthly, selection bias may have influenced the study results. The study was done in secondary public health services, and we cannot exclude the possibility that patients treated in primary or private settings differ from our study population. Patients who consent to participate in a study that includes sham treatment might also have a more positive and optimistic attitude and thus differ from the general population.

### Intra-articular steroids for adhesive capsulitis… [^117SE4jX]. AAFP (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Do intra-articular steroid injections improve pain and function in patients with adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER Intra-articular steroid injections inconsistently improve pain and function when used to treat adhesive capsulitis in the short term and medium term. Ultrasound guidance improves accuracy of injection into the glenohumeral joint, but there is no difference in pain at 3, 6, and 12 weeks compared with landmark-guided injection. EVIDENCE SUMMARY A 2020 systematic review and meta-analysis of 65 randomized trials compared the relative effectiveness of nonsurgical treatments for adhesive capsulitis.

1 The systematic review included studies that were randomized designs of any type comparing treatment modalities with placebo injection, no treatment, or other treatment modalities. Primary outcomes were pain and function, and the secondary outcome was shoulder external rotation range of motion. Pain was evaluated using a 0- to 10-point visual analog scale, with lower numbers indicating less pain. Because the studies used different functional scores, standardized mean differences were used in the overall analysis. Shoulder external rotation ROM was measured in degrees. Minimal clinically important differences were defined as 1 point for VAS pain, an effect size of 0. 45 for functional score, and 10 degrees for ROM. SubscribeFrom $180

Subacromial-subdeltoid bursa (SASDB) injections — interval and repeat dosing guidance: For painful shoulder disorders, there is insufficient data to select a preferred corticosteroid injection (CSI) approach for SASDB injections, and the guideline suggests spacing injections with a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks, up to 3 months, with any repeat injection based on shared decision-making that balances pain intensity and potential adverse events.

### Technical tips to perform safe and effective ultrasound guided steroid joint injections in children [^114uc99n]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2015). Low credibility.

In our institution we inject a wide variety of joints using a variety of imaging modalities. We utilize US alone in the joints in which the intra-articular position of the needle as well as the injection of the medication can be clearly seen by this method. This article focuses in these group of joint which include: ankle, knee, hip, radio-carpal and inter-phalangeal joints. A combination of US and fluoroscopy (with injection of iodinated contrast) is used in the shoulder, elbow, carpal, subtalar and mid-foot joints. US is combined with cross sectional imaging (Computed Tomography (CT) or C-arm CT) in the injection of the temporomandibular joints and sacroiliac joints.

The steroid that we use is long-acting triamcinolone hexacetonide (Aristospan R, Sandoz Canada Inc, 20 mg/ml) and is injected preferably with 25 gauge 1 1/2 inches needles (Precision Glide Needle, Becton Dickinson & Co, Franklin Lakes, NJ). The needle can be flushed with local anesthetic prior to the injection to avoid air injection that will decrease tip visualization. Luer lock or slip syringes can be used. Slip syringes may help trainees to understand that no pressure is necessary when injecting the steroid into the joint space. If the needle touches the bone or cartilage or if there is resistance to the injection of the steroid, the needle is slightly withdrawn and gentle injection of the medication under direct US visualization is performed to make sure that there is no extravasation of the steroid into the adjacent soft tissues. We routinely inject a small amount of local anesthetic (Lidocaine 1%) after the steroid to provide rapid release of pain/discomfort and to push the steroid into the joint space. Over distention of the joint should be avoided to prevent or diminish post procedural pain.

Potential complications of the procedure include pain, bleeding, infection, skin atrophy, blood/nerve damage, and joint calcifications. The physician performing the procedure should be aware of the main vascular and neural structures located close to the joints to be injected.

### Image-guided versus blind glucocorticoid injection for shoulder pain [^1167AWgC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Traditionally, glucocorticoid injection for the treatment of shoulder pain has been performed guided by anatomical landmarks alone. With the advent of readily available imaging tools such as ultrasound, image-guided injections have increasingly become accepted into routine care. While there is some evidence that the use of imaging improves accuracy, it is unclear from current evidence whether or not it improves patient-relevant outcomes.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess whether image-guided glucocorticoid injections improve patient-relevant outcomes compared to landmark-guided or systemic intramuscular injections in patients with shoulder pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid), and EMBASE (Ovid) to June 2011. We also searched the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) to identify ongoing trials and screened reference lists of retrieved review articles and trials to identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared image-guided glucocorticoid injection to landmark-guided or systemic intramuscular injection. Outcomes of interest included pain, function, range of motion, proportion of participants with overall improvement and adverse events. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data and performed a risk of bias assessment. Disagreement about inclusion or exclusion of individual studies and risk of bias was resolved by a third review author.

Main Results

Five studies (290 participants) were included in the review. The image-guided groups in all trials used ultrasound to guide injection. Four studies included participants with rotator cuff disease; in three the comparator was local landmarks to direct injection into the subacromial bursa and in the fourth the comparator was systemic intramuscular injection into the upper gluteal muscles in the buttock region. One study included participants with adhesive capsulitis and injection was directed into the glenohumeral joint by either ultrasound or anatomical landmark guidance. No significant differences between groups were observed with respect to reduction in pain at one to two weeks (two trials, 146 participants, standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.44, 95% CI -4.14 to 1.26), or function at one to two weeks (two trials, 146 participants, SMD 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.29 to 3.20; back-translated to mean difference (MD) 4 points, 95% CI -5 to 13, on a 0 to 100 point scale, higher score means better function) or six weeks (three trials, 207 participants, SMD 0.63, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.33; back-translated to MD -3 points, 95% CI -11 to 5, on a 0 to 100 point scale) and the sensitivity analyses did not alter these results. While there was a significant difference between groups with respect to reduction in pain at six weeks favouring image guidance (three trials, 207 participants, SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.46 to -0.14), there was considerable statistical heterogeneity and after removing trials with inadequate allocation concealment and inadequate blinding in a sensitivity analysis, the difference was no longer significant (one trial, 106 participants, MD -0.60 points, 95% CI -1.44 to 0.24 points on a 9-point scale). No statistical difference in adverse events between groups was identified (10/104 image-guided group versus 16/103 comparator; risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.85). Minor adverse events reported included transient post-injection pain, facial redness and warmth.

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon moderate evidence from five trials, our review was unable to establish any advantage in terms of pain, function, shoulder range of motion or safety, of ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection for shoulder disorders over either landmark-guided or intramuscular injection. The lack of any added benefit of ultrasound guided subacromial bursal injection over glucocorticoid injection administered into the upper gluteal muscles of the buttock suggests that the benefits of glucocorticoid may arise through systemic rather than local effects. Therefore, although ultrasound guidance may improve the accuracy of injection to the putative site of pathology in the shoulder, it is not clear that this improves its efficacy to justify the significant added cost.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^114WkgjA]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Corticosteroid injections for adult chronic joint pain are described with use, techniques, and safety considerations. Pain in the shoulder, hip, knees, or fingers is common in patients over 40 years of age, and peripheral joint injections are used after failure of conservative management with the objective of reducing pain and improving function. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) and other musculoskeletal injections alleviate inflammation and reduce pain, improve function, facilitate rehabilitation, or give some temporary relief until definitive treatment, for example, surgery, can be undertaken, and injections include local anesthetic, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), mesenchymal stromal cells, and corticosteroid. For patients with joint pain, such injections are performed using landmark techniques or guided by ultrasound (US) or fluoroscopy. Clinical studies revealed corticosteroid-related adverse events; these include decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary axis, increase in blood sugar, and postoperative joint infection, and these events are compounded by clinicians injecting amounts higher than minimally effective doses; moreover, there has been no publication that compared the safety of the different procedures with landmark, US, or fluoroscopy across the joints' spectrum.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^113FKPEQ]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Statistical analysis

We present categorical baseline data as number of cases with percentages and continuous data as means with standard deviations. We used a linear mixed model for repeated measurements for analysis. Analyses of the primary and secondary continuous outcomes (OSS; QuickDASH; VAS for pain at rest, at night, and during activity; EQ-5D-5L) were adjusted for baseline differences and were performed according to intention to treat. We estimated the linear mixed model by using linear maximum likelihood and included a random intercept, measure of the baseline value as a covariate, and observation time after intervention and type of intervention with their interaction term as factors. We used mean differences (95% confidence intervals) between groups at all follow-ups from the linear mixed model to assess differences between interventions. We considered a two sided P value ≤ 0.05 to be significant. We did post hoc pairwise comparisons for the primary outcome with P value adjustments according to Bonferroni. We handled missing values by using mixed model analysis. We did supplementary per protocol analyses on the four month and 24 month results of the OSS based on the patients who had adhered to the allocated treatment regimen. For patients who had received supplementary treatment, we present the number of cases in each supplementary treatment group and mean values on the OSS at baseline and at four and 24 months.

We did several exploratory analyses for the impact of prespecified categorical factors on the OSS at the four month follow-up. We used two way between groups analysis of variance to explore the effect of treatment group and deposit size at baseline, of treatment group and deposit appearance at follow-up, and of treatment group and adherence to the exercise programme. We used supplementary one way analysis of variance to compare the effect of treatment group on the primary outcome separately for the two groups of deposit sizes. We used an independent t test to assess the effect of the volume of retrieved calcium during lavage on the result. We used one way analysis of variance to investigate the influence of appearance of deposit on the OSS at 24 months. We investigated the relation between the patients' positive and negative treatment expectations and the outcome on the OSS at four months by using the Pearson correlation coefficient. We assessed the success of blinding by calculating the blinding index according to James at three time points. We investigated clinical safety by assessing procedure related complications and adverse events in a descriptive manner. We used Stata/SE 17.0 and SPSS version 28 for statistical analyses.

### Local and systemic side effects of corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal indications [^1174Lit2]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2024). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid injections can be associated with a range of potential side effects, which may be classified as local or systemic and further stratified as immediate or delayed in onset. Radiologists performing image-guided musculoskeletal injections should recognize the potential side effects of corticosteroid medication when counseling patients before injection and consider such side effects in planning individual injections. This Review summarizes the available evidence regarding the local and systemic side effects of corticosteroid injections performed for musculoskeletal indications. Local side effects include postinjection flare, skin hypopigmentation and atrophy, infection, tendon rupture, accelerated progression of osteoarthritis, and osseous injury. Systemic side effects include adrenal suppression or insufficiency, facial flushing, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and osteoporosis. Additional targeted counseling is warranted regarding side effects that are specific to certain patient populations (i.e., premenopausal women, patients with diabetes, athletes, and pediatric patients). Corticosteroid injections are contraindicated in the presence of superficial or deep infection, fracture, or a prosthetic joint. Guidelines on the frequency, duration, and maximal lifetime use of corticosteroid injections are currently lacking. Further research is needed regarding the long-term complications of continuous corticosteroid use, particularly with regard to osseous effects.

Shoulder intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) and subacromial-subdeltoid bursa (SASDB) injections — dose response and comparative efficacy: An randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed no difference in efficacy between triamcinolone acetonide (TA) 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg for IACS with reduction in SPADI at 6 months. In adhesive capsulitis/shoulder joint stiffness, two RCTs showed no difference between TA 20 mg and 40 mg, with one trial reporting equal effectiveness up to 12 weeks and another noting relief up to 12 months. For SASDB, in 79 subjects with primary osteoarthritis/full-thickness rotator cuff tear, ultrasound-guided (USG) TA 20 mg or 40 mg versus placebo at 8 weeks showed improved pain VAS and active ROM over placebo without differences between TA doses. Another SASDB RCT randomized 62 subjects by preparation (methylprednisolone acetate [MPA] vs TA) and dose (20 mg vs 40 mg) and found no differences between groups by preparation or dose. A systematic review showed equal efficacy between NSAIDs and corticosteroids in SASDB injections.

### Editorial commentary: "Doctor, are you sure the steroid injection won' T harm my shoulder? " perhaps we should stop injecting corticosteroids and just repair those rotator cuffs [^111YfpYV]. Arthroscopy (2019). Medium credibility.

Analysis of insurance records indicates that 2 or more corticosteroid injections before rotator cuff repair could triple the odds of revision. The cause-and-effect relationship cannot be ascertained because it remains unclear whether steroids worsen outcomes or are injected in shoulders that are worse to start with. Registry studies cannot adjust for lesional determinants of prognosis and should be interpreted with caution to avoid depriving patients from safe and simple treatments to delay or circumvent surgery. The risks of corticosteroids could be mitigated using radiographically guided infiltration and, ultimately, by rapid surgical repair in young patients before the advent of fatty infiltration and tendon retraction.

Injection guidance methods — landmark, fluoroscopy, and ultrasound: Our literature search did not show a study that compared fluoroscopy with landmark-based injection. Overall, studies showed improved accuracy of US-guided (USG) over landmark-based injections. One review showed the US to have improved accuracy over fluoroscopy in glenohumeral joint injections, but did not reach statistical significance. Two other studies showed comparable results in accuracy, pain relief, and functional outcomes between US-guided and fluoroscopy-guided glenohumeral joint injections. A study showed significantly better accuracy with US compared with fluoroscopy in injections around the long head of the biceps, but there were no differences in pain relief or complications.

### The accuracy of subacromial corticosteroid injections: a comparison of multiple methods [^117DvyXr]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of the impingement syndrome. Efficacy, as well as accurate placement, have been questioned. The purpose of this prospective, randomized study is to assess the accuracy of subacromial injections and to correlate accuracy with short term clinical outcome at 3 months. Sixty shoulders, which were diagnosed with impingement syndrome, were randomized to receive a subacromial injection of corticosteroids, local anesthetic, and contrast dye from 1 of 3 locations: anterolateral, lateral, or posterior. Accuracy was confirmed by 3 radiographic views of the shoulder, while clinical ratings were assessed by the UCLA shoulder score and a 10-point visual pain analog scale during the initial, post-injection, and 3-month visits. The overall accuracy was 70%, with no difference among the 3 portals. Accuracy was not related to body mass index. Furthermore, accurate injections did not significantly improve the UCLA score, pain scale, or patient satisfaction at 3 months. In contrast, accurate injections produced a positive Neer's impingement test more often (35/39 vs 9/16; p = 0.009). Overall, there was an improvement in the UCLA score (26.2–32.2; P < .001) and a decrease in the pain scale (7.2–3.43; P < .001) at 3-month follow-up. In conclusion, the accuracy of injection was 70%. Clinical improvement did not correlate with accuracy; however, accuracy did reliably produce a positive impingement test. This multimodal treatment plan did produce significant improvement in shoulder function and pain level in the short term.

### Comparison of high-and low-dose corticosteroid in subacromial injection for periarticular shoulder disorder: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^116jLceC]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether subacromial injection with high-dose corticosteroid in patients with periarticular shoulder disorders is better than low-dose corticosteroid or placebo in improving pain, function, and active range of motion (AROM).

Design

Multicenter, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

Primary (n = 2) and university-affiliated (n = 1) tertiary-care hospitals.

Participants

Volunteers (N = 79) with periarticular shoulder disorders with at least 1 month's duration of pain.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive ultrasound-guided subacromial injection with triamcinolone acetonide, 40 or 20mg, or placebo. After a single injection, participants were followed up for 8 weeks.

Main Outcome Measures

Visual analog scale (VAS) of average shoulder pain level during the past 1 week, Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ), and angles of shoulder AROM (including flexion, abduction, external rotation, internal rotation) pre- and posttreatment at weeks 2, 4, and 8.

Results

There were no significant differences among the 3 groups (triamcinolone acetonide, 40mg, group 1, n = 27; triamcinolone acetonide, 20mg, group 2, n = 25; placebo, group 3, n = 27) in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline. (1) Within-group comparison: VAS score, SDQ score, and AROM for groups 1 and 2 significantly improved at weeks 2, 4, and 8 (P < .0167). However, there was no difference in VAS score, SDQ score, and AROM scores for group 3. (2) Between-group comparison: significant differences in VAS score, SDQ score, and abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation of AROM were shown between groups 1 and 2 and group 3 at weeks 2, 4, and 8 (P < .05).

Conclusions

This was the first study to assess the efficacy of corticosteroid according to 2 different doses, which are the most widely used in subacromial injection for participants with periarticular shoulder disorders. This study showed no significant differences between the high- (triamcinolone acetonide, 40mg) and low-dose (20mg) corticosteroid groups, indicating preferred use of a low dose at the initial stage.

### WITHDRAWN: interventions for shoulder pain [^112DqW8w]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Shoulder pain is a common problem and although there are many accepted standard forms of conservative therapy for shoulder disorders including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticosteroid injections, oral glucocorticosteroid medication, manipulation under anaesthesia, physical therapy, hydrodilatation (distension arthrography) and surgery, evidence of their efficacy is not well established.

Objectives

To review the efficacy of common interventions for shoulder pain.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Group trials register, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Science Citation Index) up to May 1998, and hand searched major textbooks, bibliographies of relevant literature, the fugitive literature, and the subject indices of relevant journals including: American College of Rheumatology; British College of Rheumatologists; the Biennial Conference of the Manipulative Physiotherapy Association of Australia; International Federation of Manual Therapists conference proceedings; British Orthopaedic Association; and American Orthopaedic Association.

Selection Criteria

Each identified study was assessed for possible inclusion by two independent reviewers based on the blinded methods sections. The determinants for inclusion were that the trial include an intervention of interest (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-articular or subacromial glucocorticosteroid injection, oral glucocorticosteroid treatment, physiotherapy, manipulation under anaesthesia, hydrodilatation, or surgery); that treatment allocation was randomized; and that the outcome assessment was blinded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Methodological quality was assessed by two independent, blinded reviewers. Data relating to selection criteria, outcome measurement and treatment effect was extracted from the blinded trials. Range of motion scores were entered as degrees of restriction to movement, and all pain and overall effect scores were transformed to 100 point scales. For continuous outcome measures, where standard deviation was not reported it was either calculated from the raw data or converted from standard error of the mean. If neither of these were reported, authors were contacted in an effort to obtain the missing values. Effect sizes were calculated and combined in a pooled analysis if study population, endpoint and intervention were comparable.

Main Results

Thirty one trials met inclusion criteria. Mean methodological quality score was 16.8 (9.5–22) out of possible score of 40. Selection criteria varied widely even for the same diagnostic label. There was no uniformity in outcome measures used and their measurement properties were rarely reported. Effect sizes for individual trials were small (-1.4 to 3.0). The results of only three studies investigating "rotator cuff tendonitis" could be pooled. Benefit of subacromial steroid injection over placebo for improving range of abduction (weighted difference between means (WMD) 35 degrees, 95% CI 14 to 55) was the only positive finding.

Authors' Conclusions

There is little evidence to support or refute the efficacy of common interventions for shoulder pain. As well as, the need for further well designed clinical trials, more research is needed to establish a uniform method of defining shoulder disorders and developing outcome measures which are valid, reliable and responsive in these study populations.

### Image-guided glucocorticoid injection versus injection without image guidance for shoulder pain [^116Grb9k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use, our 2012 Cochrane review did not confirm that use of imaging to guide glucocorticoid injection for people with shoulder pain improves its efficacy.

Objectives

To update our review and assess the benefits and harms of image-guided glucocorticoid injection compared to non-image-guided injection for patients with shoulder pain.

Search Methods

We updated the search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and clinicaltrials.gov to 15 Feb 2021, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) to 06 July 2020. We also screened reference lists of retrieved review articles and trials to identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared image-guided glucocorticoid injection to injection without image guidance (either landmark-guided or intramuscular) injection in patients with shoulder pain (rotator cuff disease, adhesive capsulitis or mixed or undefined shoulder pain). Major outcomes were pain, function, proportion of participants with treatment success, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. Minor outcomes were shoulder range of motion and proportion of participants requiring surgery or additional injections. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Nineteen trials were included (1035 participants). Fourteen trials included participants with rotator cuff disease, four with adhesive capsulitis, and one with mixed or undefined shoulder pain. Trial size varied from 28 to 256 participants, most participants were female, mean age ranged between 31 and 60 years, and mean symptom duration varied from 2 to 23 months. Two trials were at low risk of bias for all criteria. The most notable sources of bias in the remaining trials included performance bias and detection bias. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) indicates that ultrasound-guided injection probably provides little or no clinically important benefits compared with injection without guidance with respect to pain (15 trials) or function (14 trials) at three to six weeks follow-up. It may not improve quality of life (2 trials, low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to potential for bias and imprecision) and we are uncertain about the effect of ultrasound-guided injection on participant-rated treatment success due to very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias, inconsistency and imprecision). Mean pain (scale range 0 to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was 3.1 points with injection without image guidance and 0.5 points better (0.2 points better to 0.8 points better; 1003 participants, 15 trials) with an ultrasound-guided injection. This represents a slight difference for pain (0.5 to 1.0 points on a 0 to 10 scale). Mean function (scale range 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better function) was 68 points with injection without image guidance and 2.4 points better (0.2 points worse to 5.1 points better; 895 participants, 14 trials) with an ultrasound-guided injection. Mean quality of life (scale range 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better quality of life) was 65 with injection without image guidance and 2.8 points better (0.7 worse to 6.4 better; 220 participants, 2 trials) with an ultrasound-guided injection. In five trials (350 participants), 101/175 (or 606 per 1000) people in the ultrasound-guided group reported treatment success compared with 68/175 (or 389 per 1000) people in the group injected without image guidance (RR 1.56 (95% CI 0.89 to 2.75)), an absolute difference of 22% more reported success (4% fewer to 62% more). Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) indicates that ultrasound-guided injections may not reduce the risk of adverse events compared to injections without image guidance. In five trials (402 participants), 38/200 (or 181 per 1000) people in the ultrasound-guided group reported adverse events compared with 51/202 (or 252 per 1000) in the non-image-guided injection group (RR 0.72 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.28)), an absolute difference of 7% fewer adverse events (15% fewer to 7% more). Five trials reported that there were no serious adverse events. The remaining trials did not report serious adverse events. One trial reported that 1/53 (or 19 per 1000) in the injection without image guidance group and 0/53 in the ultrasound-guided group withdrew due to adverse events. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the effects for pain and function may have been influenced by selection bias, and the effects for function may have been influenced by detection bias. The test for subgroup differences indicated there were unlikely to be differences in pain and function across different shoulder conditions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our updated review does not support use of image guidance for injections in the shoulder. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that ultrasound-guided injection in the treatment of shoulder pain probably provides little or no benefit over injection without imaging in terms of pain or function and low-certainty evidence indicates there may be no difference in quality of life. We are uncertain if ultrasound-guided injection improves participant-rated treatment success, due to very low-certainty evidence. Low-certainty evidence also suggests ultrasound-guided injection may not reduce the risk of adverse events compared with non-image-guided injection. No serious adverse events were reported in any trial. The lack of significant benefit of image guidance over injection without image guidance to improve patient-relevant outcomes or reduce harms, suggests that any added cost of image guidance appears unjustified.

### Positive outcomes with intra-articular glenohumeral injections are independent of accuracy [^115VpsGb]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Shoulder pain is a common, costly, and recalcitrant affliction. One treatment for shoulder pain is intra-articular injection of corticosteroid. Clinical opinion is that injection guided by palpation is accurate and effective, and there is some evidence to support a positive effect of injection on pain. However, great controversy exists as to the accuracy of injection by palpation, whether or not accuracy is important, and what the effect is of accuracy on pain.

Methods

We used a blinded, longitudinal observational design of effectiveness in an effort to determine the accuracy of intra-articular injections and the effect of that accuracy on pain and functional outcomes in patients with various shoulder pathologies.

Results

Injection accuracy data were captured on 103 patients. Of the 103 blinded injections, 54 received injections that were identified by fluoroscopy as "in" the capsule, whereas 49 were identified as "outside" the capsule; an accuracy rate of 52.4%. In the 4-week follow up, regardless of group assignment or accuracy of the injection, patients improved significantly (P < .01) from pre- to post-injection. Improvement was typically over by 2.5 points in the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) categories, over 8 points on the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SFMPQ), and over by 13 points on the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire (DASH).

Discussion

Our accuracy rate was within the range reported in the literature. Improvements in all subjects with regard to pain and self-reported function occurred even in light of a wide variance in subject duration of symptoms, multiple injectors with varied training, a blinded approach to injection, and multiple injection approaches.

Conclusions

The accuracy of the injection does not appear to depend on the experience of the physician and may be irrelevant in treating shoulder pain of multiple origins.

### Therapeutic and diagnostic joint injections [^112GcYoC]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Joint injections remain a valuable modality in the detection and treatment of intra-articular pathology. Over the past several decades, various diagnostic and therapeutic indications for joint injections have been developed. Imaging guidance for joint injection generally increases accuracy in joint aspirations and diagnostic blocks. Confirming intra-articular placement with steroid injections improves efficacy and reduces local complications. Administering intra-articular contrast can improve the diagnostic performance of CT and MR imaging in many circumstances. This article focuses on the rationale for injections at different sites and describes different fluoroscopic approaches for common joints.

2.1. Placebo Response Study

2.1.1. Trial design

This two-armed parallel group randomised controlled trial was approved by Yorkshire and The Humber- Sheffield research ethics committee (REC reference 22/YH/0051). All patients gave written informed consent. This study was preregistered onprior to first patient enrollment (Identifier NCT05302232, Unique protocol ID 311,106) and has been designed and reported in line with the CONSORT 2010 guidelines and checklist.

2.1.2. Participants

Patients with a diagnosis of IA, including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, with a numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score > 3/10 and who required an intra-articular steroid injection as recommended by the direct care team were recruited from Guy's Hospital Rheumatology department. We excluded those with underlying joint damage identified on routine x-ray, those under 18 years of age, and those requiring shoulder or proximal interphalangeal joint injection.

2.1.3. Randomization and interventions

Patients were block randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio, using the online randomization service sealed envelope, to receive either intra-articular 1% lidocaine plus steroid or, as a placebo control, 0.9% saline plus steroid. Patients only were blinded to study group. For pragmatic reasons, the outcome assessor also administered the injections and was thus unblinded. Standardised amounts of steroid and lidocaine were administered for each joint (see Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content).

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114YRdwt]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND

Subacromial impingement syndrome (SIS) is a of common cause of shoulder pain, and accounts for 44%–65% of all shoulder complaintsin people older than 40 yrs. The pathophysiological mechanism of SIS is the mechanical impingement of the rotator cuff tendons as they pass through the subacromial space, which leads to a condition of inflammation and irritation. Shoulder pain occurs when patients elevate their arms at or above the shoulder level, is usually confined to the anterolateral shoulder, and radiates to the medial and lateral sides of the humerus. Physical function and quality of life can be severely affected by shoulder pain.

The primary aims of SIS treatment are to resolve the mechanical dysfunction and relieve pain. Corticosteroid injection into the subacromial space has been recommended as a standard treatment approach in the management of SIS. Traditionally, corticosteroid injections are administered under the guidance of anatomical landmarks. Henkus et al.reported that 30%–80% of shoulder girdle injections reaching the subacromial capsule were regarded as blind injections. Injections performed by image guidance (fluoroscopy or ultrasonography) have been shown to improve the accuracy of shoulder girdle injections. With recent advances in ultrasound imaging, ultrasound-guided (USG) injections have gained popularity and have been demonstrated to have improved efficacy in the treatment of SIS.

However, despite improvements in the accuracy of injection placement by USG, the current evidence on the effect of USG versus ALG corticosteroid injections for the management of SIS is conflicting. Several studies, indicated that USG injections for SIS resulted in significant improvements in pain relief and physical function compared with ALG injections, whereas others, reported no positive results. The results from previous systematic reviews were contradictory and previous studies were limited by small sample sizes, ambiguous definitions of SIS, and increased costs were raised to justify the advantages of using USG injections for SIS. – Therefore, to address these concerns, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to summarize and update the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of applying USG versus ALG corticosteroid injection in the management of SIS.

Subacromial subdeltoid bursa (SASDB) corticosteroid injections — approach accuracy and guidance: An RCT including 50 subjects comparing midlateral versus posterior landmark approaches showed greater accuracy for the mid-lateral approach (92% vs 68%) with no difference in functional clinical outcomes, and a small RCT in 80 subjects with subacromial impingement syndrome showed no difference in SPADI, pain, or shoulder function for up to 12 weeks between posterior versus lateral approaches; a review of five RCTs and three trials did not determine superiority of specific approaches. Accuracy was similar between landmark and ultrasound-guided SASDB injections with injections located in the bursa in all cases, while another study reported 76% (13 of 33 patients) accuracy with the posterior approach and 69% (10 of 33) with the anterolateral approach, and only injection into the SASDB resulted in a significant reduction of pain and improvement in functional scores.

### A prospective double-blind randomized trial on ultrasound-guided versus blind intra-articular corticosteroid injections for primary frozen shoulder [^114JUjnu]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

Ultrasound (US)-guided injections are widely used in patients with conditions of the shoulder in order to improve their accuracy. However, the clinical efficacy of US-guided injections compared with blind injections remains controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy and efficacy of US-guided compared with blind corticosteroid injections into the glenohumeral joint in patients with primary frozen shoulder (FS).

Methods

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections were administered to 90 patients primary FS, who were randomly assigned to either an US-guided (n = 45) or a blind technique (n = 45), by a shoulder specialist. Immediately after injection, fluoroscopic images were obtained to assess the accuracy of the injection. The outcome was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, the subjective shoulder value (SSV) and range of movement (ROM) for all patients at the time of presentation and at three, six, and 12 weeks after injection.

Results

The accuracy of injection in the US and blind groups was 100% (45/45) and 71.1% (32/45), respectively; this difference was significant (p < 0.001). Both groups had significant improvements in VAS pain score, ASES score, SSV, forward flexion, abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation throughout follow-up until 12 weeks after injection (all p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the VAS pain scores, the ASES score, the SSV and all ROMs between the two groups at the time points assessed (all p > 0.05). No injection-related adverse effects were noted in either group.

Conclusion

We found no significant differences in pain and functional outcomes between the two groups, although an US-guided injection was associated with greater accuracy. Considering that it is both costly and time-consuming, an US-guided intra-articular injection of corticosteroid seems not always to be necessary in the treatment of FS as it gives similar outcomes as a blind injection.

### Managing painful shoulder after neurological injury [^112M19wo]. Practical Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Management

The physical management of all presentations involves appropriate manual handling and a plan for the 24-hour positioning of the affected limb (Box 3). In all cases, management should ideally be led by a multi-disciplinary team and be tailored to the individual's functional status, quality of life, goals, and expected progress. Management should follow a stepwise approach and the effectiveness of each intervention should be reviewed at regular intervals. Specific physiotherapy and medical management recommendations of the four clinical presentations are outlined in Box 4. We recommend that first line treatments are continued alongside treatment escalations.

Steroid injections may be considered primarily for the management of acute exacerbations of pain not responding to first line treatments and simple analgesia, and/or in the context of meeting particular functional goals in the rehabilitation setting. They should not be considered routinely, nor do we advocate regularly repeated injections due to the potential risks of muscle atrophy and/or damage (for example tear or rupture). There are large variations between practitioners regarding how often and how many injections should be offered. A rough guide would be to repeat up to twice in total in the same location in cases of chronic intractable shoulder pain. Where steroids are mentioned in this paper, treatment is expected to show an effect 1-week post injection and to last 6–8 weeks.

When considering referral to the orthopaedic team, it is important to consider the background neurological injury and degree of functional recovery, hence the likelihood that surgery would offer benefit.

Patient and public involvement

Patients were not involved in setting the research question and the outcome measures, or in the design and implementation of the study, primarily because patient and public involvement was not common in the study countries when the study was initiated. Advisory panels of patients and public members had not yet been established and necessary experience how to best conduct this process was lacking in our research team.

### Executive summary: the British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^116sDDmC]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Targeted injection therapy

20. Local corticosteroid injections are safe and effective, and can be offered as an adjunct for the relief of inflammation and pain in the foot in IA. Image guidance using radiology or ultrasound should be considered and available if needed. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.
21. Children and young people undergoing local corticosteroid injection should be offered access to general anaesthesia or conscious sedation in a suitable paediatric environment. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 99.

Rationale

Weak evidence for the effectiveness of US-guided injections on foot pain reduction in adults with IA has been demonstrated in a systematic review of four uncontrolled trials and one comparative trial. The GWG accepted the effectiveness of palpation-guided and US-guided injections to reduce pain and inflammation. Whilst evidence of the effectiveness of US-guided over palpation-guided injections in the foot is lacking, US-guided injections theoretically allow more accurate needle placement, injection of structures that are difficult to access and avoidance of other structures. However, RCTs at other joint sites do not show convincingly that US-guided injections are more effective than systemic or palpation-guided corticosteroid injections or sham lavage plus corticosteroid.

There is weak evidence from observational studies of improved outcomes following local intra-articular corticosteroid ankle and subtalar joint injections in children and young people with JIA. Conscious sedation provides safe and effective short-term relief of pain and anxiety during intra-articular injections and can be considered in children and young people with IA. General anaesthesia may be more suitable in certain cases (e.g. younger children or for multiple injections).

Local corticosteroid injections are well-tolerated. Serious side-effects are rare Administration is standard practice in other joints in IA (e.g. knees, shoulders), with evidence from RCTs for improved outcomes.

### Use of corticosteroids for adult chronic pain interventions: sympathetic and peripheral nerve blocks, trigger point injections-guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^1149nHEF]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Trigger point injections (TPIs) — ultrasound (US) guidance and clinical outcomes — may be performed without imaging by manual palpation to elicit a twitch response and then inject, with US imaging showing echogenic skin, mixed echogenic adipose, and hypoechoic marbled muscle. Studies report US-guided TPIs have improved accuracy versus landmark injections and favorable pain relief versus blind injections; a randomized controlled study found pain scores, neck disability index, and shoulder pain disability index significantly better in the US-guided group. In an emergency department setting, US-guided TPIs improved short-term pain scores and reduced rescue medications compared with multimodal oral analgesic therapy, and a small study showed landmark technique TPIs are superior to intravenous NSAIDs.

### Ultrasound-guided therapeutic scapulothoracic interval injections [^114aa7eA]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Scapulothoracic pain is a common ailment, but the underlying cause can be difficult to diagnose in a timely manner, and treatment options are limited. We retrospectively review our experience using ultrasound-guided therapeutic scapulothoracic interval steroid injections to treat scapulothoracic pain and review correlative magnetic resonance imaging findings over a 5-year period. Although a variety of structural causes are known to cause scapulothoracic pain, in our experience, most cases lack correlative imaging findings. Ultrasound-guided scapulothoracic interval injections provide a safe, easily performed diagnostic and therapeutic tool for treating patients with periscapular pain, providing at least short-term symptom relief.

### Comparison of glenohumeral and subacromial steroid injection in primary frozen shoulder: a prospective, randomized short-term comparison study [^113McVAJ]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Glenohumeral (GH) joint steroid injection is one of the most well-known treatments for frozen shoulder. However, the low accuracy of GH joint injections and the improvement of symptoms after subacromial (SA) steroid injections led us to design a study that compares the efficacy of a steroid injection for primary frozen shoulder according to the injection site.

Materials and Methods

Patients with primary frozen shoulder were randomly divided into 2 groups according to the location of the injection: a GH group of 37 for the glenohumeral joint and an SA group of 34 for the subacromial space. Injections were completed using ultrasonographic guidance. Evaluations using a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, the Constant score, and passive range of motion (ROM) were completed at 3, 6, and 12 weeks after the injection.

Results

The GH group showed lower pain VAS at 3 weeks, but no statistical difference was found between the 2 groups at 6 and 12 weeks. Improvement in pain was evident at every follow-up visit compared with the preinjection evaluation. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to the Constant score or ROM at serial follow-up.

Conclusions

The GH steroid injection was not superior to a SA injection for patients with primary frozen shoulder even though injection at the GH joint led to earlier pain relief compared with the SA injection. SA steroid injection along with a GH injection is an alternative modality, and the treatment should be individualized and tailored appropriately.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^113rgJ7i]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To compare treatment effects between ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection and sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection in patients with calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder.

Design

Pragmatic, three arm, parallel group, double blinded, sham controlled, randomised, superiority trial with repeated measurements over 24 months.

Setting

Six hospitals in Norway and Sweden.

Participants

220 adults with calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder, persistent for at least three months.

Interventions

Ultrasound guided deposit lavage plus subacromial injection of 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide and 9 mL 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (lavage+steroid); sham lavage plus subacromial injection of 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide and 9 mL 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (sham lavage+steroid); or sham lavage plus subacromial injection of 10 mL 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (sham). All patients received a physiotherapeutic treatment regimen consisting of four home exercises.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the result on the 48 point scale (0 = worst; 48 = best) of the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) at four month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included measurements on the short form of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) and of pain intensity up to 24 months. The influence of the size of the deposit at baseline and of the persistence or disappearance of the deposit was investigated.

Results

Data from 218 (99%) participants were included in the primary analysis. Differences between groups on the OSS at four months were not significant: lavage+steroid versus sham 0.2 (95% confidence interval -2.3 to 2.8; P = 1.0); sham lavage+steroid versus sham 2.0 (-0.5 to 4.6; P = 0.35); lavage+steroid versus sham lavage+steroid -1.8 (-4.3 to 0.7; P = 0.47). After four months, 143 patients with insufficient treatment effect received supplementary treatment. At 24 months, none of the study procedures was superior to sham. No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

This study found no benefit for ultrasound guided lavage with a corticosteroid injection or for sham lavage with a corticosteroid injection compared with sham treatment in patients with calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy of the shoulder.

### Subacromial corticosteroid injections [^115KSqMi]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The use of subacromial injections to treat shoulder pain has remained one of the most common procedures for the practicing orthopedist, rheumatologist, and general practitioner. Despite this, many prospective studies have questioned the efficacy of corticosteroid injections compared with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or injections of local anesthetics alone, or both, when used for the treatment of symptomatic rotator cuff disease. Accurate diagnosis of the etiology of a patient's shoulder pain and proper injection technique are important in achieving satisfactory clinical outcomes. Both extrinsic as well as intrinsic etiologies for rotator cuff disease should be considered and must be elucidated with appropriate physical examination techniques. Although subacromial injections appear straightforward, more recent cadaveric, radiographic, and clinical studies have demonstrated variable accuracy rates using the two common techniques. In addition, absolute sterile technique must be used because infections of the subacromial space after injections, although uncommon, have generally led to debilitating conditions. This article reviews the etiology and pathophysiology of rotator cuff disease and the indications and techniques for subacromial corticosteroid injections.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) imaging — image-guided intraarticular glucocorticoid injections: Imaging guidance is conditionally recommended for use with intraarticular glucocorticoid injections of joints that are difficult to access, or to specifically localize the distribution of inflammation. The recommendation includes ultrasound and/or fluoroscopy, and examples of joints that may be difficult to access include sacroiliac joints, hips, TMJs, shoulder, midfoot, and subtalar joints. The recommendation is conditional because it is dependent on the skill of the practitioner, availability of imaging, costs, and risk of delay in treatment.

Short-term differences in symptoms following baseline steroid injection

Of 384 participants who provided SPADI data at week 2, 150 (39%) had received baseline steroid injections, compared with 40/116 (34%) without 2-week SPADI.

In the 384 patients with 2-week data, proportions receiving baseline injections were 58%, 51%, 11% and 18% in groups 1–4, respectively. The extent of the difference at 2 weeks predicted by baseline injection did not differ between US groups (interaction group × injection, P = 0.354). Having removed the interaction, 2-week SPADI did not differ by US group [difference compared with group 1 was –1.56 (–6.16, 3.05), –2.14 (–6.71, 2.43) and –3.63 (– 7.45, 0.20) for groups 2–4, respectively; overall P = 0.423]. The estimated difference between steroid-treated and untreated patients was –11.0 (95% CI –13.8, –8.2), which although statistically significant (P < 0.001) did not exceed SDC.

Trajectories of change in SPADI over 6 months

Four trajectory classes were identified in n = 228 patients (Fig. 1; Supplementary Results; Supplementary Table S8, available at Rheumatology online). The majority (79%; 260/328) showed little change over time; estimated mean SPADI in this class was 52.8 at baseline and 47.1 at week 26 (trajectory 1); nevertheless, 57% reported achieving a PASS at week 26 compared with just 18% at baseline. Eleven patients, all of whom had received a baseline steroid injection, improved rapidly at week 2 but had returned to baseline symptoms by 6 months (trajectory 2); only 2 (18%) achieved PASS at week 26. A minority of patients (17%) showed either a gradual [14% (47/328); trajectory 3] or rapid sustained improvement [3% (10/328); trajectory 4]; almost all achieved PASS at week 26 (95% and 100%, respectively).

Figure 1.
Trajectories of change in total SPADI

The majority of patients followed trajectories 1 or 2, with little change relative to baseline at week 26, irrespective of US pathology group (groups 1–4: 82%, 82%, 88% and 76%).

Biceps tendon sheath injection — guidance accuracy, outcomes, dosing, and safety: Among patients with anterior shoulder pain attributed to the biceps, 43% had a normally appearing biceps tendon. Ultrasound-guided (USG) injection accuracy was 87% compared with 27% for landmark technique, and US was more accurate than palpation-guided injection (100% vs 86%) with less discomfort. US also produced significantly better pain relief and QuickDASH improvement at 4 weeks and 6 months compared with comparators. A 10-year retrospective review showed higher first-pass (91% vs 74%) and final-pass (98% vs 90%) rates for US than fluoroscopy, while a separate retrospective fluoroscopy-guided series included only six patients. Commonly used doses are triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in 1 mL and methylprednisolone acetate 40 mg in 1 mL. Tendon rupture can be a consequence of corticosteroid injection into the tendon.

Investigations

The following imaging modalities may be used in conjunction with clinical assessment to help guide diagnosis:
⍰ Shoulder x-ray (true AP, scapular Y and axillary views): aids in the diagnosis of skeletal pathology such as; dislocation, osteoarthritis, fracture, osseous abnormalities, and heterotopic ossification. If shoulder subluxation is present, it can be characterised and measured.
⍰ Shoulder ultrasound: aids in the diagnosis of conditions such as bursitis, tendonitis, tendinosis calcarea, tears or partial tears. Ultrasound-guided steroid injection to the affected area(s) or to the GHJ may be arranged simultaneously.
⍰ Shoulder CT: to further assess fracture, arthropathy or osseous abnormalities such as dysplasia.
⍰ Shoulder MRI: this should be considered if intra-articular pathology or a partial/full rotator cuff tear is suspected.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^117DtYUP]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Calcific tendinopathy is a painful disorder of the shoulder, characterised by the deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals in the tendinous part of the rotator cuff. A prevalence of up to 7.8% in asymptomatic shoulders and up to 42.5% in symptomatic shoulders has been reported. According to current theories, pain is caused by tendon inflammation at the periphery of the deposit, by a rise in intratendinous pressure, or by impingement of the deposit under the acromion. The cause of the condition is unknown. Different theories have been proposed, including overuse, local ischaemia, tenocyte metaplasia, mis-differentiation of stem cells, and genetic predisposition. The course of the disease is thought to be cyclic and often self-limiting and has been described in four distinct phases of varying length and symptom intensity (the formative, resting, resorptive, and reparative phases). In many cases, the cycle ends with spontaneous resorption of deposit and pain relief after a few months. The individual course of the disease, however, is unpredictable and delayed courses are not uncommon. Given the often limited period with symptoms, the primary treatment approach should be symptom relieving and non-operative by use of steroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, analgesics, and physiotherapy. Refractory cases may be considered for further treatment by ultrasound guided lavage, extracorporal shock wave therapy, or surgical treatment.

Over the past few years ultrasound guided lavage together with a steroid injection has gained increasing popularity and has become the preferred method for many orthopaedic surgeons, radiologists, and physical medicine physicians. It has the advantage of being an outpatient procedure and targets both the surrounding inflammation and the deposit itself. Several cohort studies have reported good results with the technique, but studies with an adequate control group are lacking. Without comparison with a sham or a no-treatment group, whether reported improvements are due to the treatment itself, the natural history of the disease, or a placebo effect is unclear.

We designed this study to assess the true effect of ultrasound guided lavage with a steroid injection for patients with calcific tendinopathy. The primary study aim was to compare the four month results between the three study groups: lavage plus steroid versus sham lavage plus steroid versus sham. Our hypothesis was that in comparison with each other, the outcome would be best for lavage plus steroid and poorest for sham.

### Joint and soft tissue injection… [^116o2cEE]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Injection of joints, bursae, tendon sheaths, and soft tissues of the human body is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic skill for family physicians. With training, physicians can incorporate joint and soft tissue injection into daily practice, yielding many benefits. For example, a lidocaine injection into the subacromial space can help in the diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndromes, and the injection of corticosteroids into the subacromial space can be a useful therapeutic technique for subacromial impingement syndromes and rotator cuff tendinopathies. PRECAUTIONS Several precautions should be taken when using steroid injections. Care should be taken to avoid direct injection of tendons because of the danger of rupture. Avoid injection into adjacent nerves of the target area. Allow adequate time between injections, generally a minimum of four to six weeks.

Pay attention to the depth of needle insertion to avoid needle trauma to articular cartilage. Finally, avoid injecting several large joints simultaneously because of the increased risk of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal suppression and other adverse effects.
9. A postinjection steroid flare, thought to be a crystal-induced synovitis caused by preservatives in the injectable suspension, may occur within the first 24 to 36 hours after injection. 11 This is self-limited and responds to application of ice packs for no longer than 15-minute intervals. Soft tissue atrophy and local depigmentation are possible with any steroid injection into soft tissue, particularly at superficial sites. Periarticular calcifications are described in the literature, but they are rare. Tendon rupture can be avoided by not injecting directly into the tendon itself.

To avoid direct needle injury to articular cartilage or local nerves, attention should be paid to anatomic landmarks and depth of injection. Other rare, but possible, complications include pneumothorax, perilymphatic depigmentation, steroid arthropathy, adrenal suppression, and abnormal uterine bleeding. 12 Once the skin is anesthetized, the needle should be inserted through the skin to the site of injection. To prevent complications, adhere to sterile technique for all joint injections; know the location of the needle and underlying anatomy; avoid neuromuscular bundles; avoid injecting corticosteroids into the skin and subcutaneous fat; and always aspirate before injecting to prevent intravascular injection.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^115vLiRq]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Post-intervention treatment

After the intervention, prescription-free analgesics and use of the shoulder for routine activities were permitted. Within one week after treatment, patients were instructed to start on a standardised home based physiotherapeutic treatment regimen, consisting of four shoulder exercises that had to be done twice daily. Exercises were presented on an illustrated instructional folder and as a video. Before the start of the programme, a physiotherapist at each hospital showed the patients how to do the exercises correctly. Patients had to maintain a regular protocol over eight weeks, during which they had to record each training session with the date and number of exercises performed.

Change of treatment was avoided until the four month follow-up if possible. Patients who had symptoms sufficiently severe that they could not wait until four months were re-examined earlier by a blinded follow-up assessor. If secondary treatment was found to be indicated, patients were offered treatment measures such as ultrasound guided lavage, steroid injection, guided physiotherapy, or surgery, depending on findings and the patient's preferences.

Blinding

The study was conducted double blinded, with masking of patients and follow-up assessors for the patient's treatment allocation. During the intervention, patients were blinded by blocking their view on the ultrasonograph screen and the doctor's working space with opaque sheets and by mimicking barbotage in the sham lavage plus steroid and sham groups. The blinding effect was assessed by asking the patients directly after the treatment, and again after two and six weeks, which treatment they believed they had received. Response options were one of the three treatment groups or "I don't know". After study treatment was given, the interventionalists had no further contact with the patients. Follow-up was performed by blinded assessors, and statistical analyses were conducted blinded for treatment groups.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^115THbhk]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection and peri-articular corticosteroid injection are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. Results vary by musculoskeletal region, but most studies report short-term benefit with mixed results on long-term relief. Publications showed adverse events from single corticosteroid injections. Recommended effective doses were lower than those currently used by clinicians.

Methods

Development of the practice guideline for joint injections was approved by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the participating societies. A Corticosteroid Safety Work Group coordinated the development of three guidelines: peripheral nerve blocks and trigger points; joints; and neuraxial, facet, and sacroiliac joint injections. The topics included safety of the technique in relation to landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or radiology-aided injections; effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate; and adverse events related to the injection. Experts on the topics were assigned to extensively review the literature and initially develop consensus statements and recommendations. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed. A modified Delphi process was adhered to in arriving at a consensus.

Results

This guideline focuses on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid joint injections for managing joint chronic pain in adults. The joints that were addressed included the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet. All the statements and recommendations were approved by all participants and the Board of Directors of the participating societies after four rounds of discussion. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain. A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for both shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections. The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone. Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. Overall, IACS injections result in short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months. The adverse events include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection.

Conclusions

In this practice guideline, we provided specific recommendations on the role of corticosteroids in joint, bursa, and peritendon injections for musculoskeletal pain.

### Intra-articular steroid injection for frozen shoulder: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials with trial sequential analysis [^117Dqkjz]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-articular steroid injection is a common intervention for frozen shoulder (FS).

Purpose

This review aimed to illustrate the effects of intra-articular steroid injection for FS.

Study Design

Systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intra-articular steroid injection with no injection or sham injections for FS. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores were the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included passive external rotation, abduction, flexion, internal rotation, and functional scores. Complication rates were the safety outcome measure. Comparisons were performed with mean differences (MDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Three time intervals were analyzed: 4 to 6 weeks, 12 to 16 weeks, and 24 to 26 weeks postintervention. Trial sequential analysis was used to verify the pooled results. Line charts were drawn to view the recovery trend in both the intervention and control groups.

Results

Eight RCTs with 416 patients were included. Compared with controls, patients who received intra-articular steroid injection had significantly reduced VAS pain scores at 4 to 6 weeks (MD, 1.28 cm [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.82]), 12 to 16 weeks (MD, 1.00 cm [95% CI, 0.47 to 1.52]), and 24 to 26 weeks (MD, 0.65 cm [95% CI, 0.19 to 1.10]) postinjection. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the pooled results at 4 to 6 weeks and 12 to 16 weeks but not at 24 to 26 weeks. Patients who received intra-articular steroid injection had improved passive external rotation, abduction, and flexion and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores at all 3 time intervals, as well as improved American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores at 12 to 16 weeks (MD, 12.20 [95% CI, 2.55 to 21.85]). No difference was noticed in Constant scores (MD, 5.70 [95% CI, -0.59 to 11.99]) or internal rotation except at 12 to 16 weeks (MD, 0.81° [95% CI, 0.18° to 1.44°]) and 24 to 26 weeks (MD, 3.88° [95% CI, 0.51° to 7.25°]) between steroid injection and placebo. Complication rates were 1.78% for facial flushing, 0.71% for dizziness owing to vasovagal reactions during injection, 1.07% for chest or shoulder pain, and 0.36% for nausea. Line charts improved in both groups.

Conclusion

Intra-articular steroid injection is effective and safe for FS and relieves pain, improves functional performance, and increases range of motion. The effects are significant at 4 to 6 and 12 to 16 weeks postintervention and may last as long as 24 to 26 weeks.

### Efficacy of a single, image-guided corticosteroid injection for glenohumeral arthritis [^114jRwSn]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Limited data are available on the efficacy of cortisone injections for glenohumeral osteoarthritis (GHOA). The amount and longevity of pain relief provided by a single cortisone injection are unclear. Additionally, it remains uncertain how the severity of radiographic GHOA and patient-reported function and pain levels impact the efficacy of an injection. Therefore, we sought to describe the relief provided by a single, image-guided glenohumeral injection in patients with GHOA. We hypothesized that patients with more severe radiographic GHOA and poorer baseline shoulder function would require earlier secondary intervention.

Methods

Patients with symptomatic GHOA who elected to receive a corticosteroid injection for pain relief were prospectively enrolled. A phone interview was conducted to record the baseline Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) and visual analog scale (VAS) score prior to the injection, as well as the OSS and VAS score at months 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, and 12 after the injection. The endpoint of the study occurred when patients required a second injection, progressed to surgery, or reached month 12. Patients were grouped by their respective baseline OSS (mild vs. moderate or severe) and Samilson-Prieto radiographic classification (mild, moderate, or severe) for analysis.

Results

We analyzed 30 shoulders (29 patients). Of the patients, 52% were men. The average age was 66.1 years. No significant difference in overall survival (defined as no additional intervention) was seen between groups based on either the OSS or Samilson-Prieto grade. Additionally, the OSS and VAS score at each follow-up were compared with baseline values. For the entire cohort, a clinically significant difference was seen between baseline and months 1–4 for the OSS and between baseline and months 1–4, 6, 9, and 12 for the VAS score.

Discussion

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for GHOA. There were no differences in the need for secondary intervention in this population based on the severity of either the OSS or the Samilson-Prieto radiographic classification. However, patients with more severe shoulder dysfunction based on the OSS did experience statistically significantly greater symptomatic relief than patients with milder dysfunction. Additionally, following a single injection, patients in this cohort experienced statistically and clinically relevant improvements in shoulder function and pain up to 4 months after injection.

### Subacromial ultrasound guided or systemic steroid injection for rotator cuff disease: randomised double blind study [^116Zpr5v]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Study protocol

We scheduled patients who were eligible and willing to participate in the study for an appointment at the clinic for baseline registrations and treatment according to the protocol. We recorded magnetic resonance imaging results. Patients not able or unwilling to have magnetic resonance imaging had diagnostic ultrasonography. Patients had an equal probability of assignment to the two treatment groups. We used the computer program Clinstat to generate a predetermined randomisation sequence with a randomised variable block size of three, four, and five. A member of the study group who was not participating in patients' eligibility, allocation to treatment, or outcome assessment developed the randomisation sequence. The consultant physician responsible for the injections held the only copy of the randomisation sequence. After the baseline registrations, we gave each participant a study number. To ensure concealed allocation, each patient was referred to the consultant physician responsible for injections, who then allocated the patient to one of the treatment groups according to the randomisation sequence. Patients and the outcome assessor were blinded for treatment assignment. The consultant physician preparing and administering the injections was not blinded.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Modified US Preventive Services Task Force levels of certainty regarding net benefit — definitions for evidence strength are outlined for joint pain interventions. High certainty is described as evidence with "consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative care populations with joint pain", with conclusions "unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate certainty is when "the available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the intervention on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors", and "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low certainty indicates "the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes".

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162Ftv1]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies involving 891 participants (USG group: 454 participants; ALG group: 437 participants) suggested that USG corticosteroid injection for management of SIS resulted in more effective pain relief and functional improvement than ALG injections; however, there was no significant difference in shoulder ROM. In the subgroup analysis, follow-up of 6–8 wks and use of methylprednisolone showed evidence of a significant difference in pain relief and functional improvement.

Our findings are in consistent with those of several previously published systematic reviews. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the significantly greater improvement in pain reduction and functional gain in the USG group. The main mechanism is the greater accuracy of USG versus ALG for all shoulder girdle joints, which led to improved efficacy in outcome measures of pain and function. Another important factor resulting in the improvement to consider is the increased patient comfort and less needle manipulation with USG injections, although it was not assessed across all studies. Ultrasound-guided injections also provide real-time monitoring during needle placement without any risk of radiation exposure. Furthermore, a short-term retention of the therapeutic efficacy may exist as reported by the findings in our subgroup analysis, and another systematic review measured the changes between 6-wk follow-up and baseline VAS and shoulder function scores. However, several factors should be considered when interpreting these positive findings such as the varied quality of included studies, inclusion of specific populations with small sample sizes, substantial heterogeneity across studies, and small clinical effect. The reasons for these weaknesses could be attributed to different periods of follow-up, heterogeneous pathologies of painful shoulder, inadequate patient blinding potentially causing bias, and placebo effect. In our study, although there was an evidence of substantial heterogeneity among the included trials, our sensitivity analysis detected no changes in the levels of heterogeneity and effect, and the results of publication bias confirmed the robustness.

While many treatments, including corticosteroid injections in and around the shoulder, are advocated to be of benefit for shoulder pain, few are of proven efficacy. This review of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain is one in a series of reviews of varying interventions for shoulder disorders.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of corticosteroid injections in the treatment of adults with shoulder pain.

Search Strategy

MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Central and Science Citation Index were searched up to and including June 2002.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and pseudo-randomised trials in all languages of corticosteroid injections compared to placebo or another intervention, or of varying types and dosages of steroid injection in adults with shoulder pain. Specific exclusions were duration of shoulder pain less than three weeks, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica and fracture.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial inclusion and methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers according to predetermined criteria. Results are presented separately for rotator cuff disease, adhesive capsulitis, full thickness rotator cuff tear and mixed diagnoses, and, where possible, combined in meta-analysis.

Main Results

Twenty-six trials met inclusion criteria. The number, site and dosage of injections varied widely between studies. The number of participants per trial ranged from 20 to 114 (median 52 participants). Methodological quality was variable. For rotator cuff disease, subacromial steroid injection was demonstrated to have a small benefit over placebo in some trials however no benefit of subacromial steroid injection over NSAID was demonstrated based upon the pooled results of three trials. For adhesive capsulitis, two trials suggested a possible early benefit of intra-articular steroid injection over placebo but there was insufficient data for pooling of any of the trials. One trial suggested short-term benefit of intra-articular corticosteroid injection over physiotherapy in the short-term (success at seven weeks RR = 1.66 (1.21, 2.28).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Despite many RCTs of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain, their small sample sizes, variable methodological quality and heterogeneity means that there is little overall evidence to guide treatment. Subacromial corticosteroid injection for rotator cuff disease and intra-articular injection for adhesive capsulitis may be beneficial although their effect may be small and not well-maintained. There is a need for further trials investigating the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain. Other important issues that remain to be clarified include whether the accuracy of needle placement, anatomical site, frequency, dose and type of corticosteroid influences efficacy.

### Is the anterior injection approach without ultrasound guidance superior to the posterior approach for adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder? A sequential, prospective trial [^116CxwTE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Shoulder injections for conditions such as adhesive capsulitis are commonly performed and can be administered through image-based or landmark-based injection approaches. Ultrasound-guided injections are widely used and accurate because ultrasound allows real-time visualization of the needle and injected contrast. Landmark-based injections would be advantageous, if they were accurate, because they would save the time and expense associated with ultrasound. However, few prospective studies have compared well-described landmark-based shoulder injection techniques without ultrasound.

Question/Purpose

Using anatomic landmarks, and without using ultrasound, is the accuracy of glenohumeral injection for adhesive capsulitis greater via the posterior approach or via a new anterior approach?

Methods

Between 2018 and 2020, we treated 108 patients potentially eligible for adhesive capsulitis treatment. These patients had clinical symptoms of aggravating shoulder pain with a duration of less than 4 months and passively impaired, painful glenohumeral ROM. Due to the exclusion of patients with other shoulder conditions (full-thickness rotator cuff ruptures and posttraumatic stiffness), 95 patients received an injection in this sequential, prospective, comparative study. Between 2018 and 2019, 41 patients (17 males and 24 females; mean age 52 ± 5 years; mean BMI 24 ± 3 kg/m2) were injected through the posterior approach, with the acromion as the anatomical landmark, during the first part of the study period. After that, between 2019 and 2020, 54 patients (20 males and 34 females; mean age 54 ± 4 years; mean BMI 23 ± 3 kg/m2) received an injection through a new anterior approach, with the acromioclavicular joint as the anatomic landmark, during the second part of the study period. Injections via both approaches were administered by two experienced shoulder specialists (both with more than 10 years of experience). Both specialists had experience with the posterior approach before this study, and neither had previous training with the new anterior approach. Injections contained a corticosteroid, local anaesthetic, and contrast medium. Radiographs were taken within 20 minutes after the injection, and a radiologist blinded to the technique determined accuracy. Accurate injections were defined as having contrast fluid limited to the glenohumeral joint, while inaccurate injections displayed leakage of contrast fluid into the soft tissue or subacromial space. All of the enrolled patients were analyzed.

Results

In the group with the posterior approach, the accuracy was 78% (32 of 41) in contrast to 94% (51 of 54, odds ratio 0.21 [95% CI 0.05 to 0.83]; p = 0.03) in patients with the new anterior approach.

Conclusion

The new anterior approach without the use of ultrasound was more accurate than the posterior approach. In fact, it was nearly as accurate as previously published ultrasound-guided approaches. We recommend using the new anterior approach for intraarticular glenohumeral injections instead of ultrasound-guided injections because it will save time and costs associated with ultrasound. Still, the clinical effects (anxiety, pain, functional outcome, and adverse events) of the new anterior approach should be compared with ultrasound-guided injections in a randomized study.

Level Of Evidence

Level II, therapeutic study.

Acromioclavicular and glenohumeral intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) — image-guided versus landmark guidance: Ultrasound-guided (USG) IACS for painful acromioclavicular joint due to OA produced better pain and functional outcomes than landmark-guided IACS at 6 months, and a 2012 Cochrane review reported better pain outcomes at 6 weeks with image-guided injections in three out of five trials; however, a recent double-blind RCT between USG and landmark-guided injections for adhesive capsulitis did not show a difference in pain or functional outcomes. For glenohumeral joint injections, landmark accuracy issues are noted and IACS injection into the glenohumeral joint through landmark is not recommended.

### Ultrasound-guided versus blind subacromial corticosteroid injections for subacromial impingement syndrome: a randomized, double-blind clinical trial [^117Tv6ej]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Subacromial corticosteroid injections are frequently performed for impingement syndrome of the shoulder. To improve the accuracy of injections, ultrasound can be used.

Purpose

To assess the clinical outcome of ultrasound-guided subacromial injections compared with blind subacromial injections for subacromial impingement syndrome.

Study Design

Randomized controlled clinical trial; Level of evidence, 1.

Methods

A total of 56 shoulders with subacromial impingement syndrome were randomized into 2 groups: 28 shoulders received a subacromial corticosteroid injection with ultrasound guidance (ultrasound group), and 28 shoulders received a subacromial corticosteroid injection without ultrasound guidance (blind group). The visual analog scale (VAS) for pain with overhead activities and the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score were obtained before the injection and at 6 weeks after the injection.

Results

The VAS score for pain with overhead activities decreased from 59 ± 5 mm (mean ± SEM) before the injection to 33 ± 6 mm at 6 weeks after the injection in the ultrasound group (P < .001) and from 63 ± 4 mm to 39 ± 6 mm, respectively, in the blind group (P < .001). The decrease in the VAS score was not significantly different between the groups (P > .999). The ASES score increased from 57 ± 2 before the injection to 68 ± 3 at 6 weeks after the injection in the ultrasound group (P < .01) and from 54 ± 3 before the injection to 65 ± 4 after the injection in the blind group (P < .01), with no significant difference between the groups (P = 0.7). Four shoulders (14%) in the ultrasound group and 6 shoulders (21%) in the blind group eventually needed surgery (P = 0.7).

Conclusion

No significant differences were found in the clinical outcome when comparing ultrasound-guided subacromial injections to blind subacromial injections for subacromial impingement syndrome.

### Value of imaging to guide interventional procedures in rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases: a systematic literature review informing EULAR points to consider [^1142b5Xq]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

A total of 6049 references (after duplicates removal) were screened for eligibility (see online supplemental figure 1). Sixty-six articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with some of them addressing multiple PICO questions. Fifty-one articles compared interventions with imaging or palpation guidance, or interventions assisted by different imaging techniques (PICO1), three articles assessed the influence of different settings (PICO2), while 16 articles compared the value of different procedures for imaging-guided interventions (PICO3). RoB assessment of the retrieved studies is detailed in online supplemental table 3.

Imaging techniques for interventional procedures (PICO1)

Large joints and periarticular structures

Twenty-nine articles (23 RCTs, 4 retrospective cohort studies, 1 retrospective cross-sectional study and 1 RCT-letter) assessed the value of imaging for interventions at large joints, with 20 studies comparing US versus palpation-guided interventions,5 investigating US versus fluoroscopyand 1 study each comparing fluoroscopy with palpation guidance, fluoroscopy with US and palpation guidance, or fluoroscopy with CT-guided interventions, as well as one study comparing either US or fluoroscopy with palpation guidance. The following large joints and periarticular structures were studied: knee (n = 10), shoulder (n = 9), sacroiliac joint (SIJ) (n = 3) and one study each for elbow, wrist, spine, piriformis muscle, hip, trochanteric bursa and ankle. All interventions were injections with one or more of the following compounds: glucocorticoids (GC), local anaesthetics, viscosupplements and/or contrast media. The most important characteristics of the 29 studies are depicted in table 1, full details on interventions and outcomes can be found in online supplemental table 4.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^116AR4D4]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

What this study adds

This trial shows that treatment benefits from ultrasound guided lavage with a steroid injection or from a steroid injection alone are not superior to those from sham treatment
This questions their use as treatment measures for patients with calcific tendinopathy and should lead to a critical reconsideration of the role of these methods in treatment algorithms

Box 4 — Shoulder joints: For intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) and SASDB shoulder injections, lower corticosteroid doses equivalent to 20 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone are stated to be equally effective as higher doses (level of certainty: moderate). Corticosteroid injection (CSI) of the shoulder provides short-term improvement (up to 8 weeks) in pain and disability over no treatment or placebo and should be considered for adhesive capsulitis (AC) and other painful shoulder disorders (level of certainty: high). Physical therapy and home exercise, in conjunction with CSI of the shoulder, is beneficial for painful shoulder disorders, including AC and subacromial bursitis (level of certainty: moderate). Recommendations specify the recommended initial CSI can be performed with corticosteroid equivalent not exceeding 20 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone (Grade B), that shoulder CSI should be offered for short-term pain relief of moderate-to-severe pain and disability from shoulder disorders such as AC, impingement syndrome, or subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis (Grade B), and that physical therapy or home exercises should be offered in conjunction with shoulder CSI (Grade B).

### Corticosteroid injections and risk of fracture [^114zuUK2]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Are high numbers of corticosteroid injections (CSIs) associated with subsequent fractures?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7197 patients over a 4-year period, higher fracture risk was not associated with the cumulative dose of injected corticosteroid, regardless of osteoporosis status.

Meaning

Corticosteroid injections are an important option for pain treatment, and clinicians should not withhold CSI owing to fear of fracture risk.

### Manipulation or intra-articular steroids in the management of adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder? A prospective randomized trial [^113hHfPA]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

The management of adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) is controversial. The authors present a prospective randomized study comparing the outcome, at a two-year follow-up period, of two groups of patients treated either by manipulation of the shoulder under anaesthetic or by intra-articular shoulder injections using steroid with distension.

Methods

Fifty-three patients suffering from Idiopathic "Primary" Frozen Shoulder were prospectively randomized into two treatment groups and followed up for two years from the start of treatment. Patients were assessed using the Constant score, a Visual Analogue Score, and the SF36 questionnaire.

Results

No statistical differences were found between the two groups of patients with regards to the outcome measures.

Conclusion

Treatment using steroid injections with distension as an out-patient is therefore recommended for the treatment of Idiopathic "Primary" Frozen Shoulder. This has the same clinical outcome as a manipulation under anaesthetic with less attendant risks.

### The use and safety of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain in general practice: a retrospective cohort study [^113dc9U8]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Key results

In this retrospective cohort study, we examined the use of CSIs by the GP in the treatment of shoulder pain. This study found that a quarter of patients with a new episode of shoulder pain received a CSI within 12 months after the initial diagnosis. Furthermore, we found that in half of the cases the GP administered the CSI as the initial treatment, which is not in accordance with the current guidelines. Older patients were more likely to receive a CSI, to receive the CSI at the first consultation, and to receive multiple CSIs within 1 year after the initial diagnosis.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^112wJuEt]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To compare treatment effects between ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection and sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection in patients with calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder.

Design

Pragmatic, three arm, parallel group, double blinded, sham controlled, randomised, superiority trial with repeated measurements over 24 months.

Setting

Six hospitals in Norway and Sweden.

Participants

220 adults with calcific tendinopathy of the shoulder, persistent for at least three months.

Interventions

Ultrasound guided deposit lavage plus subacromial injection of 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide and 9 mL 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (lavage+steroid); sham lavage plus subacromial injection of 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide and 9 mL 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (sham lavage+steroid); or sham lavage plus subacromial injection of 10 mL 1% lidocaine hydrochloride (sham). All patients received a physiotherapeutic treatment regimen consisting of four home exercises.

Main outcome measures

The primary outcome was the result on the 48 point scale (0 = worst; 48 = best) of the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) at four month follow-up. Secondary outcomes included measurements on the short form of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) and of pain intensity up to 24 months. The influence of the size of the deposit at baseline and of the persistence or disappearance of the deposit was investigated.

Results

Data from 218 (99%) participants were included in the primary analysis. Differences between groups on the OSS at four months were not significant: lavage+steroid versus sham 0.2 (95% confidence interval −2.3 to 2.8; P = 1.0); sham lavage+steroid versus sham 2.0 (−0.5 to 4.6; P = 0.35); lavage+steroid versus sham lavage+steroid −1.8 (−4.3 to 0.7; P = 0.47). After four months, 143 patients with insufficient treatment effect received supplementary treatment. At 24 months, none of the study procedures was superior to sham. No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusions

This study found no benefit for ultrasound guided lavage with a corticosteroid injection or for sham lavage with a corticosteroid injection compared with sham treatment in patients with calcific rotator cuff tendinopathy of the shoulder.

### Are corticosteroid injections associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency in adults with musculoskeletal pain? A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies [^1167k7Zw]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroid injection is a common treatment for individuals experiencing musculoskeletal pain, and it is part of the management of numerous orthopaedic conditions. However, there is concern about offering corticosteroid injections for musculoskeletal pain because of the possibility of secondary adrenal insufficiency.

Questions/Purposes

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies, we asked: (1) Are corticosteroid injections associated with secondary adrenal insufficiency as measured by 7-day morning serum cortisol? (2) Does this association differ depending on whether the shot was administered in the spine or the appendicular skeleton?

Methods

We searched the Allied and Complementary Medicine (AMED), Embase, EmCare, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science from inception to January 22, 2021. We retrieved 4303 unique records, of which 17 were eventually included. Study appraisal was via the Downs and Black tool, with an average quality rating of fair. A Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations assessment was conducted with the overall certainty of evidence being low to moderate. Reflecting heterogeneity in the study estimates, a pooled random-effects estimate of cortisol levels 7 days after corticosteroid injection was calculated. Fifteen studies or subgroups (254 participants) provided appropriate estimates for statistical pooling. A total of 106 participants received a spine injection, and 148 participants received an appendicular skeleton injection, including the glenohumeral joint, subacromial bursa, trochanteric bursa, and knee.

Results

Seven days after corticosteroid injection, the mean morning serum cortisol was 212 nmol/L (95% confidence interval 133 to 290), suggesting that secondary adrenal insufficiency was a possible outcome. There is a difference in the secondary adrenal insufficiency risk depending on whether the injection was in the spine or the appendicular skeleton. For spinal injection, the mean cortisol was 98 nmol/L (95% CI 48 to 149), suggesting secondary adrenal insufficiency was likely. For appendicular skeleton injection the mean cortisol was 311 nmol/L (95% CI 213 to 409) suggesting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis integrity was likely.

Conclusion

Clinicians offering spinal injections should discuss the possibility of short-term secondary adrenal insufficiency with patients, and together, they can decide whether the treatment remains appropriate and whether mitigation strategies are needed. Clinicians offering appendicular skeleton injections should not limit care because of concerns about secondary adrenal insufficiency based on the best available evidence, and clinical guidelines could be reviewed accordingly. Further research is needed to understand whether age and/or sex determine risk of secondary adrenal insufficiency and what clinical impact secondary adrenal insufficiency has on patients undergoing spinal injection.

Level Of Evidence

Level IV, therapeutic study.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^114uUdEm]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

The principal finding of the study is that neither lavage plus steroid nor sham lavage plus steroid was superior to sham treatment in the treatment of calcific tendinopathy at four month and 24 month follow-ups. The lack of benefit from both active treatments is further supported by the large number of patients who needed supplementary treatment between four and 24 months of follow-up.

The results from this study are in contrast with the existing literature and question the use of ultrasound guided lavage as a treatment measure for calcific tendinopathy. Current treatment recommendations are mainly based on the results from case studies, which are more likely than randomised controlled trials to be influenced by confounding. Results from these studies may also be biased due to small and selected study samples and large percentages, 24–45% of patients, who were excluded from analyses because of additional treatment during follow-up. None of the few previous randomised studies had a sham control group, and these studies also did not have blinded physiotherapists, patients, and outcome assessors. The results of existing studies may exaggerate the effectiveness of ultrasound guided lavage, and our trial may represent a more realistic estimate of the true effectiveness of this commonly used intervention.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^116yCwPF]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Patient follow-up

Outcome data were collected two and six weeks and four, eight, 12, and 24 months after the intervention. The two week and six week follow-ups and the eight month and 12 month follow-ups were digital at-home follow-ups, whereas patients had to attend hospital after four months and 24 months for supplementary clinical follow-up, including registration of post-intervention use of prescription analgesics and radiographic examination. The primary outcome was the four month result on the OSS. Secondary outcomes were the results on the OSS at the other points of follow-up; the results on the QuickDASH score, on the VAS for pain at night, at rest, and during activity, and on the EQ-5D-5L at all follow-up points; and the number of patients in each treatment group who changed treatment. Before the start of the study, we planned to explore possible associations between the primary outcome and the change in the appearance of the deposit on radiographs from baseline to follow-up (whether unchanged, changed but still visible, or disappeared), the volume of extracted calcium in the lavage group (whether ≤ 0.1 mL or > 0.1 mL), the size of the calcification on sonography at baseline (whether ≤ 12.5 mm or > 12.5 mm in the longitudinal or horizontal plane), the adherence to the programme of home exercises, and the patients' positive or negative treatment expectations as given by the SETS. The appearance of deposits on radiographs was examined after the last follow-up had been done. We collected radiographs from the study hospitals in one database, and two of the authors (SM, OME) assessed them independently, blinded for the patient's treatment group. They compared the deposits with baseline and registered them as "unchanged", "changed but still visible", or "disappeared". In a following consensus meeting, results were compared between the examiners and all differing opinions were resolved with a consensus discussion.

### Improving injection accuracy of the elbow, knee, and shoulder: does injection site and imaging make a difference? A systematic review [^112d5brj]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Joint injections and aspirations are used to reduce joint pain and decrease inflammation. The efficacy of these injections is diminished when they are placed inadvertently in the wrong location or compartment. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of varying sites or imaging techniques affects the rate of accurate needle placement in aspiration and injection in the shoulder, elbow, and knee.

Hypotheses

(1) Accuracy rates of different joint injection sites will demonstrate variability. (2) Injection accuracy rates will be improved when performed with concomitant imaging.

Study Design

Systematic review of the literature.

Methods

Studies reporting injection accuracy based on image verification were identified through a systematic search of the English literature. Accuracy rates were compared for currently accepted injection sites in the shoulder, elbow, and knee. In addition, accuracy rates with and without imaging of these joints were compared.

Results

In the glenohumeral joint, there is a statistically higher accuracy rate with the posterior approach when compared with the anterior approach (85% vs 45%). Injection site selection did not affect accuracy for the subacromial space, acromioclavicular joint, elbow, or knee. The use of imaging improved injection accuracy in the glenohumeral joint (95% vs 79%), subacromial space (100% vs 63%), acromioclavicular joint (100% vs 45%), and knee (99% vs 79%).

Conclusion

Injection accuracy rates are significantly higher for the posterior approach compared with the anterior approach for the glenohumeral joint. Similarly, the accuracy rates are also higher when imaging is used in conjunction with injection of the glenohumeral joint, subacromial space, acromioclavicular joint, and knee.

Supplementary analyses

Adverse events

Adverse events were few and mild and included temporary dizziness, nausea, headache, haematoma at the injection site, increasing pain, a vasovagal reaction, and capsulitis. They did not differ between the treatment groups (supplementary table G).

Use of post-intervention analgesics

Only a few patients reported regular use of prescription analgesics at the four month and 24 month follow-ups, and the usage did not differ between the treatment groups (supplementary table H).

Blinding

Control of the effect of blinding directly after the treatment session showed that only 10 (5%) of 217 patients believed that they had received sham treatment, four of them correctly, six of them incorrectly, whereas 143 (66%) believed that they were treated by one of the two active treatments and 64 (29%) answered that they did not know (supplementary table I). At two and six weeks, the number of patients who believed that they had been treated by sham rose to 46 (21%) and 45 (21%), respectively (supplementary table I). The blinding index of James exceeded the threshold value for successful blinding of 0.5 at all measurement points. The exact index values were 0.63 directly after treatment, 0.55 after two weeks, and 0.52 after six weeks.

### Exercise therapy after corticosteroid injection for moderate to severe shoulder pain: large pragmatic randomised trial [^115ajNbs]. BMJ (2010). Excellent credibility.

In our trial all therapies were delivered by physiotherapists working in a primary care based musculoskeletal service, and no extra NHS resources were required to implement the study interventions. In routine clinical practice in the UK, combining these treatments in a timely fashion could be problematic for practical reasons related to the skills of practitioners and service issues such as waiting lists for physiotherapy. In this study physiotherapists provided both arms of the study; in other large trials different professions have provided the treatment arms.

The need to avoid selection of a heterogeneous group in research into shoulder pain has been highlighted. Although clinical classification is difficult, we aimed to exclude conditions for which the study protocol was not appropriate, such as adhesive capsulitis and inflammatory arthritis, and patients with mild shoulder pain and those aged under 40 years. Severe shoulder pain at initial presentation has been shown to be a prognostic indicator for persistent symptoms. In keeping with two previous studies that excluded patients with low scores on the shoulder pain and disability indexwe deliberately included only patients who rated their pain as moderate or severe because patients with mild pain would not routinely be offered an injection in clinical practice. Of those patients not eligible for the study, 152 (17%) reported mild shoulder pain. Other studies investigating corticosteroid injections have not used the level of pain or degree of functional disability as specific entry criteria. We excluded patients aged 40 and under to avoid including younger patients with subacromial impingement related to a sporting injury, who are not usually offered steroid injections as an initial treatment, which was the consensus view of the physiotherapists who designed the intervention package. A recent study indicated that nearly 80% of shoulder pain is found in patients aged 40 and over; our study therefore reflecting the age group with the highest prevalence of shoulder pain.

Limitations of study

Because of this study's pragmatic design, participants were not blinded to their interventions and there could have been a placebo or non-specific effect caused by the injection. We therefore accept that the total treatment response probably includes both treatment and associated placebo effects, as is the case in routine clinical practice. We did not set out to examine which component of the non-pharmacological intervention (exercise or manual therapy, or both) is effective. Although evidence is emerging about the efficacy of certain interventions — for example, exercise combined with manual therapy seems more effective than exercise alone for subacromial impingement syndrome, and ultrasound guided injections might have better outcomes than "blind" injections — questions about the optimal use of injection and physiotherapy interventions remain and continue to be important for future research.

### Editorial commentary: unguided glenohumeral injections-Do we achieve sufficient accuracy? [^116kYpEo]. Arthroscopy (2018). Low credibility.

Image-guided (fluoroscopy, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) and unguided glenohumeral injection techniques are frequently used for different diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in clinical practice. Guided injections are highly accurate, reproducible, and more often performed in routine practice. Nevertheless, these techniques are more cost intensive and time consuming, and require special imaging devices. In case of fluoroscopic- or computed tomography-guided injections, radiation exposure of the patient is a disadvantage. In contrast, unguided glenohumeral injection techniques do not have these drawbacks, but rather are based on the precise identification of anatomic landmarks and depend on the experience of the provider. That is the reason they are supposed to be less accurate and less reproducible than guided techniques. But recent studies showed comparable accuracy; therefore, the use of unguided glenohumeral injection techniques should be considered in daily clinical practice in the hands of experienced shoulder arthroscopists.

### The clinical and functional outcomes of ultrasound-guided vs landmark-guided injections for adults with shoulder pathology – a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114RfYhc]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the clinical and functional outcomes of US-guided (USG) vs landmark-guided (LMG) injection for the treatment of adults with shoulder pathology.

Method

MEDLINE, AMED and Embase in addition to unpublished literature databases were searched from 1950 to August 2011. Studies were included if they were randomized or non-randomized controlled trials comparing USG vs LSG injections for the treatment of adults with shoulder pathology. Two reviewers independently performed data extraction and appraisal of the studies. Meta-analyses were performed where possible and when inappropriate a narrative review of the data was presented.

Results

Six papers including 307 patients were reviewed; 142 received LMG injections and 165 received USG injections. There was a statistically significant difference in favour of USG for pain at 6 weeks (standardized mean difference 1.03; 95% CI 0.12, 1.93; P = 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference between the injection methods with respect to shoulder function (standardized mean difference 0.33; 95% CI -0.59, 1.25; P = 0.48). There was a significant difference between interventions for shoulder abduction at 6 weeks in favour of the USG method (mean difference 2.81; 95% CI 0.67, 4.95; P = 0.01). No other movements showed a statistically significant difference.

Conclusion

There is a statistically significant difference in pain and abduction between LMG and USG steroid injections for adults with shoulder pathology. However, these differences are small and may not represent clinically useful differences. The current evidence base is limited by a number of important methodological weaknesses, which should be considered when interpreting these findings. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention should be considered in the design of future studies.

### Ultrasound-guided steroid injections for shoulder pain | AAFP… [^116TUc9a]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does using ultrasonography to guide steroid injections into the shoulder region improve pain or function compared with using anatomic landmarks alone. Evidence-Based Answer Ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection for shoulder pain provides no advantage over landmark-guided or intramuscular injection in terms of pain, function, range of motion, or safety when measured within a six-week follow-up period. However, the small sample size of this review means that a clinically significant benefit cannot be ruled out. The authors of this Cochrane review analyzed five studies with 290 participants to compare ultrasound-guided steroid injection with blind or gluteal steroid injection.

Of the four trials that included participants with rotator cuff disease, subacromial bursitis, or both, three compared ultrasound-guided injection with blind injection into the subacromial bursa, and one compared ultrasound-guided subacromial injection with gluteal injection. The authors found no significant differences between groups in pain reduction at any of the end points. In data pooled from three studies, range of abduction improved by about 20 degrees at two weeks with ultrasound-guided injection. However, statistical heterogeneity was considerable, and benefits were not seen at other time points. Minor adverse events such as transient postinjection pain and facial redness were rare and occurred equally in the control and ultrasound-guided treatment groups. Only one study was assessed to have a low risk of bias; it compared ultrasound-guided subacromial injection with systemic gluteal injection.

2 No differences in pain or function were noted between groups during a six-week follow-up, suggesting that any benefit of the injection was likely from its systemic effects and not dependent on injection location. Although evidence of increased effectiveness is lacking, attempting to accurately administer steroid injections to their target location is still considered standard of care. Point-of-care ultrasonography can be helpful when training health care professionals to see and feel where the injection is going. Various pathologies also can be visualized with ultrasonography. A four-minute video of a clinician performing ultrasonography of shoulder structures and administering a subacromial injection is available at http: //www. youtube. com/watch.

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^114qME8q]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Trial procedures

Demographic and baseline data were collected at the primary consultation. Standard shoulder radiographs (anterior-posterior, lateral, and acromioclavicular views) were obtained and the size of the calcification was measured in the anterior-posterior plane both vertically and horizontally within four weeks before the intervention. The deposit was classified according to Molé as a type A (sharply delineated, dense, homogenous), B (sharply delineated, dense, multiple fragments), or C (heterogenous, fluffy). Experienced sonographers examined both shoulders sonographically according to a published examination protocol. The anterior-posterior size of the deposit was measured sonographically on a short axis view and the medial-lateral size on a long axis view. Use of analgesics had to be terminated 48 hours before baseline. The intervention day was usually scheduled within six weeks after the primary consultation.

Before randomisation, patients filled in digital versions of the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS); the short form of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire (QuickDASH) upper extremity score; the EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L) general health score; the visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain at rest, at night, and during activity over the previous week, labelled 0 for no pain and 100 for worst imaginable pain; and the Stanford expectations of treatment scale (SETS). We selected the study scores to allow a broad evaluation of shoulder function and therefore included a shoulder specific score (OSS), an upper extremity specific score (QuickDASH), and symptom specific scales (VAS for pain). The OSS has been validated for pathologies of the rotator cuff, including calcific tendinopathy, and exists in Norwegian and Swedish translation. It ranges from 0 to 48 with a lower result indicating a greater degree of disability. The QuickDASH ranges from 0 to 100 with a higher score indicating greater disability. The EQ-5D-5L measures general health related quality of life, and results can be presented as an index value with a value of 1 representing a state of perfect health. The SETS measures positive and negative pre-treatment expectations, each on a scale from 1 to 7, with higher scores representing higher degrees of positive and negative expectations, respectively. An adverse event diary was handed out, and patients were instructed to note any change in their health condition that they perceived as an adverse event together with the type of the event, its date of occurrence, its severity, and whether treatment was needed.

### Subacromial ultrasound guided or systemic steroid injection for rotator cuff disease: randomised double blind study [^113FQNHV]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results

Of the 312 patients evaluated for inclusion, we randomised 106. The figureshows the reasons for exclusion and the follow-up of patients through the trial. One patient in each treatment group did not attend the two week follow-up. Two patients in the systemic group were not available at the six week follow-up (one had a medical condition and the other could not be reached). For these patients, we carried forward the last reported values in the intention to treat analysis. One patient in the systemic group withdrew from the study after the two week follow-up and received an additional corticosteroid injection in the shoulder. We included these results in the intention to treat analyses. The outcome for this patient was poor.

Flow chart of study. GH = glenohumeral; SLAP = superior labrum, anterior to posterior; SPADI = shoulder pain and disability index

Table 1shows the baseline characteristics of the study sample. At baseline, the groups were similar with respect to sex, age, duration of symptoms, sickness leave, worker's compensation claims, dominant side affected, concomitant neck pain, previous episodes of shoulder pain, emotional distress, and use of analgesics. Eight patients were not able or were unwilling to have magnetic resonance imaging and had diagnostic ultrasonography. Five patients in each group had a full thickness rotator cuff tear. Eight patients in the local group and five patients in the systemic group attended physiotherapy between baseline and the six week follow-up. The groups did not differ in drug use, and no patient reported attending for other treatments in the trial period. All procedures were implemented without difficulties. Seven (24%) of 29 patients in the local group and 19 (50%) of 38 patients in the systemic group correctly identified the treatment group they were assigned to (P = 0.055). Thirty nine (37%) patients did not answer the question about which treatment they believed they had received.

### Patterns of imaging requests by general practitioners for people with musculoskeletal complaints: an analysis from a primary care database [^112V9bPJ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Almost 30% of our cohort with a shoulder complaint received an x‐ray request. Although plain radiographs may be worthwhile to diagnose glenohumeral joint arthritis and assess its severity, the radiographic prevalence of this condition in primary care is only 17% and mainly affects older adults, indicating likely overuse. Over 40% of our cohort had a shoulder ultrasound request, although the utility of diagnostic ultrasound for shoulder complaints in primary care is of questionable, if any, utility. Age‐related abnormalities of the rotator cuff in asymptomatic people are common and may not be of clinical relevance to a patient's complaint. This overuse may also partially explain the high number of patients who received an ultrasound‐guided shoulder injection. Although there is high‐quality evidence that glucocorticoid injection provides worthwhile short‐term benefit for people with rotator cuff disease, there is also moderate‐certainty evidence that ultrasound guidance does not improve pain or function over landmark‐guided injection. It also has significantly greater cost. Medicare statistics data indicate an increasing number of ultrasound‐guided injections are being performed over time, which led to it being identified as a low‐value practice, which should be questioned by the Australian Rheumatology Association. Other than a lack of awareness of the evidence and promotion of the procedure by vested interests, the removal of subsidized landmark‐guided intra‐articular steroid injection from the Medicare Benefits Schedule in 2009 may also explain the increased use of ultrasound‐guided shoulder injection. Although meta‐analyses support the use of hydrodilatation with glucocorticoid over glucocorticoid injection alone for frozen shoulder, only 1.7% (n = 445) of our cohort with a shoulder complaint had a request for hydrodilatation compared with nearly 11% for injection. This may be explained by the relatively low prevalence of frozen shoulder compared with rotator cuff disease for which there is also evidence supporting the effectiveness of shoulder injection.

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113RQCcn]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Quality Assessment

Of the 12 included studies, one was rated as having a "low risk of bias" in all domains, and the other studies were classified as having an "unclear risk of bias" for at least one aspect or a "high risk of bias" for at least two aspects. The results of the risk of bias are presented in the Supplementary Material Appendix D (Supplemental Digital Content 4). According to the GRADE system, the quality of the evidence of the included studies was very low, low, or moderate. For pain, the certainty of the evidence was moderate. The evidence was downgraded because of the risk of bias. For function, the certainty of the evidence was very low. The evidence was downgraded because of the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. For shoulder ROM, the certainty of the evidence was low or very low. The evidence was downgraded because of the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. The GRADE results are presented in Table 2.

TABLE 2
Results of the GRADE

Effect of Intervention: Pain Relief

Ten trials. (795 participants) were included in the analysis. Moderate certainty evidence showed that the USG injection had a small but significant effect on the reduction of pain (10 trials; MD = −0.58; 95% CI = −1.05 to −0.10; P = 0.017) with statistically significant heterogeneity (I² = 76.7%, P = 0.000; Fig. 2). In the subgroup analysis, follow-up duration of 6–8 wks (8 trials; MD = −0.72; 95% CI = −1.19 to −0.25; P = 0.002) and use of methylprednisolone (8 trials; MD = −0.79; 95% CI = −1.28 to −0.29; P = 0.002) and betamethasone (1 trial; MD = −0.94; 95% CI = −1.58 to −0.30; P = 0.004) showed evidence of a significant difference in pain relief (Table 3). Age and other subgroup factors had no effect on pain relief. No significant changes in heterogeneity or overall effects were observed in the sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Material Appendix E, Supplemental Digital Content 5).

### Progressive exercise compared with best practice advice, with or without corticosteroid injection, for the treatment of patients with rotator cuff disorders (GRASP): a multicentre, pragmatic, 2 × 2 factorial, randomised controlled trial [^1173PnZ9]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Randomisation and masking

Consented participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) progressive exercise programme (a progressive home exercise programme that was individually tailored and prescribed and supervised by a physiotherapist involving up to six face-to-face sessions over 16 weeks), (2) best practice advice (one face-to-face session with a physiotherapist and home exercise programme supported by high quality self-management materials); (3) progressive exercise programme preceded by a subacromial corticosteroid injection; or (4) best practice advice session preceded by a subacromial corticosteroid injection.

Randomisation (1:1:1:1) was done by an independent research facilitator using the centralised computer randomisation service provided by the Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit once the patient was enrolled and baseline questionnaire completed. Randomisation was computer generated and stratified by site, age (18–35 years, > 35 years) and sex, using variable block sizes. We could not mask physiotherapists or study participants once treatment allocation was revealed. When practical, team members were masked until after data analysis was complete. Trial statisticians had access to treatment assignment during the study for the purposes of data monitoring and safety. Data entry personnel entered data from anonymised questionnaires, which included some details on treatments received.

Procedures

Subacromial corticosteroid injection was delivered before the progressive exercise or best practice advice intervention and given predominately by extended-scope physiotherapists with an appropriate post-registration qualification. Appointments were coordinated so that participants would receive their injection within 10 days of randomisation. In accordance with the trial protocol, the corticosteroid injected was either methylprednisolone acetate (≤ 40 mg) or triamcinolone acetonide (≤ 40 mg), as per local treatment protocols. The local anaesthetic was either 1.0% lidocaine (≤ 5 mL) or 0.5% bupivacaine hydrochloride (≤ 10 mL). The choice and dose of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic (including volume), including the injection site, was recorded for each participant. A second injection could be given after 6 weeks in accordance with the trial protocol for patients who received good initial benefit from their first injection. Because of existing evidence of the greater effectiveness of corticosteroid injection compared with placebo for short-term management, we excluded the use of placebo injection from our protocol. Full details of the exercise interventions have been reported previouslyand here described in brief.

### Optimising outcomes of exercise and corticosteroid injection in patients with subacromial pain (impingement) syndrome: a factorial randomised trial [^112H4N6n]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Shoulder pain is an important cause of disability, affecting one in five adults. Half of cases are due to subacromial pain (formerly impingement) syndrome (SAPS). Treatment guidelines recommend non-surgical management as the mainstay including education/self-management advice, exercise, corticosteroid injection and analgesia.

Exercise is thought to reduce SAPS-related pain and disability by addressing posture, muscle (including rotator cuff) weakness, scapular stability and impaired scapulohumeral rhythm, but trials are often small, of poor methodological quality and include only short-term follow-up. Supervised, progressed shoulder exercises are effective in the short term but the optimum type, intensity and duration are unknown. A systematic review of contextual factors associated with outcome concluded that physiotherapists should be involved in the design and delivery of exercise programme for SAPS.SAPS is commonly treated with corticosteroid injections although their efficacy is debated. Poor response to injection has been attributed to inaccurate placement of the injection, among other factors. Ultrasound guidance might improve accuracy, but small randomised trials have not consistently confirmed the superiority of ultrasound-guided injection over unguided injection in patients with SAPS.

The SUbacromial imPingement syndrome and Pain: a randomised controlled trial Of exeRcise and injecTion trial aimed to assess whether greater improvements in pain and function were obtained with (1) a physiotherapist led, individualised, supervised and progressed exercise programme versus a standardised advice and exercise leaflet, and (2) ultrasound-guided subacromial corticosteroid injection versus unguided injection.

### Diagnostic injections about the shoulder [^116up2oS]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2017). Low credibility.

Injections about the shoulder serve diagnostic as well as therapeutic purposes. Diagnosis of shoulder conditions, such as rotator cuff tears, acromioclavicular joint pathology, subacromial impingement or anterolateral pain syndrome, glenohumeral joint pathology, suprascapular nerve entrapment, and biceps tendon pathologies, is often complicated by concomitant conditions with overlapping symptoms and by inconclusive physical examination and imaging results. Injections of anesthetic agents can often help clinicians locate the source of pain. However, technique and accuracy of needle placement can vary by route. Accuracy is often improved with the use of ultrasonography guidance, although studies differ on the benefits of guided versus unguided injection.

### Editorial commentary: corticosteroid injections administered within 4 weeks before shoulder arthroscopy are associated with an increased risk of infection [^1162PzNa]. Arthroscopy (2024). Medium credibility.

Corticosteroid injections are a frequently used modality for addressing shoulder pain. The widespread utilization of corticosteroid injections is supported by clinical practice guidelines and consensus statements including the 2019 American Academy for Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) guidelines for the management of rotator cuff injuries. However, steroids may be detrimental to healing potential following cuff repair and increase the risk of re-tear. In addition, corticosteroid injections administered within 4 weeks prior to shoulder arthroscopy are associated with an increased risk of infection. The degree of risk is dependent on the timing of surgery with longer time intervals between injection and shoulder arthroscopy being associated with less risk. The next version of the AAOS clinical practice guidelines for managing rotator cuff tears should incorporate commentary on the specific risk of surgical site infection following pre-operative corticosteroid injections, as well as on the timing of injections, with the aim of increasing awareness of these potentially devastating adverse effects.

### A randomized comparative study of short term response to blind injection versus sonographic-guided injection of local corticosteroids in patients with painful shoulder [^1155sMqr]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Local corticosteroid injections, commonly accepted by rheumatologists to be effective treating painful shoulder, have shown controversial results. High frequency ultrasonography is an accurate and safe imaging modality for guiding musculoskeletal injections. We prospectively compared the short term response to randomized blind injection versus sonographic-guided injection of local corticosteroid in patients with painful shoulder.

Methods

We studied 41 consecutive patients with painful shoulder. Patients with previous trauma or chronic inflammatory arthritis were excluded. No patient had received previous physiotherapy or local steroid injection in the shoulder. Patients were randomized to receive either a blind subacromial injection of 20 mg triamcinolone (Group 1, n = 20) or a sonographic guided injection of 20 mg triamcinolone (Group 2, n = 21) by the same rheumatologist blinded to the clinical evaluation. In both groups we recorded shoulder abnormalities and the location of the steroid postinjection by ultrasound. Each patient was clinically assessed within 5 days before injection and 6 weeks after injection by another rheumatologist without knowledge of the injection technique performed. Clinical assessment included demographic and clinical data, a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain (0–100), the Shoulder Function Assessment (SFA) scale (0–70), and postinjection adverse effects. No patient received physical therapy during the followup period. Initially, demographic, clinical, and ultrasonographic findings in both groups showed no significant differences.

Results

Six weeks after injection, the VAS and the SFA score showed a significantly greater improvement in Group 2 compared with Group 1 (mean VAS score change 34.9 for Group 2 vs 7.1 for Group 1, p < 0.001; and mean SFA score change 15 for Group 2 vs 5.6 for Group 1, p = 0.012). One patient in Group 1 reported mild postinjection adverse effects.

Conclusion

We suggest that sonographic-guided corticosteroid injections should be indicated, at least, in patients with poor response to previous blind injection to ensure accurate medication placement in order to improve therapeutic effectiveness.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) and peri-articular injections for musculoskeletal pain are addressed in this adult-focused guideline, which summarizes scope, dosing, efficacy, and safety. The guideline covers corticosteroid joint injections for "the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet", notes "little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another", and states that "Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain". Dosing statements include: "A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections", "The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone", and "Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS". Efficacy is characterized as "short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months", and adverse events include "an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection".

### Arthroscopic subacromial decompression for subacromial shoulder pain (CSAW): a multicentre, pragmatic, parallel group, placebo-controlled, three-group, randomised surgical trial [^112oTFfU]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Operating surgeons had a large amount of experience (29 of 38 were consultants for more than 5 years and 26 of 38 had done more than 20 decompressions in the previous year), and most had done between 40–60 procedures. Patients had to have subacromial pain of at least 3 months' duration with intact rotator cuff tendons, be eligible for arthroscopic surgery, and to have previously completed a non-operative management programme that included both exercise therapy and at least one steroid injection. Diagnosis was confirmed by a consultant shoulder surgeon. Detailed exclusion criteria are in the protocol and included patients with a full-thickness torn rotator cuff (identified with MRI, ultrasound, or x-ray). Patients with partial-thickness tears were not excluded but the location, nature, and extent of the partial-thickness tear was recorded. Informed consent of patients was obtained by the participating surgeon or suitably qualified local centre study personnel after a reflection period of 48 h, subsequent to study introduction and taken at the baseline measurement appointment immediately before baseline measurement. Consent was requested for all study interventions and assessments, including voice recording of appointments for qualitative research investigative purposes.

Randomisation and masking

We randomly assigned participants (1:1:1) to arthroscopic subacromial decompression, investigational arthroscopy only, or no treatment (attendance of one reassessment appointment with a specialist shoulder clinician 3 months after study entry, but no intervention). Arthroscopy only was a placebo as the essential surgical element (bone and soft tissue removal) was omitted. We did the randomisation with a computer-generated minimisation system.

Patients randomly assigned to surgery were not told which procedure they had undergone, decompression or arthroscopy only, to ensure they were masked to assignment; however, patients assigned to no treatment were not masked to assignment. Masked assessment was done in all groups. The randomisation was done by a site research officer using an automated computer generated minimisation system, minimising for age (< 40, 40–55, or ≥ 56 years), sex, baseline Oxford Shoulder Score (< 19, 19–26, 27–33, or ≥ 34 years), and recruiting site.

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115oZAMz]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Implications

Ultrasound-guided injections are associated with several advantages including the lack of radiation exposure; therefore, this technique has gained widespread use in recent years, replacing the conventional ALG injection, also known as "blind" approach. In our study, few cases of adverse events were reported in the safety analysis, although only six studies reported this outcome. Therefore, based on our findings, we recommend USG corticosteroid injection as an efficient and safe intervention for patients with SIS, particularly when a physician or therapist is not well trained and proficient in using ALG injection, both of which can achieve similar accuracy and efficacy when administered by an experienced provider. Although some researchers have expressed concerns regarding the lack of efficacy of USG injections to justify their higher cost, a cost-effectiveness analysis has not been performed in current evidence to address these concerns. Until this analysis is conducted, the decision regarding the use of USG versus ALG injections should be primarily informed by evidence from currently available efficacy analysis.

### Ultrasound imaging for the rheumatologist XLVI. ultrasound guided injection in the shoulder: a descriptive literature review [^111p9Nxw]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Shoulder pain represents one of the most frequent clinical conditions in the general population and it can be generated by a large spectrum of pathologies. The most frequent approach of most rheumatologists to shoulder pain, in daily clinical practice, mainly based on their personal experience, is to locally inject drugs. Since the literature on this topic provides conflicting results due to the wide heterogeneity in the study designs, we decided to report the most relevant studies. Not enough data are available to assess whether US-guided injections are more efficient in controlling shoulder pain with respect to the landmark approach. However, it is likely that US-guided technique shows a more rapid improvement, possibly by providing a higher corticosteroid volume injected right where it is needed. When injecting hyaluronic acid, a more accurate localisation of the medicament might be useful to improve efficacy and avoid adverse effects (i.e. pain), however, there are no studies comparing the blind approach to the US-guided one. Finally, new treatments for shoulder pain have been used but they still need future validation in more appropriate RCTs.

### The use and safety of corticosteroid injections for shoulder pain in general practice: a retrospective cohort study [^116ieQEm]. Family Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Our search algorithm identified 18,678 adult patients with a new episode of shoulder pain in the Rijnmond Primary Care database (2012–2017). A total of 3,730 patients had to be excluded because they did not have 12 months of valid follow-up data available. This resulted in a total study population of 14,948 patients, of whom 56% were women; the mean age was 53.9 years (SD 16.2).

Sample 1: patients with a new episode of shoulder pain (n = 1,000)

In this sample of 1,000 patients with a new episode of shoulder pain, 84 patients had to be excluded because they did not meet the criteria for the definition of shoulder pain(Fig. 1). Therefore, the positive predictive value (PPV) for the algorithm was 91.6%. Of the included patients (n = 916), 58% were female and the mean age was 53.8 years (SD 15.5). In total, 31% had a history of shoulder pain, 13% had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis, 10% had diabetes and only 2% had a diagnosis of a rheumatic disease. In this sample, 237 patients (26%) received a CSI administered by the GP within 12 months after the initial shoulder pain diagnosis (Table 1).

Characteristics of sample 1: patients with a new episode of shoulder pain and the incidence of the administration of a corticosteroid injection (CSI) within 12 months after the initial shoulder pain diagnosis (2012–2017).

In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the patient's age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02–1.04) and history of shoulder complaints (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.13–2.12) were positively associated with the likelihood of receiving a CSI within 12 months. Sex and the presence of a diabetes diagnosis were not associated with receiving a CSI (Supplementary Table 1).

### The incidence and management of shoulder complaints in general practice: a retrospective cohort study [^117WsuAb]. Family Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Management and consultation rates

We selected a random sample of 1000 incident cases from the study population, identified through our search algorithm. The full medical files were examined from the consultation date of the initial diagnosis until 12 months after the diagnosis. The following definition for shoulder complaints was used to identify cases: 'Shoulder complaints include all pain that is located in all or part of the area that runs from the base of the neck to the elbow and is not a consequence of serious recent trauma'. Cases where the shoulder diagnosis did not match our definition were excluded from further analyses.

For each patient in the random sample, information on the side of the affected shoulder (left, right, both, unknown) and duration of complaints at the first consultation was extracted. The duration was categorized as acute (< 6 weeks), non-acute (> 6 weeks) or unknown. The patient's age at the first consultation, gender and history of shoulder complaints (an episode of shoulder complaints ≥ 12 months before the current episode) were also extracted from the electronic medical files. Information on the management by the GP at each consultation for the shoulder complaints within 12 months following the initial diagnosis was extracted. The applied management approach was categorized as: a wait-and-see policy (if no active treatment was given), prescription of oral medication (divided into paracetamol, nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) or opioids), administration of a corticosteroid injection, referral to a physiotherapist, commissioning of additional diagnostic imaging (including X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging) and/or referral to secondary care (including orthopaedic surgeon, neurologist or rheumatologist).

### Ultrasound guided lavage with corticosteroid injection versus sham lavage with and without corticosteroid injection for calcific tendinopathy of shoulder: randomised double blinded multi-arm study [^112kZdm3]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

An interesting secondary finding is the superiority of the sham lavage plus steroid group on the OSS over sham at two and six weeks and over lavage plus steroid at two weeks. This indicates that a steroid injection should be preferred when temporary symptomatic improvement is the treatment goal. Whether this short term benefit is outweighed by higher recurrence rates and lower rates of recovery, as reported in previous trials, can, however, be discussed. The hypothesis of a rebound effect after a steroid injection may be supported by the results from the sham lavage plus steroid group at 24 months, which were inferior to sham and significantly inferior to lavage plus steroid on all outcome scores (table 2).

Strengths of study

Firstly, this study had a double blind, three arm design with inclusion of a sham group. Without a sham group, assessing the true clinical effect of active treatment in a condition with a natural course that often ends with spontaneous recovery is not possible. Secondly, the pragmatic, multicentre, and multidisciplinary design contributes to the generalisability of the results. Thirdly, because of the successful blinding of the study patients, we presume that a placebo response occurred in our study groups.

### A prospective study of 100 patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy showed no correlation between subacromial bursitis and the efficacy of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection [^113vCCE3]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The objective of this study was to determine whether the presence of subacromial bursitis in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy (RCT) was associated with a better outcome after ultrasound (US)-guided subacromial corticosteroid injection.

Methods

A single-center prospective study was performed including patients referred for subacromial injection to manage RCT. At baseline, all patients received an US-guided intra-bursal injection of betamethasone (1 ml). The primary endpoint was reduced pain 3 months (M3) after the procedure: a good responder was defined by a decrease in Visual Analogue Scale pain of more than 30%. Secondary endpoints included functional recovery assessed by the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) and clinical success at 6 weeks (W6). We also explored the association between good clinical response and other factors, such as US or X-ray features.

Results

One hundred patients were included and 49 presented with subacromial bursitis. At M3, 60% of patients (54/100) were considered good responders. The rate of good responders did not differ between the bursitis and non-bursitis groups (p = 0.6). During follow-up, OSS improved over time whether bursitis was present or not. We did not find any US or X-ray features significantly associated with a favorable clinical outcome.

Conclusion

The presence of subacromial bursitis did not influence clinical outcomes at 3 months post-subacromial injection in patients suffering from RCT.

Clinical Relevance Statement

The presence of subacromial bursitis did not influence clinical outcomes at 3 months post-subacromial corticosteroid injection in patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy. For patient management, looking for ultrasonographic signs of bursitis does not appear relevant for the indication of the injection.

Key Points

- Ultrasound-guided subacromial corticosteroid injections led to a significant improvement in 60% of patients suffering from rotator cuff tendinopathy.
- The presence of subacromial bursitis was not associated with better improvement at 3 months post-injection.
- Except for the Minnesota score referring to job satisfaction, we did not find any baseline clinical, X-ray, or ultrasound characteristics associated with a successful outcome.

### Subacromial ultrasound guided or systemic steroid injection for rotator cuff disease: randomised double blind study [^113j64Tk]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

Methods

This study was a prospective, double blind, randomised controlled trial. We recruited patients between April 2005 and October 2006. We invited general practitioners in Oslo, serving a population of half a million, to refer patients with rotator cuff disease to the outpatient clinic of the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department at Ullevål University Hospital in Norway. We included patients who were at least 18 years old and had all of the following: shoulder pain for more than three months; pain on abduction; less than a 50% reduced glenohumeral range of motion in no more than one direction of external rotation, internal rotation, or abduction; pain on two of three isometric tests for abduction, external rotation, and internal rotation; and a positive Hawkins-Kennedy impingement sign.

We excluded patients who had symptomatic acromioclavicular arthritis, clinical and radiological findings indicating glenohumeral joint pathology, referred pain from the neck or internal organs, generalised muscular pain syndrome with bilateral muscular pain in the neck and shoulders, a history of inflammatory arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, previous fractures or surgery to the shoulder, or contraindications to local steroid injections or if they had received any corticosteroids the last month before inclusion. We also excluded patients with a shoulder pain and disability index score below 30 points, representing minor complaints that did not indicate corticosteroid injections.

The same medical doctor (OME) examined all patients referred to the clinic for eligibility. They were thoroughly informed about the study and signed an informed consent if they were willing to participate.

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Pe1jN]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaborationand reported based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines (see Supplementary Material Appendix A, Supplemental Digital Content 1). The protocol of this study is available in PROSPERO (CRD42020162682).

Search Strategy

The following electronic databases were searched from inception to August 15, 2021; using search terms shoulder impingement syndrome/impingement and corticosteroid injection: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang databases. Detailed electronic search strategies are provided in the Supplementary Material Appendix B (Supplemental Digital Content 2). Open Grey was searched for the gray literature research. The reference lists of the included reviews and trials were also screened to identify potentially related studies.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Types of Studies

All randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy of USG versus ALG corticosteroid injection in treating SIS were eligible for inclusion. Studies without full text or case reports were excluded. The language of the included randomized controlled trials was limited to English and Chinese.

Types of Participants

Adults participants (older than 18 yrs) with (1) a history of shoulder pain that worsened because of overhead activities and lying on the affected shoulder; (2) painful restriction of active flexion and/or abduction of the shoulder, or limitations in internal and external rotation; and (3) a positive Neer test, Hawkins test, Jobes test, painful arch, or external rotation resistance testwere included. Causes of shoulder pain other than SIS were excluded.

Types of Interventions

The intervention was a USG corticosteroid injection, and the comparator was an ALG corticosteroid injection. The doses and types of corticosteroids used were not limited. There was no restriction on the injection approach: anterior, lateral, and posterior approaches.

Types of Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was pain and secondary outcomes were function/disability, range-of-motion (ROM) assessment, and adverse events. The outcomes were prioritized as suggested by Steuri et al.and pain or functional outcomes were assessed by using different scales (Supplementary Material Appendix C, Supplemental Digital Content 3).
