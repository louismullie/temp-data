## Question

How does binge eating disorder (BED) differ from bulimia?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how Binge Eating Disorder (BED) differs from Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core feature both disorders share. Then, I should verify the single most decisive diagnostic differentiator. Next, I will compare the formal DSM-5-TR criteria and clarify frequency/duration thresholds, including any misstatements that need correction. After that, I should review psychological and behavioral phenotypes, followed by medical complications and epidemiology. I will then consider treatment principles and monitoring, and finally synthesize the overlapping features and nosology to give a concise takeaway with clinical implications [^114HLSBV] [^112FcNNm] [^111Twosn].

> Let me first confirm the fundamental shared feature: both BED and BN are anchored by recurrent episodes of binge eating, defined as consuming an objectively large amount of food in a discrete period with a sense of loss of control; I need to ensure the definition aligns with DSM-5-TR and contemporary reviews, and it does, which explains why the two are often conflated at presentation [^114HLSBV] [^112FcNNm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before identifying the pivot for diagnosis; the regular use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain is required in BN and absent in BED, so the presence of purging, laxatives/diuretics, fasting, or excessive exercise points firmly to BN, whereas their absence supports BED and is, in fact, exclusionary for BN in BED's criteria, which I should double-check and which is confirmed by DSM-5-TR and the BED disease primer [^114HLSBV] [^112FcNNm].

> Wait, let me verify the finer points of the DSM criteria because subtle wording matters for clinical decisions; in BN, both binge eating and compensatory behaviors must occur at least once weekly for three months and self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape/weight, while in BED, binge eating must occur at least once weekly for three months with marked distress and at least three associated features (eating rapidly, until uncomfortably full, when not hungry, alone due to embarrassment, or with guilt/disgust), and compensatory behaviors are not regularly present; I initially recalled a phrasing suggesting "once per day per week", but that wording is incorrect — let me correct myself clearly: the threshold is at least once per week for three months for both disorders according to DSM-5-TR and contemporary summaries, whereas some secondary sources misstate this frequency [^114HLSBV] [^112FcNNm] [^113bkCkz].

> I need to consider body image psychopathology carefully; I should confirm that overvaluation of shape/weight is a required criterion for BN, which it is, but is not required for BED even though its presence in BED signals greater severity and a profile that can resemble BN; this distinction has prognostic and treatment-planning value, so I should flag overvaluation in BED as a specifier-level severity marker per empirical studies while retaining that it is not diagnostic for BED per DSM [^114HLSBV] [^111BKy8w] [^115ZTtuj].

> Next, I should review psychological and behavioral phenotypes without overgeneralizing; both disorders share impairments in reward processing, inhibitory control, and emotion regulation, but personality research suggests BN is relatively higher in stress reactivity and negative emotionality, whereas BED shows higher harm avoidance after adjusting for depression, which can guide individualized psychotherapy targets and relapse prevention planning [^112FcNNm] [^116igMRv].

> Let me now examine medical complications and epidemiology, and I need to ensure I separate purging-related risks from obesity/metabolic risks; BN's medical risks are driven by purging and include electrolyte disturbances (notably hypokalemia), metabolic alkalosis, dehydration, arrhythmias, dental erosions, and salivary gland enlargement, and body weight is often normal or slightly elevated, with US female prevalence roughly 2–3 percent, whereas BED's complications track with obesity and metabolic syndrome such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease, and global prevalence is on the order of 0.6–1.8 percent in women and 0.3–0.7 percent in men, becoming more common in weight-loss seeking populations, which I should explicitly note for primary care and bariatric settings [^117TAo8m] [^113A9Vah] [^111Twosn] [^112FcNNm] [^1158kvzQ].

> I should double-check treatment principles and monitoring because they follow from the core differences; for BN, SSRIs — especially fluoxetine 60 mg/day — are recommended as first-line or adjunctive therapy and care should routinely include CBT and a coordinated multidisciplinary team, with targeted monitoring for purging sequelae including electrolytes, renal and hepatic indices, and ECG when indicated, while for BED, psychotherapy and multidisciplinary care are central with pharmacotherapy tailored to binge frequency and comorbidities, and medical monitoring focuses on metabolic screening and weight-related comorbidities rather than purging complications [^115JqgX1] [^117TfV3u] [^112vKMyB] [^117EoG6m] [^115aFdwr] [^113BbAU6] [^112FcNNm].

> But wait, what if these disorders are more closely related than our categorical labels suggest; let me reconsider nosology and longitudinal data, which show substantial comorbidity with mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, evidence of familial and genetic overlap among eating disorders, and diagnostic crossover between BED and BN over time, all of which support viewing them as related conditions along a binge-eating spectrum rather than entirely discrete entities, even as the presence versus absence of compensatory behaviors remains the decisive diagnostic boundary in DSM [^111Twosn] [^112FcNNm] [^112H7ozt] [^112wiUzZ] [^115n2vTZ] [^114iEWLd].

> In final synthesis, I need to ensure the clinical takeaway is crisp: BED and BN both feature recurrent binge eating with loss of control, but BN is defined by regular, inappropriate compensatory behaviors and overvaluation of shape/weight, whereas BED requires the absence of those behaviors and emphasizes distress with associated binge features; that single behavioral difference drives different medical risk profiles, monitoring priorities, and initial treatment emphases, even as shared vulnerabilities justify transdiagnostic perspectives and careful longitudinal follow-up for crossover and comorbidity [^114HLSBV] [^112FcNNm] [^111Twosn].

BED and bulimia nervosa **both involve binge eating with loss of control** [^112FcNNm] but differ in compensatory behaviors and medical risks. The key distinction is that **BED lacks regular compensatory behaviors** (purging, laxatives, excessive exercise) [^113bkCkz], whereas **BN includes them** to prevent weight gain [^114HLSBV]. BED is more often linked to obesity and metabolic syndrome [^112FcNNm], whereas BN carries higher risk of electrolyte disturbances, dental erosion, and esophageal injury from purging [^117TAo8m]. Both respond to CBT, but **BN uniquely benefits from SSRIs** such as fluoxetine 60 mg/day [^115JqgX1] [^117TAo8m]. Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide **treatment and risk management** [^114Kjg6K].

## Diagnostic criteria

### Binge eating disorder (BED)

- **Core features**: Recurrent binge episodes with loss of control [^112FcNNm], without regular compensatory behaviors [^113bkCkz].
- **Frequency**: ≥ 1 episode/week for ≥ 3 months [^113tAR51] [^113bkCkz].
- **Associated symptoms**: Marked distress; eating rapidly, until uncomfortably full, when not hungry, alone due to embarrassment [^116ref8X], and post-binge guilt or disgust [^113bkCkz].
- **Exclusion**: Not exclusive to AN or BN [^112FcNNm] [^113bkCkz].

---

### Bulimia nervosa (BN)

- **Core features**: Recurrent binge episodes with loss of control, followed by regular compensatory behaviors (vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise) [^114HLSBV] [^111Twosn].
- **Frequency**: ≥ 1 episode/week for ≥ 3 months [^113A9Vah] [^114HLSBV].
- **Body image**: Overvaluation of shape/weight strongly influences self-evaluation [^111Twosn] [^114HLSBV].
- **Exclusion**: Not exclusive to AN [^114HLSBV].

---

## Clinical features and behavioral patterns

| **Feature** | **BED** | **BN** |
|-|-|-|
| Compensatory behaviors | Absent [^113bkCkz] | Present (vomiting, laxatives, excessive exercise) [^114HLSBV] |
| Body image disturbance | Present, but less severe [^111BKy8w] | Severe, central to diagnosis [^114HLSBV] |
| Weight status | Often overweight/obese [^112FcNNm] | Typically normal weight or slightly overweight [^111Twosn] |
| Medical complications | Obesity, metabolic syndrome [^112FcNNm] | Electrolyte imbalance, dental erosion, esophageal injury [^117TAo8m] |
| Psychological distress | High, guilt and shame [^112FcNNm] | High, guilt, shame, anxiety [^111Twosn] |

---

## Epidemiology and demographic differences

BED is more **prevalent** than BN, particularly in obesity-treatment settings [^1158kvzQ] [^1158mgnp]. Both are more common in females, but a higher proportion of males are affected in BED than in BN [^112FcNNm] [^112a73CY]. BED often has a later age of onset than BN.

---

## Comorbidities and psychological factors

Common comorbidities include **depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders** in both conditions [^112FcNNm] [^117TAo8m]. Personality traits differ, with BN showing greater **impulsivity and emotional dysregulation**, whereas BED shows higher **harm avoidance** and negative core beliefs [^11551Bmm].

---

## Treatment approaches and effectiveness

- **Psychotherapy**: CBT is first-line for both; IPT and DBT are also effective.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine 60 mg/day) are effective for BN; limited evidence for BED [^115JqgX1].
- **Multidisciplinary care**: Medical, psychiatric, psychological, and nutritional expertise is recommended for both [^112vKMyB] [^117TfV3u].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

Both disorders can be **chronic with relapse**; BN carries higher medical risk from **purging**, whereas BED carries higher **obesity-related risk** [^117TAo8m]. Recurrence is **significant in both**, and psychiatric comorbidity predicts **poorer outcomes** [^115n2vTZ].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **BED** | **BN** |
|-|-|-|
| Compensatory behaviors | Absent [^113bkCkz] | Present [^114HLSBV] |
| Medical complications | Obesity, metabolic syndrome [^112FcNNm] | Electrolyte imbalance, dental erosion [^117TAo8m] |
| Pharmacotherapy | Limited evidence [^112FcNNm] | SSRIs effective [^115JqgX1] |
| Prognosis | Chronic, obesity-related complications [^112FcNNm] | Chronic, purging-related complications [^117TAo8m] |

---

BED and BN differ in compensatory behaviors, medical risks, and treatment response; **accurate diagnosis is essential** for targeted care and risk management [^114Kjg6K].

The following constitutes key background information on binge eating disorder:

- **Definition**: BED is characterized by regular episodes of consuming large amounts of food and experiencing a loss of control over eating behavior.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BED is complex, involving genetic and environmental factors, as well as neuroendocrinological and neurobiological contributions. Neurobiological findings highlight impairments in reward processing, inhibitory control, and emotion regulation in individuals with BED.

- **Epidemiology**: The worldwide prevalence of BED for the years 2018–2020 is estimated to be 0.6–1.8% in adult women and 0.3–0.7% in adult men.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for BED are diverse and include psychological factors, societal influences, and certain comorbidities. It is commonly associated with obesity and somatic and mental health comorbidities, including mood and anxiety disorders.

- **Disease course**: The clinical manifestations of BED are characterized by regular episodes of binge eating during which individuals ingest large amounts of food and experience a loss of control over their eating behavior. Unlike other eating disorders, BED does not involve inappropriate compensatory behaviors or extreme dietary restraint.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BED is often chronic, with individuals experiencing considerable burden and impairments in quality of life (QoL).

The disease bulimia nervosa can be associated with various conditions and symptoms. These include metabolic acidosis, dietary restrictions, self-induced vomiting, binge eating disorder, and decreased serum phosphate. Additional related issues are diuretics, lightheadedness, hypomagnesemia, binge eating, hypokalemia, anxiety, suicidal ideation, obesity, and body image dissatisfaction. Mood changes, dental erosions, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, Russell's sign, dehydration, depression, and angular cheilitis are also noted.

Other associated factors are alcohol use disorder, ADHD, vitamin B12 deficiency, laxative use, anovulation, hypochloremia, substance use disorder, and metabolic alkalosis. Personality disorders, vitamin D deficiency, peripheral edema, iron deficiency anemia, purging behavior, overexercising, bilateral parotid gland enlargement, amenorrhea, fainting, zinc deficiency, and fatigue have also been observed.

### Prospects for new drugs to treat binge-eating disorder: Insights from psychopathology and neuropharmacology [^113bkCkz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Low credibility.

Binge-eating disorder (BED) was first recognized as a distinct eating disorder in the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Edition 5 (DSM-V). Its symptoms are defined under five criteria:

- **Criterion 1**: Episodes of binge eating (BE). These episodes are characterized by eating an excessive amount of food in a discrete period combined with a sense of lack of control.

- **Criterion 2**: BE episodes are associated with three (or more) of the following:
	- Eating much more rapidly than normal.
	- Eating until feeling uncomfortably full.
	- Eating large amounts of food when not hungry.
	- Eating alone because of embarrassment over how much is eaten.
	- Feeling disgusted, depressed, or very guilty after overeating.

- **Criterion 3**: Marked distress regarding BE.

- **Criterion 4**: BE occurs at least once per day per week for three months (DSM-V).

- **Criterion 5**: BE is not associated with the regular use of inappropriate compensatory behavior (e.g. purging, fasting, and excessive exercise) and does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa (AN) or bulimia nervosa (BN).

### Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR™) [^114HLSBV]. APA (2022). High credibility.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa is a clinical tool designed to diagnose and classify the severity of bulimia nervosa. The primary components include episodes of binge eating, a sense of lack of control over eating, inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, the frequency of these behaviors, and the influence of body shape and weight on self-evaluation. The tool also considers whether the disturbance occurs exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa.

The diagnostic criteria are met if all the primary components are present. The severity of bulimia nervosa is classified as mild, moderate, severe, or extreme based on the frequency of inappropriate compensatory behaviors per week. The tool also provides for the classification of bulimia nervosa in partial or full remission, depending on whether some or none of the criteria have been met for a sustained period of time after full criteria were previously met.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa is a comprehensive tool that aids in the accurate diagnosis and classification of bulimia nervosa, facilitating appropriate treatment planning and monitoring of disease progression. This tool is designed to help evaluate whether an individual meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa and, if so, determine the severity and remission status of the condition.

Regarding medical management for binge eating disorder and multidisciplinary care, the 2015 guidelines from the American Academy of Family Physicians recommend ensuring an interdisciplinary team approach. This team often includes a family physician, a psychotherapist or psychiatrist, a dietitian, an eating disorder specialist, and school personnel for the treatment of patients with bulimia nervosa.

### Schema-level cognitions in patients with binge eating disorder: A case control study [^11551Bmm]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

This study examined the schema-level cognitions (core beliefs) of patients with binge eating disorder to determine whether these patients differ from those with bulimia nervosa. A case control method, matching groups for age and body mass index (BMI), was used to avoid the confounding factors commonly found in similar studies.

All clinical women were recruited from a specialist eating disorder clinic. The index group consisted of 25 women with DSM-IV diagnoses of binge eating disorder. These women were compared with a clinical group of 25 women with bulimia nervosa and a group of 25 women with no eating disorder. Groups were closely matched for age and BMI. Each participant completed a well-validated measure of core beliefs.

Although the binge eating disorder group had a range of more negative core beliefs than nonclinical women, the differences between the clinical groups were much smaller. The binge eating disorder group had more negative core beliefs than the bulimia nervosa group in many areas. However, the bulimia nervosa group was distinguished by having the highest level of abandonment beliefs, and this difference may account for the difference in the presence of purging behaviors.

Levels of abandonment beliefs seem to be crucial in understanding the behavioral differences between these clinical groups, particularly the absence of purging behaviors. However, the relevance of these beliefs to treatment outcomes and other aspects of psychopathology remains to be established.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for binge eating disorder, more specifically with respect to initial evaluation, APA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following during the initial psychiatric evaluation of patients with a possible eating disorder:

- **Weight measurement**: Monitor and document the patient's weight.

- **Quantity of eating and weight control behaviors**: Evaluate the frequency, intensity, or time spent on dietary restriction, binge eating, purging, exercise, and other compensatory behaviors.

- **Co-occurring health conditions**: Identify any psychiatric disorders or other health conditions that coexist with the eating disorder.

- **Comprehensive review of systems**: Conduct a thorough assessment of the patient's overall health.

### Are the criterion B binge-eating symptoms interchangeable in understanding binge-eating severity? An item response theory analysis [^116ref8X]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The Criterion B binge-eating symptoms represent five symptoms associated with binge eating. Any three out of five symptoms can be used to meet Criterion B. However, Criterion B symptoms may not be interchangeable in terms of how binge-eating severity is associated with each symptom. Item response theory (IRT) can test how endorsing each symptom relates to the overall level (i.e. severity) of binge-eating measured by Criterion B. We used IRT to identify:

- **Symptom correspondence**: How each Criterion B symptom corresponded with binge-eating severity in a transdiagnostic binge-eating sample.
- **Symptom differentiation**: How well each symptom differentiated individuals with differing levels of severity.

Participants (N = 219) were adults (80.8% female) with an eating disorder (ED) that included objective binge-eating episodes assessed via semi-structured interview. A two-parameter logistic IRT model evaluated how endorsement of each Criterion B symptom corresponded with the level of latent binge-eating severity.

"Eating large amounts when not hungry" and "eating alone" reflected the highest binge-eating severity. "Eating alone" was the best discriminator across different binge-eating severity levels, whereas "uncomfortably full" was the poorest discriminator across binge-eating severity levels.

Criterion B symptoms were not interchangeable in terms of what level of binge-eating severity corresponded with symptom endorsement. "Eating large amounts when not hungry" or "eating alone" may signify elevated binge-eating severity, whereas "uncomfortably full" and "feeling disgusted/depressed/guilty" may not.

### The diagnostic validity of the criteria for binge eating disorder [^114p5HUd]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

This paper considers whether the criteria currently used to classify the diagnosis of binge eating disorder (BED) are valid and appropriate.

- **Method**: We review evidence that reflects on the validity of the criteria for binge eating episodes and BED, using literature retrieved through major psychology and psychiatry search engines (e.g. PsycInfo, PubMed).

- **Results**: Evidence from experimental research points to the relative importance of episode frequency, the amount of food consumed at episodes, the subjective sense of loss of control over eating, and several additional criteria associated with binge episodes in BED. Evidence on the differences in psychopathology between BED and bulimia nervosa, as well as between BED and obesity without binge eating, related to diagnostic criteria, is reviewed.

- **Conclusion**: Although evidence concerning the diagnostic criteria of BED is mixed, broadening certain diagnostic criteria for binge eating episodes and BED might more accurately reflect the research literature and increase the number of individuals eligible for inclusion in treatment programs.

### Genetic and environmental contributions to diagnostic fluctuation in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [^112H7ozt]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Although anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are defined as two distinct eating disorders, they share common symptoms. For instance, both disorders include over-evaluation of body weight and shape and behaviors to control weight; anorexia nervosa can include binge eating and purging behaviors, and bulimia nervosa can also involve restrictive eating behaviors. Diagnostic crossover has also been observed across the course of illness. Although pure forms of the illnesses exist, 10–54% of individuals with anorexia nervosa develop bulimia nervosa, and 2–27% of individuals with bulimia nervosa develop anorexia nervosa during the course of illness [Tozzi et al; Eddy et al; Peat et al; Fichter et al.]. The two eating disorders also share common comorbid conditions such as mood disorders, anxiety disorder, substance use disorders, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [Hudson et al; Yao et al.]. In terms of treatment, transdiagnostic approaches such as enhanced cognitive behavioural therapy are associated with favorable outcomes in both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [Dalle Grave et al; Fairburn et al.]. Together, these observations suggest considerable, but not complete, overlap between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.

Observed familial co-aggregation of the two eating disorders further implies their aetiological overlap. Relatives of individuals with anorexia nervosa have an increased risk (over four times) of bulimia nervosa compared to the same types of relatives of individuals without anorexia nervosa, and vice versa [Stein et al; Strobe].

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: An international perspective on key changes and controversies [^115UUdz9]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

In addition to the changes in specifications to anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), the most significant addition to the eating disorders grouping was the inclusion of binge eating disorder (BED) as a separate category. BED is a disturbance characterized by binge eating, associated with significant distress, in the absence of inappropriate weight-compensatory behaviors. The addition of BED as a formal diagnosis, which parallels changes in the DSM-5, follows two decades of research on the clinical significance and validity of this diagnostic construct, previously described as a research category in the Appendix of the DSM-IV. Emerging research worldwide has indicated the prevalence of BED relative to other eating disorders and established the clinical and public health significance of this diagnostic construct.

Both BN and BED are based on the occurrence of binge eating, and the ICD-11 also incorporates changes regarding the definition of what constitutes an episode of binge eating. In the ICD-11, binge eating is defined as a time when an "individual eats notably more and/or differently than usual and feels unable to stop eating or limit the type or amount of food eaten". Other characteristics of binge-eating episodes may include eating alone because of embarrassment, eating foods that are not part of the individual's regular diet, eating large amounts of food despite not feeling hungry, and eating faster than usual. These other features, reflecting a general loss of control or a difference in eating behaviors, resonate with clinicians and patients and parallel the behavioral indicators.

### Long-term course of binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa: Relevance for nosology and diagnostic criteria [^115n2vTZ]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to present the twelve-year outcome of binge eating disorder (BED) in 68 female inpatients, compared to bulimia nervosa, purging type (BN-P; N = 196).

The method involved both self and expert ratings, focusing on the beginning of therapy and the 12-year follow-up.

Results indicated that 36% of BED and 28.2% of BN-P patients still received an eating disorder diagnosis at follow-up. Differences between groups were small according to the Eating Disorder Inventory, Structured Inventory for Anorexic and Bulimic Syndromes, Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and Beck Depression Inventory. Similar predictors for BED and BN-P were identified. Psychiatric comorbidity was the predominant predictor of poor outcome in both diagnoses. Predictors for BED outcome were body dissatisfaction, sexual abuse, and impulsivity; self-injury predicted BN-P outcome.

In conclusion, the course, outcome, and mortality were similar for BED and BN-P. Both disorders had psychiatric comorbidity as the main predictor of outcome, and there was a diagnostic shift between BED and BN-P over time, pointing to their nosological proximity. The data are relevant for the formulation of DSM-V and ICD-11 diagnostic criteria.

### Gender differences in patients with binge eating disorder [^112a73CY]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

This study examined gender differences in patients with binge eating disorder (BED). Participants included 182 adults (35 male, 147 female) who were consecutively evaluated for outpatient clinical trials and met criteria for BED as outlined in the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. They were administered a battery of measures to evaluate developmental, eating and weight-related disturbances, and psychological features associated with BED.

Men and women did not differ significantly on several developmental variables, such as age at first overweight, age at first diet, age at onset of regular binge eating, or number of weight cycles. However, men had a significantly higher body mass index (BMI), the highest adult BMI, and were more likely to be classified as obese. Although men and women did not differ significantly on measures of eating disorder features like binge eating, eating concerns, or weight and shape concerns, women reported significantly greater body image dissatisfaction and drive for thinness. While there were no significant differences in depression or self-esteem, men reported a higher frequency of past drug abuse problems.

Although men and women who present for treatment for BED show many similarities in eating disorder features, we observed several gender differences in important developmental, physical variables, and associated psychological features.

### Bulimia nervosa severity levels based on shape/weight overvaluation explain more variance in clinical characteristics than DSM-5 severity levels [^114Ab9AD]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

- **DSM-5 severity specifiers**: ANOVAs indicated DSM-5 groups differed on overvaluation, cognitive ED symptoms, depression, and binge-eating frequency, with all p-values less than 0.05.

- Group comparisons of demographic and clinical characteristics for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-5 specified severity indicators are detailed in Table 4.

- **Note**: Comp. bx frequency = weekly compensatory behavior frequency; overvaluation = shape and weight overvaluation; binge eating = weekly binge-eating frequency; ED = eating disorder.

- Contrast results for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-5 specified severity indicators are shown in Table 5.

- **Clinical overvaluation**: People with clinical overvaluation often exhibit high levels of psychological distress, which affects their overall well-being.

### Examining the placement of atypical anorexia nervosa in the eating disorder diagnostic hierarchy relative to bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder [^116wge6q]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2024). Low credibility.

Some individuals meet the criteria for atypical anorexia nervosa and another eating disorder simultaneously. The study evaluated whether allowing a diagnosis of atypical anorexia nervosa to supersede a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa (BN) or binge-eating disorder (BED) provided additional information on psychological functioning.

Archival data from 650 university students (87.7% female, 69.4% white) who met Eating Disorder Diagnostic Survey for DSM-5 eating disorder criteria and completed questionnaires assessing quality of life, eating disorder-related impairment, and eating pathology at a single time point. Separate regression models used diagnostic category to predict quality of life and impairment. Two diagnostic schemes were used: the DSM-5 diagnostic scheme and an alternative scheme where atypical anorexia nervosa superseded all diagnoses except anorexia nervosa. Model fit was compared using the Davidson-Mackinnon J test. Analyses were pre-registered (https://osf.io/2ejcd).

Allowing an atypical anorexia nervosa diagnosis to supersede a BN or BED diagnosis provided a better fit to the data for eating disorder-related impairment (p = .02; n = 271), but not physical, psychological, or social quality of life (p's ≥ .33; n = 306). Allowing an atypical anorexia nervosa diagnosis to supersede a BN or BED diagnosis provided a better fit in cross-sectional models predicting purging (p = .02; n = 638), but not body dissatisfaction, binge eating, restricting, or excessive exercise (p's ≥ .08; n's = 633–647).

The data support retaining the current diagnostic hierarchy.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders [^117LYc9v]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for binge eating disorder, more specifically with respect to the initial evaluation, the APA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following during the initial evaluation of patients with a possible eating disorder:

- **Height and weight history**: Maximum and minimum weight and recent weight changes.

- **Changes in eating behaviors**: Presence of, patterns in, and changes in restrictive eating, food avoidance, binge eating, and other eating-related behaviors such as rumination, regurgitation, chewing, and spitting.

- **Food repertoire patterns**: Patterns and changes in the breadth of food variety and the narrowing or elimination of food groups.

- **Compensatory and weight control behaviors**: Presence of, patterns in, and changes in behaviors, including dietary restriction, compulsive or driven exercise, purging behaviors (e.g. laxative use, self-induced vomiting), and the use of medications to manipulate weight.

- **Preoccupation with food and body image**: Percentage of time preoccupied with food, weight, and body shape.

- **Prior treatment**: Prior treatment and response to treatment for an eating disorder.

- **Psychosocial impairment**: Psychosocial impairment secondary to eating or body image concerns or behaviors.

- **Family history**: Family history of eating disorders, other psychiatric illnesses, and other medical conditions such as obesity, IBD, or diabetes mellitus.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for bulimia nervosa, more specifically with respect to the initial evaluation, the APA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following during the initial physical examination of patients with a possible eating disorder:

- **Vital signs**: Including temperature, resting heart rate, blood pressure, orthostatic pulse, and orthostatic blood pressure.

- **Height, weight, and BMI**: For children and adolescents, use percent median BMI, BMI percentile, or BMI Z-score.

- **Physical appearance**: Including signs of malnutrition or purging behaviors.

The following constitutes key background information on bulimia nervosa (BN):

- **Definition**: BN is an eating disorder characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of BN is complex and not fully understood. It is thought to involve dysregulation of key neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the brain, such as serotonin, which play a role in appetite regulation and mood.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of BN in females in the US is estimated at 2–3%.

- **Risk factors**: Several risk factors are associated with BN, including genetic predisposition and psychological factors such as perfectionism and body dissatisfaction, as well as societal influences that emphasize thinness. Certain life stages, such as adolescence and early adulthood, may increase vulnerability to the disorder.

- **Disease course**: The clinical course of BN is marked by cycles of binge eating and compensatory behaviors, such as self-induced vomiting, laxative use, or excessive exercise, to prevent weight gain. These cycles can vary in frequency and intensity, and the disorder can be chronic, with periods of remission and relapse.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of BN varies. While many individuals can achieve recovery with appropriate treatment, others may experience a chronic course with ongoing symptom fluctuation.

### The prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating in adults seeking obesity treatment: A systematic review with meta-analyses [^116cnZKw]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

- **Forest plots**:
	- FIGURE 2 displays a forest plot of binge-eating disorder diagnosed by clinical interview (DSM-IV).
	- FIGURE 3 visualizes a forest plot of binge-eating disorder diagnosed by clinical interview (DSM-5).

The pooled prevalence of self-report moderate severity binge eating, defined as Binge Eating Scale scores between 17 and 26, was reported at 26% (95% CI: 23 to 28, k = 12; n = 8113, τ² = 0.001), with a prediction interval of 18% to 33%. This analysis included studies by:

- **Self-report moderate severity binge eating studies**: Ariel and Perri, Cheung et al, Corsica et al, Dalle Grave et al, Heinberg et al, Hood et al, Imperatori et al, Innamorati et al, McGarrity et al, Nasirzadeh et al, Shakory et al, Soulliard et al.

Self-reported severe binge eating, with Binge Eating Scale scores greater than 25, showed a pooled prevalence of 12% (95% CI: 8 to 16, k = 18; n = 12,136, τ² = 0.01), with a prediction interval from 0% to 31% (Figures 4 and 5). Studies included in this analysis were conducted by:

- **Self-report severe binge eating studies**:
	- **Researchers beginning with A to H**: Ariel and Perri, Azarbad et al, Bianciardi, Fabbricatore et al, Cheung et al, Corsica et al, Dalle Grave et al, Grupski et al, Heinberg et al, Hood et al
	- **Researchers beginning with I to S**: Imperatori et al, Innamorati et al, Marchesini et al, Marcus et al, McGarrity et al, Nasirzadeh et al, Shakory et al, Sherwood et al, Soulliard et al

A post hoc sensitivity analysis examined severe binge eating upon exclusion of the 1985 study by Marcus et al, which was a substantial outlier and the oldest in the review, dating back 40 years prior. Following its removal, the pooled prevalence was adjusted to 10% (95% CI: 8 to 12, k = 17).

### Do adolescents with eating disorder not otherwise specified or full-syndrome bulimia nervosa differ in clinical severity, comorbidity, risk factors, treatment outcome or cost [^113opNoe]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

We wanted to know whether adolescents with eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) differ from those with bulimia nervosa (BN) in clinical features, comorbidity, risk factors, treatment outcome or cost.

- **Method**: Adolescents with EDNOS (n = 24) or BN (n = 61) took part in a trial of family therapy versus guided self-care. At baseline, eating disorder symptoms, risk factors, and costs were assessed by interview. Patients were reinterviewed at 6 and 12 months.

- **Results**: Compared with EDNOS, BN patients binged, vomited, and purged significantly more, and were more preoccupied with food. Those with EDNOS had more depression and childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder. 66.6% of EDNOS versus 27.8% of BN patients were abstinent from bingeing and vomiting at 1 year. Diagnosis did not moderate treatment outcome. Costs did not differ between groups.

- **Conclusion**: EDNOS in adolescents is not trivial. It has milder eating disorder symptoms but more comorbidity than BN.

### The validity and utility of subtyping bulimia nervosa [^114iEWLd]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

To review the evidence for the validity and utility of subtyping bulimia nervosa (BN) into a purging (BN-P) and a nonpurging subtype (BN-NP), and of distinguishing BN-NP from binge eating disorder (BED), a comparison was made focusing on the course, complications, and treatment.

A literature search of psychiatry databases was conducted for studies published in peer-reviewed journals that used the DSM-definitions of BN and BED. These studies included both individuals with BN-NP and individuals with BN-P and/or BED.

Twenty-three studies compared individuals with BN-NP (N = 671) to individuals with BN-P (N = 1795) and/or individuals with BED (N = 1921), two of which reported on course, 12 on comorbidity, and none on treatment response — the indicators for validity and clinical utility. The differences found were mainly quantitative rather than qualitative, suggesting a gradual difference in severity from BN-P (most severe) through BN-NP to BED (least severe).

None of the comparisons provided convincing evidence for the validity or utility of the BN-NP diagnosis. Three options for the position of BN-NP in DSM-V were suggested: (1) maintaining the BN-NP subtype, (2) dropping nonpurging compensatory behavior as a criterion for BN, thus designating individuals currently classified as BN-NP as having BED, or (3) including BN-NP in a broad BN category.

### The validity and clinical utility of binge eating disorder [^115n63vx]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

This review examines the validity and clinical utility of the DSM-IV binge eating disorder (BED) diagnosis across a wide range of validating strategies.

- **Method**: Various electronic databases, including PubMed and PsychInfo, were searched for terms relevant to the diagnosis of BED (e.g. binge eating disorder, binge eating) to identify papers. Additionally, published papers were reviewed to locate additional manuscripts and papers presented at meetings.

- **Results**: The validity and utility of BED varied substantially according to the validator chosen. There is reasonable evidence that BED can be differentiated from other existing eating disorders and is associated with significant impairment and clinical levels of eating disorder psychopathology. The relationship between BED and obesity is complex. Despite some positive findings, further research examining the predictive power of BED — beyond the simple presence of obesity and associated psychopathology in relation to clinically relevant outcomes — is needed.

- **Discussion**: Binge eating disorder is being considered for inclusion in the DSM-V, and various options regarding this decision are reviewed based on the empirical findings in the paper.

### The validity of DSM-5 severity specifiers for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^111iyAfA]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The DSM-5 includes severity specifiers (i.e. mild, moderate, severe, extreme) for anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED), which are determined by weight status for AN and frequencies of binge-eating episodes for BED or inappropriate compensatory behaviors for BN. Given limited data regarding the validity of eating disorder (ED) severity specifiers, this study examined the construct and predictive validity of severity specifiers in AN, BN, and BED.

The method involved identifying adults with AN (n = 109), BN (n = 76), and BED (n = 216) from previous datasets. Construct validity was assessed by measures of ED psychopathology, depression, anxiety, quality of life, and physical health. Predictive validity was assessed by ED symptoms at the end of the treatment in BN and BED.

The results indicated that severity categories did not differ in baseline validators, though the mild AN group evidenced greater ED symptoms compared to the severe group. In BN, greater severity was related to greater end-of-treatment binge-eating and compensatory behaviors, and a lower likelihood of abstinence. However, in BED, greater severity was related to lower ED symptoms at the end of the treatment.

The discussion demonstrated limited support for the validity of DSM-5 severity specifiers. Future research is warranted to explore additional validators and possible alternative indicators of severity in EDs.

### One size does not fit all. Genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^112PJtDp]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Although twin and family studies demonstrate a positive genetic correlation (~0.46) between anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, indicating considerable shared genetics, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of bulimia nervosa or binge‐eating disorder with sufficient size have yet to be conducted to allow well‐powered investigations of their molecular genetic correlations with each other. On a phenotypic level, binge‐eating disorder co‐occurs with anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance abuse, and personality disorders. In addition, individuals with binge‐eating disorder commonly have overweight or obesity. We have previously suggested that increased genetic liability for obesity was associated with an increased risk of binge eating in adolescence. In contrast, it is not well understood the extent to which binge‐type eating disorders share genetics with other psychiatric, anthropometric, and metabolic traits.

To explore differences in the genetics of eating disorders and generate new hypotheses regarding their genetic overlap with other traits, we conducted polygenic score analyses to identify traits that are genetically associated with either of the three primary eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge‐eating disorder in a subsample of the UK Biobank, with attempted replication in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.

### One size does not fit all. Genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^111LYHXr]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

In the UK Biobank dataset, we identified 1,550 participants with any eating disorder. They either self-reported one or multiple of the three primary eating disorders: anorexia nervosa (n = 720), bulimia nervosa (n = 402), or binge-eating disorder (n = 561) in the mental health questionnaire or had an International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD-10), hospital diagnosis recorded in the Hospital Episode Statistics of F50.0 or F50.1 for anorexia nervosa (n = 48), F50.2 or F50.3 for bulimia nervosa (n = 21), or F50.5 for vomiting associated with other psychological disturbances, F50.8 for other eating disorders, including pica, or F50.9 for eating disorder, unspecified (n = 15). We excluded the 15 participants with F50.5, F50.8, and F50.9 from this analysis due to insufficient numbers to perform analyses.

This resulted in 768 (4.7%) participants with anorexia nervosa, 423 (2.7%) with bulimia nervosa, and 561 (3.5%) with binge-eating disorder. If participants self-reported more than one eating disorder diagnosis (n = 194), they were assigned to all applicable primary eating disorder groups. We randomly sampled one set of controls in the ratio of 1–10, resulting in 15,500 controls. Exclusion criteria for controls were answering the mental health questionnaire, having no diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder (i.e. self-report or ICD-10 diagnosis), and not taking any psychotropic medication. The subsample included 17,050 (92% female) European participants.

### Initial evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa [^113A9Vah]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Eating disorders are life-threatening conditions that are challenging to address; however, the primary care setting provides an important opportunity for critical medical and psychosocial intervention. The recently published Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, includes updated diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa, such as the elimination of amenorrhea as a diagnostic criterion, and for bulimia nervosa, where the criterion for frequency of binge episodes decreased to an average of once per week. In addition to the role of environmental triggers and societal expectations of body size and shape, research has suggested that genes and discrete biochemical signals contribute to the development of eating disorders.

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa occur most often in adolescent females and are often accompanied by depression and other comorbid psychiatric disorders. For low-weight patients with anorexia nervosa, virtually all physiologic systems are affected, ranging from hypotension and osteopenia to life-threatening arrhythmias, often requiring emergent assessment and hospitalization for metabolic stabilization. In patients with frequent purging or laxative abuse, the presence of electrolyte abnormalities requires prompt intervention.

- **Family-based treatment**: This approach is helpful for adolescents with anorexia nervosa.
- **Short-term psychotherapy**: Cognitive behavior therapy is effective for most patients with bulimia nervosa.
- **Psychotropic medications**: Their use is limited for anorexia nervosa, whereas treatment studies have shown a benefit of antidepressant medications for bulimia nervosa.

### Refining the definition of binge eating disorder and nonpurging bulimia nervosa [^114BXY8v]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnostic concept of binge eating disorder (BED) was introduced in response to the clinical observation of Stunkard (1959) that some people with obesity experience episodes of binge eating. We suggest that the DSM-IV concept of BED has resulted in the recruitment of heterogeneous research samples, among which are people with BED, as described by Stunkard, those with bulimia nervosa, others with different types of eating disorders, and some with no eating disorder at all. We consider the difficulties in distinguishing BED from other forms of overeating, especially in patients with obesity, and from nonpurging bulimia nervosa. We propose revised diagnostic criteria for BED and bulimia nervosa that are designed to minimize these problems.

### Investigating the reinforcing value of binge anticipation [^111GmNKf]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2016). High credibility.

Binge eating is a hallmark feature of several types of eating disorders, including bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa (binge/purge type), and binge-eating disorder, and is associated with numerous harmful consequences. For decades, researchers have sought to understand what maintains and reinforces this behavior in the face of such profound negative consequences. In this context, researchers have focused on the binge-eating behavior itself and given little consideration to what may be a crucial part of the process: anticipating or planning binge-eating episodes.

In this article, we discuss binge anticipation, its potential reinforcing value, and methodologies that would allow researchers to investigate this potentially critical process in individuals who binge eat.

### The hidden burden of eating disorders: An extension of estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^1158mgnp]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are the only eating disorders included in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019. However, binge-eating disorder and other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) are more prevalent. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and burden of binge-eating disorder and OSFED globally, advocating for their inclusion in the GBD.

The research utilized studies from the GBD 2019 anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa epidemiological databases. Additionally, two systematic reviews, which included studies providing epidemiological estimates of binge-eating disorder and OSFED, were used, along with insights from experts in the field. Studies published between January 1, 1998, and March 1, 2019, were included if they reported non-zero prevalence of two or more eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or OSFED) and diagnosed cases according to DSM-IV or DSM-5. The proportions of total eating disorder cases meeting diagnostic criteria for each individual disorder were estimated through network meta-regression and simulation using studies reporting eating disorder prevalence. The global cases unrepresented in GBD 2019 were estimated using proportions from the simulation and the GBD 2019 eating disorder prevalence data. Disability weights for binge-eating disorder and OSFED were estimated, along with disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates are presented with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).

Fifty-four studies, of which thirty-six were from high-income countries, were included in the analysis.

### How useful is the DSM-5 severity indicator in bulimia nervosa? A clinical study including a measure of impairment [^112m72zu]. Psychiatry Research (2016). Low credibility.

The severity criterion used in DSM-5 for bulimia nervosa (BN) was investigated in 214 individuals referred for treatment at a regional eating disorders service in the UK. In addition to comparing eating disorder symptoms, impairment secondary to these symptoms was also assessed. According to guidance in DSM-5, 94 individuals were classified as mild (43.9%), 70 as moderate (32.7%), 32 as severe (15.0%), and 8 as extreme (3.7%) levels of BN severity. Due to small numbers in the latter two groups, it was necessary to combine these to form one 'severe/extreme' group. Analyses on these three groups suggested no group effect on demographic variables, but differences were seen in measures of eating pathology, psychological distress, and psychosocial impairment between the mild group and other groups. Individuals in the moderate and severe/extreme groups scored comparably on most measures of pathology and impairment. The results are broadly consistent with past studies on community samples, although together they question the demarcation between moderate and more severe groups of individuals with BN.

### The clinical significance of binge eating disorder [^115GgGUY]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Controversy exists regarding the status of binge eating disorder (BED) as a diagnostic entity. A critique of the literature is provided to address the question of whether BED represents a clinically significant syndrome.

- **Method**: The scientific evidence is considered through addressing five questions that are key in evaluating the clinical utility of any mental disorder.

- **Results**: Individuals with BED meaningfully differ from individuals without eating disorders and share important similarities to, yet are distinct from, individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). BED is associated with co-occurring physical and mental illnesses, as well as impaired quality of life and social functioning. Questions about the course of the disorder and the optimal treatment regimen for the syndrome need to be explored further.

BED's distinctive combination of core eating disorder psychopathology, and other co-occurring physical and psychiatric conditions, impaired psychosocial functioning, and overweight constitute an eating disorder of clinical severity and a significant public health problem.

### One size does not fit all. Genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^112wiUzZ]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Here, we present the first molecular genetic evidence that the underlying biology differs between binge-type eating disorders, including bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder, and anorexia nervosa, and these differences can be captured at the genomic level. We discuss bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder grouped as binge-type eating disorders because they showed a similar pattern of associations with the polygenic scores, especially with reference to psychiatric/behavioral and anthropometric phenotypes (Figure 1).

Although the associations for psychiatric traits with bulimia nervosa did not reach significance, most likely due to inadequate statistical power, the patterning of associations for the two binge-type eating disorders was comparable. Our UK Biobank analyses propose strong positive associations between bulimia nervosa/binge-eating disorder and anthropometric polygenic scores (e.g. overweight and waist circumference), suggesting that binge eating shares genomic variants with overweight and obesity. In contrast, for anorexia nervosa, the direction of these associations was reversed.

Binge-eating disorder also showed an association with the childhood obesity polygenic score, while anorexia nervosa did not, further highlighting the genomic differences between binge-type eating disorders and anorexia nervosa. The genetic relationship between binge eating and BMI had been studied previously (Abdulkadir et al; Bulik, Sullivan, & Kendler), and is replicated by our analyses. It is notable that previous work suggests that genomic variation correlates with these disorders.

### One size does not fit all. Genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^112pcbZD]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Our findings must be interpreted in light of the following limitations: The number of individuals with eating disorders in both samples was relatively small. Specifically, we identified only 423 individuals with bulimia nervosa in the UK Biobank, which considerably limited the power to detect statistically significant results. The same is true for the replication sample drawn from the ALSPAC cohort, which comprised only 217 cases and 3,018 controls. Additionally, the samples included only white British participants, necessitating investigations in more diverse samples. Most of the eating disorder diagnoses and symptoms were self-reported, indicating that they were not diagnosed using clinical diagnostic instruments. Symptom constellations used in ALSPAC to identify cases do not fully correspond to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or ICD-10 diagnostic criteria; however, the classification of eating disorders was primarily derived based on DSM-5 criteria. Nevertheless, symptoms and derived diagnoses in the ALSPAC cohort were obtained from both parents and adolescents, representing best practices in child and adolescent psychiatry, thereby strengthening the validity of the diagnoses [Angold et al; Boyle et al; Duncan et al.].

Furthermore, we were unable to differentiate between binge-eating/purging and restricting anorexia nervosa as subtype information was unavailable. The absence of subtype differentiation may have masked important differences in polygenic load associated with specific disordered eating symptoms and should be investigated further.

### Personality dimensions in bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and obesity [^116igMRv]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this investigation was to examine differences in personality dimensions among individuals with bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, non-binge eating obesity, and a normal-weight comparison group, as well as to determine the extent to which these differences were independent of self-reported depressive symptoms.

Personality dimensions were assessed using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire in 36 patients with bulimia nervosa, 54 patients with binge eating disorder, 30 obese individuals who did not binge eat, and 77 normal-weight comparison participants.

Participants with bulimia nervosa reported higher scores on measures of stress reaction and negative emotionality compared to the other three groups, and lower well-being scores compared to the normal-weight comparison and the obese samples. Patients with binge eating disorder scored lower on well-being and higher on harm avoidance than the normal-weight comparison group. In addition, the bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder groups scored lower than the normal-weight group on positive emotionality. When personality dimensions were reanalyzed using depression as a covariate, only stress reaction remained higher in the bulimia nervosa group compared to the other three groups, and harm avoidance remained higher in the binge eating disorder group than the normal-weight comparison group.

The higher levels of stress reaction in the bulimia nervosa sample and harm avoidance in the binge eating disorder sample after controlling for depression indicate that these personality dimensions may be distinct psychological characteristics associated with these disorders.

### Recent advances in developmental and risk factor research on eating disorders [^11215vXL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (i.e. DSM-5) currently recognizes three primary eating disorders: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. The origins of eating disorders are complex and remain poorly understood. However, emerging research highlights a dimensional approach to understanding the multifactorial etiology of eating disorders as a means to inform assessment, prevention, and treatment efforts. Guided by research published since 2011, this review summarizes recent findings elucidating risk factors for the development of eating disorders across the lifespan in three primary domains:

- **Genetic/biological**: Prospective empirical research in clinical samples with full-syndrome eating disorders is emphasized with added support from cross-sectional studies, where relevant.

- **Psychological**: The developmental stages of puberty and the transition from adolescence to young adulthood are discussed as crucial periods for the identification and prevention of eating disorders.

- **Socio-environmental**: The importance of continuing to elucidate the mechanisms underlying gene by environmental interactions in eating disorder risk is also discussed. Finally, controversial topics in the field of eating disorder research and the clinical implications of this research are summarized.

### Evaluating the predictive validity of purging disorder by comparison to bulimia nervosa at long-term follow-up [^111ZXBcU]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

The largely similar outcomes from purging disorder and bulimia nervosa replicate prior findings from a tertiary care sample that also found no differences in remission between diagnostic groups over a 5-year follow-up (Koch et al.). In contrast, a recent meta-analysis found a more favorable natural course in purging disorder relative to bulimia nervosa (Smith et al.). This discrepancy may reflect the longer duration of follow-up and older age in both the sample and prior tertiary care sample (Koch et al.) Indeed, differences apparent earlier in follow-up of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa (Herzog et al.) also dissipated over longer durations of follow-up (Eddy et al.). The meta-analysis relied primarily on adolescent samples (Allen et al; Stice et al.), which tend to have a shorter course of illness and greater diagnostic instability (Steinhausen et al.) relative to adults.

Despite comparable levels of eating pathology and comorbidity, purging disorder and bulimia nervosa differed in clinical presentation at follow-up in ways that reflected clinical differences at baseline. This is similar to findings in an adolescent sample where the prevalence of diagnostic stability in both full threshold and subthreshold diagnoses was similar to or greater (23% of bulimia nervosa cases, 31% of purging disorder cases) than the likelihood of crossover between bulimia nervosa and purging disorder over shorter durations of follow-up (17% of bulimia nervosa cases; 9% of purging disorder cases; Glazer et al.). Although data from anorexia nervosa suggest that bi…

### Full syndromal versus subthreshold anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder: A multicenter study [^1153yKSY]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2002). Low credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED) establish symptom severity levels, which are used to separate full cases from partial cases. However, the value of these distinctions is unclear.

Three hundred eighty-five women with full or partial AN, BN, or BED were assessed at entry into a longitudinal study of eating disorders.

Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that full and partial BN were discriminated by the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale total scores (kappa = .46). However, it was not possible to discriminate between full and partial AN or BED. Discriminant analysis also demonstrated clear differences between full AN, BN, and BED.

Full BN can be differentiated from partial BN by more severe eating disorder symptoms, whereas both full and partial AN and full and partial BED appear quite similar. These results emphasize the distinct nature of AN, BN, and BED, as well as the similarities between full and partial cases.

### Evaluating the predictive validity of purging disorder by comparison to bulimia nervosa at long-term follow-up [^112JLYoX]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Although differences in baseline clinical presentation were not meaningful in predicting long-term illness outcomes, these differences may be meaningful for treatment planning. For example, baseline group differences in fullness sensitivity suggest that interoceptive exposures may be beneficial in purging disorder, but may not be clinically relevant in bulimia nervosa.

Transdiagnostic samples have often included purging disorder in "bulimia nervosa-spectrum illness", but more work is needed to understand how treatment may need to be tailored differently based on symptom presentation, particularly given the relative stability of diagnostic differences. Future research should also consider how purging disorder may differ from other types of OSFED, such as atypical anorexia nervosa. Baseline data were collected before the inclusion of atypical anorexia nervosa in the DSM-5, and we are unable to examine this differential diagnosis. While atypical anorexia nervosa without purging is distinguishable from purging disorder, approximately half of individuals with purging disorder are also weight suppressed and meet both sets of criteria simultaneously.

As similar patterns also exist in bulimia nervosa, and weight suppression predicts the onset of BN and PD, the consideration of weight history may be a more potent predictor of outcome. Future work is needed to understand how weight history predicts purging disorder treatment response, course, or outcome.

### Emotional eating across different eating disorders and the role of body mass, restriction, and binge eating [^115fUgmH]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

Several strengths of the present study, such as thorough interview diagnostics and mostly large sample sizes, alongside the inclusion of a large control group with a broad BMI range, have to be seen in the context of some limitations.

First, the present study used a psychometric, cross-sectional design, which limits the causal inference of the interpretation of the results. The SEES is a self-report questionnaire that measures perceived alterations in food intake in response to emotions. Hence, the scale is susceptible to response and retrospective biases, and several researchers have argued that emotional eating questionnaires do not validly assess real behavior. However, we have reported findings that support the validity of emotional eating scales with regard to craving and appetitive responding (e.g. Reichenberger et al. 2018; Schnepper et al. 2020). Future research should corroborate the present results, for example, by measuring actual food intake in laboratory or ecological momentary assessment studies.

Second, although most groups were well-powered, the patient group of AN-BP was relatively small in comparison to the other groups, suggesting caution when generalizing some of the results.

Third, groups differed with regard to age, and future research might profit from age-matched groups. It has previously been shown that one characteristic of EDs is different age onsets (e.g. a rather early onset of AN compared to a rather late onset of BED).

### Effects of reducing the frequency and duration criteria for binge eating on lifetime prevalence of bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder: Implications for DSM-5 [^113LZyft]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

We assessed the impact of reducing the binge eating frequency and duration thresholds on the diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED).

- **Method**: We estimated the lifetime population prevalence of BN and BED in 13,295 female twins from the Swedish Twin Study of Adults: Genes and Environment, employing a range of frequency and duration thresholds. External validation (risk to cotwin) was used to investigate empirical evidence for an optimal binge eating frequency threshold.

- **Results**: The lifetime prevalence estimates of BN and BED increased linearly as the frequency criterion decreased. As the required duration increased, the prevalence of BED decreased slightly. Discontinuity in cotwin risk was observed in BN between at least four times per month and at least five times per month. This model could not be fit for BED.

- **Discussion**: The proposed changes to the DSM-5 binge eating frequency and duration criteria would allow for better detection of binge eating pathology without resulting in a markedly higher lifetime prevalence of BN or BED.

### Subjective binge eating with compensatory behaviors: a variant presentation of bulimia nervosa [^1161nZhw]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

To determine whether a variant bulimic-type presentation, termed "subjective bulimia nervosa" (SBN), which meets criteria for bulimia nervosa (BN) except that binge eating episodes are not objectively large, has comparable clinical severity to established eating disorders, particularly BN, a study was conducted.

Treatment-seeking adults with BN (N = 112), SBN (N = 28), anorexia nervosa restricting type (AN-R) (N = 45), and AN-binge/purge type (AN-B/P) (N = 24) were compared. The study found that SBN could not be meaningfully distinguished from BN. Both SBN and BN exhibited equivalent levels of eating pathology, depression and anxiety symptoms, low quality of life, impulsivity, Axis I comorbidity, and lifetime psychiatric history, with clinical severity comparable to AN-R and AN-B/P.

Individuals with SBN, differing from BN only by the smaller size of their binge eating episodes, had a form of eating disorder comparable in clinical severity to threshold AN and BN. This warrants clinical attention, and health professionals and the community require greater awareness of this variant to optimize detection, treatment-seeking, and outcomes.

### Significance of overvaluation of shape/weight in binge-eating disorder: Comparative study with overweight and bulimia nervosa [^111BKy8w]. Obesity (2010). Low credibility.

Increasing empirical evidence supports the validity of binge-eating disorder (BED) and its inclusion as a formal diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V). Contention exists regarding the criteria for BED, including whether, like bulimia nervosa (BN), it should be characterized by the overvaluation of shape/weight. This study examined the significance of overvaluation for BED using two complementary comparison groups.

Participants were 324 women who completed self-report instruments as part of an Internet study. Analyses compared BMI, eating disorder (ED) features, and depressive levels across four groups: 123 overweight participants without ED, 47 BED participants who do not overvalue shape/weight, 101 BED participants who overvalue shape/weight, and 53 BN participants. Both BED groups exhibited significantly greater ED psychopathology than the overweight group. Within BED, the group with overvaluation had significantly greater ED psychopathology and depressive levels, despite no differences in binge eating.

The BED with overvaluation and the BN groups differed little from each other but had significantly higher ED psychopathology and depressive levels than the other groups. These group differences existed despite similar age and BMI across the groups, and were consistent even when controlling for group differences in depressive levels. These findings provide further support for the validity of BED and suggest that overvaluation of shape/weight, which offers important information about BED severity, warrants consideration as either a diagnostic specifier or as a dimensional specifier.

### General practitioner and mental healthcare use in a community sample of people with diagnostic threshold symptoms of bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, and other eating disorders [^1158TBit]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Lengthy delays in receiving treatment have been reported for people with bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge-eating disorder (BED). This study aimed to investigate healthcare use and predictors of mental health specialist healthcare use in a community sample of individuals with diagnostic threshold symptoms of BN, BED-Broad, or another eating disorder (Other ED).

In 2017, a total of 2,977 individuals aged 15 years and older were interviewed in a general population survey. Participants were asked questions relating to sociodemographic characteristics, ED symptoms, other clinical features, and healthcare use data. Assessment of ED symptoms was based on diagnostic questions derived from the eating disorder examination.

Thirty-six participants with symptoms of BN, 33 participants with BED-Broad, and 369 with an Other ED were identified. Fewer people with symptoms of BN/BED-Broad (23%) or an Other ED (6%) received treatment from a mental health specialist than from a general practitioner (GP; 80%, 71.6%). Healthcare use differed significantly across types of ED only for treatment from a mental health specialist. In multivariate analyses, being asked about a person's mental health by a GP was the best explanatory variable for receiving treatment from a mental health specialist.

A large treatment gap exists in healthcare for people with EDs. Inquiry about an individual's mental health by a GP was associated with higher rates of treatment from mental health specialists. However, a similar diet/eating inquiry did not have this association. Future research should consider the use of this approach.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with eating disorders [^112aHfT6]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for bulimia nervosa: More specifically, with respect to indications for screening, AACAP 2015 guidelines recommend screening all pediatric and adolescent patients for eating disorders when seen by a mental health clinician. This should be followed by a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including laboratory tests and imaging studies as indicated, if the screening results are positive.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for binge eating disorder, and specifically for initial evaluation, the APA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following during the initial physical examination of patients with a possible eating disorder:

- **Vital signs**: Including temperature, resting heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), orthostatic pulse, and orthostatic BP.

- **Anthropometric measurements**: Height, weight, and body mass index (BMI), or percent median BMI, BMI percentile, or BMI Z-score for children and adolescents.

- **Physical appearance**: Including signs of malnutrition or purging behaviors.

### Why no cognitive body image feature such as overvaluation of shape/weight in the binge eating disorder diagnosis [^115ZTtuj]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The undue influence of body shape or weight on self-evaluation, referred to as overvaluation, is considered a core feature across eating disorders, yet it is not a diagnostic requirement for binge eating disorder (BED). This article addresses the relevance of a feature reflecting disturbance in body image for the diagnosis of BED.

- **Method**: The distinction between overvaluation of shape/weight and body dissatisfaction is discussed, and empirical research regarding the conceptual and predictive significance of overvaluation of shape/weight for BED is reviewed.

- **Results**: The literature suggests that overvaluation does not simply reflect concern or distress commensurate with excess weight. It is reliably associated with greater severity of eating-related psychopathology and psychological distress and has shown negative prognostic significance.

- **Discussion**: Overvaluation of shape/weight warrants consideration as a diagnostic specifier for BED.

### Thinking afresh about the classification of eating disorders [^112VuqhW]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2007). Low credibility.

In considering what to do about the classification of eating disorders in the interim, it is unlikely that sufficient data will be available before DSM-V is finalized to answer the posed questions. Therefore, an interim solution is needed. We favor the two-step solution proposed by Fairburn and Bohn. Briefly, the first step involves accepting the flawed classificatory scheme and expanding the diagnostic thresholds for anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), as proposed in the literature. This involves including the "subthreshold" cases of AN and BN within EDNOS. However, doing so only modestly impacts the relative prevalence of EDNOS, even if binge eating disorder (BED) is recognized as a diagnostic concept and its boundaries are expanded.

The explanation is that most cases of EDNOS are "mixed" in character, with many clinical features of AN and BN present but combined in subtly different ways from those seen in the two currently specified syndromes. What should be done about them? Fairburn and Bohn suggested that, as the second step, these cases be designated as belonging to a new all-embracing diagnostic category, perhaps termed "mixed eating disorder". Admittedly, this is somewhat of a sleight of hand, but it serves a purpose; this parsimonious and pragmatic solution would highlight the problems of all remaining EDNOS patients while reducing the risk of premature generation of new diagnostic subdivisions. It must be emphasized, however, that this is only an interim solution.

### Eating disorders [^114Kjg6K]. Lancet (2020). Low credibility.

Eating disorders are disabling, deadly, and costly mental disorders that considerably impair physical health and disrupt psychosocial functioning. Disturbed attitudes towards weight, body shape, and eating play a key role in the origin and maintenance of eating disorders. The prevalence of eating disorders has been increasing over the past 50 years, with changes in the food environment being implicated as a contributing factor.

All health-care providers should routinely inquire about eating habits as a component of overall health assessments. Six main feeding and eating disorders are now recognized in diagnostic systems: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, pica, and rumination disorder. The presentation of eating disorders might vary for men versus women, for example.

As eating disorders are under-researched, there is significant uncertainty regarding their pathophysiology, treatment, and management. Future challenges, emerging treatments, and outstanding research questions are addressed.

### The hidden burden of eating disorders: An extension of estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 [^117N9EsC]. The Lancet Psychiatry (2021). Low credibility.

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are the only eating disorders included in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, yet binge-eating disorder and other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) are more prevalent. This study sought to estimate the prevalence and burden of binge-eating disorder and OSFED globally and present a case for their inclusion in GBD.

- **Methods**: We sourced studies from the GBD 2019 anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa epidemiological databases, two systematic reviews that included studies with epidemiological estimates of binge-eating disorder and OSFED, and experts in the field. Studies, published between January 1, 1998, and March 1, 2019, were included if they reported non-zero prevalence of two or more eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or OSFED) and diagnosed cases according to DSM-IV or DSM-5. The proportions of total eating disorder cases that met diagnostic criteria for each individual eating disorder were estimated via network meta-regression and simulation using studies reporting eating disorder prevalence. The global cases unrepresented in GBD 2019 were estimated using the proportions from the simulation and the GBD 2019 eating disorder prevalence. Disability weights for binge-eating disorder and OSFED were then estimated along with disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Estimates are presented with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs).

- **Findings**: 54 studies, of which 36 were from high-income countries, were included in the analysis. The number of global…

In regard to diagnostic investigations for bulimia nervosa, specifically with respect to initial evaluations, the APA 2023 guidelines recommend assessing the following during the initial evaluation of patients with a possible eating disorder:

- **Height and weight history**: Maximum and minimum weight and recent weight changes.

- **Eating behaviors**: Presence of, patterns in, and changes in restrictive eating, food avoidance, binge eating, and other eating-related behaviors, such as rumination, regurgitation, chewing, and spitting.

- **Food repertoire**: Patterns and changes in food variety, including the narrowing or elimination of food groups.

- **Weight control behaviors**: Presence of, patterns in, and changes in compensatory and other weight control behaviors, including dietary restriction, compulsive or driven exercise, purging behaviors (such as laxative use and self-induced vomiting), and use of medication to manipulate weight.

- **Preoccupation with food, weight, and body shape**: Percentage of time preoccupied with these concerns.

- **Prior treatment**: Prior treatment and response to treatment for an eating disorder.

- **Psychosocial impairment**: Impairments secondary to eating or body image concerns or behaviors.

- **Family history**: Family history of eating disorders, other psychiatric illnesses, and other medical conditions, such as obesity, IBD, and diabetes mellitus.

### One size does not fit all. Genomics differentiates among anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder [^111waGnn]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2021). Low credibility.

- **Sex and age differences**: The adult obesity polygenic score was more strongly associated with anorexia nervosa than the childhood obesity polygenic score. The difference in the log odds ratios was statistically significant (difference = −0.15, p = .004). We did not detect age differences in the associations of the obesity polygenic scores with bulimia nervosa or binge-eating disorder. We found no evidence for sex differences in the associations of the BMI polygenic score with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder.

- **Sensitivity analyses**: We compared logistic regression results when assigning participants to all possible eating disorder diagnoses with assigning participants exclusively to one eating disorder diagnosis in the UK Biobank sample. The effect sizes of both analyses correlated with r = .98, indicating that the analyses were not sensitive to participant overlap.

- **Independent replication**: In ALSPAC, the overweight polygenic score (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13–1.69; p empirical = .05) and the obesity Class 1 polygenic score (OR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.00–1.50; p empirical = .001) were positively associated with binge-eating disorder. Correlations between these polygenic scores are presented in corresponding figures.
