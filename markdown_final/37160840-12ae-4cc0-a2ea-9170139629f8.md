## Question

How is it possible for the rate of all bleeding events to not be higher while traumatic bleeding events are higher? Does that imply another category was lower so the overall bleeding events did not increase?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the overall rate of all bleeding events can remain unchanged when traumatic bleeding events are higher, and whether that means other bleeding categories were lower so the total did not increase. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how bleeding events are categorized and whether these categories are mutually exclusive. Then, I should verify the arithmetic relationship between category-specific rates and the composite total. Next, I will consider clinical and methodological scenarios where one category rises but the composite stays flat. After that, I need to review how trial wording and bleeding definitions can influence interpretation. Finally, I will synthesize the answer and highlight clinical implications and caveats to avoid overinterpretation [^115hiH4m] [^1132D82X] [^117QLSDQ].

> Let me first confirm the categorization framework. In the PEGASUS analysis, TIMI major or minor bleeds were assigned to mutually exclusive etiologic categories — spontaneous, procedural, and traumatic — that together constitute all bleeding events, with spontaneous accounting for about 71%, procedural 15%, and traumatic 14%, and the sites and causes reported as similar between ticagrelor 60 mg and placebo groups, which supports the premise that the total is a composite sum of disjoint parts [^115hiH4m].

> I should double-check the math before drawing any clinical inference. If the total composite is defined as the sum of spontaneous, procedural, and traumatic bleeding, then by simple additivity an increase in the traumatic component can be offset by a decrease in spontaneous and/or procedural bleeding, yielding no net change in the overall rate; this follows directly from the mutually exclusive construction used in PEGASUS and similar ACS/PCI trials that report composite bleeding endpoints [^115hiH4m] [^117QLSDQ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider plausible clinical scenarios that could drive a compensatory pattern. For example, a therapy or care pathway might slightly increase trauma-related bruising or soft tissue bleeds while simultaneously reducing spontaneous gastrointestinal bleeds or procedure-related access site bleeds through gastroprotection or radial access and hemostasis protocols, so the composite stays flat even as traumatic bleeds rise; this is particularly feasible because spontaneous bleeds dominate the event pool, so modest reductions there can numerically counterbalance relative increases in the smaller traumatic category [^115hiH4m] [^114yX2CX].

> Wait, let me verify the statistical interpretation because rarity and dilution matter. A small absolute increase in traumatic bleeds can be statistically significant within that stratum if relative change is large, yet remain diluted within the composite dominated by spontaneous events, leading to a non-significant change in total bleeding; differing bleeding definitions and analytic choices across trials further modulate apparent rates and significance thresholds, complicating direct comparisons and the perceived impact on the composite [^113rQq9r] [^1132D82X].

> I will now examine care delivery factors that may create competing shifts among categories. Risk-concordant use of bleeding avoidance strategies around PCI — such as radial access, specific anticoagulant choices, and vascular closure — reduces procedural bleeding and overall costs, and could offset increases in traumatic bleeds seen in frail patients, yielding a stable total despite category redistribution; this risk-treatment dynamic has been repeatedly demonstrated and can alter the etiologic mix without necessarily changing the composite count [^114yX2CX] [^112Taded].

> Let me scrutinize how trial wording might mask small but real shifts. In PEGASUS, the statement that sites and causes of bleeding were similar between ticagrelor 60 mg and placebo indicates comparable distributions overall, yet small category shifts — for instance, a rise from 14% to 16% traumatic with a corresponding fall in spontaneous from 71% to 69% — could preserve the total and still represent a meaningful etiologic change; I should confirm that such language allows for minor redistributions within a broadly similar profile, which it does [^115hiH4m].

> Next, I should review how endpoint definitions and adjudication influence what is counted where. Variability among TIMI, GUSTO, BARC, and ISTH criteria captures different severities and subsets of bleeding, so an increase in traumatic events under one definition may not materially change a composite defined by another, and adjudication versus routine data can introduce ascertainment differences that obscure or exaggerate category-specific changes while leaving composite estimates relatively stable [^1132D82X] [^111DJgke] [^114M43kd].

> Now, to answer the direct question, I need to ensure I state the logical constraint clearly. Yes, the implication is correct: if traumatic bleeding increases while the composite of all bleeding events remains unchanged, then one or both of the other mutually exclusive categories must have decreased sufficiently to offset that rise; however, I should confirm additional caveats, including differing statistical power across strata, classification drift, competing risks such as early mortality or drug discontinuation, and definition-specific capture, all of which can affect whether changes appear in a category, the composite, or both [^115hiH4m] [^1132D82X] [^114M43kd].

> Let me reconsider the clinical significance before concluding. Even when the composite is unchanged, a shift toward more traumatic bleeding can still be clinically meaningful given the consistent association between bleeding — especially more severe phenotypes — and adverse outcomes, so I need to emphasize targeted mitigation strategies for the shifting etiologies while not being falsely reassured by a flat composite rate; major bleeding and even clinically relevant non-major bleeding have been linked with increased morbidity and mortality in ACS and anticoagulated populations [^113T6yyp] [^116EbpNx] [^115bY4Vf].

Yes, if traumatic bleeding events are higher but overall bleeding is not, then **other bleeding categories must be lower** to offset the increase. This is a mathematical necessity: overall bleeding is the sum of traumatic, spontaneous, and procedural events, so a rise in one category with a stable total means a compensatory drop elsewhere. The most likely offset is a reduction in spontaneous or procedural bleeding, often due to changes in patient risk, antithrombotic regimens [^1174vg5k], or procedural techniques [^114yX2CX]. Definition and reporting differences can also **shift events between categories** without changing the total [^1132D82X] [^115bY4Vf].

---

## Mathematical relationship between bleeding categories

Let the **components** be:

- T✱✱ = traumatic bleeding events
- S✱✱ = spontaneous bleeding events
- P✱✱ = procedural bleeding events
- O✱✱ = overall bleeding events

The **relationship** is **O✱✱ = T + S + P; if T increases while O is unchanged, then **S and/or P must decrease.

---

## Clinical scenarios explaining the discrepancy

---

### Changes in patient population or clinical practice

In this context, **increased trauma exposure** — more falls or accidents (e.g. frailty, osteoporosis, high-risk activities) — can raise traumatic bleeding, while **improved management of spontaneous/procedural bleeding** through better risk stratification [^115bAvXH], bleeding-avoidance strategies [^114yX2CX], or safer antithrombotic regimens [^111DJgke] can reduce spontaneous/procedural bleeding and offset the rise.

---

### Differences in bleeding definitions and reporting

Variability in definitions — using different criteria (ISTH, BARC, TIMI) [^1132D82X] [^115bY4Vf] — can **reclassify events between categories** without changing the total, making traumatic bleeding appear higher while overall rates remain stable. In addition, **reporting bias** — such as greater vigilance for traumatic bleeding (e.g. following a safety initiative) — can increase its reported rate while spontaneous/procedural events remain unchanged or are underreported [^114M43kd].

---

### Changes in antithrombotic therapy

A **shift in antithrombotic regimens** — switching from warfarin to DOACs [^1174vg5k] or using lower-dose antiplatelets — can reduce spontaneous/procedural bleeding, offsetting increased traumatic events [^111DJgke].

---

## Evidence from clinical trials and observational studies

Evidence from clinical trials and observational studies includes the **PEGASUS-TIMI 54 trial**, in which ticagrelor 60 mg reduced ischemic events in low-bleeding-risk patients but increased TIMI major/minor bleeding; spontaneous/procedural bleeding likely drove the overall increase, not traumatic bleeding [^115hiH4m] [^112NtYTW]. Additionally, **risk-concordant bleeding avoidance strategies**, in which BAS use in high-risk PCI patients reduced overall bleeding — likely by lowering procedural bleeding — could offset rises in traumatic bleeding [^114yX2CX] [^112Taded].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

This discrepancy has **important clinical implications** [^113T6yyp]:

- **Risk stratification**: Use validated tools (e.g. HAS-BLED, ARC-HBR) to identify patients at higher traumatic bleeding risk and tailor therapy [^115bAvXH] [^1164GYNM].
- **Preventive measures**: Fall prevention, protective equipment, and patient education can reduce traumatic bleeding.
- **Antithrombotic management**: Adjust regimens to balance ischemic and bleeding risks, especially in patients prone to trauma [^116HxpCb].

---

## Conclusion

When traumatic bleeding rises but overall bleeding does not, **other categories must fall**. This pattern can reflect changes in patient risk, antithrombotic therapy, procedural practice, or event definitions. Recognizing this helps clinicians interpret safety data and optimize bleeding-risk management.

A total of 20,942 patients received at least one dose of the study drug, comprising the safety population. Baseline characteristics in the overall safety population, according to the occurrence of TIMI major or minor bleeding during follow-up (median, 33 months), are summarized in Table 1. Patients who experienced a TIMI major or minor bleed (n = 432) were older and more likely to have hypertension, renal insufficiency, a history of malignancy, a history of a previous spontaneous bleed requiring hospitalization, and a hemoglobin value indicating anemia.

- **Type, location, and cause of bleeding in all treatment arms**: The majority of TIMI major or minor bleeding events were spontaneous (N = 306; 71% of all bleeds), followed by procedural bleeding (N = 65; 15%) and traumatic bleeding (N = 61; 14%). Spontaneous TIMI major or minor bleeds were primarily of gastrointestinal origin (75%), followed by intracranial (12%) and genitourinary (6%). The sites and causes of bleeding were similar in patients randomized to ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily or placebo. Of the spontaneous gastrointestinal bleeds, the most common was upper gastrointestinal ulcer or inflammation (49%), followed by diverticular bleeding or hemorrhoids (20%) and previously undiagnosed neoplasm (17%).

### Reversing the "risk-treatment paradox" of bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: Risk-concordant use of bleeding avoidance strategies is associated with reduced bleeding and lower costs [^114yX2CX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Influence of risk-concordant BAS use on outcomes and cost of PCI

We found that the incidence of bleeding events was 2% in the risk‐concordant group versus 9% in the risk‐discordant group, which yielded an absolute 7% higher risk difference and a number needed to treat of 14. In the univariable logistic regression model, risk‐concordant BAS use was associated with bleeding events with an odds ratio of 0.20 (95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.29; P < 0.001). When adjusted for the risk of bleeding and the risk of mortality, risk‐concordant BAS use was associated with bleeding events with an odds ratio of 0.33 (95% CI, 0.22–0.48; P < 0.001), implying a 67% relative risk reduction (95% CI, 52–78%) when BAS were aligned with risk of bleeding. This full model predicted a bleeding event with an accuracy of 82%. These findings indicate a strong and independent association of risk‐concordant BAS use with the outcomes of PCI.

- **Association of risk‐concordant BAS use with occurrence of bleeding**: Similarly, when we compared the total operating per‐patient costs from a hospital perspective, we observed that the risk‐concordant use of BAS was associated with a $4738 (95% CI, $3353–$6122; P < 0.001) reduction in hospital costs that translated to a cost-savings of 21.6%. Thus, risk‐concordant use of BAS was strongly and independently associated with improvements in both costs and bleeding outcomes.

We then examined whether the increased costs associated with the use of bivalirudin and VCDs among femoral cases and bivalirudin alone among radial cases.

### Variation in the definitions of bleeding in clinical trials of patients with acute coronary syndromes and undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions and its impact on the apparent safety of antithrombotic drugs [^1132D82X]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

This review compares and contrasts the various criteria used to characterize bleeding, particularly major bleeding, during recent studies of antithrombotic therapies in acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

- **Methods**: This review includes an analysis of recent large randomized clinical trials (published between January 2000 and September 2006; n > 3000 patients) evaluating antithrombotic drugs in patients with ACS or those undergoing PCI, identified using Medline searches.

- **Results**: Bleeding has been shown to correlate with patient mortality and major cardiovascular events. Different definitions of bleeding, other than Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction or Global Utilization of Streptokinase and t-PA for Occluded Coronary Arteries bleeding criteria, were used in 9 of the 13 randomized trials that were identified and enrolled over 178,000 patients in total. These definitions overlapped to a degree but differed substantially. Bleeding rates according to several bleeding criteria within one trial illustrate that different bleeding definitions can lead to markedly different conclusions about the safety of an antithrombotic regimen. The shift toward identifying therapies that specifically attempt to reduce bleeding while maintaining efficacy at reducing ischemic complications increases the need for standardized bleeding definitions.

- **Conclusions**: A task force should be initiated to formulate an internationally accepted, meaningful, and standardized approach for reporting bleeding events.

### Balancing the risk of spontaneous ischemic and major bleeding events in acute coronary syndromes [^116EbpNx]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Evaluation of antithrombotic treatments for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) requires balancing ischemic and bleeding risks to assess net benefit. We sought to compare the relative effects of ischemic and bleeding events on mortality.

- **Methods**: In the PLATelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial, we compared spontaneous ischemic events (myocardial infarction or stroke) with spontaneous major bleeding events (PLATO major, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] major, Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries [GUSTO] severe) with respect to risk of mortality using time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models. The comparison was performed using ratio of hazard ratios for mortality increase after ischemic vs bleeding events.

- **Results**: A total of 822 patients (4.4%) had ≥ 1 spontaneous ischemic event; 485 patients (2.6%) had ≥ 1 spontaneous PLATO major bleed, 282 (1.5%) had ≥ 1 spontaneous TIMI major bleed; and 207 (1.1%) had ≥ 1 spontaneous severe GUSTO bleed. In patients who experienced both events, bleeding occurred first in most. Regardless of classification, major bleeding events were associated with increased short- and long-term mortality that were not significantly different from the increase associated with spontaneous ischemic events. The ratio of hazard ratios (95% CIs) for short- and long-term mortality after spontaneous ischemic vs bleeding events was: 1.46 (0.98–2.19) and 0.92 (0.52–1.62) (PLATO major); 1.26 (0.80–1.96) and 1.19 (0.58–2.24) (TIMI major); 0.72 (0.47–1.10) and 0.83 (0.38–1.79) (GUSTO severe).

### Upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk scores: who, when and why [^114isajK]. World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pathophysiology (2016). High credibility.

The clinical calculator "Rockall score for upper GI bleeding" is used for assessing non-variceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding and variceal hemorrhage. The Initial Rockall Score is a clinical tool used to predict mortality due to upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. This scoring system applies to patients presenting with upper GI bleeding, regardless of the underlying cause. The score is calculated based on three parameters: age, shock, and presence of comorbidity. A higher score indicates a higher risk of mortality.

- **Clinical utility**: The Initial Rockall Score aids in the risk stratification of patients with upper GI bleeding, helping clinicians identify high-risk patients who may require more aggressive management or intervention. It also assists in making decisions regarding hospital admission and discharge.

- **Exclusion criteria**: There are no specific exclusion criteria for using the Initial Rockall Score. However, it does not account for the severity or source of bleeding and should be used alongside other clinical findings and diagnostic tools.

The Initial Rockall Score estimates the risk of mortality due to upper gastrointestinal bleeding by evaluating three factors: age, the presence and degree of shock, and any major comorbidities. Each factor is assigned a score, which is then summed to provide an overall risk score.

- **Age scoring**:
	- **Less than 60 years**: 0 points
	- **Between 60 and 79 years**: 1 point
	- **80 years or older**: 2 points

### Prognostic impact of baseline hemoglobin levels on long-term thrombotic and bleeding events after percutaneous coronary interventions [^112rHJo5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

In this study, the primary ischemic outcome measure was a composite of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischemic stroke (fatal or nonfatal), whereas the primary bleeding outcome measure was GUSTO (Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries Trial) moderate/severe bleeding. Severe bleeding referred to life‐threatening intracerebral bleeding or bleeding that caused substantial hemodynamic compromise needing treatment, while moderate bleeding referred to bleeding that needed transfusion.

- **Secondary outcome measures**: The secondary outcome measures included all‐cause death, cardiovascular death, noncardiovascular death, MI, definite stent thrombosis, stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, GUSTO severe bleeding, GUSTO moderate bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial bleeding, any coronary revascularization, and heart failure hospitalization. Intracranial bleeding included both hemorrhagic stroke and traumatic brain injury.

Detailed definitions of the clinical events can be found in Data S1. An independent clinical event committee in each study adjudicated all the endpoint events.

### Growth differentiation factor 15 and risk of bleeding events: The atherosclerosis risk in communities study [^114jbx84]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

**Study limitations**: Our study has several limitations, including potential misclassification of the outcome due to reliance on ICD discharge codes. However, previous studies have reliably used ICD codes to establish the outcome of bleeding using hospitalization ICD codes. When compared with chart reviews, the positive predictive values for nonvariceal GI bleeding ranged from 88% to 98%, and for lower GI bleeding, it ranged from 95% to 98%. In addition, we may not have captured mild cases of bleeding that did not require hospitalization, although the majority of clinically significant bleeding events do require hospitalization. Although we rigorously accounted for covariates, residual confounding may still have played a role. Lastly, we acknowledge that, given the large sample size, we need to carefully evaluate whether statistically significant associations in our study are clinically significant.

### Timing and volume of fluid administration for patients with bleeding [^1121v9wP]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment of haemorrhagic shock involves maintaining blood pressure and tissue perfusion until bleeding is controlled. Different resuscitation strategies have been used to maintain blood pressure in trauma patients until bleeding is controlled. However, while maintaining blood pressure may prevent shock, it may worsen bleeding.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effect on mortality and coagulation times of two intravenous fluid administration strategies in the management of haemorrhagic hypovolaemia. The strategies include early compared to delayed administration, and larger compared to smaller volume of fluid administered.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic + Embase (OvidSP), ISI Web of Science (SCI-Expanded and CPCI-S), and clinical trials registries. We checked reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors and experts in the field. The most recent search was run on 5 February 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials of the timing and volume of intravenous fluid administration in trauma patients with bleeding were considered. Trials in which different types of intravenous fluid were compared were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

- **Main results**: Six trials involving a total of 2,128 people were included in this review. We did not combine the results quantitatively due to differences in study design and patient populations.

### Approach to the diagnosis and management of mild bleeding disorders [^11374mjJ]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2007). Low credibility.

Symptoms suggestive of mild bleeding tendencies are commonplace. While the majority with such symptoms are healthy, it is important to identify those with bleeding disorders to manage symptoms, minimize risk from invasive procedures, and avoid unnecessary exposure to blood products. Thorough clinical assessment remains the cornerstone of the diagnostic strategy for mild bleeding disorders, although the sensitivity and specificity of the clinical history and examination are limited.

When clinical suspicion is aroused, the use of a staged protocol of laboratory investigations is appropriate. However, the limitations of currently available tests of primary hemostasis and blood coagulation must be recognized to avoid diagnostic errors. Although there is considerable interest in global assays of hemostasis and coagulation, none has yet been demonstrated conclusively to be more effective than the standard approach.

Iatrogenic bleeding has increasing prominence in clinical practice. The expanding use of anticoagulants and platelet inhibitor drugs has resulted in an increased proportion of the population being at risk of abnormal bleeding. Knowledge of the levels of risk associated with particular drugs and combinations, and the advantages and hazards of interruption of drug use for planned interventional procedures, is essential to reduce the incidence of iatrogenic bleeding. Prevention and treatment of hemorrhage in subjects with mild bleeding disorders include the application of general measures.

### Efficacy, safety, and bleeding risk factor analysis of oral anticoagulants in AF patients ≥ 65 years of age: a multicenter retrospective cohort study [^116xbex3]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). High credibility.

Stroke prevention in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is challenging and requires a balance between thromboembolic prevention and bleeding risk. The comparison of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and warfarin in clinical practice, particularly in elderly Asian patients, has not been well studied. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NOACs versus warfarin in elderly patients with AF, supported by data from real-world observational studies.

- **Methods**: This retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in four centers in China. Patient information and clinical events were collected over an average of 15 months of follow-up and case queries. Clinical outcomes included major bleeding, minor bleeding, total bleeding, thrombosis, and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 3,450 elderly patients with AF were enrolled, with 2,656 patients receiving at least one NOAC (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban) and 794 patients receiving warfarin. After adjusting for confounders, NOACs significantly reduced the risk of minor bleeding [OR 0.70 (95% CI, 0.49–1.01), P = 0.049] and all-cause mortality [OR 0.57 (95% CI, 0.44–0.75), P < 0.001] compared with warfarin. However, major bleeding events [OR 1.51 (95% CI, 0.98–2.42), P = 0.075] and thrombotic events [OR 0.79 (95% CI, 0.57–1.13), P = 0.187] were not significantly different. There was no heterogeneity between clinical outcomes of NOACs and warfarin in subgroup analyses by age (65–74, 75–84, ≥ 85 years), sex (male, female), BMI (≥ 25, < 25), and comorbidities.

### Anticoagulation and other risk factors for clinically relevant bleeding after medical hospitalization: the Medical Inpatient Thrombosis and Hemostasis Study [^116V4bFX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). High credibility.

Clinically relevant bleeding after discharge from a medical hospitalization is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is limited knowledge of the risk factors for this bleeding. We aimed to determine the risk factors for bleeding leading to rehospitalization after hospital discharge.

The study population consisted of primary care patients followed longitudinally from October 2010 to September 2019 for medical hospitalization and clinically relevant bleeding. People discharged alive from a medical hospitalization were followed for up to 90 days for postdischarge bleeding requiring rehospitalization. Age-, sex- (male vs. female), and length of stay-adjusted hazard ratios for candidate bleeding risk factors were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models.

Over 9 years, there were 15,630 medical hospitalization discharges and 414 (2.6%) postdischarge clinically relevant bleeding events that required readmission. Clinical and patient factors related to the postdischarge bleeding risk were increasing age, active cancer, liver disease, creatinine concentration of > 2 g/dL, heart disease, and a history of previous gastrointestinal or central nervous system bleeding. Hemoglobin concentrations of < 12 g/dL for women and < 13.6 g/dL for men, a platelet count of < 50 × 10³/mm³, and anticoagulation at discharge were also associated with an increased risk for clinically relevant bleeding postdischarge.

In conclusion, postdischarge bleeding requiring hospitalization occurs in 2.6% of medical hospitalizations.

### Transfusion strategies in bleeding critically ill adults: A clinical practice guideline from the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine [^116PFKJe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

For each PICO question, a methodologist (SO) updated searches from published systematic reviews and developed new search strategies, with input from other TF members (supplementary materials). We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for each PICO up to September 2019, along with trial databases (clinicaltrials.gov and ISRCTN), to identify in-progress trials, which were incorporated into the literature reviews as they became available. Search results were uploaded into Rayyan for screening. Two reviewers from the TF screened the search results for relevant English-language systematic reviews (SRs), randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and observational studies. Any citation identified by either reviewer as potentially relevant underwent full text review. These were in turn screened by two reviewers, with disagreements about full text inclusion resolved by discussion and input from a third TF member.

Using a standardized and piloted data abstraction form, the methodology team conducted data abstraction for all included studies. To ensure consistency and prevent transcription errors, a second reviewer validated the data. With input from other TF members, the methodology team also conducted risk of bias assessments for each included study using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, or the Newcastle–Ottawa risk of bias assessment tool.

When there was sufficient evidence for data pooling, meta-analyses for each PICO question were conducted.

### Evaluation of definitions for oral anticoagulant-associated major bleeding: A population-based cohort study [^115bY4Vf]. Thrombosis Research (2022). High credibility.

Major bleeding is the most serious complication of oral anticoagulants (OACs). While consensus criteria to define major bleeding have been established by the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH), Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC), and Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), significant variability exists across these definitions. We sought to evaluate the agreement of cases identified by the three definitions and to assess their effect on mortality and OAC resumption.

- **Methods**: We used a dataset of individuals aged 66 and older in Ontario, Canada, presenting with OAC-related bleeding from 2010 to 2015. For case agreement, we calculated Cohen's κ between the three major bleeding definitions. We used multivariate regression to determine differences in mortality and OAC resumption among ISTH, BARC, and TIMI-defined major bleeds.

- **Results**: Among 2002 cases of OAC-related bleeding, agreement in case identification between ISTH and BARC was substantial (Cohen's κ = 0.69); however, agreement between TIMI and other definitions was poor. Using 30-day mortality of clinically relevant non-major bleeds as a comparator, ISTH-, BARC-, and TIMI-defined major bleeds conferred 3.3-, 3.2- and 5.9-fold increased risk, respectively. Among survivors, 50% with ISTH- and BARC-defined major bleeds resumed OACs at 180 days, compared to 31% of TIMI-associated cases.

- **Conclusion**: Major bleeds identified by ISTH and BARC criteria showed good agreement and similar prognostic utility, whereas TIMI criteria identified patients at greater clinical risk. Our results highlight the need for consistent criteria in defining major bleeding to ensure accurate risk assessment and management of patients on OACs.

### Risk of hospitalised bleeding in comparisons of oral anticoagulant options for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism [^1174vg5k]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Low credibility.

Understanding the comparative bleeding risks of oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapies for the primary treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) is limited. Therefore, among anticoagulant-naïve VTE patients, comparisons of apixaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin were conducted to study the rate of hospitalised bleeding within 180 days of OAC initiation. MarketScan databases covering the period from 2011 to 2016 were utilized. For each OAC comparison, new users were matched with up to five initiators of a different OAC.

The final analysis included 83,985 VTE patients who experienced 1,944 hospitalised bleeding events. In multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models, the rate of hospitalised bleeding was lower among new users of apixaban when compared to new users of rivaroxaban [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) 0.58 (0.41–0.80)] or warfarin [0.68 (0.50–0.92)]. Overall, the hospitalised bleeding rate was similar when comparing new users of rivaroxaban to new users of warfarin [0.98 (0.68–1.11)], though there was some suggestion that rivaroxaban was associated with lower bleeding risk among younger individuals.

Findings from this large real-world population concur with results from the randomized trial which found a lower bleeding risk with apixaban versus warfarin and, for the first time, reveal a lower risk of bleeding in a comparison of apixaban versus rivaroxaban.

### Guidelines for bleeding disorders in women [^115dY6BA]. Thrombosis Research (2009). Low credibility.

Women with bleeding disorders are disproportionately affected by reproductive tract bleeding and other related complications. Data on the management of women with bleeding disorders are hampered by a lack of randomized trials, case-control studies, or even large case series. In the absence of strong evidence to direct practice, government agencies and hemophilia organizations have developed consensus guidelines. This paper summarizes existing recommendations from these guidelines.

### Predictors, type, and impact of bleeding on the net clinical benefit of long-term ticagrelor in stable patients with prior myocardial infarction [^112NtYTW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The analysis focuses on TIMI major or minor bleeding in the ticagrelor 60 mg group versus the placebo group, stratified by low (N = 11,240) or high (N = 2,714) bleeding risk at baseline.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: A sensitivity analysis of safety was performed based on baseline bleeding risk, defined by the presence or absence of a history of spontaneous bleeding requiring hospitalization before randomization or anemia (hemoglobin ≤ 13.5 g/dL for men and ≤ 12.0 g/dL for women). ARI indicates absolute risk increase; HR, hazard ratio; KM, Kaplan–Maier; and TIMI, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction.

- **Efficacy evaluation**: An exploratory analysis evaluated the efficacy of ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily compared with placebo based on bleeding risk. Ticagrelor 60 mg reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke by 20% in patients with low bleeding risk (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70–0.92; P = 0.0015; Figure 6). However, there was no apparent benefit of ticagrelor in patients at high bleeding risk (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.77–1.26; P = 0.88, P interaction = 0.15).

- **Net clinical benefit**: Results for the net clinical benefit showed a consistent pattern, with ticagrelor 60 mg twice daily associated with favorable effects in low-bleeding-risk patients (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71–0.94; P = 0.004) but no apparent benefit in high bleeding risk (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.81–1.31).

Finally, there was significant heterogeneity for mortality with ticagrelor based on low versus high bleeding risk. There was a reduction in low bleeding risk (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.65–0.96) and no benefit in high bleeding risk (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.86–1.50; P interaction = 0.03; Figure 6, Table S3).

### Validation of high bleeding risk criteria and definition as proposed by the Academic Research Consortium for high bleeding risk [^1164GYNM]. European Heart Journal (2020). Low credibility.

The study aimed to validate the set of clinical and biochemical criteria proposed by consensus by the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) for High Bleeding Risk (HBR) for identifying HBR patients. These criteria were categorized into major and minor, if expected to carry in isolation ≥ 4% and < 4% Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) 3 or 5 bleeding risk within one year after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). High bleeding risk patients are defined as those meeting at least one major or two minor criteria.

- **Methods and results**: All patients undergoing PCI at Bern University Hospital, between February 2009 and September 2018, were prospectively entered into the Bern PCI Registry (NCT02241291). Age, haemoglobin, platelet count, creatinine, and use of oral anticoagulation were prospectively collected, while the remaining HBR criteria except for planned surgery were retrospectively adjudicated. A total of 16,580 participants with complete ARC-HBR criteria were included. After assigning one point to each major and 0.5 point to each minor criterion, we observed a step-wise augmentation of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding rates at one year for every 0.5 score increase. This ranged from 1.90% among patients fulfilling no criterion through 4.01%, 5.98%, 7.42%, 8.60%, 12.21%, 12.29%, and 17.64%. All major and five out of six minor criteria conferred in isolation a risk for BARC 3 or 5 bleeding at one year exceeding 4% at the upper limit of the 95% confidence intervals.

In conclusion, all major and the majority of minor ARC-HBR criteria identify in isolation patients at high bleeding risk.

### Major haemorrhage: past, present and future [^1143KRY9]. Anaesthesia (2023). Low credibility.

The definitions of major haemorrhage, particularly in trauma, have traditionally varied. It includes the loss of more than one circulating blood volume within 24 hours, estimated at around 70 ml/kg, or approximately 5 liters in a 70 kg adult. It can also be defined as the loss of 50% of total blood volume with a heart rate exceeding 110 beats/minute. However, physiological changes may be masked in specific patient groups, such as older patients, pregnant individuals, and those taking beta-blockers.

Definitions of major haemorrhage can also differ between patient populations. In obstetrics, postpartum haemorrhage is defined as blood loss greater than 500 mL from the genital tract within 24 hours of delivery. This can be further categorized into minor (500–1000 ml) or major (> 1000 ml). Major postpartum haemorrhage is further divided into moderate (1000–2000 ml) or severe (> 2000 ml). For patients experiencing upper and/or lower gastrointestinal bleeding, various risk scores have been validated to stratify severity.

### Antithrombotic therapy to minimize total events after ACS or PCI in atrial fibrillation: Insights from AUGUSTUS [^116HxpCb]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Low credibility.

Limited data exist on the optimal antithrombotic strategy to minimize total bleeding and ischemic events for patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and atrial fibrillation (AF).

- **Objectives**: The authors sought to identify the antithrombotic regimen that minimized total major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events, ischemic events, and hospitalizations after ACS or PCI in AF.

- **Methods**: We conducted a secondary analysis of AUGUSTUS, a 2×2 factorial, randomized trial evaluating apixaban vs a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) and aspirin vs placebo in patients with AF and ACS or PCI who were on P2Y 12 inhibitor therapy. We determined the incidence of total major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events in patients receiving at least 1 dose of study therapy, total ischemic events, and total hospitalizations among patients randomized to each antithrombotic strategy.

Over 6 months of follow-up, 573 of 4,568 (12.5%) patients experienced at least 1 bleeding event while on study drug; among them, 110 (19.2%) had multiple bleeding events. Compared with those with 1 bleeding event, patients with multiple bleeding events were more likely to be on a high-potency P2Y 12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor vs clopidogrel).

### Reversing the "risk-treatment paradox" of bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: Risk-concordant use of bleeding avoidance strategies is associated with reduced bleeding and lower costs [^112Taded]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Bleeding is a common, morbid, and costly complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. While bleeding avoidance strategies (BAS) are effective, they are used paradoxically less in patients at high risk of bleeding. Whether a patient-centered approach to specifically increase the risk-concordant use of BAS and, thus, reverse the risk-treatment paradox is associated with reduced bleeding and costs is unknown.

Methods and results were implemented to reverse the bleeding risk-treatment paradox at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, MO. The study examined:

- **Temporal trends in BAS use**: Among 3519 percutaneous coronary interventions, there was a significantly increasing trend (P = 0.002) in risk-concordant use of BAS.
- **Association of risk-concordant BAS use with bleeding and hospital costs**: The bleeding incidence was 2% in the risk-concordant group versus 9% in the risk-discordant group (absolute risk difference, 7%; number needed to treat, 14). Risk-concordant BAS use was associated with a 67% reduction (95% confidence interval, 52–78%; P < 0.001) in the risk of bleeding and a $4738 reduction (95% confidence interval, 3353–6122; P < 0.001) in per-patient percutaneous coronary intervention hospitalization costs (21.6% cost-savings).

Conclusions indicate that patient-centered care, directly aimed at making treatment-related decisions based on the predicted risk of bleeding, led to more risk-concordant use of BAS and reversal of the risk-treatment paradox. This, in turn, was associated with a reduction in bleeding.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^117612rR]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, specifically concerning patients on warfarin, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend the administration of vitamin K (1–3 mg IV, for one dose) in patients with non-major bleeding while on warfarin.

### Severe non-traumatic bleeding events detected by computed tomography: Do anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents have a role [^114RyjiY]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Bleeding is the most common and serious complication of anticoagulant (AC) and antiplatelet agents (APA), which are increasingly used in everyday practice. This study aimed to enlist and analyze the most severe bleeding events revealed during computed tomography (CT) examinations over a 1-year period at our University Hospital and evaluate the role of ACs and APAs in their occurrence.

This descriptive monocentric retrospective study included all patients who benefited from an emergency CT scan with a diagnosis of severe non-traumatic bleeding. Patients were divided into two groups: those treated with ACs and/or APAs and those not treated with ACs or APAs.

After applying the inclusion criteria, 93 patients were enrolled. Sixty-one patients received an anticoagulant or antiplatelet treatment, and 32 did not receive any AC or APA therapy. Seventy-nine percent presented with an intracranial hemorrhage, 17% with a rectus sheath or iliopsoas bleeding or hematoma, and 4% with a quadriceps hematoma. Only patients who received ACs or APAs suffered a muscular hematoma (p 3).

In our series, intracranial hemorrhage was preponderant, and muscular hematomas occurred exclusively in patients treated with ACs and/or APAs. This study needs to be extended to evaluate the impact of new anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 557: Management of acute abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-aged women [^112CcnSe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). High credibility.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 2013 guidelines recommend classifying the etiologies of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) using the PALM-COEIN system. This classification includes:

- **Polyp**: Growths that develop in the inner lining of the uterus.
- **Adenomyosis**: A condition where the inner lining of the uterus breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus.
- **Leiomyoma**: Also known as fibroids, these are benign tumors of the uterus.
- **Malignancy and hyperplasia**: Encompasses cancerous growths and the abnormal thickening of the uterine lining.
- **Coagulopathy**: Refers to bleeding disorders that affect how blood clots.
- **Ovulatory dysfunction**: Involves irregularities in the ovulation process.
- **Endometrial**: Pertains to issues related to the uterine lining itself.
- **Iatrogenic**: Results from medical intervention or treatment.
- **Not otherwise classified**: A category for causes that do not fit into the other classifications.

### Predictive value of venous thromboembolism (VTE)-BLEED to predict major bleeding and other adverse events in a practice-based cohort of patients with VTE: results of the XALIA study [^112Aj6ko]. British Journal of Haematology (2018). Low credibility.

The primary outcome of this study evaluated major bleeding incidents in patients with VTE after day 30. The absolute incidence of major bleeding was 0.53% [15/2818, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.32–0.88] in the low-risk VTE group and 1.5% (24/1629, 95% CI 0.98–2.2) in the high-risk group, resulting in a crude odds ratio (OR) of 1.4 (95% CI 1.2–1.7) per increase of the VTE-BLEED score by one point. This crude OR was 1.5 (95% CI 1.1–2.2) in the rivaroxaban group and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1–1.6) in the standard of care group. The c-statistic was 0.68 (95% CI 0.59–0.77) in the overall cohort, 0.69 (95% CI 0.55–0.84) in the rivaroxaban group, and 0.64 (95% CI 0.52–0.75) in the standard of care group. The crude hazard ratio (HR) for major bleeding after day 30 was 2.6 (95% CI 1.3–5.2) and the treatment-adjusted HR was 2.3 (95% CI 1.1–4.5) comparing the high-risk versus the low-risk VTE-BLEED group.

- **Primary study outcome**: Major bleeding after day 30 during anticoagulation of 4457 patients was available for the primary analysis.

The overall crude and treatment-adjusted OR per point increase for major bleeding after day 90 were 1.5 (95% CI 1.2–1.9) and 1.4 (95% CI 1.1–1.7), whereas the crude and treatment-adjusted HR were 3.8 (95% CI 1.6–9.3) and 3.2 (95% CI 1.3–7.7) comparing the high-risk versus the low-risk VTE-BLEED group. The c-statistic for major bleeding after day 90 was 0.71 (95% CI 0.61–0.82).

### Abnormal uterine bleeding and underlying hemostatic disorders: Report of a consensus process [^113wNnrS]. Fertility and Sterility (2005). Low credibility.

An ad hoc consensus group determined that the prevalence of von Willebrand's disease in females with heavy menstrual bleeding is approximately 13%, but the severity of the disorder varies and, consequently, the overall clinical impact remains unknown. Consensus recommendations are presented, which include:

- **Structured history**: For screening females with heavy menstrual bleeding.
- **Collaborative, multidisciplinary evaluation**: To ensure comprehensive assessment.
- **Strategy for future research**: Focused on basic science and clinical investigation.

### Relationship of platelet reactivity with bleeding outcomes during long-term treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy for medically managed patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112VfN1e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Unadjusted bleeding outcomes: Using the two-level composite bleeding endpoints for the primary analyses, 28 GUSTO severe/life-threatening or moderate bleeding events and 39 TIMI major or minor bleeding events not related to CABG occurred from randomization through the end of the study follow-up. Starting at the landmark of five days post-randomization (the starting point for this analysis that corresponds with the steady-state day five PRU values), there were 27 GUSTO severe/life-threatening or moderate bleeding events and 37 TIMI major or minor bleeding events not related to CABG included in these analyses. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common location for both GUSTO and TIMI bleeding events.

Bleeding event curves through 30 months by PRU tertiles overlapped during the first 12 months. The highest rates of bleeding through 30 months were observed for the middle PRU tertile (PRU 106–211) for both GUSTO and TIMI two-level composite bleeding events.

### Effectiveness and outcome of management strategies for dabigatran- or warfarin-related major bleeding events [^112hCzz1]. Thrombosis Research (2016). Low credibility.

Strategies used for the management of dabigatran-related major bleeding events (MBEs) and their effectiveness have not been systematically evaluated.

- **Methods**: Reports on 1,034 individuals experiencing 1,121 MBEs (696 on dabigatran and 425 on warfarin) in five phase III randomized controlled trials were assessed independently by two investigators.

- **Results**: MBEs were managed either by drug discontinuation only (37%), or drug discontinuation with either transfusion of only red cell concentrates (38%), or plasma (23%). Few MBEs (2%) were treated with coagulation factor concentrates. The effectiveness of the management was assessed as good in a significantly larger proportion of MBEs on dabigatran (91%) than on warfarin (84%, odds ratio [OR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–2.49), which was consistent with the lower 30-day mortality (OR 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44–1.00). The effectiveness of bleeding management in non-traumatic bleeding was better in patients with dabigatran than with warfarin (OR 1.82; 95% CI, 1.18–2.79) but was similar in traumatic bleeding (OR 0.75; 95% CI, 0.25–2.30). The relative effectiveness of management of bleeding and 30-day mortality rates across other key subgroups of patients or sites of bleeding, the use of platelet inhibitors, and age-, sex-, and renal function subgroups were comparable in MBEs on dabigatran or warfarin.

- **Conclusion**: Despite the unavailability of a specific antidote at the time of these studies, bleeding in patients receiving dabigatran was managed in the overwhelming majority of patients without coagulation factor concentrates.

### Definition of major bleeding in clinical investigations of antihemostatic medicinal products in non-surgical patients [^112dyxko]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2005). Low credibility.

A variety of definitions of major bleeding have been used in published clinical studies, adding to the difficulty in comparing data between trials and performing meta-analyses. In the first step towards unified definitions of bleeding complications, the definition of major bleeding in non-surgical patients was discussed at the Control of Anticoagulation Subcommittee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. From this discussion, a definition was developed to be applicable to studies with all agents that interfere with hemostasis, including anticoagulants, platelet function inhibitors, and fibrinolytic drugs. The definition and text that follow have been reviewed and approved by the cochairs of the subcommittee, and the revised version is published here. The intention is to also seek approval of this definition from the regulatory authorities.

### Frequency and impact of bleeding in elective coronary stent clinical trials — utility of three commonly used definitions [^113rQq9r]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2012). Low credibility.

Bleeding events are common after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and have been shown to increase mortality in studies of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and antithrombotic therapy. Despite this evidence, bleeding has not been included as a traditional major endpoint in clinical trials of low-risk populations enrolled in PCI clinical trials. Thus, the impact of specific bleeding definitions has not been fully evaluated among these patients.

- **Methods and results**: Using patient-level pooled data from sirolimus and zotarolimus drug-eluting stent clinical trials, we identified bleeding events using three common definitions of bleeding: ACUITY, TIMI, and GUSTO. We assessed the impact on mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) at 12 months after PCI. The GUSTO, ACUITY, and TIMI classifications identified bleeding rates of 2.3%, 1.9%, and 2.1%, respectively. The GUSTO criteria classified all 118 suspected bleeding events, with 22 (18.6%) and 8 (6.8%) suspected bleeding events not meeting ACUITY and TIMI criteria, respectively. The combined endpoint of all-cause death or MI at 12 months was significantly higher for patients with a bleeding event compared with those who did not bleed [hazard ratio 1.95 (95% CI 1.06–3.60)].

- **Conclusion**: There is substantial variability in the utility and inclusiveness of three widely used bleeding definitions in identifying clinically significant bleeding events in clinical trials of low-risk patients undergoing PCI with DES. Patients with bleeding after elective PCI have an increased one-year risk of death or MI.

### Reversing the "risk-treatment paradox" of bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: Risk-concordant use of bleeding avoidance strategies is associated with reduced bleeding and lower costs [^111kb9Zr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

This is the first prospective observational study to directly address the reversal of the bleeding risk-treatment paradox via a focused patient-centered intervention. Our study found that the risk-treatment paradox was commonly observed. By focusing on the risk of bleeding at the point of care, it was feasible to impact, but also difficult to fully reverse, the risk-treatment paradox. Nonetheless, even partial reductions in the risk-treatment paradox, achieved by the risk-concordant use of bleeding avoidance strategies (BAS), were associated with substantial reductions in the incidence of bleeding and hospital costs. The association of risk-concordant use of BAS with reductions in the incidence of bleeding and hospital costs was independent of bleeding risk and mortality risk. Furthermore, an increasing trend in risk-concordant use of BAS was associated with concomitant reducing trends in the incidence of bleeding and hospital costs.

The Institute of Medicine defines patient-centered care as "care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs, and values", ensuring that patient needs and values guide all clinical decisions. The Institute of Medicine has recognized patient-centered care as one of six major domains of healthcare quality. While the healthcare community widely recognizes the potential of health information technology in enabling patient-centered care, we have yet to see patient-centered care being used to improve percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) outcomes in the catheterization laboratory — an area of critical need and a very large service area, where more than 600,000 procedures are conducted annually.

### Impact of spontaneous extracranial bleeding events on health state utility in patients with atrial fibrillation: Results from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^117LKuPC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

- **Bleeding end points**: The primary safety end point in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 was adjudicated major bleeding. Spontaneous bleeding events requiring medical attention were adjudicated by an independent and blinded clinical events committee, according to prespecified criteria as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The specific event categories included major gastrointestinal bleeding, major nongastrointestinal bleeding, and clinically relevant nonmajor (CRNM) bleeding.

Major bleeds include symptomatic bleeding in a critical area or organ, such as intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intraarticular, or pericardial, or intramuscular with compartment syndrome and/or bleeding causing a decrease in hemoglobin level of 2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more, or leading to transfusion of 2 or more units of whole blood or red blood cells. CRNM bleeds are acute or subacute clinically overt bleeds that do not meet the criteria for major bleed but prompt a clinical response, in that they lead to at least 1 of the following: a hospital admission for bleeding, a physician-guided medical or surgical treatment for bleeding, or a change in antithrombotic therapy (including interruption or discontinuation of study drug). Bleeding events that did not require medical attention were classified as minor bleeding, without clinical events committee adjudication.

### Risk for major hemorrhages in patients receiving clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin alone after transient ischemic attack or minor ischemic stroke: A secondary analysis of the POINT randomized clinical trial [^111zEk61]. JAMA Neurology (2019). High credibility.

The short-term risk of hemorrhage when treating patients with acute transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor acute ischemic stroke (AIS) using clopidogrel plus aspirin or aspirin alone was evaluated. This secondary analysis of the Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) randomized, double-blind clinical trial involved patients with high-risk TIA or minor AIS. They were randomized within 12 hours of symptom onset and followed for 90 days. The trial was conducted in 10 countries across North America, Europe, and Australasia, with total enrollment of 4881 patients between May 28, 2010, and December 17, 2017, comprising the intention-to-treat group. Of these, 4819 patients (98.7%) were included in the as-treated analysis group. Primary safety analyses focused on the as-treated group, classifying patients based on the study drug received, with intention-to-treat analyses as secondary. Data analyses were conducted in April 2018.

Patients received clopidogrel (600 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 75 mg daily for days 2–90) or placebo; all patients also received open-label aspirin, 50 to 325 mg per day.

The primary safety outcome was the occurrence of major hemorrhages; secondary safety outcomes included minor hemorrhages. In total, 269 sites worldwide randomized 4881 patients (median age, 65.0 years; interquartile range, 55–74 years; 2195 women, constituting 45.0%).

### Timing and volume of fluid administration for patients with bleeding [^111Ni2Z6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

The treatment of hemorrhagic shock involves maintaining blood pressure and tissue perfusion until bleeding is controlled. Different resuscitation strategies have been used to maintain blood pressure in trauma patients until bleeding is controlled. However, while maintaining blood pressure may prevent shock, it may worsen bleeding.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of early versus delayed, and larger versus smaller volume of fluid administration in trauma patients with bleeding.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the specialised register of the Injuries Group, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the National Research Register, and the Science Citation Index. We checked reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors and experts in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of the timing and volume of intravenous fluid administration in trauma patients with bleeding. Trials in which different types of intravenous fluid were compared were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

- **Main results**: We did not combine the results quantitatively because the interventions and patient populations were so diverse. Early versus delayed fluid administration: Three trials reported mortality and two coagulation data. In the first trial (n = 598), the relative risk (RR) for death with early fluid administration was 1.26 (95% confidence interval of 1.00–1.58). The weighted mean differences (WMD) for prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 2.7 (95% CI 0.9–4.5) and 4.3.

### Reliability of major bleeding events in UK routine data versus clinical trial adjudicated follow-up data [^114M43kd]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

Our analysis of the ASCEND trial highlights the challenges of ensuring complete follow-up for major bleeding outcomes when using either adjudicated direct-participant mail-based follow-up or routinely collected data. When comparing these two methods of follow-up, we found that although there was moderate agreement, over 200 major bleeding events were either reported in adjudicated direct-participant follow-up alone or routine data only. Importantly, in ASCEND, despite these discrepancies, relative and absolute treatment effects were similar between both data sources. However, if a trial must ensure complete follow-up for major bleeding outcomes, then this will likely require a combined approach of direct participant and routine data follow-up.

For the major bleeding events only identified in adjudicated direct-participant follow-up, the majority had a corresponding routinely collected hospitalization record, but either the record gave no indication of bleeding severity or no bleeding code was recorded. Although there has been an expansion in sources of routine data available for UK clinical trials, secondary care datasets that could help categorize bleeding events are not yet collected nationally. Expanding existing hospital data flows to also include within-hospital prescribing, laboratory results, and standardized patient discharge summaries could improve our algorithm's performance at ascertaining major bleeding events from routine data.

A number of studies have reported on the impact of clinical adjudication on investigator-reported and participant-reported cardiovascular events, underscoring the need for harmonized data collection practices to ensure the accuracy and completeness of outcome reporting.

### Standardized reporting of bleeding complications for clinical investigations in acute coronary syndromes: a proposal from the academic bleeding consensus (ABC) multidisciplinary working group [^117QLSDQ]. American Heart Journal (2009). High credibility.

Clinical trials of antithrombotic agents for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) routinely assess bleeding as a safety endpoint, but variation in bleeding definitions makes comparison of the relative safety of these agents difficult.

- **Methods**: The ABC Multidisciplinary Working Group, an informal working group comprising clinical researchers and representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the pharmaceutical industry, sought to develop a consensus approach to measuring the incidence and severity of bleeding complications during clinical trials of ACS. A meeting of the ABC was convened in April 2008 in Washington, DC, with the goal of developing a consensus approach to measuring the incidence and severity of hemorrhagic complications during clinical trials of ACS. Relevant literature on bleeding was reviewed through a series of short lectures and intensive group discussion.

- **Results**: Using existing evidence on bleeding and outcomes as well as clinical judgment, criteria for the assessment of bleeding were developed through expert consensus. This consensus statement divides bleeding-related data elements into three categories: essential, recommended, and optional.

- **Conclusions**: The ABC Group recommendations for collection and reporting of bleeding complications provide a framework for consistency in the collection of information on hemorrhagic complications in trials of ACS. Widespread adoption of the statement recommendations will facilitate understanding of the mechanisms of adverse outcomes after bleeding events in such trials.

### Relationship of platelet reactivity with bleeding outcomes during long-term treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy for medically managed patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes [^112UTkxL]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Using the method of Contal and O'Quigley, the best PRU cut points identified for GUSTO severe/life-threatening or moderate bleeding events (PRU < 106) and TIMI major or minor bleeding events (PRU < 46) for the primary analyses did not significantly distinguish longitudinal bleeding risks using these two-level bleeding composite endpoints (Figure 2A and 2B). For the exploratory analyses, the separately determined PRU cut points that maximized the score statistic were < 75 both for the three-level composite of GUSTO severe/life-threatening, moderate, or mild bleeding events (unadjusted bleeding rates = 26.5% for PRU values < 75 vs. 12.6% for PRU values ≥ 75) and for the three-level composite of TIMI major, minor, or minimal bleeding events (unadjusted bleeding rates = 25.9% vs. 12.2%, respectively). Bleeding event curves distinguished by this cut point of < 75 PRU (using the three-level composite bleeding endpoints) separated early and continued to separate during the trial follow-up period (Figure 2C and 2D).

### Definition of major bleeding: Prognostic classification [^112F8VPt]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

In patients on anticoagulant treatment, the major bleeding (MB) definition released by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) is widely accepted. However, this definition identifies MBs with a highly variable short-term risk of death.

- **Objectives**: The study aims were to derive and validate a classification of ISTH-defined MBs for the risk of short-term death.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients admitted for ISTH-defined MB occurring while on treatment with oral anticoagulants were included in the study and divided into a derivation and a validation cohort. Death within 30 days was the primary study outcome.

- **Results**: Among 1077 patients with MB, 64/517 and 63/560 patients in the derivation and validation cohort died, respectively. In the derivation cohort, a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) < 14 and shock were predictors of death; critical site bleeding and hemoglobin decrease ≥ 2 g/dL, or transfusion ≥ 2 units were not. GCS < 14 (hazard ratio [HR], 8.67; 95% confidence interval, 3.93–19.13) was a predictor of death in intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), and shock at admission (HR, 4.84; 95% CI, 2.01–11.70), and pericardial bleeding (HR, 11.37; 95% CI, 1.33–97.31) in non-ICH MBs. The predictive value of GCS < 14 in ICH, and shock and pericardial bleeding in non-ICH MBs was confirmed in the validation cohort. None of the patients with isolated ocular or articular bleeding died. A prognostic classification of ISTH-defined MBs for the risk of short-term death is proposed as "serious", "severe", and "life-threatening" (ICH with GCS < 14 or non-ICH with shock) MBs.

### Reversing the "risk-treatment paradox" of bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: Risk-concordant use of bleeding avoidance strategies is associated with reduced bleeding and lower costs [^115VrD8R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Patient-centered care that directly aims to make treatment-related decisions based on the predicted probability of bleeding is urgently required. Larger and multicentered studies are also needed to corroborate and generalize these results. As clinical medicine inches toward personalization of care, both the patient — through reduced rates of adverse outcomes — and the hospitals — via substantial reduction in per-patient costs — are likely to benefit by a simple change of practice that encourages objectivity and mitigates variability in care.

### A British society for haematology guideline on the assessment and management of bleeding risk prior to invasive procedures [^117V5qff]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for perioperative bleeding, more specifically concerning initial assessment, BSH 2024 guidelines recommend eliciting a structured bleeding history, including personal and family history of spontaneous or procedure-related bleeding, such as using the HEMSTOP questionnaire, before elective procedures associated with a risk of bleeding.

### Effect of tranexamic acid on mortality in patients with traumatic bleeding: Prespecified analysis of data from randomised controlled trial [^113mB7Zh]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

To examine whether the effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of death and thrombotic events in patients with traumatic bleeding varies according to baseline risk of death, this study assessed the extent to which protocols for treatment with tranexamic acid maximize benefits to patients.

The design involved a prespecified stratified analysis of data from an international multicentre randomised controlled trial (the CRASH-2 trial) with an estimation of the proportion of premature deaths that could potentially be averted through the administration of tranexamic acid.

Participants included 13,273 trauma patients in the CRASH-2 trial who were treated with tranexamic acid or placebo within three hours of injury. Trauma patients enrolled in the UK Trauma and Audit Research Network were stratified by risk of death at baseline (50%).

The intervention involved tranexamic acid (1 g over 10 minutes followed by 1 g over eight hours) or a matching placebo.

- **Main outcome measure**: Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for death in hospital within four weeks of injury, deaths from bleeding, and fatal and non-fatal thrombotic events associated with the use of tranexamic acid according to baseline risk of death. Unless there was strong evidence against the null hypothesis of homogeneity of effects (P < 0.001), the overall odds ratio was used as the most reliable guide to the odds ratios in all strata.

Results indicated that tranexamic acid was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality and deaths from bleeding. In each stratum of baseline risk, there were fewer deaths among patients treated with tranexamic acid compared to those receiving a placebo.

### Defining high bleeding risk in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: A consensus document from the Academic Research Consortium for High Bleeding Risk [^115bAvXH]. European Heart Journal (2019). Low credibility.

A number of important limitations of the proposed definition must be acknowledged. First, the chosen cutoff values for 1-year BARC 3 or 5 bleeding (4%) and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) (1%) are arbitrary, according to the expert opinion of this group. Second, data on rates of BARC 3 or 5 bleeding or ICH at 1 year were not available for a number of criteria, in which case justification is based on consensus decision alone. Third, although the relationship between many criteria and bleeding is continuous, binary criteria have been used to simplify the definition and facilitate its use in trial enrollment. In addition, the differential bleeding risks associated with the criteria have not been weighted beyond major and minor because of a lack of data to support such an approach. Finally, the definition has not been validated in an independent patient data set. To this end, as more data become available, we anticipate validation and recalibration of this initial set of high bleeding risk criteria.

### Bleeding risk and the management of bleeding complications in patients undergoing anticoagulant therapy: Focus on new anticoagulant agents [^1139xexn]. Blood (2008). Low credibility.

For more than 60 years, heparin and coumarin have been mainstays of anticoagulation therapy. They are widely available, inexpensive, effective, and have specific antidotes but are regarded as problematic because of their need for careful monitoring. In addition, coumarin has a delayed onset of action, interacts with many medications, has a narrow therapeutic window, and is paradoxically prothrombotic in certain settings (i.e. can precipitate "coumarin necrosis"). Heparin may require monitoring of its therapeutic effect and can also cause thrombosis (heparin-induced thrombocytopenia/thrombosis syndrome).

These limitations have led to the development of new anticoagulants with the potential to replace these agents. These newer agents fall into two classes based on whether they are antithrombin dependent (low-molecular-weight heparin, fondaparinux) or antithrombin independent (direct inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin [factor IIa]). This paper addresses newer anticoagulants, reviewing their efficacy and limitations, and focuses on the risk of major bleeding that may complicate their use.

In contrast to heparin and coumarin, none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. Available data on the efficacy and safety of experimental agents for anticoagulant reversal are reviewed, and a plan for management of anticoagulant-induced bleeding is presented.

### Clinical end point definitions after percutaneous coronary intervention and their relationship to late mortality: An assessment by attributable risk [^117PzZQb]. Heart (2006). Low credibility.

To explore the relative and absolute risks associated with various definitions for myocardial infarction, bleeding, and revascularization within the context of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the REPLACE-2 (randomised evaluation of PCI linking Angiomax to reduced clinical events) database of patients undergoing PCI was used. Various definitions of myocardial infarction, bleeding, and revascularization were modeled by logistic regression, assessing their relationship with 12-month mortality. Estimates from these models were used to calculate the "attributable fraction" for late mortality associated with each definition.

The most liberal definition of myocardial infarction was associated with an attributable risk of 13.7% (95% CI 3.4% to 23.0%). The most stringent definition was associated with an attributable risk of 4.6% (95% CI 0.6% to 8.6%). Restrictive definitions of bleeding, such as TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) major bleeding, are associated with a high odds ratio of risk (6.1, 95% CI 2.1 to 17.7, p = 0.001) but a low attributable fraction (3.5%, 95% CI 0.9% to 6.8%).

Stringent end point definitions may under-represent the clinical significance of adverse outcomes after PCI. Considering both the proportional and absolute risk associated with definitions may be a more useful method for evaluating clinical trial end points. This analysis supports the definitions of ischemic events but suggests that more liberal definitions of bleeding events may also be relevant to late mortality.

### Impact of spontaneous extracranial bleeding events on health state utility in patients with atrial fibrillation: Results from the ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 trial [^115Z3KPH]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The impact of different types of extracranial bleeding events on health-related quality of life and health-state utility among patients with atrial fibrillation is not well understood.

- **Methods and results**: The ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 (Effective Anticoagulation With Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation–Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 48) trial compared edoxaban with warfarin regarding the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation. Data from the EuroQol-5D (5D-3L) questionnaire, collected prospectively at 3-month intervals for up to 48 months, were used to estimate the impact of different categories of bleeding events on health-state utility over 12 months following the event. Longitudinal mixed-effect models revealed that major gastrointestinal bleeds and major nongastrointestinal bleeds were associated with significant immediate decreases in utility scores (−0.029 [−0.044 to −0.014; P < 0.001] and −0.029 [−0.046 to −0.012; P = 0.001], respectively). These effects decreased in magnitude over time and were no longer significant for major nongastrointestinal bleeds at 9 months but remained borderline significant for major gastrointestinal bleeds at 12 months. Clinically relevant nonmajor and minor bleeds were associated with smaller but measurable immediate impacts on utility (−0.010 [−0.016 to −0.005] and −0.016 [−0.024 to −0.008]; P < 0.001 for both), which remained relatively constant and statistically significant over the 12 months following the bleeding event.

Conclusions

All categories of bleeding events were associated with negative impacts on utility scores.

### Guidelines on the assessment of bleeding risk prior to surgery or invasive procedures [^115GE96S]. British Journal of Haematology (2008). Low credibility.

Unselected coagulation testing is widely practiced in the process of assessing bleeding risk prior to surgery. This may delay surgery inappropriately and cause unnecessary concern in patients who are found to have 'abnormal' tests. In addition, it is associated with a significant cost. This systematic review was performed to determine whether patient bleeding history and unselected coagulation testing predict abnormal perioperative bleeding.

A literature search of Medline between 1966 and 2005 was performed to identify appropriate studies. Studies that contained enough data to allow the calculation of the predictive value and likelihood ratios of tests for perioperative bleeding were included. Nine observational studies (three prospective) were identified. The positive predictive value (0.03–0.22) and likelihood ratio (0.94–5.1) for coagulation tests indicate that they are poor predictors of bleeding.

- **Bleeding history**: Patients undergoing surgery should have a bleeding history taken. This should include details of previous surgery and trauma, a family history, and details of anti-thrombotic medication.
- **Screening**: Patients with a negative bleeding history do not require routine coagulation screening prior to surgery.

### Reliability of major bleeding events in UK routine data versus clinical trial adjudicated follow-up data [^114rAGRC]. Heart (2023). Low credibility.

Agreement between routine data and adjudicated direct follow-up was analyzed for the components of the major bleeding composite outcome. The strongest agreement was observed for intracranial hemorrhage (kappa 0.73, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and serious gastrointestinal bleeding (0.56, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.62). Other major bleeding and sight-threatening eye bleeding demonstrated poor (0.36, 0.26 to 0.45) and moderate agreement (0.45, 0.35 to 0.45), respectively.

Among the 241 major bleeding events identified in adjudicated direct-participant follow-up alone, within 90 days, 74 (30.7%) had a bleeding code recorded in the routine data but did not meet the algorithm's definition for major bleeding. Additionally, 93 (38.6%) had a routine data hospitalization record but no bleeding code recorded, and 74 (30.7%) had no routine data hospitalization record. Conversely, for the 281 major bleeding events identified in routine data only, in the adjudicated direct-participant follow-up database, 11 (3.9%) participants had a bleed event within 90 days which was refuted after adjudication, 10 (3.6%) had a minor bleed reported, and 223 (79.4%) had no hospitalization reported within 90 days.

### Guideline on the management of bleeding in patients on antithrombotic agents [^117KefNT]. British Journal of Haematology (2013). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for bleeding in patients on antithrombotics, specifically in patients taking dabigatran, the BSH 2013 guidelines recommend considering the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate, activated prothrombin complex concentrate, and/or recombinant factor VIII for patients experiencing ongoing life-threatening bleeding.

### Time course of ischemic and bleeding burden in elderly patients with acute coronary syndromes randomized to low-dose prasugrel or clopidogrel [^115FW2V7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). High credibility.

Elderly patients experience high ischemic and bleeding rates following acute coronary syndrome; however, the progression of these complications over time has not been thoroughly studied. This study sought to characterize average daily ischemic rates (ADIRs) and average daily bleeding rates (ADBRs) over one year in patients over 74 years old with acute coronary syndrome, who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and were randomized in the Elderly ACS 2 trial. This trial compared low-dose prasugrel (5 mg daily) with clopidogrel (75 mg daily).

ADIRs and ADBRs were calculated as the total number of events, including recurrent events, divided by the number of patient-days of follow-up. These rates were assessed within different clinical phases: acute (0–3 days), subacute (4–30 days), and late (31–365 days). Generalized estimating equations were used to test the least squares mean differences for the pairwise comparisons of ADIRs and ADBRs, as well as the comparisons between clopidogrel and prasugrel effects.

Globally, ADIRs were 2.6 times (95% CI, 2.4–2.9) higher than ADBRs. ADIRs were significantly higher in the clopidogrel arm compared to the low-dose prasugrel arm during the subacute phase (P adj < 0.001), with no corresponding difference in ADBRs (P adj = 0.35). In the late phase, ADIRs remained significantly higher with clopidogrel (P adj < 0.001), while ADBRs were significantly higher with low-dose prasugrel (P adj < 0.001).

In conclusion, the ischemic burden was greater than the bleeding burden across all clinical phases during a one-year follow-up of elderly patients with acute coronary syndrome treated with percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Timing and volume of fluid administration for patients with bleeding following trauma [^112bHVkA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment of haemorrhagic shock involves maintaining blood pressure and tissue perfusion until bleeding is controlled. Different resuscitation strategies have been used to maintain blood pressure in trauma patients until bleeding is controlled. However, while maintaining blood pressure may prevent shock, it may worsen bleeding.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of early versus delayed, and larger versus smaller volume of fluid administration in trauma patients with bleeding.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, the specialized register of the Injuries Group, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the National Research Register, and the Science Citation Index. We checked reference lists of identified articles and contacted authors and experts in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized trials of the timing and volume of intravenous fluid administration in trauma patients with bleeding were included. Trials in which different types of intravenous fluid were compared were excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

- **Main results**: We did not combine the results quantitatively because the interventions and patient populations were so diverse.
	- **Early versus delayed fluid administration**: Three trials reported mortality, and two reported coagulation data. In the first trial (n = 598), the relative risk (RR) for death with early fluid administration was 1.26 (95% confidence interval of 1.00–1.58). The weighted mean differences (WMD) for prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 2.7 (95% CI 0.9–4.5) and 4.3.

### Recommendations for standardization of bleeding data analyses in contraceptive studies [^113abpTx]. Contraception (2022). Low credibility.

To address limitations that exist with existing definitions of menstrual bleeding changes occurring with contraceptive methods, we assembled a panel to develop new recommendations for the standardization of bleeding data analyses associated with contraceptive use to better inform users, clinicians, investigators, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory agencies. We propose three criteria for assessing bleeding outcomes: pattern, flow, and duration. The descriptors within each criterion depend on whether the contraceptive is designed to result in a predictable or unpredictable bleeding pattern.

Predictable pattern outcomes quantify days of scheduled, unscheduled, and no bleeding, while unpredictable pattern outcomes assess frequency. Flow is quantified based on patient comparisons to their typical flow when not using contraception, with spotting representing no menstrual product use. The duration of a prolonged bleeding and/or spotting episode is more than 7 days. Studies should assess bleeding characteristics for a minimum of 12 months for 21/7, 24/4, extended cycle, or continuous regimens, two years for injectables, and the full duration of use for long-acting contraceptives.

Describing pattern, flow, and duration as independent categories allows a fuller understanding of the bleeding outcomes and better future assessments of acceptability and continuation. Standardization of outcomes permits better comparison between studies and data synthesis; standardization will also improve the ability of clinicians and patients to understand differences between products.

### Adverse impact of bleeding on prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndromes [^113T6yyp]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Use of multiple antithrombotic drugs and aggressive invasive strategies has increased the risk of major bleeding in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. It is not known to what extent bleeding determines clinical outcome.

- **Methods and results**: Using Cox proportional-hazards modeling, we examined the association between bleeding and death or ischemic events in 34,146 patients with ACS enrolled in the Organization to Assess Ischemic Syndromes and the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent ReEvents studies. Patients with major bleeding were older, more often had diabetes or a history of stroke, had lower blood pressure and higher serum creatinine, more often had ST-segment changes on the presenting ECG, and had a 5-fold-higher incidence of death during the first 30 days (12.8% versus 2.5%; P < 0.0001) and a 1.5-fold-higher incidence of death between 30 days and 6 months (4.6% versus 2.9%; P = 0.002). Major bleeding was independently associated with an increased hazard of death during the first 30 days (hazard ratio, 5.37; 95% CI, 3.97 to 7.26; P < 0.0001), but the hazard was much weaker after 30 days (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.01 to 2.36; P = 0.047). The association was consistent across subgroups according to cointerventions during hospitalization, and there was an increasing risk of death with increasing severity of bleeding (minor less than major less than life-threatening; P for trend = 0.0009). A similar association was evident between major bleeding and ischemic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke.

- **Conclusions**: In ACS patients, the occurrence of major bleeding is associated with a significantly increased risk of both short-term and long-term mortality, as well as an elevated risk of ischemic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. The severity of bleeding correlates with increased mortality risk.

### Non-major bleeding with apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111DJgke]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

We describe the incidence, location, and management of non-major bleeding and assess the association between non-major bleeding and clinical outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving anticoagulation therapy enrolled in Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE).

- **Methods**: We included patients who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug (n = 18,140). Non-major bleeding was defined as the first bleeding event considered to be clinically relevant non-major (CRNM) or minor bleeding, not preceded by a major bleeding event.

- **Results**: Non-major bleeding was three times more common than major bleeding (12.1% vs. 3.8%). Like major bleeding, non-major bleeding was less frequent with apixaban (6.4 per 100 patient-years) than with warfarin (9.4 per 100 patient-years) (adjusted HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.75). The most frequent sites of non-major bleeding were haematuria (16.4%), epistaxis (14.8%), gastrointestinal (13.3%), haematoma (11.5%), and bruising/ecchymosis (10.1%). Medical or surgical intervention rates were similar among patients with non-major bleeding on warfarin versus apixaban (24.7% vs. 24.5%). A change in antithrombotic therapy (58.6% vs. 50.0%) and permanent study drug discontinuation (5.1% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.10) was numerically higher with warfarin than with apixaban. CRNM bleeding was independently associated with an increased risk of overall death (adjusted HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.18) and subsequent major bleeding (adjusted HR 2.18, 95% CI 1.56 to 3.04).

In ARISTOTLE, non-major bleeding was a significant factor to consider.
