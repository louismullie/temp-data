## Question

A 45-year-old woman presents with a 3-day history of painful swelling of her left leg. Duplex ultrasound confirms an extensive iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Due to severe symptoms and low bleeding risk, she undergoes successful catheter-directed thrombolysis with stent placement. The interventional radiologist asks you, as the admitting physician, about the next steps in her management regarding anticoagulation.

According to current ESVS guidelines, what is the recommended approach to anticoagulation in this patient following early thrombus removal with stenting, and how should the duration of anticoagulation be determined?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended approach to anticoagulation after catheter-directed thrombolysis with stenting for extensive iliofemoral DVT, including how to choose the anticoagulant and how long to treat. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guideline anchor, which is the ESVS 2021 guidance on anticoagulation after early thrombus removal. Then, I should verify how to translate "duration at least as long as anticoagulation alone" into a practical plan based on whether the DVT was provoked or unprovoked. Next, I will review peri-procedural and early post-procedural anticoagulation choices, including the role of LMWH and DOACs. After that, I should consider whether to add antiplatelet therapy and for how long. Finally, I will integrate surveillance and follow-up imaging to guide duration decisions and summarize a clear, actionable recommendation with caveats and exceptions.

> Let me first confirm the core principle from ESVS 2021, because that will anchor everything else. The ESVS explicitly recommends initiating anticoagulation after early thrombus removal, with or without stenting, and states the duration should be at least as long as if the patient were treated with anticoagulation alone, with the exact choice and duration left to the treating physician's judgment, which means I should not assume a fixed short course just because a stent was placed [^f41f3976] [^a193ba4a].

> Wait, let me verify how to translate "at least as long as anticoagulation alone" into a concrete plan. For provoked proximal DVT with a major transient risk factor, standard duration is 3 months, whereas for unprovoked proximal DVT, extended anticoagulation beyond 3 months is recommended if bleeding risk is low or moderate, with periodic reassessment of bleeding risk, so in this case I should treat for at least 3 months and then extend if the event was unprovoked and bleeding risk remains acceptable [^9089e775] [^c93e562b] [^8e4c8e68].

> I need to check the peri-procedural and early post-procedural anticoagulation strategy, because timing and agent choice matter for stent patency and bleeding risk. Multiple high-credibility sources advise prompt, fully therapeutic anticoagulation without delay, and favor LMWH in the early post-procedural period for its predictable pharmacokinetics and anti-inflammatory properties, with transition to a DOAC or VKA thereafter; DOACs are reasonable once hemostasis is secure, but LMWH for the first 2–6 weeks is a common approach after stenting in acute DVT [^5d7dfee7] [^933cb5b6] [^98996a3f] [^fc280fa1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adding antiplatelet therapy. I initially thought dual antiplatelet therapy might be indicated after venous stenting, but wait, I should double-check the evidence base. The ESVS guideline does not mandate antiplatelet therapy after early thrombus removal with stenting, and contemporary interventional society guidance emphasizes anticoagulation as primary therapy; antiplatelet therapy may be considered selectively in higher-risk scenarios or when a poor anatomic result or immediate restenosis is present, but routine dual therapy is not recommended, so I should individualize and avoid blanket antiplatelet use here [^f41f3976] [^933cb5b6] [^fc280fa1].

> Next, I should review surveillance and how it informs duration decisions, because residual obstruction or abnormal D-dimer can shift risk and treatment length. ESVS suggests using repeat whole-leg ultrasound at the end of anticoagulation to establish a new baseline and considering residual vein obstruction and/or D-dimer to guide decisions about extended therapy, which means I should plan imaging at 3 months and, if anticoagulation is stopped, consider D-dimer testing to stratify recurrence risk and revisit the need for extension [^beacbdfd] [^1efa001a].

> Let me synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and make sure it aligns with the evidence. Immediately post-procedure, continue fully therapeutic anticoagulation without interruption, preferably with LMWH for the first 2–6 weeks given stent placement and acute DVT, then transition to a DOAC or VKA based on renal function, drug interactions, and patient preference. Treat for at least 3 months total, and if the DVT was unprovoked and bleeding risk remains low or moderate, extend anticoagulation beyond 3 months with periodic reassessment. Avoid routine antiplatelet therapy unless there is a compelling individualized indication. And arrange follow-up imaging at 3 months to document patency and guide whether to stop or extend therapy [^98996a3f] [^fc280fa1] [^c93e562b] [^beacbdfd].

> But wait, what if the patient had a clearly provoked DVT from a major transient risk factor like surgery or estrogen exposure; could I stop at 3 months without exception? I should confirm that ESVS still allows consideration of extension even in provoked cases in selected patients after reassessing thrombotic and bleeding risks, so while 3 months is the default, a longer course may be reasonable if risk markers suggest higher recurrence propensity, which I should discuss explicitly with the patient [^notfound].

> Finally, I should ensure the long-term surveillance plan is explicit. Maintain clinical follow-up to confirm sustained symptom relief, watch for bleeding, and monitor for recurrent symptoms. If anticoagulation is discontinued, consider D-dimer testing to refine recurrence risk and be ready to resume or extend therapy if risk emerges, keeping the shared decision-making process dynamic over time [^1efa001a] [^8e4c8e68].

---

Per ESVS 2021, after successful catheter-directed thrombolysis with stenting for extensive iliofemoral DVT, **anticoagulation should be initiated immediately** and continued for at least as long as in patients managed with anticoagulation alone, typically 3–6 months, with extension for unprovoked events or persistent risk factors [^f41f3976] [^c93e562b]. DOACs are preferred unless contraindicated; if a DOAC is not suitable, use LMWH or VKA with INR monitoring. Routine antiplatelet therapy is not recommended unless there is another indication [^fc280fa1]. Reassess bleeding and thrombotic risk at 3 months to guide duration, and consider indefinite anticoagulation for unprovoked DVT with low bleeding risk [^c93e562b] [^6081e4ae].

---

## Immediate post-procedural anticoagulation

- **Initiate immediately**: Start anticoagulation promptly after the procedure to prevent rethrombosis and maintain stent patency [^5d7dfee7].

- **Preferred agents**: DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) are first-line unless contraindicated (e.g. severe renal impairment, pregnancy, drug interactions) [^fc280fa1].

- **Alternatives**: If DOACs are unsuitable, use LMWH or VKA with INR monitoring [^fc280fa1].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation

The duration is **guided by the underlying DVT risk profile**, not by the fact that thrombolysis and stenting were performed:

| **Dvt risk category** | **Recommended duration** |
|-|-|
| Provoked (major transient risk factor) | 3 months [^9089e775] |
| Unprovoked or minor transient risk factor | ≥ 6 months; consider indefinite if low bleeding risk [^c93e562b] [^6081e4ae] |
| Active cancer | Indefinite anticoagulation [^notfound] |

---

ESVS advises that the duration after early thrombus removal should be **at least as long as with anticoagulation alone**, with individualized decisions based on bleeding and thrombotic risk [^f41f3976] [^a193ba4a].

---

## Role of antiplatelet therapy

Routine antiplatelet therapy is **not recommended** after venous stenting unless there is another indication (e.g. concurrent arterial disease). Evidence is limited and mixed; reserve antiplatelets for selected cases with high thrombotic risk or suboptimal stent deployment [^fc280fa1] [^e57bf17a].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Clinical follow-up**: Reassess at 3 months to review bleeding and thrombotic risk and decide on continuation [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Consider duplex ultrasound at 3–6 months to assess stent patency and residual thrombus, especially if symptoms persist or recurrence is suspected [^notfound].

- **Indefinite anticoagulation**: Consider for unprovoked DVT with low bleeding risk or persistent risk factors (e.g. thrombophilia, ongoing compression) [^c93e562b] [^6081e4ae].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Immediate anticoagulation**: Start immediately post-procedure.

- **Agent selection**: Prefer DOACs; use LMWH or VKA if contraindicated.

- **Duration**: At least 3–6 months, individualized to provocation status and risk; extend or consider indefinite for unprovoked DVT with low bleeding risk.

- **Antiplatelets**: Not routine; use selectively if indicated.

- **Follow-up**: Reassess at 3 months; consider imaging and adjust therapy accordingly.

---

This approach aligns with ESVS 2021 and balances thrombosis prevention with bleeding risk, ensuring **individualized care** after thrombolysis and stenting for extensive iliofemoral DVT.

Early thrombus removal strategies — We recommend that patients managed with early thrombus removal be treated with a standard course of conventional anticoagulation after the procedure (Grade 1A). Strategies of early thrombus removal should be considered an adjunct rather than an alternative to conventional anticoagulation for acute iliofemoral DVT. Successful thrombus removal should be followed by a standard course of anticoagulation with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin, followed by oral anticoagulants administered for a duration guided by the patient's underlying risk factors. Although the duration of anticoagulation is generally determined by underlying thrombotic risk factors, the optimal duration of anticoagulation after the placement of venous stents in the setting of early thrombus removal has not been adequately studied, and no evidence-based recommendations can be provided. Factors associated with stent thrombosis have included thrombophilia and evidence of extrinsic compression.

Society clinical practice guidelines — endovascular management of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) describe the following positions: The National Institute of Healthcare Excellence advises to "Consider catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy for people with symptomatic iliofemoral DVT who present with the following: symptoms lasting < 14 d; good functional status; a life expectancy of ≥ 1 y; and a low risk of bleeding", and further notes procedure use "should only be used with special arrangements for clinical governance, consent, and audit or research", with distal DVT use "only be used in the context of research". The American Society of Hematology states its panel "suggests anticoagulation therapy alone over thrombolytic therapy", that thrombolysis "is reasonable to consider" for limb‑threatening DVT or selected younger low‑bleeding‑risk iliofemoral DVT, and "suggests using catheter-directed thrombolysis over systemic thrombolysis". The European Society of Vascular Surgery advises that in selected symptomatic iliofemoral DVT, early thrombus removal "should be considered (Class IIa, Level A)", is "not recommended (Class III, Level B)" for femoral/popliteal/calf DVT, and after early removal "it is recommended that the duration of anticoagulation should be at least as long as if the patients were treated by anticoagulation alone… (Class I, Level C)". The American College of Chest Physicians states that in acute DVT of the leg, "anticoagulant therapy alone is suggested over interventional… therapy", while noting that in very severe, limb‑threatening DVT "the benefits of more rapid thrombus resolution may outweigh the risk of harm".

Chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction — anticoagulant therapy after iliac vein stent placement is recommended for at least several months in most patients with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/post‑thrombotic syndrome (PTS) but may not be needed for most with nonthrombotic disease (Level of Evidence D, Strength of Recommendation Moderate). Decisions on post‑stent anticoagulation should be individualized, and patients with a poor anatomic result, ongoing risk factors for DVT recurrence, or unprovoked DVT should continue anticoagulation; patients being treated for anatomically extensive venous obstruction may benefit from more aggressive antithrombotic therapy, especially during the early postoperative period, based on observational patency data suggesting higher risk of patency loss in those with prior venous thrombosis.

SAFETY OUTCOME ASSESSMENT

Safety reporting is commonly focused on the requirements of applicable regulatory bodies. However, studies should also strive to report safety outcomes in a manner that reflects the scientific and clinical conventions for the applicable disease area, ideally with the use of society-endorsed standardized definitions and reporting guidelines that can enable meaningful comparisons across studies. Advance consideration should be given to prespecifying, defining, and reporting the full range of safety events that may be expected to occur with a particular intervention. When no events occurred, this fact should be explicitly stated in reporting results. Given the variability in devices and treatments, the duration of follow-up may vary; in general, longer follow-up should be considered for devices that are intended for long-term implantation.

Any venous interventional procedure may be complicated by the development of thrombosis or bleeding. Symptomatic thrombosis can manifest as DVT, PE, both, or neither. DVT can be limited to a treated vein segment or can extend to involve additional segments and can lead to PE, PTS, or neither; PE can lead to right heart strain, hemodynamic compromise, death, or none of these consequences. Blood loss can be overt or occult and can result from device-related aspiration, device-related hemolysis, venous access site hemorrhage, vascular perforation or rupture, or development of a distant site of bleeding; concomitant anticoagulant and fibrinolytic drugs can contribute to the onset and severity of these events. Some bleeding events require blood transfusion or surgical or endovascular therapy to address. In reporting events, such details should be provided to enable their overall clinical impact to be discerned. To enable standardization of event reporting, guidelines have been developed by the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, the GUSTO (Global Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) investigators, and the Society of Interventional Radiology, among other bodies. – The International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis scheme may be particularly applicable to VTE populations.

Safety events can be related to a specific device (eg, fracture of a stent), an overall endovascular treatment (eg, thrombosis of a venous segment treated with pharmacomechanical CDT followed by stent placement), associated treatments that were mandated by the protocol (eg, gastrointestinal bleed in a patient who was placed on antiplatelet therapy after stent placement), standard care (eg, subdural hematoma in a patient receiving anticoagulation for preexisting DVT), or none of these. Therefore, in reporting treatment-related events, investigators should provide the specific definition of relatedness that was used.

### Role of venous stenting for venous thromboembolism [^d30e9ea1]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2020). Medium credibility.

Endovenous stenting has emerged as the method of choice to treat iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction. It is used in patients with established postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) after previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) to reduce symptoms of chronic pain and swelling and to aid ulcer healing in severe cases. Venous stenting is used to alleviate symptoms of obstruction in patients presenting with acute DVT, with the aim of preventing development of PTS. There is a low risk of morbidity and mortality associated with the use of endovenous stenting, and although significant advances have been made, particularly improvements in stent design for use in the venous circulation, data are lacking on beneficial long-term outcomes. Unmet research needs include optimal patient selection, anticoagulant choice and duration, best practice for postoperative surveillance, and use of validated assessment tools to measure outcomes. In this article, I address the potential benefits, as well as the challenges, of endovenous stenting.

### Iliofemoral venous thrombosis [^6a9b4f8a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is associated with serious short- and long-term physical, social, and economic sequelae for patients. Most physicians treat patients with acute iliofemoral DVT in the same manner as they treat all acute DVT patients: with anticoagulation alone. Yet a growing body of evidence suggests that, in this subset of DVT patients, a treatment strategy that includes thrombus removal plus optimal anticoagulation significantly improves outcomes. This article reviews the evidence supporting this strategy and discusses current and promising techniques of thrombus removal, including contemporary venous thrombectomy, intrathrombus catheter-directed thrombolysis, and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis.

Table II
Risk factors for iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IFDVT) in patients with no acute illness/trauma

Intervention was performed in 36 of the 49 patients (73.5%) in the primary group. The specific procedures performed are listed in Table III. Of note, stent insertion was only performed in 14 of the 36 interventions (39%). On completion venography after intervention, thrombosis resolution was reported to be complete in 68% of patients, > 70% in 16%, and < 70% in 16%. Primary and secondary patency in the 14 patients who underwent stenting was 62% and 91% at 3 years, respectively.

Table III
Treatments performed for acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IFDVT)

All patients were treated with anticoagulation initially after diagnosis of IFDVT, although the type and duration of anticoagulation was variable. All patients received anticoagulation for at least 3 months. In five patients, we were not able to accurately determine the duration of anticoagulation use. Long-term anticoagulation was recommended in 26 patients and was confirmed for at least 1 year after DVT. In 18 patients (37%), anticoagulation was discontinued between 3 and 12 months after the thrombotic event with the specific duration noted in Table IV. As noted in Table IV, enoxaparin was the most prescribed anticoagulant at the time of hospital or emergency room discharge, but direct oral anticoagulants were prescribed as initial therapy in one-third of patients. Patients initially treated with enoxaparin were transitioned to oral therapy, usually within 1 month of their DVT event.

Table IV
Anticoagulation use and duration for treatment of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (IFDVT)

One year after IFDVT, over one-third of patients (34.1%) reported moderate or severe post-thrombotic symptoms (Table V). Recurrent IFDVT occurred in 18% of patients at 1 year and 26% at 3 years after IFDVT. Development of moderate/severe PTS based on treatment method is listed in Table VI. Although there were fewer patients who developed significant PTS symptoms after intervention with stenting, statistical analysis of the data is not possible due to the limited sample size.

### Endovascular treatment of lower limb acute DVT: current trends and future directions [^c796408f]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremities is a prevalent vascular disorder characterized by the sudden formation of blood clots within the deep veins, often associated with significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Acute DVT refers to the presence of symptoms for less than 14 days or for which imaging studies indicate that thrombosis occurred within the previous 14 days. Prompt and effective management of acute DVT is imperative to prevent potential life-threatening complications, such as pulmonary embolism and the development of post-thrombotic syndrome. Historically, anticoagulation therapy has been the primary approach for the treatment of acute DVT, aiming to halt clot propagation and reduce the risk of embolization. However, advancements in endovascular techniques have introduced new possibilities for the rapid and targeted treatment of acute DVT.

European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) and the American Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), emphasizing a comprehensive approach to management. Current recommendations advocate for a combination of anticoagulation therapy, thrombolysis, and mechanical thrombectomy depending on the severity and location of the thrombus. Anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) remains the cornerstone of initial therapy to prevent clot extension and embolization. In cases of extensive or severe DVT, especially involving the iliofemoral veins, endovascular techniques such as catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) may be considered to expedite thrombus resolution and reduce long-term complications such as post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and recurrent thrombosis (ESVS, SIR).

Pediatric and younger adolescent ETR — For children and younger adolescents with acute iliofemoral DVT, ETR should not be routinely performed but should be limited to patients with compelling clinical indications such as acute limb threat or unacceptably high PE risk from rapid DVT progression on anticoagulation (Level of Evidence D, Strength of Recommendation Weak). In children and adolescents with DVT, close collaboration with a pediatrician to define optimal care is suggested, with strong consideration for pediatric hematology consultation; when considering aggressive therapies, the availability of suitable monitoring facilities/experience and local expertise with systemic thrombolysis and pediatric catheter interventions should be weighed; if ETR is performed in children who are of less than adult size, efforts to minimize trauma to the venous system should be made and stent placement should usually be avoided; and continued clinical follow-up is important to reduce the risk of recurrent DVT and to evaluate for PTS in early adulthood.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^918ff771]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Society for Vascular Surgery and American Venous Forum guideline — Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are presented using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, incorporating the strength of the recommendations (strong: 1; weak: 2) and the level of evidence (A to C). Early thrombus removal strategies include catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy. The authors recommend against routine use of the term "proximal venous thrombosis" in favor of more precise characterization involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous segments (Grade 1A). They further suggest the use of early thrombus removal strategies in ambulatory patients with good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT of < 14 days in duration (Grade 2C) and strongly recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade 1A). They also suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are available and that surgical thrombectomy or open surgical or endovascular thrombectomy therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C). Most data are noted to be of low quality but suggest patient-important benefits with respect to reducing postthrombotic morbidity.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) with venous stenting in acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — registry outcomes show that in a 473 patient multicenter cohort, patients receiving venous stents had 73% 1-year patency versus 54% without stents.

Antithrombotic therapy after iliofemoral venous stent placement — population-specific considerations are highlighted: Clinical practice continues to exhibit substantial variability in the use of antithrombotic therapy following iliofemoral venous stent placement. Populations undergoing endovascular therapy tend to be substantially younger than those in traditional DVT anticoagulation studies, and midterm stent patency rates clearly show room for improvement in patients with postthrombotic syndrome (PTS); hence, individualized assessment of risk and benefit will often favor longer and more intense antithrombotic therapy in stented patients with PTS, especially during the early weeks and months after the procedure. For nonthrombotic iliac vein lesions (NIVLs), stent patency rates have been extremely high, and the available literature does not support the use of routine antithrombotic therapy.

Guideline 8.3 — primary prevention for acute DVT treatment: As post-thrombotic syndrome is a common preceding event for venous leg ulcers, we recommend current evidence-based therapies for acute DVT treatment. [GRADE - 1; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] We suggest use of low-molecular-weight heparin over vitamin K antagonist therapy of 3-month duration to decrease post-thrombotic syndrome.

[GRADE - 2; LEVEL OF EVIDENCE - B] First, rapid parenteral anticoagulation with either low-molecular-weight heparin or fondaparinux is indicated over intravenous unfractionated heparin (Grade 1A), as this may increase DVT recanalization. Second, early use of compression is recommended, generally within 24 hours of diagnosis (Grade 2C). Third, early ambulation and limiting of bed rest are recommended.

Endovascular DVT therapy has historically been directed at patients with the most extensive DVT. As evidence has been developed to support the use of catheter-directed thrombolysis for iliofemoral DVT, interventional radiologists are increasingly being referred patients with DVT that is anatomically less severe. In this article, we outline the key considerations that should be weighed in determining whether or not to provide aggressive therapy to patients with DVT limited to the femoropopliteal veins.

CDT/PCDT for nonelderly, symptomatic patients: For nonelderly patients with initially presenting acute iliofemoral DVT, nonthreatened limbs, good pre-DVT functional status, moderate-to-severe symptoms, and low risk of bleeding, adjunctive CDT/PCDT should be strongly considered as part of the first-line treatment approach with anticoagulant therapy to enhance relief of presenting symptoms, reduce PTS severity, and improve health-related QoL (Level of Evidence B, Strength of Recommendation Moderate); decisions vary by patient factors and preferences, and for many patients a 3- to 7-day trial of anticoagulation may be reasonable before determining whether to perform CDT/PCDT; discussions should convey the likelihood of short-term (≤ 6 months) symptom/QoL benefits with moderate uncertainty about long-term QoL benefits; younger patients with severe presenting symptoms may be most likely to benefit, whereas patients aged ≥ 65 years are less likely to benefit and more likely to be harmed by CDT/PCDT compared with younger patients.

Acute deep venous thrombosis — systemic thrombolysis outcomes and recommendation are summarized as follows: Conventional anticoagulation is reported as "effective, with major hemorrhage in 2% of patients and 3-month recurrence rates as low as 5.5%", yet long-term postthrombotic morbidity persists, with "Among 355 patients with a first episode of DVT, the cumulative incidence of any and severe postthrombotic syndrome at 5 years was 28% and 9.3%, respectively". Routine systemic thrombolysis showed only modest efficacy and increased bleeding, with "a pooled analysis of six randomized trials" in which "streptokinase was 3.7 times more likely than heparin to produce 'greater than minimal' thrombolysis, although at the expense of a 2.9-fold increase in major bleeding complications", and "complete thrombolysis in as few as 8.9% and no thrombus reduction in as many as 33.8% of patients treated with systemic tissue plasminogen activator". Accordingly, the guideline states, "We recommend against the use of non–catheter-directed, systemically administered thrombolytic agents for the treatment of iliofemoral thrombosis".

### Antithrombotic management of patients with deep vein thrombosis and venous stents: an international registry [^63d6f4c6]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) treated with catheter-based thrombolysis and venous stenting, poststenting anticoagulant management is uncertain.

Objectives

To determine the type and duration of antithrombotic therapy used in patients who have received venous stents for treatment of acute lower extremity DVT.

Methods

We created an international registry of patients with leg DVT from 2005 to 2019 who received venous stents as part of their acute management. We collected data on baseline clinical characteristics and pre-venous and post-venous stent antithrombotic therapy.

Results

We studied 173 patients with venous stents: 101 (58%) were aged ≤ 50 years, 105 (61%) were female, and 128 (74%) had risk factors for thrombotic disease. DVT was iliofemoral in 150 (87%) patients, and catheter-based treatment was given within 7 days of diagnosis in 92 (53%) patients. After venous stenting, 109 (63%) patients received anticoagulant-only therapy with a direct oral anticoagulant (29%), warfarin (22%), or low-molecular-weight heparin (10%), and 59 (34%) received anticoagulant-antiplatelet therapy. In patients taking anticoagulant-only therapy, 29% received indefinite treatment; in patients on anticoagulant-antiplatelet therapy, 19% received indefinite treatment. Factors associated with combined anticoagulant-antiplatelet therapy vs anticoagulant-only therapy were use of thrombolytic, thrombectomy, and aspiration interventions (odds ratio [OR], 5.11; 95% CI, 1.45–18.05); use of balloon angioplasty (OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 1.20–5.76); and immediate stent restenosis (OR, 7.2; 95% CI, 1.45–5.89).

Conclusion

Anticoagulant therapy without concomitant antiplatelet therapy appears to be the most common antithrombotic strategy in patients with DVT and venous stenting. More research is needed to determine outcomes of venous stenting in relation to antithrombotic therapy.

Surveillance and perioperative care

Appropriate compression should be applied at the end of the procedure before leaving the operating room/interventional suite (typically bandaging for the first few hours before transitioning to stockings). Anticoagulation should be continued immediately postoperatively. The patient should be encouraged to walk as soon as hemostasis at the access site is considered safe, typically 3–6 hours postoperatively. Before discharge a duplex ultrasound imaging can identify early failures and need for reintervention. Patient should also have a defined anticoagulation plan consistent with the underlying DVT reason and the risk of recurrence, the complexity of the reconstruction (eg, stent extension into the common femoral vein), and current guidelines. For those who ended up with a stented iliofemoral segment, low-molecular-weight heparin for 2–6 weeks is preferred, due to its anti-inflammatory effects, before initiation of oral anticoagulants. An antiplatelet agent for 6 months or indefinitely depending on the patient's risk profile can be considered. Appropriate referral to hematology is warranted in patients with an unprovoked DVT or possible thrombophilia. A follow-up office visit is suggested at 2–4 weeks, at 3, 6, and 12 months, and annually thereafter with duplex ultrasound imaging. Although there are no defined duplex criteria to trigger advanced imaging and reintervention, the combination of peak flow velocity (PFV) and analysis of the Doppler flow pattern at the stent inlet, along with in-stent velocity measurements (eg, ratio of in-stent to stent inlet PFV > 3.5 or PFV in the stent > 44 cm/s indicating > 50% stenosis), can potentially diagnose a failing stent. 57,59 Cross-sectional imaging can be occasionally needed in complex iliocaval reconstructions and when stents have been extended below the inguinal ligament to evaluate their integrity and restenosis.

GENERAL STUDY DESCRIPTION AND DESIGN

In considering published studies that have evaluated endovascular venous therapies, the panel observed a number of common reporting issues that have clouded interpretation of study results. The panel recognized that because studies vary greatly in intent, scope, design, and resourcing, each study cannot be expected to fulfill every optimal design specification or best practice. However, investigators must still clearly delineate the methodological design that was used, indicate how the study was actually performed, draw scientifically valid inferences, summarize the findings in ways that encourage appropriate interpretation by clinicians, and be fully forthcoming about limitations and alternative interpretations. The panel's recommendations in this section are aimed at ensuring that future studies avoid the reporting issues noted below.

Incomplete Description of Study Populations

For venous clinical practice to be informed by evidence from a clinical study, it must be reported in a manner that enables clear discernment of what study population was evaluated, facilitating comparison with other studies. Key elements that may influence treatment responses, complication rates, and the comparability of venous cohorts are summarized here.

First, the chronicity of the disease must be reported. At present, there is no widely available, inexpensive, and reliable blood test or noninvasive imaging method that can precisely date thrombus formation or the onset of other relevant pathological processes. The composition of intraluminal material, the inflammatory response to thrombosis (which may influence clinical presentation), the nature of standard therapy, and expectations for clinical change evolve substantially over time following the inciting event. Hence, notwithstanding its limitations, the duration of time since venous symptom onset remains a useful parameter in trial reporting. To date, published guidelines and randomized clinical trials have considered acute DVT as being associated with symptom duration of < 14 to 21 days. The Society of Interventional Radiology Reporting Guidelines have considered subacute DVT and chronic DVT as being associated with symptom durations of 15 to 30 days and > 30 days, respectively, but the actual use of these terms has varied significantly in the published literature. These definitions were largely derived from observations about the amenability of thrombus to dissolution or removal with fibrinolytic drugs and early thrombectomy devices. However, the progress of thrombus organization, inflammation, and fibrosis vary among patients; many patients have thrombus of mixed age; and new devices may be designed to treat a broader range of patients. Hence, to ensure clear description of study populations, investigators should specify the allowed duration of symptoms rather than relying on descriptive labels like acute, subacute, and chronic.

### Acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis in adolescents and young adults is associated with hypercoagulable States and a significant incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome [^a20d1f87]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

In our population, similar to a report from Warad et al, patients were managed by a variety of clinicians from different specialties and over a time period in which treatment options were changing. Some patients and families preferred a conservative approach with anticoagulation alone, whereas others chose to proceed with intervention, which could include tissue plasminogen activator or mechanical thrombectomy alone, thrombectomy with angioplasty, or also with stent placement. Given the limited number of patients in the study cohort, conclusive evidence on the relative benefit of the methods of intervention cannot be provided. Although there was a suggestion that patients who did receive stents for significant iliac obstruction had a lower rate of significant PTS at 1 year, this finding did not reach statistical significance and would need to be confirmed in a larger patient population.

Treatment with anticoagulation after diagnosis of IFDVT or intervention for DVT was variable and depended on numerous factors including the patient's prior history of VTE, the presence of hypercoagulable risk factors, and physician preference. This likely reflects national practice patterns for young patients with IFDVT. Because patients may be treated by pediatricians, hematologists, vascular specialists, hospitalists, or other specialties, it is not surprising that treatment protocols are poorly standardized. The most common initial anticoagulant prescribed at the time of hospital or emergency facility discharge was enoxaparin, but the duration of treatment with this and the secondary anticoagulant prescribed after enoxaparin use varied widely. There is insufficient evidence available from this review to assess the effect of specific anticoagulation strategies on patient outcomes. However, we do believe that establishing standard intersocietal treatment recommendations for anticoagulation in young patients presenting with acute proximal DVT would be a step forward that would likely improve treatment outcomes.

Several limitations exist for our study as it is a retrospective case series review with a limited number of patients. Our data was collected over the timeframe of 2014 to 2022, during which endovascular venous intervention for VTE was undergoing significant evolution. Our data is also dependent on the specificity and details within the electronic medical record and was not complete in all cases. We were also limited in our statistical analysis and ability to draw conclusions due to the small number of patients. However, this case series is, to our knowledge, larger than any other published series of young patients with IFDVT, so hopefully the findings will stimulate further investigation in this understudied patient population.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^d681efa6]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The anticoagulant treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) has been historically directed toward the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism. However, such treatment imperfectly protects against late manifestations of the postthrombotic syndrome. By restoring venous patency and preserving valvular function, early thrombus removal strategies can potentially decrease postthrombotic morbidity.

Objective

A committee of experts in venous disease was charged by the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum to develop evidence-based practice guidelines for early thrombus removal strategies, including catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, and surgical thrombectomy.

Methods

Evidence-based recommendations are based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relevant literature, supplemented when necessary by less rigorous data. Recommendations are made according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, incorporating the strength of the recommendation (strong: 1; weak: 2) and an evaluation of the level of the evidence (A to C).

Results

On the basis of the best evidence currently available, we recommend against routine use of the term "proximal venous thrombosis" in favor of more precise characterization of thrombi as involving the iliofemoral or femoropopliteal venous segments (Grade 1A). We further suggest the use of early thrombus removal strategies in ambulatory patients with good functional capacity and a first episode of iliofemoral DVT of < 14 days in duration (Grade 2C) and strongly recommend their use in patients with limb-threatening ischemia due to iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction (Grade 1A). We suggest pharmacomechanical strategies over catheter-directed pharmacologic thrombolysis alone if resources are available and that surgical thrombectomy be considered if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated (Grade 2C).

Conclusions

Most data regarding early thrombus removal strategies are of low quality but do suggest patient-important benefits with respect to reducing postthrombotic morbidity. We anticipate revision of these guidelines as additional evidence becomes available.

Consensus-Based Statements 18 to 25

18 For patients with acute iliofemoral DVT, we strongly encourage the design and conduct of multicenter randomized trials of venous thrombectomy. Remark: Patients with acute iliofemoral DVT experience more severe presenting symptoms, more frequent recurrent DVT and PTS, and more severe PTS than other patients with DVT and appear to have the strongest potential to benefit from endovascular therapy. A randomized trial using standardized device/procedure protocol and assessment of both short-term (eg, early symptom relief) and long-term (eg, PTS severity) outcomes is most capable of credibly demonstrating any clinical benefit over conservative therapy alone.
19 For studies of endovascular intervention for acute lower extremity DVT, the population description should include (1) characteristics of the index DVT — whether it was associated with presenting symptoms, PE, or a temporary provoking risk factor; (2) symptom duration, DVT history, and other indicators of DVT chronicity; (3) the most cephalad anatomic extent of the DVT, using accepted definitions; and (4) whether the study includes patients with initially presenting DVT, early treatment failure (eg, progression of symptoms or thrombus extent), or acute limb-threatening circulatory compromise. Remark: patients with DVT with only temporary provoking risk factors are at lower risk for recurrence than patients with chronic provoking risk factors or unprovoked DVT. Per guidelines of the Society of Interventional Radiology and the American Heart Association, iliofemoral DVT should be used for DVT that involves the iliac vein or common femoral vein, with or without the involvement of other deep veins. Femoral-popliteal DVT should be used for femoral or popliteal DVT that does not extend into the common femoral vein or more cephalad veins.
20 For studies of acute lower extremity DVT, the protocol and statistical analysis plan should prespecify the type of thrombus removal techniques used in the study, with particular reference to whether the study will assess stand-alone use of the device, its use along with fibrinolytic drug therapy, and its use along with other treatment methods. Any use of fibrinolytic drugs, the route of administration (eg, systemic or catheter directed), the sequence of use (eg, thrombectomy device first, drug first, simultaneous), the drug dosing scheme, and use of other thrombus removal methods should be reported to enable a clear understanding of the treatment delivered.
21 In studies evaluating thrombectomy for acute lower extremity DVT, we suggest early patient follow-up at ≈7 to 10 days, 1 month, and 6 months to evaluate adverse events, early anatomic efficacy, and early clinical efficacy. To evaluate long-term clinical efficacy, follow-up of 1 to 2 years is sufficient to identify most cases of incident PTS and may optimize feasibility for many studies. Follow-up of 3 to 5 years, however, will enable the most definitive assessment of the PTS, the need for reintervention, and severe clinical manifestations (eg, ulcers).
22 For acute lower extremity DVT treatments, demonstration of early clinical efficacy at 1 to 6 months compared with nonintervened controls can justify the use of a device/intervention in clinical practice provided the safety profile is appropriate and should include the demonstration of (1) early anatomic efficacy that supports the attribution of treatment effects to the intervention and (2) improvement in patient-centered sequelae of venous disease (eg, limb pain, ambulatory/functional capacity, and QOL) or objective clinical signs of venous disease (eg, swelling by measurement of limb circumference/volume), compared with a control group. Remark: although studies to date have focused on prevention of PTS, many patients with acute iliofemoral DVT experience severe symptoms, functional impairment, and poor QOL during the early weeks and months. Independent of PTS reduction, acceleration of early clinical recovery from acute DVT would be worthwhile if achievable with acceptable safety. A control comparator is needed because the natural history of nonintervened (conservatively treated) acute DVT includes early clinical improvement that extends over the first year.
23 For acute lower extremity DVT treatments, the primary assessment of early anatomic efficacy of the device/intervention should occur at least 1 month after use to enable confidence in both its immediate anatomic efficacy and the degree to which this is sustained beyond the initial use. Remark: the medium-to-large bore venous access and catheter/device manipulations needed for venous thrombectomy may influence the risk of early rethrombosis after intervention. More aggressive interventions may demonstrate enhanced thrombus removal efficacy, while conversely increasing the risk of rethrombosis. Clinical trials have found the status of the venous system 1 to 6 months after DVT treatment initiation to correlate with 2-year outcomes. Hence, demonstration of success should require sustained patency for at least the first month.
24 For a thrombectomy device to demonstrate immediate anatomic efficacy, demonstration of thrombus volume reduction by independent blinded assessment of venograms performed before and after the intervention, ideally using established assessment scales, is acceptable. For stand-alone device use to be considered effective, the posttreatment venogram must be performed before the use of other interventions that can influence thrombus removal or patency. Remark: fibrinolytic drugs can dissolve venous thrombus, and venous angioplasty and stent placement can help restore venous patency. As such, when possible, studies should be designed to avoid confounding with the effects of venous thrombectomy devices.
25 In acute lower extremity DVT thrombectomy studies, particular attention should be paid to risks of bleeding (device-related blood loss, access site bleeding, and distant bleeding), PE, early rethrombosis, vascular injury, bradycardia, renal failure, and any additional risks that stem from the nature and mechanism of action of any specific device that is used.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on the endovascular management of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis [^5d7dfee7]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Anticoagulation for acute iliofemoral DVT — timing and selection: Prompt achievement and maintenance of fully therapeutic anticoagulation are essential for patients with acute iliofemoral DVT unless major contraindications exist (Level of Evidence A, Strength of Recommendation Strong), and consideration of ETR should not be permitted to delay the rapid achievement of fully therapeutic anticoagulation; weight-based, twice-daily, subcutaneously injected LMWH for most ETR candidates is suggested because it achieves therapeutic levels faster than intravenous UFH, enables consistent anticoagulation, and the safety of concomitantly using direct-acting oral anticoagulants with fibrinolytic drugs is uncertain; UFH is reasonable for periprocedural use provided therapeutic levels are reached quickly, active monitoring and timely dose adjustments are important, UFH may be maintained at fully therapeutic levels during on-table components and reduced to subtherapeutic levels during fibrinolytic drug infusions, and the patient's individualized risk of bleeding should be carefully considered when calibrating UFH levels.

### The role of thrombolysis in the clinical management of deep vein thrombosis [^7f7cfe21]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2011). Low credibility.

The cornerstones of current management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are the routine use of anticoagulant therapy, graduated elastic compression stockings, and early ambulation. Thrombolytic therapy was previously reserved only for patients with life-, limb-, or organ-threatening complications. However, the postthrombotic syndrome has been increasingly recognized as a frequent and serious long-term complication of DVT. In parallel, endovascular thrombolytic methods have evolved considerably in recent years, prompting discussion and controversy as to whether they should be more liberally used. In some centers, pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis is now routinely used in the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT. Randomized trials are currently under way to determine when the use of pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis is appropriate in patients presenting with acute proximal DVT.

### Management of venous leg ulcers: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery® and the American Venous Forum [^daed83a8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) management for post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) prevention — risk markers and thrombolysis are described as follows: an randomized controlled trial showed that if D-dimer remains elevated after stopping anticoagulation, recurrence risk is significantly elevated (~2.5-fold) and continuation or reinstitution of anticoagulation is recommended, usually for life, whereas if D-dimer is normal, cessation is usually safe. Duplex ultrasonography evidence indicates residual venous abnormalities carry recurrence risks varying from 2.5- to 9.7-fold, and if a patient has an extensively irregular or occluded long venous segment, continued anticoagulation may be beneficial. For iliofemoral DVT, adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis in the CaVeNT trial yielded an absolute risk reduction at 24 months of 14.4% (2%-28%) in PTS reduction, but several occurrences of major bleeding occurred; in properly selected patients, the benefit of catheter-directed thrombolysis outweighs the risks.

### Initial experience with the ambulatory management of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis with May-Thurner syndrome with percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, angioplasty and stenting [^c3c44514]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Our results demonstrate a promising opportunity for the ambulatory management of acute iliofemoral DVT and MTS with percutaneous thrombectomy and stenting. Most clinical practice guidelines began recommending ambulatory management for low-risk DVT starting in 2012. In 2016, these guidelines were updated to additionally recommend OP management for PE. Numerous studies have also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ambulatory DVT management with anticoagulation and catheter-directed thrombolysis. Despite these findings, however, ≥ 67% of low-risk venous thromboembolism patients are still admitted for in-hospital management. Although the present study makes no distinction in treatment costs between the IP and OP thrombectomy groups, one could argue an ambulatory approach to nonemergent DVT management is intuitively cost-effective. The direct costs associated with PMT, angioplasty, and stenting will be the same whether the patient is treated as an IP or OP. However, OP management mitigates the expenditure and cost of vital healthcare resources associated with IP treatment. Nevertheless, we believe sustained outcomes are contingent on a strong patient–physician alliance to ensure optimal anticoagulation and surveillance strategies, as evident by our patients who developed in-stent DVT secondary to subtherapeutic anticoagulation. We also believe consistent availability of DOAC starter packs and comprehensive knowledge of copay assistance programs by the ED staff is essential to the success of our proposed treatment algorithm to ensure patients who are discharged will be immediately compliant with their prescribed regimens.

### Current evidence for endovascular therapies in the management of acute deep vein thrombosis [^50f37940]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), specifically proximal iliofemoral DVT, is a relatively common disorder that can result in a chronic debilitating post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), with a significant effect on a patient's quality of life. Anticoagulation is first-line therapy; however, percutaneous interventions have emerged as treatment options for patients where there is concern that anticoagulation alone will not resolve the DVT as well as prevent PTS. This paper will discuss the existing data on these interventions and review current endovascular techniques, including catheter-directed thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, and large-bore mechanical thrombectomy in the management of DVT.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^bba34ee5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Early thrombus removal strategies — indications: We suggest a strategy of early thrombus removal in selected patients meeting the following criteria (a) a first episode of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis, (b) symptoms < 14 days in duration, (c) a low risk of bleeding, and (d) ambulatory with good functional capacity and an acceptable life expectancy. We recommend early thrombus removal strategies as the treatment of choice in patients with limb-threatening venous ischemia due to iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis with or without associated femoropopliteal venous thrombosis (phlegmasia cerulea dolens). We recommend that patients with isolated femoropopliteal deep venous thrombosis be managed with conventional anticoagulation therapy because there is currently insufficient evidence to support early thrombus removal strategies in this patient population.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on the endovascular management of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis [^933cb5b6]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Society of Interventional Radiology — post-ETR follow-up and anticoagulation: In patients with acute iliofemoral DVT who undergo ETR, a close clinical follow-up should occur to ensure that anticoagulation is fully therapeutic, to monitor for bleeding, to ensure good symptom control, and to enable timely reintervention to restore patency in patients who develop recurrent symptoms (Level of Evidence B, Strength of Recommendation Strong). Randomized trials and other studies have shown that thrombus reformation is frequent after ETR and that long-term benefits are most likely to be realized when patency is maintained; although no large prospective studies have compared antithrombotic therapy strategies after ETR, anticoagulation should be given for at least as long as comparable patients who did not undergo ETR, and, if feasible, strong consideration should be given to the use of LMWH during the weeks immediately following the procedure.

### Endovascular treatment of lower limb acute DVT: current trends and future directions [^6815b115]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Hu G et al. investigation into percutaneous endovenous intervention (PEVI) compared to anticoagulation in acute LE-DVT demonstrated quantifiable reductions in post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and pulmonary embolism (PE) risks, increased venous patency, and a negligible increase in bleeding risk with PEVI. These numerical findings provide concrete evidence supporting the effectiveness and safety of PEVI relative to traditional anticoagulation therapy.

In summary, the incorporation of specific numerical results enriches the discourse on the efficacy and safety of mechanical thrombectomy devices in managing acute DVT. These results not only underscore the immediate and long-term benefits but also highlight the safety profiles associated with different mechanical thrombectomy approaches, offering valuable insights for healthcare professionals and researchers engaged in DVT treatment.
3 Venous stenting (Table 3).

Table 3
Summary of Venous stenting studies

Venous stenting serves as an additional therapy for patients experiencing acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) if residual venous obstruction (RVO) persists after thrombolysis and balloon angioplasty, aiming to restore vein patency and mitigate post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) risks. Evidence suggests a higher incidence of PTS and venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence when balloon angioplasty is solely employed in patients with RVO. To ascertain the lesion's nature, a combination of computed tomography or MR venogram and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is recommended before initiating treatment.

### Early thrombus removal strategies for acute deep venous thrombosis: clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular Surgery and the American Venous Forum [^b1fd2509]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Medium credibility.

Acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis — indications for early thrombus removal (section 2.1): We suggest a strategy of early thrombus removal in selected patients meeting the following criteria: (a) a first episode of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis, (b) symptoms < 14 days in duration, (c) a low risk of bleeding, and (d) ambulatory with good functional capacity and an acceptable life expectancy (Grade 2C). Overall, the quality of evidence supporting early thrombus removal strategies is very low (Grade C). Among patients enrolled in the National Venous Registry, those with chronic symptoms, femoropopliteal DVT, and symptoms > 10 days in duration had significantly worse outcomes than those with a first episode of acute iliofemoral DVT of < 10 days in duration. Other guidelines have suggested that DVT associated with symptoms present for ≤ 14 days be considered acute, and a recently published randomized trial included patients with symptoms of < 21 days. On balance, recommendations for consideration of early thrombus removal strategies in patients with symptoms of < 14 days of duration would seem fairly secure, although a benefit in patients with a duration of symptoms of > 14 days cannot be excluded and the relative benefits vs risks in such patients should be considered on an individualized basis. A decision analysis evaluating systemic streptokinase in the treatment of DVT suggests that patients would be unlikely to accept more than a 1.7-fold increase in major bleeding compared with heparin therapy, and on this basis of individual variation in values and preferences, strategies of early thrombus removal should be considered a Grade 2 recommendation; recommendation of a strategy of early thrombus removal requires a careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits for the individual patient and a careful discussion with the patient.

### Randomized trial evidence supporting a strategy of thrombus removal for acute DVT [^dc547b3b]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Reports of strategies of thrombus removal for acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), especially in patients with iliofemoral DVT, consistently demonstrate improved outcomes relative to postthrombotic morbidity. Randomized trials support the observation that a strategy of thrombus removal reduces postthrombotic syndrome in patients with extensive proximal DVT. Unfortunately, there have been few randomized trials to date and they do not stand up to rigorous methodological review. This results in relatively weak recommendations by national and international guidelines for treatment strategies designed to eliminate thrombus. This report reviews the outcomes of randomized studies of treatments designed to remove thrombus from the venous system, including operative venous thrombectomy, systemic thrombolysis, and catheter-directed thrombolysis. Hopefully, the reader can put these results into perspective versus those anticipated with anticoagulation alone.

### Treatment of acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis: a strategy of thrombus removal [^b8f1a59e]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) suffer the most severe postthrombotic sequelae. The majority of physicians treat all patients with acute DVT with anticoagulation alone, despite evidence that postthrombotic chronic venous insufficiency, leg ulceration, and venous claudication are common in patients treated only with anticoagulation. The body of evidence to date in patients with iliofemoral DVT suggests that a strategy of thrombus removal offers these patients the best long-term outcome. Unfortunately, currently published guidelines use outdated experiences to recommend against the use of techniques designed to remove thrombus, ignoring recent clinical studies showing significant benefit in patients who have thrombus eliminated. Contemporary venous thrombectomy, intrathrombus catheter-directed thrombolysis, and pharmacomechanical thrombolysis are all options that can be offered to successfully remove venous thrombus with increasing safety. The authors review evidence supporting the rationale for thrombus removal and discuss the most effective approaches for treating patients with acute iliofemoral DVT.

Results

We included 94 patients with an iliofemoral or inferior vena cava DVT, accounting for 95 events since one patient experienced a second DVT. Sixty-two patients were treated with CDT (6 of these after 2009) and 33 with USCDT. Characteristics of patients, risk factors for DVT, location of thrombi, and duration of symptoms, stratified by treatment modality are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differences between groups.

a No significant differences between groups

Table 2 displays the characteristics of venous thrombus and short-term outcomes after treatment. The thrombus burden was equal in both groups before the start of treatment. The proportion of patients that achieved sufficient patency within 48 h was significantly higher after USCDT (27 vs. 10%, P < 0.05). The median duration of total hospitalization was shorter for USCDT patients compared to those treated with CDT [6.0 days (IQR 5.0–9.0) vs. 8.0 (IQR 5.8–12.0), P < 0.05]. Finally, intravenous stenting of residual thrombosis after thrombolysis was less often deemed necessary by the treating team in the USCDT group (30% vs. 55%, P < 0.05). We did not observe any significant differences in the dose of thrombolytic agent used, nor in the degree of thrombolysis achieved immediately after treatment [> 90% of luminal recanalization in 88% (CDT) vs. 76% (USCDT)]. Exclusion of patients (n = 8) with symptoms of VTE longer than 14 days, an exclusion criterion in most guidelines, did not change outcomes (data not shown).

### Catheter-directed venous thrombolysis in acute iliofemoral vein thrombosis – the caVenT study: rationale and design of a multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial (NCT00251771) [^fb4acf31]. American Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The conventional treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is anticoagulation and compression therapy, as recommended in the international guidelines. Anticoagulation prevents recurrent venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and death. Compression therapy reduces the risk of developing long-term sequelae, that is, postthrombotic syndrome (PTS). Evaluation of systemic thrombolysis has shown effective thrombolysis and a likely reduction in PTS but at the cost of increased risk of bleeding complications. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) was introduced for rapid removal of thrombi and salvage of venous valves with less systemic thrombolytic effect, and is being offered to selected patients with iliofemoral DVT to prevent development of PTS. Case series have shown technical and thrombolytic success; however, no randomized studies have evaluated the long-term clinical effects of venous CDT. The aim of the CaVenT study is to investigate the role of adjunctive CDT by evaluating its clinical efficacy and safety compared with conventional treatment alone in patients with acute iliofemoral DVT.

Methods

The CaVenT study is an open, randomized, controlled, clinical trial. We plan to include 200 patients who will receive either CDT, in addition to conventional treatment, or conventional treatment alone. The primary outcome measures are patency at 6 months and prevalence of PTS at 2 years.

Conclusion

Implementation of the CaVenT study will be a contribution toward evidence-based medicine in the treatment of acute proximal DVT of the leg. Any documentation of improved functional outcome will have a significant impact on clinical practice for this patient group and may lead to a modification of existing international guidelines.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on the management of chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction with endovascular placement of metallic stents [^9c1daa0c]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Patient selection for stent placement — venous stent placement may be appropriate in highly selected symptomatic patients with chronic iliac vein obstruction but should be avoided in most patients who do not have all of the following: life interference of at least moderate severity attributable to venous disease; anatomic evidence of significant venous obstruction in the IVC, the iliac vein, or common femoral vein; good inflow to the common femoral vein from a patent femoral and/or deep femoral vein; and, when individualized risk indicates substantial stent thrombosis risk, the ability to receive long-term anticoagulation (Level of Evidence C, Strength of Recommendation Weak). The risk-benefit ratio has not been evaluated in well-designed multicenter randomized trials, and because available stents are permanent implants, it is important to avoid placements that do not provide durable patency and clinical benefits.

### Interventional approaches to deep vein thrombosis [^3847ca12]. American Journal of Hematology (2012). Low credibility.

The last decade has seen increased use of aggressive, catheter-based methods of treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT). In this article, we outline the risks, benefits, and uncertainties surrounding endovascular DVT therapies, describe clinical situations in which endovascular treatment options should reasonably be considered, and update the reader on new outcome data that pertains to catheter-based DVT interventions. Endovascular thrombolytic therapy is reasonable to perform for selected patients with DVT causing acute limb-threatening circulatory compromise, acute inferior vena cava occlusion, or acute iliofemoral DVT for the purposes of limb salvage and relief of presenting DVT symptoms, and appears likely to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in patients with proximal DVT. A multicenter randomized trial, the ATTRACT Study, is currently underway in the United States to determine whether pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) is sufficiently safe and effective to be recommended for routine use in proximal DVT patients. Selected patients with established moderate-to-severe PTS in association with an occluded iliac vein or a refluxing saphenous vein may also be amenable to endovascular intervention to reduce venous hypertension, alleviate symptoms, and improve limb function and quality of life. Pending the results of further studies, an individualized approach to patient selection for interventional DVT therapies is recommended.

Deep venous stenting of a non-thrombotic iliac vein lesion

For patients with deep venous stenting of NIVL, anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet agents was recommended to improve outcomes in initial phase therapy (first 1 months) (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅰ), and LMWH or DOACs were recommended as the initial treatment agents (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅲ). Anticoagulation alone or antiplatelet therapy alone was recommended in maintenance-phase management (Grade C, consistency Grade Ⅲ), and DOACs were the preferred anticoagulants (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅲ).

Deep venous stenting following acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis

For patients with deep venous stenting following acute iliofemoral DVT, therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet agents was recommended to improve outcomes in initial phase therapy (first 1 months) (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅲ). In the maintenance-phase therapy, therapeutic-dose (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅳ) DOACs (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅲ) with a treatment course of at least 6 months (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅱ) were appropriate. In addition, if anticoagulation with antiplatelet agents were chosen for initial treatment, we recommended at least a 6-month treatment phase of dual pathway antithrombotic therapy (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅲ).

Deep venous stenting of post-thrombotic syndrome

For patients with deep venous stenting of PTS, therapeutic-dose DOACs with or without antiplatelet agents were recommended to improve outcomes in initial phase therapy (first 1 months) (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅲ). In the maintenance-phase therapy, therapeutic-dose (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅲ) DOACs (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅳ) with a treatment course at least 12 months (Grade A, consistency Grade Ⅳ) were recommended.

Anatomic severity and candidate selection for catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) — preferred and discouraged scenarios are outlined: Patients with iliofemoral DVT tend to be highly symptomatic and at particularly high risk for recurrent DVT, PTS, and late disability, and the iliofemoral DVT subgroup is believed to be the ideal subgroup for endovascular intervention; patients with IVC thrombosis are also good candidates for aggressive therapy; the Catheter-Directed Venous Thrombolysis Trial (CaVenT) included patients with DVT extending only into the popliteal half of the femoral vein and found significant reduction in the 2-year PTS rate with infusion-only CDT, therefore CDT may also be justified for selected patients with femoral DVT, although the proper threshold for femoral DVT should probably be higher than for iliofemoral DVT; conversely, the risks of thrombolysis cannot generally be justified in isolated calf DVT or when DVT extends no higher than the popliteal vein.

### Indications for thrombolysis in deep venous thrombosis [^4e7fb1d2]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Deep venous thromboses (DVTs) are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the general and inpatient population. Current anticoagulation therapy is efficient in reducing thrombus propagation but does not contribute to clot lysis or prevention of post-thrombotic limb syndrome. Catheter directed thrombolysis (CDT) is an alternative method for treating DVTs but there is no consensus regarding indications for its use.

Data Sources

PubMed and Cochrane library were searched for all articles on deep vein thrombosis and thrombolysis.

Review Method

Articles presenting data on DVT thrombolysis, DVT anticoagulation, mechanical thrombectomy, venous stenting and May-Thurner's syndrome were considered for inclusion in the review.

Results

CDT reduced clot burden, DVT recurrence and may prevent the formation of post-thrombotic syndrome. Indications for its use include younger individuals with a long life expectancy and few co-morbidities, limb-threatening thromboses and proximal ilio-femoral DVTs. There is a marked lack of randomised controlled trials comparing CDT-related mortality and long term outcomes compared to anticoagulation alone. The effectiveness of combined pharmaco-mechanic thrombectomy, although promising, need to be further investigated, as is the role of caval filters in preventing DVT-associated pulmonary emboli.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the outcome of CDT in DVT management are encouraging in selected patient cohorts, but further evidence is required to establish longer term benefits and cost-effectiveness.

### Catheter-directed thrombolysis for acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis [^c26247f9]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis often experience severe postthrombotic complications that result from venous obstruction and valve incompetence. Conventional anticoagulation prevents thrombus extension, fatal pulmonary embolism, and recurrence of the deep venous thrombosis, but it can hardly minimize the postthrombotic complications. Whether early thrombus removal significantly reduces the postthrombotic morbidity is an important question related to the treatment of these patients. This article will chiefly introduce rationale for and evidence supporting early thrombus removal for acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis, and the development and current status of catheter-directed thrombolysis and adjunctive percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy or pharmacomechanical thrombolysis, which are usually the first line of therapy for early removal of an acute thrombus in the proximal veins of the leg. In addition, we will briefly introduce the development of new pharmacologic agents.

Procedures

Standard treatment was applied to all included patients and consisted of anticoagulant therapy prescribed according to international guidelines, initiation of compression therapy within 24 hours after diagnosis, and early mobilization.

Additionally, patients allocated to the intervention group were admitted to 1 of the 6 interventional centers where thrombolysis had to be initiated no more than 21 days after onset of symptoms. Details on the procedure of ultrasound‐accelerated catheter‐directed thrombolysis have been previously reported. Following venography to confirm iliofemoral localization of the thrombus, the catheter of the Ekos Endowave System (Ekos Corporation) was inserted under local anaesthesia and ultrasound guidance and positioned at the level of the thrombosed vein segments. After placement of the catheter, a single bolus dose of 250,000 IU of urokinase diluted in 10 mL NaCl was administered in addition to the continuous infusion of 100,000 IU/h urokinase and 1000 IU/h heparin for the duration of the intervention. Furthermore, during the intervention, standard oral anticoagulant treatment was replaced by therapeutic doses of low‐molecular weight heparin. When thrombolysis was terminated, standard oral anticoagulant therapy was reinstalled 1 hour after removal of the sheath. Thrombolysis was terminated in case of a regained venous patency of ≥ 90%, 48 hours without improvement of patency as assessed with daily venography, a persisting deviance in coagulation status according to the 6 hourly laboratory tests (activated partial thromboplastin time > 80 s, fibrinogen < 8 mm in rotational thromboelastometry assay for the fibrin part of the clot, or plasma fibrinogen < 1.8 g/L), or when the maximum duration of thrombolysis (96 hours) was exceeded. Adjunctive procedures (eg, thrombosuction, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, dedicated venous stent placement, endophlebectomy, creating an arteriovenous fistula, or a combination of the former) were recommended in the presence of compression syndromes or a residual venous lumen reduction of ≥ 50% but performed at the discretion of the operator.

Regular follow‐up study visits were performed at the outpatient clinic at 3, 6, and 12 months after inclusion and annually thereafter if preferred by the patient. During the study's long‐term follow‐up phase (ie, follow‐up assessments of more than 12 months performed after inclusion of the last patient) visits were clustered. The closing study visit included assessment of clinical scores, health‐related quality of life, and a standardized extensive duplex ultrasound. A detailed overview of the follow‐up schedule and performed assessments can be found in Table S2.

### Endovascular treatment options in the management of lower limb deep venous thrombosis [^04cb9726]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Systemic anticoagulation therapy is the mainstay of conventional treatment instituted by most physicians for the management of DVT. This has proven efficacy in the prevention of thrombus extension and reduction in the incidence of pulmonary embolism and rethrombosis. Unfortunately, especially in patients with severe and extensive iliofemoral DVT, standard treatment may not be entirely adequate. This is because a considerable proportion of these patients eventually develops postthrombotic syndrome. This is characterized by chronic extremity pain and trophic skin changes, edema, ulceration, and venous claudication. Recent interest in endovascular technologies has led to the development of an assortment of minimally invasive, catheter-based strategies to deal with venous thrombus. These comprise catheter-directed thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy devices, adjuvant venous angioplasty and stenting, and inferior vena cava filters. This article reviews these technologies and discusses their current role as percutaneous treatment strategies for venous thrombotic conditions.

Table 1
Summary of catheter-directed thrombolysis studies

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) has emerged as a promising and minimally invasive therapeutic approach for managing DVT, offering targeted delivery of thrombolytic agents directly to the clot site.

CDT involves the insertion of a catheter into the affected vein under imaging guidance, allowing for the administration of thrombolytic drugs, typically a thrombolytic agent such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), directly into the clot. This localized treatment aims to dissolve the clot, restore venous patency, and alleviate symptoms associated with DVT. The procedure has gained traction as an alternative to traditional systemic thrombolysis, which may be associated with an increased risk of bleeding.

The amalgamation of evidence derived from a series of clinical trials and systematic reviews investigating the efficacy of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and ultrasound-accelerated CDT for the management of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) offers significant insights into their effectiveness. According to the 2020 NICE guidelines, catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is recommended as a therapeutic intervention for individuals diagnosed with iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) who present with symptoms persisting for less than 14 days, exhibit a low risk of bleeding, maintain good functional status, and possess a life expectancy of one year or more.

### Thrombolysis for deep venous thrombosis [^422195aa]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The key questions addressed in this summary are whether clot removal should be part of the preferred therapy for patients with acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT), and whether there is evidence that a strategy of thrombus removal offers better outcomes for patients than anticoagulation alone. Evidence is defined as an outward sign or something that furnishes proof. Evidence in medicine is not limited to direct, blinded comparisons of one form of treatment compared with another but rather the body of knowledge that provides insight to clinicians to offer patient care. Evidence-based medicine follows from information available to form the foundation for the use of a treatment for a specific disease. Reports of strategies of thrombus removal for acute DVT, especially in patients with iliofemoral DVT, consistently demonstrate improved outcomes relative to postthrombotic morbidity. This summary reviews the evidence supporting this strategy as the preferred initial management of patients with extensive proximal DVT.

### Endovascular treatment of lower limb acute DVT: current trends and future directions [^2fac0b17]. CVIR Endovascular (2024). Medium credibility.

Noteworthy studies collectively shed light on the positive impact of CDT in ameliorating venous patency and diminishing the incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in patients grappling with acute or subacute DVT. For instance, Enden et al. randomized controlled trial spanning from January 2006 to December 2009, involving 209 patients, illustrated a significant reduction in the risk of PTS in those with iliofemoral DVT who underwent CDT. The absolute risk reduction of 14.4% at 24 months and enhanced short-term iliofemoral patency after 6 months underscored the efficacy of CDT, albeit with acknowledgment of a small additional risk of bleeding. Notten et al. clinical trial, focusing on long-term follow-up of PTS patients, unveiled that supplementary ultrasound-accelerated catheter-directed thrombolysis could mitigate the risk of PTS, especially when employing the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definition. Despite these benefits, the study highlighted limited improvement in patients' quality of life.

Zhu et al. clinical trial comparing ultrasound-guided CDT with ultrasound non-guided CDT showcased the advantages of ultrasound guidance, including higher success rates, shorter operation times, lower incidence of hematoma, improved venous patency, and significantly lower rates of long-term PTS in the ultrasound-guided group. Engelberger et al. BERNUTIFUL study, centered on acute iliofemoral DVT, demonstrated that a standardized catheter thrombolysis regimen followed by routine stenting resulted in low PTS incidence, good quality of life, and excellent patency rates with minimal postthrombotic vein lesions. Interestingly, the addition of intravascular ultrasound did not significantly impact the outcomes.

Lu Y et al. conducted a meta-analysis comparing catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) with anticoagulation therapy alone for acute lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT). CDT improved venous patency and reduced postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) but increased bleeding and pulmonary embolism (PE) risks. No significant differences were found in death or recurrent VTE events. CDT patients had longer hospital stays and higher charges. The decision to use CDT should consider patient risks and treatment benefits.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on the endovascular management of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis [^f50149d9]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Anticoagulant therapy with or without ETR — anticoagulation reduces adverse outcomes and must be instituted without delay when acute iliofemoral DVT is diagnosed or suspected; LMWH has advantages over UFH, and common practice during ETR uses UFH or LMWH with UFH often targeted to subtherapeutic levels during fibrinolytic infusions. Anticoagulant therapy reduces symptomatic PE, thrombus extension, and mortality in patients with proximal DVT, and delayed achievement of fully therapeutic anticoagulant effect has been shown to correlate with poorer clinical outcomes. Therefore, anticoagulation must be instituted without delay in patients in whom acute iliofemoral DVT is diagnosed or suspected, irrespective of whether ETR is being considered. Compared with intravenous UFH, subcutaneous LMWH results in faster achievement of therapeutic-level anticoagulation, a lower risk of recurrent VTE, and a trend toward reduced mortality. Randomized trials have not been performed to identify the optimal strategy for anticoagulation during ETR; in practice most patients have received UFH or LMWH during ETR, and UFH is often targeted to subtherapeutic levels during fibrinolytic drug infusions.

### Inferior and superior vena cava reconstruction [^39889c54]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although infrequent, stent migration is a feared complication and may be avoided by a 2 mm oversizing of stents. After stenting, IVUS may again be valuable to evaluate for residual stenosis, correct stent position and early re-thrombosis.

The inflow of the renal veins may be in the diseased segment of the ICV. Although a large body of evidence about the relevance of jailing the renal inflow is lacking, available data suggest that renal outflow and function may be preserved even using self-expanding nitinol stents.

In contrast to the SVC, short stenoses are less likely in the IVC and the procedure time and long segment venoplasty up to large diameters may be uncomfortable. Therefore, general anesthesia may be helpful in most if not all recanalization procedures.

Although intra-procedure anticoagulation is usually with intravenous heparin, the antithrombotic regimen after IVC stenting has not found consensus. In a recent systematic review on IVC stenting, it was found that post-procedure anticoagulation varied widely from no anticoagulation to full anticoagulation with warfarin and dual antiplatelet therapy.

Similar challenges arise when aiming to extrapolate an antithrombotic regimen from chronic deep venous obstruction therapy in general. In the recently published ESVS clinical practice guidelines, the peri- and post-interventional antithrombotic regimens were found to be heterogeneous among studies. No particular strategy on either duration or type of anticoagulation could be recommended. In a Delphi consensus paper, anticoagulant treatment should be continued for at least six months after intervention in patients with a history of DVT. Regarding the role of antiplatelets, no consensus was reached.

For more than 20 years, catheter-directed thrombolysis has been utilized to reduce the burden of obstructive acute thrombus in the iliofemoral veins, and resolution of the thrombus relieves pain and swelling in the LE and is thought to reduce valve damage and to reduce the likelihood of future post-thrombotic-syndrome.

### Prevention and treatment of the post-thrombotic syndrome [^e4210ed6]. Thrombosis Research (2018). Low credibility.

Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a complication that develops in up to 50% of patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and manifests as symptoms and signs of chronic venous insufficiency of varying severity. PTS negatively affects patient's quality of life and causes significant burden to the healthcare system. The risk for PTS development can be markedly reduced by preventing DVT and providing appropriate anticoagulation once it develops. Patients with extensive proximal (iliofemoral) DVT may benefit from invasive interventions, such as catheter-directed thrombolysis. The effectiveness of elastic compression stockings (ECS) for PTS prevention has not been conclusively demonstrated in randomized trials. Treatment of PTS is primarily based on ECS, exercise and lifestyle modifications. The effectiveness of various pharmacologic agents for PTS treatment remains controversial. Surgical or radiological interventions for vein reconstruction or revascularization may be considered in refractory cases. This review summarizes current evidence regarding prevention and treatment of PTS of the lower limbs in adults.

Acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) — risk assessment and imaging are outlined as follows: Acute iliofemoral DVT should be viewed as a high-risk condition with attention to pulmonary embolism risk, presenting symptoms, and long-term post-thrombotic syndrome; most cases can be identified on lower extremity duplex ultrasound given common femoral vein involvement, and pelvic imaging is not routinely needed but can be obtained when iliac DVT is suspected with a negative limb ultrasound, when pelvic malignancy or another condition is a concern, or for pretreatment planning if catheter intervention is planned.

Discussion

IFDVT of the lower extremities can have severe consequences, including PE. Current guidelines support anticoagulant therapy for both initial and long-term management of DVT when clinically appropriate. Despite optimal anticoagulation treatment following DVT, a substantial proportion of patients (20%-50%) develop PTS, a chronic condition without a cure that significantly diminishes quality of life.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) can effectively reduce the risk of PTS by facilitating early thrombus removal. However, bleeding complications remain a significant concern with CDT. Utilizing power-pulse thrombolysis delivered through a small catheter, the AngioJet RT device actively removes fragmented thrombus by applying Bernoulli's principle. This advanced technology offers a potential alternative by minimizing the required thrombolytic dose and consequently reducing the risk of major bleeding events related with CDT. To ensure a fully patent vein lumen and minimize PE, after the RT procedures, POBA was performed on all patients (100%). We definitely recommend the use of stents after venoplasty in compression syndromes. Furthermore, we do not recommend stenting in cases of acute IFDVT unless there is severe iliac stenosis, as stent restenosis may increase the rate of PTS. We suggest that the procedure should be repeated if there is residual thrombus and that an appropriate time should be waited after thrombolytic administration to increase clinical and procedural success rates. In one case within our study cohort, post-thrombectomy venography identified an iliac vein lesion. Subsequent to this finding, iliac vein stenting was performed.

### Invasive approaches to treatment of venous thromboembolism [^7d75c5b4]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs in one-quarter of a million individuals annually in the United States and results in significant disability from pulmonary embolism and chronic venous insufficiency, especially when the proximal iliofemoral is involved. Treatment has centered on early institution of adequate anticoagulation to prevent thrombus propagation and embolism, but anticoagulation alone does not always restore venous patency and many patients are left with venous outflow obstruction and valvular incompetence-the anatomic underpinnings of the postthrombotic syndrome. Various strategies have been used to restore patency of thrombosed veins, including open surgical thrombectomy, pharmacological thrombolysis, and percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy. Each modality has benefits and shortcomings. Surgical thrombectomy had previously been abandoned secondary to poor long-term results. More recently, with improved techniques and better patient selection, surgical thrombectomy has regained a therapeutic role in treating acute DVT in young patients with short segment occlusions. The advent of percutaneous techniques has allowed thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy, and stenting to be used in conjunction with each other-allowing for better resolution of venous clot burden than when an individual modality is used alone. Practitioners who treat patients with DVT should be familiar with all the options available to restore venous patency, preserve valvular function, and thereby minimize the risk of late postthrombotic complications.

### Thrombolysis for lower extremity deep venous thrombosis [^5daad40a]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) has been proposed as an alternative mode of therapy to anticoagulation in patients with massive, symptomatic deep vein thrombosis of the extremity. The major goal of therapy is to rapidly restore venous blood flow, reduce the pain and edema of the extremity, preserve venous valve function, and reduce chronic symptoms related to chronic venous hypertension (postthrombotic syndrome). In patients with iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) standard angiographic techniques are used to instrument a lower extremity vein (popliteal) and venography is performed followed by catheter-directed infusion of a plasminogen activator directly into the thrombus. Following lytic infusion, the interventionalist must evaluate the venous drainage to determine if there is an anatomic lesion that requires further endovascular treatment (eg, iliac vein compression syndrome). Posttreatment therapy usually consists of warfarin therapy and venous compression stockings for at least 3 to 6 months. The purpose of this article is to review the technical approach used in treating iliofemoral DVT and highlight the hurdles that face interventionalists in attempting to broaden this procedure to most types of lower extremity DVT.

### Society of Interventional Radiology position statement on the endovascular management of acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis [^780918e6]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction — burden and outcomes in acute iliofemoral DVT note that patients often experience pulmonary embolism (PE), severe presenting limb symptoms, and poor long-term clinical outcomes, and despite markedly reduced PE risk with timely anticoagulant therapy, many develop postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) manifesting as limb pain, heaviness, swelling, fatigue, and venous stasis skin changes such as skin ulceration. A large (N = 1,149) prospective cohort study found that patients with acute iliofemoral DVT experience a 2.4 times increased risk of recurrent DVT compared with patients with less-extensive DVT, and another study documented frequent venous claudication, severe venous physiologic abnormalities, and impaired health-related quality of life.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: A single-center retrospective case-controlled study
- **Key Findings**: Pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and thrombectomy plus catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) achieved higher rates of grade III venous patency, shorter hospital stays, and a decreased incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome compared with CDT alone.
- **Take Home Message**: Both short- and long-term outcomes support the superiority of pharmacomechanical thrombolysis and thrombectomy plus CDT vs CDT alone in the acute iliofemoral deep vein thrombosis subgroup with a symptom duration of ≤ 7 days.

Venous thromboembolism, including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), is a common and severe health condition, with an incidence of ≤ 1‰ to 2‰ annually. Of all inpatient mortalities, 7% result from acute PE. Approximately 70% to 80% of PE cases are caused by acute DVT. It is estimated that 20% to 50% of patients with acute symptomatic proximal DVT subsequently develop PTS. Also, 5% to 10% of PTS patients develop severe PTS if treated with standard anticoagulation and compression stockings alone. Additionally, after discontinuing anticoagulation for those with proximal DVT, patients experience a risk of recurrence > 20% during a 10-year period.

### Acute iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis in adolescents and young adults is associated with hypercoagulable States and a significant incidence of post-thrombotic syndrome [^8b658af8]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

In our study, abdominal/pelvic imaging was obtained in only two-thirds of the patient population, so we cannot provide clear information on the prevalence of anatomic venous abnormalities and their contribution to acute IFDVT. However, in those who did undergo imaging, evidence of common iliac vein extrinsic compression was identified in 33% and significant congenital abnormalities of the iliac veins and/or IVC in 18%. Tarango et al also identified IVC atresia as a significant risk factor for acute DVT in adolescents, recommending that these patients should be considered for long-term anticoagulation. Imaging of the more proximal and central veins should be performed in all young patients with IFDVT to evaluate for these anatomic abnormalities and inform treatment plans.

Treatment of patients with IFDVT in our review was variable, as would be expected for a condition without strong evidence to guide treatment decisions. The 2018 American Society of Hematology practice guidelines for VTE recommended anticoagulation alone for acute proximal DVT in pediatric patients. They specifically recommended against the use of thrombolysis or thrombectomy for this patient population, noting that in most cases the risks appear too high for the potential benefit. Although these treatment recommendations are aimed at the pediatric population, there are no practice guidelines available to guide management of older adolescents or young adults in whom risk factors are different from those of younger pediatric patients. In contrast to the above, Murphy et al previously reported a series of seven patients aged 18 to 24 years developing IFDVT after initiation of oral contraceptives. All these patients elected to proceed with intervention using mechanical thrombolysis followed by iliac vein stenting. Patients were all treated with low molecular weight heparin until therapeutic on warfarin. They were maintained on warfarin for 6 months and then treated with aspirin long term. Symptom resolution occurred in all patients with no evidence of PTS at a mean follow-up of 13 months. These contrasting guidelines and studies show the lack of consistent data-driven treatment algorithms for this patient population.

### Residual popliteal vein thrombosis after endovascular treatment of mixed-type lower extremity deep vein thrombosis is relevant to post-thrombotic syndrome [^9118c8ed]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we found considerable positive associations between RPVT and the incidence of PTS in patients with mixed-type lower extremity DVT after EVT. This association remained significant after adjustment for preoperative iliac vein stenosis and other clinical characteristics according to multivariable Cox regression analysis and subgroup analysis. These findings suggest that patients with RPVT may require intensive monitoring and aggressive therapeutic to remove popliteal vein thrombosis.

Four pivotal RCT studies — TORPEDO (Thrombus Obliteration by Rapid Percutaneous Endovenous Intervention), CaVenT (Catheter-Directed Venous Thrombolysis), CAVA (Ultrasound-Accelerated Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis on Preventing Post-Thrombotic Syndrome), and ATTRACT (Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal with Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis) — evaluated thrombus removal and anticoagulation strategies for patients with symptomatic proximal lower extremity DVT. TORPEDOdemonstrated the potential benefits of combining EVT with anticoagulation, indicating a significant decrease in the incidence of PTS at 6 months. Building on these findings, CaVenTshowed a sustained decrease in PTS incidence with the addition of CDT over a 24-month follow-up period. This finding implied that the advantages of early iliofemoral thrombus removal were both immediate and long lasting, potentially enhancing patients' long-term quality of life. CAVApresented a novel method using ultrasound-accelerated CDT, exhibiting a trend toward decreased PTS rates, although the results were not statistically significant. ATTRACT, demonstrated that, among patients with iliofemoral DVT, early thrombus removal significantly decreased the severity of PTS without increasing the risk of major bleeding, as shown in the subgroup analysis. The cumulative evidence from these randomized cortolled trials highlighted the possible benefits of early thrombus removal, with a focus on the iliofemoral regions. Our study's patients received guideline-recommended anticoagulationand underwent optimized EVT for prompt thrombus clearance, including CDT, PMT, and stenting when required. The overall PTS incidence in our study was 24.3%, lower than the 41.1% observed in CaVenTand the 47.0% in ATTRACT. No patients in our study experienced major bleeding events.

### Principles of optimal antithrombotic therapy for iliac VEnous stenting (POATIVES): a national expert-based Delphi consensus study [^5dd4a5f5]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: A national expert-based Delphi consensus study
- **Key Findings**: We developed 17 statements relating to antithrombotic management after venous stenting for non-thrombotic iliac vein lesions (4 statements), acute deep vein thrombosis (6 statements), and post-thrombotic syndrome (7 statements). The majority of the statements about the antithrombotic agent selection received a high consensus strength.
- **Take Home Message**: The expert panel agrees that anticoagulation should be the primary treatment for patients undergoing venous stenting. Further studies are required to clarify controversial issues including the dose and duration of anticoagulants and the role of antiplatelet agents.

Currently, estimates of the global burden of chronic venous disease (CVD) range from 45.6% to 83.6%, and epidemiological data on CVD in China are scarce. Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) as an advanced stage of CVD occurs in approximately 1% to 5% of the adult population, with the cost of CVI equaling over 2% of the annual health care budget in Western societies.

Iliac vein obstruction is a major cause of CVI, which mainly results from non-thrombotic iliac vein compression lesions (NIVL), acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) with a residual obstruction, and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Due to the establishment of safety and efficacy profiles, endovascular stenting has been widely implemented to relieve the symptoms of venous hypertension and improve the quality of life of patients with iliac vein obstruction. To maintain the long-term patency of revascularization and mitigate adverse systematic outcomes, it is reasonable to receive antithrombotic therapy for patients after venous stenting. Nevertheless, substantial evidence regarding its impact on outcomes of these patients is limited. Moreover, there are currently no clinical practice guidelines and a scarcity of studies in which the antithrombotic regimens following venous stent are addressed. The current antithrombotic management following venous stents was extrapolated from randomized controlled studies of patients who did not undergo endovascular interventions and retrospective data that lack direct comparisons between different strategies. Due to the dearth of compelling evidence, there exists significant heterogeneity in postprocedural therapeutic regimens. There is a significant prevalence and socioeconomic burden of CVI, increasing the administration of venous stents but a paucity of research regarding antithrombotic therapy following venous stenting. As a result, in the present study, the practices endorsed at many venous institutes across the country were investigated, and a Chinese expert-based Delphi consensus was achieved to provide recommendations on antithrombotic protocols following venous stenting.

### Basic data related to thrombolytic therapy for acute venous thrombosis [^94f0e39d]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Treatment guidelines for thrombolysis in iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis (DVT) are based on a limited number of observational and prospective studies. The acute venous thrombosis: thrombus removal with adjunctive catheter-directed thrombolysis (ATTRACT) trial will be the first large, multicenter randomized control trial to evaluate the relative advantages of several current treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to summarize the existing data that inform the use of catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or pharmacomechanical thrombectomy in the management of acute iliofemoral DVT.

Methods

A search of the current literature was done using PubMed, Ovid, and Cochrane databases for all available articles published up to December 2013.

Results

Of those studies, which included at least 25 patients, 19 case series were identified from 1996 to 2012. Treatment groups included anticoagulation, surgical thrombectomy, pharmacomechanical thrombectomy, and CDT. Cases observed in each ranged from 26 to 101. Three studies were identified which derived data from national multicenter registries. Only 2 randomized control trials were identified from 2002 to 2012. Both support the use of CDT over anticoagulation alone for treatment of iliofemoral DVT.

Conclusions

Present treatment guidelines for acute iliofemoral DVT have been in flux and are derived from a relatively small amount of clinical data. They are summarized here in anticipation of results from the ongoing ATTRACT trial.
