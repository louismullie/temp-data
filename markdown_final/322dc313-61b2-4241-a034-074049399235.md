## Question

Orchitis management

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about orchitis management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing orchitis from surgical emergencies and defining the clinical syndrome. Then, I should classify likely etiologies by age and risk factors. Next, I will outline the diagnostic workup, including when to image and what labs to obtain. After that, I will detail empiric antibiotic strategies tailored to etiology, followed by supportive care and follow-up. Finally, I will address special scenarios such as mumps, BCG-related orchitis, autoimmune orchitis, and chronic pain, and close with a concise algorithmic summary.

> Let me first confirm the clinical syndrome and the immediate differentials. Orchitis is inflammation of the testis, most often as part of epididymo-orchitis, and must be differentiated from testicular torsion, torsion of the appendix testis, Fournier's gangrene, and testicular cancer, with torsion being a surgical emergency where delays beyond about 6 hours threaten viability, so I need to ensure I do not miss that before committing to medical therapy [^113aoW5n] [^117L1kG2] [^114CB4wZ].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the likely etiologies by age and risk. In sexually active men under about 35 years, Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae predominate, whereas in men over 35 or with urinary tract instrumentation, enteric gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli are more common, and in children and adolescents, viral or post-infectious etiologies are frequent, with mumps historically a classic cause in unvaccinated populations [^115UAyUD] [^116MHJiF] [^112z9Pyc] [^117UJPZJ].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before treatment. I should obtain a focused history including sexual exposures, timing, urinary symptoms, recent procedures, and systemic features; on exam, I will look for tender epididymis or testis, hydrocele, and preserved cremasteric reflex to support epididymo-orchitis rather than torsion, while remembering that partial torsion can mimic epididymitis and that ultrasound is primarily to exclude torsion when the diagnosis is uncertain or torsion is suspected [^115UAyUD] [^112uAxv1] [^117L1kG2].

> I need to check the laboratory strategy next. Urinalysis and urine culture are appropriate, and NAAT testing for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae from first-void urine or urethral swab is recommended; in men over 35 or with obstructive risk, I should also culture for enteric organisms, and if mumps is suspected, I should send mumps-specific testing such as RT-PCR or IgM serology, keeping in mind that isolated orchitis without epididymitis is uncommon in adults and should prompt targeted viral testing [^112z9Pyc] [^115UAyUD] [^116MHJiF].

> Let me consider imaging carefully. Ultrasound with Doppler is the first-line modality when torsion is suspected or when the diagnosis is unclear, but I should remember that ultrasound can be normal early in epididymitis and that partial torsion may be missed, so a negative scan does not absolutely exclude torsion; if ultrasound is nondiagnostic and suspicion remains high, urgent urologic consultation for surgical exploration is warranted [^117L1kG2] [^112uAxv1].

> I should confirm when to start antibiotics. Presumptive therapy should begin at the visit for sexually active men to prevent complications and transmission, while awaiting culture results; for STI-associated disease, ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (1,000 mg if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days is first-line, and for men who practice insertive anal intercourse where enteric coverage is also needed, ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once plus levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 10 days is recommended; for enteric-only disease in older men or after instrumentation, levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 10 days is reasonable if gonorrhea has been reasonably excluded, with therapy refined to culture results when available [^112nyLca] [^1159jTK5] [^114DZQT2] [^113aoW5n].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought ceftriaxone 250 mg might suffice based on older guidance, but I should correct that; current CDC guidance specifies ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once, with 1,000 mg for those weighing 150 kg or more, so I will adhere to the 2021 dosing to ensure adequate gonococcal coverage [^112nyLca] [^113aoW5n].

> Next, I should review supportive care because symptom control matters. Bed rest, scrotal elevation, and NSAIDs are recommended adjuncts until fever and local inflammation subside, and I should counsel that pain may persist for weeks after antibiotics; I also need to advise sexual abstinence until the patient and partners are treated and symptoms resolve to prevent reinfection and transmission [^112DQcwx] [^115z4QsF] [^113aoW5n].

> I will now examine follow-up and escalation triggers. Patients should return if there is no improvement within 72 hours; persistent swelling or tenderness after completing therapy warrants re-evaluation for abscess, infarction, tumor, tuberculosis, or fungal infection, and ultrasound can help detect complications such as pyocele or abscess that may require urologic intervention; I should also ensure partner management and STI screening for HIV and syphilis are addressed [^114Q2PUV] [^115UAyUD] [^113FsJKR].

> But wait, what if this is mumps orchitis. I should double-check for parotitis and vaccination history; mumps orchitis is typically self-limited and managed supportively with rest, scrotal support, ice, and analgesia, with close follow-up, and antibiotics are not indicated unless bacterial superinfection is suspected; in outbreaks, complication rates among adult males can be substantial, reinforcing the importance of vaccination and symptomatic care [^117QgwCu] [^117UJPZJ].

> I need to ensure I consider BCG-related orchitis. After intravesical BCG, persistent local genitourinary symptoms beyond 2–3 days, including orchitis, should prompt evaluation for systemic BCG infection; management requires multiple antituberculous agents such as isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol while cultures are pending, and orchiectomy may be necessary in refractory cases, so early infectious diseases consultation is prudent [^1141jofK] [^115oAU8s] [^114DVrg5].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to autoimmune orchitis. When orchitis occurs in the context of systemic autoimmune disease or anti-sperm antibodies, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy may be indicated, though evidence is limited and management should be individualized; for infertility related to anti-sperm antibodies, assisted reproductive technologies, particularly ICSI, are reasonable options [^115nd1PX] [^114yoeGH].

> Let me reconsider chronic or persistent scrotal pain after infection has resolved. Chronic scrotal content pain lasting beyond 3 months warrants a structured evaluation to exclude ongoing infection, mass lesions, neuropathic pain, or post-surgical etiologies, and management is multimodal with analgesics, neuromodulators, pelvic floor therapy, and selective surgical approaches such as microsurgical denervation when indicated, ideally coordinated by urology and pain specialists [^112hQ1U4] [^113663Qs].

> I should double-check that I have not overlooked red flags requiring urgent urology. Severe pain with systemic toxicity, rapidly progressive swelling, skin changes suggesting necrosis, or failure to improve within 48–72 hours should prompt urgent imaging and surgical consultation for possible abscess, infarction, or alternative diagnoses such as Fournier's gangrene, where early debridement is lifesaving [^115UAyUD] [^114j2S3K].

> To synthesize, let me verify the algorithm in my mind. First, stabilize and exclude torsion or necrotizing infection; second, obtain targeted history, exam, urinalysis, urine culture, and NAATs for CT/NG with mumps testing if indicated; third, start empiric antibiotics tailored to likely etiology and refine to culture results; fourth, provide supportive care and sexual abstinence counseling; fifth, arrange partner management and STI screening; sixth, reassess at 72 hours and escalate care if no improvement or if complications arise, ensuring ultrasound and urology involvement as needed [^115UAyUD] [^113aoW5n] [^114Q2PUV].

---

Orchitis management centers on **prompt diagnosis and targeted therapy** to prevent complications. Start empiric antibiotics for likely bacterial causes [^1169FdTM], using **ceftriaxone plus doxycycline** for STI risk [^112nyLca] or **levofloxacin** for enteric organisms [^114DZQT2], and adjust to culture results [^113aoW5n]. Provide **supportive care** with bed rest, scrotal elevation, NSAIDs, and analgesia [^112DQcwx]. Use ultrasound to exclude torsion and detect abscess or infarction [^117L1kG2]; obtain urinalysis, urine culture, and NAATs for STIs [^112z9Pyc]. If no improvement in 72 hours, reassess for abscess, infarction, or alternative diagnoses [^114Q2PUV]; surgical drainage or orchiectomy is reserved for severe complications [^1143wztB]. For mumps orchitis, management is supportive; consider corticosteroids for severe pain or swelling [^notfound]. Ensure partner treatment and STI screening to prevent reinfection and transmission [^114Q2PUV].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Typical symptoms include **unilateral testicular pain, swelling, erythema, and tenderness** [^112uAxv1], often with fever, urinary symptoms, and a gradual onset that helps distinguish from torsion [^112P6Kr4]. Key **physical findings** are a swollen, tender testis with an intact cremasteric reflex and a normal lie, and ultrasound with Doppler is the first-line imaging to confirm orchitis, exclude torsion, and detect complications [^117L1kG2]. Laboratory evaluation should include urinalysis, urine culture, and NAATs for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae [^112z9Pyc]; obtain CBC, CRP, and STI testing as indicated [^113aoW5n].

---

## Differential diagnosis

- **Testicular torsion**: Surgical emergency with sudden onset, absent cremasteric reflex, and high-riding testis [^114CB4wZ].
- **Epididymitis**: Often coexists with orchitis (epididymo-orchitis) [^notfound].
- **Torsion of testicular appendages**: Gradual onset, superior pole tenderness [^114CB4wZ].
- **Fournier's gangrene**: Rapidly progressive, life-threatening necrotizing infection [^114j2S3K].
- **Testicular cancer**: Painless mass or swelling [^116H6mub].

---

## Medical management

### Antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should be started based on likely pathogens and adjusted to culture results [^113aoW5n]. For **sexually transmitted infections**, use ceftriaxone 500 mg IM once (1 g if ≥ 150 kg) plus doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 10 days [^112nyLca]. For **enteric organisms**, use levofloxacin 500 mg PO daily for 10 days [^114DZQT2]. For **pediatric patients**, limit antibiotics to those with abnormal urinalysis or positive culture; most cases are viral or post-infectious [^112nh3kZ].

---

### Supportive care

Supportive care includes **bed rest, scrotal elevation, and NSAIDs** until fever and local inflammation resolve [^112DQcwx]. Provide analgesics for pain control and advise sexual abstinence until the patient and partners complete treatment and symptoms resolve [^113aoW5n].

---

## Indications for surgical intervention

- **Abscess formation**: Ultrasound-guided drainage or surgical exploration [^1143wztB].
- **Testicular infarction or necrosis**: Orchiectomy if non-viable [^1168jrcR].
- **Fournier's gangrene**: Emergency surgical debridement [^114j2S3K].
- **Failure of medical therapy**: Persistent symptoms or complications after 72 hours [^114Q2PUV].

---

## Complications and sequelae

- **Infertility**: Due to testicular damage or obstruction [^113aoW5n].
- **Testicular atrophy**: From ischemic injury [^112QcQms].
- **Chronic pain**: Persistent orchialgia [^112hQ1U4].
- **Abscess formation**: Requires drainage [^111oYqfK].
- **Fournier's gangrene**: Life-threatening [^115ayswM].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Arrange **re-evaluation within 72 hours** to assess response and detect complications [^114Q2PUV]. Repeat ultrasound if symptoms persist or worsen to identify abscess or infarction [^notfound]. Manage and treat sexual partners to prevent reinfection and transmission [^11665eFo].

---

## Special considerations

Mumps orchitis is managed supportively; consider corticosteroids for severe pain or swelling [^notfound]. Autoimmune orchitis may require immunosuppressive therapy if associated with systemic autoimmune disease [^115nd1PX]. In immunocompromised patients, maintain a lower threshold for hospitalization and surgical intervention.

---

Orchitis management requires **timely diagnosis, targeted antibiotics, and supportive care**, with surgery for complications. Close follow-up and partner management are essential to prevent recurrence and transmission [^115UAyUD].

Epididymitis is a common and morbid condition seen across a wide age range. There are multiple etiologies that may lead to inflammation of the epididymis, including infection, trauma, autoimmune disease, and vasculitis. Although there have been multiple advances in imaging of the scrotum and detection of urinary pathogens, a large portion of cases remain idiopathic. Management of epididymitis is often difficult, but relies on clinical expertise and the use of established clinical guidelines.

### Management of acute epididymitis: are European guidelines being followed? [^1141srCf]. European Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Acute epididymitis is increasing in men aged 35 years or under due to sexually-transmitted Chlamydia trachomatis. This study examines whether Urological surgeons are following European guidelines for the management of acute epididymitis in these patients.

Methods

A postal questionnaire survey was conducted of specialists in Urology in two regions of the UK.

Results

Of 79 completed replies, 41 (52%) take a detailed sexual history but only 34 (43%) refer patients to a Genitourinary medicine clinic. Quinolones are the most commonly prescribed first-line antibiotic by 56 (71%) respondents, principally ciprofloxacin.

Conclusions

The current management of acute epididymitis in young men must be improved. Ciprofloxacin is not the optimal antimicrobial for the treatment of urogenital chlamydial infection. We recommend that all such patients be referred to local Genitourinary medicine services for contact-tracing and treatment of their sexual partners.

AUA testicular cancer — repeat imaging for indeterminate lesions with normal markers: Patients with normal serum tumor markers (hCG and AFP) and indeterminate findings on physical exam or testicular ultrasound for testicular neoplasm should undergo repeat imaging in six to eight weeks (Clinical Principle). Men with non-palpable, small (< 10mm) intra-testicular lesions may face a diagnostic dilemma; up to 50–80% of non-palpable masses less than 2 cm are not cancer. Management options include observation with serial physical examination and ultrasound, inguinal orchiectomy, and testis-sparing surgery (TSS) through an inguinal incision with intraoperative frozen-section, and patient preference and shared decision-making should be employed in choosing a management strategy. Antibiotics are inappropriate unless signs and symptoms of epididymo-orchitis are present.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute onset of Scrotal pain-without trauma, without antecedent mass [^117L1kG2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as testicular swelling with acute pain and can reflect multiple etiologies including epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the spermatic cord, or torsion of the testicular appendages. Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum and its etiology with imaging is necessary because a delayed diagnosis of torsion for as little as 6 hours can cause irreparable testicular damage. Ultrasound duplex Doppler of the scrotum is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for the acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass in an adult or child. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Epididymitis and orchitis: an overview [^112P6Kr4]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Epididymitis and orchitis are commonly seen in the outpatient setting. Men between 14 and 35 years of age are most often affected, and Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are the most common pathogens in this age group. In other age groups, coliform bacteria are the primary pathogens. Men with epididymitis and orchitis typically present with a gradual onset of scrotal pain and symptoms of lower urinary tract infection, including fever. This presentation helps differentiate epididymitis and orchitis from testicular torsion, which is a surgical emergency. Typical physical findings include a swollen, tender epididymis or testis located in the normal anatomic position with an intact ipsilateral cremasteric reflex. Laboratory studies, including urethral Gram stain, urinalysis and culture, and polymerase chain reaction assay for C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae, help guide therapy. Initial outpatient therapy is empirical and targets the most common pathogens. When C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae are suspected, ceftriaxone and doxycycline are recommended. When coliform bacteria are suspected, ofloxacin or levofloxacin is recommended.

### Variation in the evaluation of testicular conditions across United States pediatric emergency departments [^115HF3Wh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To explore the variation in diagnostic testing and management for males diagnosed with three testicular conditions (testicular torsion, appendix testis torsion, epididymitis/orchitis) using a large pediatric health care database. Diagnostic testing is frequently used in evaluation of the acute scrotum; however, there is likely variability in the use of these tests in the emergency department setting.

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional study of males with the diagnoses of testicular torsion, appendix testis torsion, and epididymitis/orchitis. We identified emergency department patients in the Pediatric Health Information Systems (PHIS) database from 2010 to 2015 using diagnostic and procedure codes from the International Classification of Diseases Codes 9 and 10. Frequencies of diagnoses by demographic characteristics and of procedures and diagnostic testing (ultrasound, urinalysis, urine culture and sexually transmitted infection testing) by age group were calculated. We analyzed testing trends over time.

Results

We identified 17,000 males with the diagnoses of testicular torsion (21.7%), appendix testis torsion (17.9%), and epididymitis/orchitis (60.3%) from 2010 to 2015. There was substantial variation among hospitals in all categories of testing for each of the diagnoses. Overall, ultrasound utilization ranged from 33.1–100% and urinalysis testing ranged from 17.0–84.9% for all conditions. Only urine culture testing decreased over time for all three diagnoses (40.6% in 2010 to 31.5 in 2015).

Conclusions

There was wide variation in the use of diagnostic testing across pediatric hospitals for males with common testicular conditions. Development of evaluation guidelines for the acute scrotum could decrease variation in testing.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^113XstJL]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment not diagnosis — are defined by clinical presentation suggesting infection extending beyond the bladder with fever, other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or hemodynamic instability), flank pain, or costovertebral angle tenderness. Pyelonephritis is encompassed in complicated UTI. UTI with systemic symptoms associated with transurethral, suprapubic, or intermittent catheterization is encompassed in complicated UTI. Patients with complicated UTIs may have an indwelling urinary catheter, neurogenic bladder, urinary obstruction, or urinary retention as an underlying condition, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^116H6mub]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Testicular cancer — clinical presentation is described as most often a painless or painful testicular nodule, mass, enlargement, or induration, with presentations that can mimic epididymitis or orchitis, and other possible findings such as supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, retroperitoneal mass, gynecomastia, venous thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism; a trial of antibiotics is never warranted for a mass suspicious for germ cell tumor (GCT) but can be considered for pain without a mass on further workup.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of pyocele: a rare complication of testicular infection [^113FsJKR]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Epididymo-orchitis is one of the common causes of acute scrotal pain that requires an accurate diagnosis as delayed management can result in complications such as pyocele, abscess, or testicular infarction. Point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic tool in the management of testicular emergencies in the emergency department (ED) including testicular infections CASE REPORT: Here we report a case of an elderly man who presented to the ED with a complaint of right-sided testicular pain and swelling. The diagnosis of pyocele was made using a PoCUS, facilitating an early referral to urology services. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? This case underscores the important role of PoCUS in the timely and accurate diagnosis of pyocele. The prompt identification of pyocele enabled early referral to urology services, highlighting the significance of integrating PoCUS into the management of testicular emergencies in the ED.

### Consensus-based disease definitions for endocrine immune-related adverse events of immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112mLMYL]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Other endocrine irAEs

We recognize that other E-irAEs have been described, such as ir-hypoparathyroidism, ir-orchitis and ir-lipodystrophy. The core working group felt that due to the rarity of these irAEs, the Delphi consensus methodology would not be suitable for development of a consensus statement on the diagnosis and management of these conditions at present.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

Pain occurs in the male genitourinary organs as for any organ system in response to traumatic, infectious, or irritative stimuli. A knowledge and understanding of chronic genitourinary pain can be of great utility to practicing nonurologists. This article provides insight into the medical and surgical management of subacute and chronic pelvic, inguinal, and scrotal pain. The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and medical and surgical treatment options of each are discussed.

Epididymitis

Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting < 6 weeks. Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index of suspicion for spermatic cord (testicular) torsion should be maintained among men who have a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition is a surgical emergency.

Acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (e.g. C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or M. genitalium) or enteric organisms (i.e. Escherichia coli). Acute epididymitis caused by an STI is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic. Acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur among men who are the insertive partner during anal sex. Nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (e.g. benign prostatic hyperplasia). Among older men, nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression. Uncommon infectious causes of nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis (e.g. Fournier's gangrene) should be managed in consultation with a urologist.

Chronic epididymitis is characterized by a ≥ 6-week history of symptoms of discomfort or pain in the scrotum, testicle, or epididymis. Chronic infectious epididymitis is most frequently observed with conditions associated with a granulomatous reaction. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is the most common granulomatous disease affecting the epididymis and should be suspected, especially among men with a known history of or recent exposure to TB. The differential diagnosis of chronic noninfectious epididymitis, sometimes termed orchialgia or epididymalgia, is broad (e.g. trauma, cancer, autoimmune conditions, or idiopathic conditions). Men with this diagnosis should be referred to a urologist for clinical management.

Treatment

To prevent complications and transmission of STIs, presumptive therapy for all sexually active men is indicated at the time of the visit before all laboratory test results are available. Selection of presumptive therapy is based on risk for chlamydial and gonococcal infections or enteric organisms. Treatment goals for acute epididymitis are 1) microbiologic infection cure, 2) improvement of signs and symptoms, 3) prevention of transmission of chlamydia and gonorrhea to others, and 4) decreased potential for chlamydial or gonococcal epididymitis complications (e.g. infertility or chronic pain). Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses (e.g. torsion, testicular infarction, abscess, or necrotizing fasciitis) or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization.

Recommended Regimens for Epididymitis
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia or gonorrhea: Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 times/day for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by chlamydia, gonorrhea, or enteric organisms (men who practice insertive anal sex): Ceftriaxone 500 mg* IM in a single dose
plus
Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
For acute epididymitis most likely caused by enteric organisms only: Levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days
* For persons weighing ≥ 150 kg, 1 g of ceftriaxone should be administered.

Levofloxacin monotherapy should be considered if the infection is most likely caused by enteric organisms only, and gonorrhea has been ruled out by Gram, MB, or GV stain. This includes men who have undergone prostate biopsy, vasectomy, and other urinary tract instrumentation procedures. Treatment should be guided by bacterial cultures and antimicrobial susceptibilities. As an adjunct to therapy, bed rest, scrotal elevation, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are recommended until fever and local inflammation have subsided. Complete resolution of discomfort might not occur for a few weeks after completion of the antibiotic regimen.

Other Management Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be advised to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their partners have been treated and symptoms have resolved. All men with acute epididymitis should be tested for HIV and syphilis.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- acute epididymitis is characterized by pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis lasting < 6 weeks

- sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis

- acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (such as C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or Mycoplasma genitalium) or enteric organisms (such as E. coli)

- acute epididymitis caused by STIs is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic

- acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur in males who are the insertive partner during anal sex

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (such as BPH)

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis in older males is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression.

### Acute epididymitis revisited: impact of molecular diagnostics on etiology and contemporary guideline recommendations [^1139QMUH]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute epididymitis is a common infectious disease of unknown etiology in about 30% of cases with guidelines based on studies published > 15 yr ago.

Objective

To investigate the etiology of acute epididymitis using state-of-the-art methods and to provide rational data for antimicrobial therapy and clinical management.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Between 2007 and 2013, 237 patients (150 antimicrobially naive and 87 antibiotically pretreated) with acute epididymitis underwent comprehensive investigation comprising microbiologic cultures, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) analysis, and PCR detection of 23 viruses. Clinical management followed international guidelines.

Outcome Measures and Statistical Analysis

Etiology, clinical management, and outcome after 3 mo were assessed.

Results and Limitations

A causative pathogen, predominantly Escherichia coli (56%), was identified in 132 antibiotic-naive patients (88%) and 44 pretreated patients (51%); 16S rDNA analysis increased the detection rate by 10%. STIs were present in 34 cases (14%) (25 patients with Chlamydia trachomatis) and were not restricted to a specific age group. Enteroviruses were found in only two patients (1%). In naive patients, cultured bacteria were susceptible to fluoroquinolones and group 3 cephalosporins in > 85% of cases (preateted patients: 42% and 67%, respectively). Primary empirical therapy was continued in 88% of naive patients for 11 d and in 77% of pretreated patients for 13 d with indwelling urinary catheters, rendering patients as high risk for switching. Only six patients (2.5%) underwent semicastration. Prostate-specific antigen levels halved within 3 mo, except in patients who were antibiotic naive and without detected pathogens. Study limitations included a lack of susceptibility testing in cases of STIs.

Conclusions

Even in antimicrobially pretreated patients, acute epididymitis is mainly of bacterial origin. STIs are not limited to patients aged < 35 yr. Viral epididymitis seems a rare condition. Current guideline recommendations on empirical antimicrobial therapy are adequate.

Patient Summary

Patients with acute epididymitis should receive appropriate diagnostics and antimicrobial therapy for safe conservative management.

Follow-Up

Men should be instructed to return to their health care providers if their symptoms do not improve < 72 hours after treatment. Signs and symptoms of epididymitis that do not subside in < 3 days require reevaluation of the diagnosis and therapy. Men who experience swelling and tenderness that persist after completion of antimicrobial therapy should be evaluated for alternative diagnoses, including tumor, abscess, infarction, testicular cancer, TB, and fungal epididymitis.

Management of Sex Partners

Men who have acute sexually transmitted epididymitis confirmed or suspected to be caused by N. gonorrhoeae or C. trachomatis should be instructed to refer all sex partners during the previous 60 days before symptom onset for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment (see Chlamydial Infections; Gonococcal Infections). If the last sexual intercourse was > 60 days before onset of symptoms or diagnosis, the most recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated. Arrangements should be made to link sex partners to care. EPT is an effective strategy for treating sex partners of men who have or are suspected of having chlamydia or gonorrhea for whom linkage to care is anticipated to be delayed (see Partner Services). Partners should be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners are treated and symptoms have resolved.

Special Considerations

Drug Allergy, Intolerance, and Adverse Reactions

The risk for penicillin cross-reactivity is negligible between all third-generation cephalosporins (e.g. ceftriaxone) (see Management of Persons Who Have a History of Penicillin Allergy). Alternative regimens have not been studied; therefore, clinicians should consult an infectious disease specialist if such regimens are required.

HIV Infection

Men with HIV infection who have uncomplicated acute epididymitis should receive the same treatment regimen as those who do not have HIV. Other etiologic agents have been implicated in acute epididymitis among men with HIV, including CMV, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, U. urealyticum, Corynebacterium species, Mycoplasma species, and Mima polymorpha.

### Epididymitis: an overview [^114piZPz]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Inflammation of the epididymis, or epididymitis, is commonly seen in the outpatient setting. Etiology and treatment are based on patient age and the likely causative organisms. Epididymitis presents as the gradual onset of posterior scrotal pain that may be accompanied by urinary symptoms such as dysuria and urinary frequency. Physical findings include a swollen and tender epididymis with the testis in an anatomically normal position. Although the etiology is largely unknown, reflux of urine into the ejaculatory ducts is considered the most common cause of epididymitis in children younger than 14 years. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are the most common pathogens in sexually active males 14 to 35 years of age, and a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone with 10 days of oral doxycycline is the treatment of choice in this age group. In men who practice insertive anal intercourse, an enteric organism is also likely, and ceftriaxone with 10 days of oral levofloxacin or ofloxacin is the recommended treatment regimen. In men older than 35 years, epididymitis is usually caused by enteric bacteria transported by reflux of urine into the ejaculatory ducts secondary to bladder outlet obstruction; levofloxacin or ofloxacin alone is sufficient to treat these infections. Because untreated acute epididymitis can lead to infertility and chronic scrotal pain, recognition and therapy are vital to reduce patient morbidity.

Management of Serious BCG Complications

Acute, localized irritative toxicities of TICE BCG may be accompanied by systemic manifestations, consistent with a "flu-like" syndrome. Systemic adverse effects of 1 to 2 days' duration such as malaise, fever, and chills often reflect hypersensitivity reactions. However, symptoms such as fever of ≥ 38.5°C (101.3°F), or acute localized inflammation such as epididymitis, prostatitis, or orchitis persisting longer than 2 to 3 days suggest active infection, and evaluation for serious infectious complication should be considered.

In patients who develop persistent fever or experience an acute febrile illness consistent with BCG infection, 2 or more antimycobacterial agents should be administered while diagnostic evaluation, including cultures, is conducted. BCG treatment should be discontinued. Negative cultures do not necessarily rule out infection. Physicians using this product should be familiar with the literature on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of BCG-related complications and, when appropriate, should consult an infectious disease specialist or other physician with experience in the diagnosis and treatment of mycobacterial infections.

TICE BCG is sensitive to the most commonly used antituberculous agents (isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol). TICE BCG is not sensitive to pyrazinamide.

### European Association of Urology-European society of paediatric urology guidelines on paediatric urology: summary of 2024 updates. part II [^115W97Lf]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

We present a summary of part II of the 2024 update of the European Association of Urology (EAU)/European Society of Paediatric Urology (ESPU) guidelines on paediatric urology. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of a number of urological conditions in the paediatric population. The aim is to provide practical recommendations for clinical management of these conditions with a focus on diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.

Methods

For the guidelines update, new and relevant evidence was identified, collated, and appraised via a structured assessment of the literature. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries. Recommendations in the guidelines were developed by the panel to prioritise clinically important care decisions. The strength of each recommendation was determined according to a balance between desirable and undesirable consequences of alternative management strategies, the quality of the evidence (including the certainty of estimates), and the nature and variability of patient values and preferences.

Key Findings and Limitations

Key recommendations emphasise the importance of thorough diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up for patients with the conditions outlines. The guidelines stress the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to treatment and the importance of shared decision-making with patients and their guardians/caregivers. The summary provides evidence-based standards for management of undescended testes, testicular tumours in prepubertal boys, acute scrotum, hypospadias, congenital penile curvature, urinary tract infections, daytime lower urinary tract conditions, urachal remnants, and transitional urology.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

Part II of the 2024 EAU/ESPU guidelines provides updated guidance for evidence-based management of a number of paediatric urological conditions, with recommendations designed for effective integration into clinical practice.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

Chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP) — definition, burden, presentation, and evaluation are described as follows: "CSCP or chronic testicular pain or chronic orchialgia is defined as unilateral scrotal pain interfering with activities of daily living that has persisted for greater than three months of time", and it "is usually diagnosed after excluding other potential causes (e.g., testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, abscess, testicular mass, varicocele)". The condition's impact is noted as "CSCP constitutes approximately 2.5% to 4.8% of all urology visits and is believed to affect over 100,000 men annually". Patients often have tenderness and neuropathic features: "The pain is commonly described in the testes with tenderness in the epididymis and/or spermatic cord appreciated on physical examination", and "Neuropathic changes such as hypersensitivity or hyperalgesia in the region of the groin may accompany these findings", with a fluctuating course — "The pain typically waxes and wanes". Care "requires a multi-disciplinary approach to management", and "Managing patient expectations through supportive counseling during this path is important to overall success". For workup, "potential underlying causes should be ruled out with a thorough physical exam and detailed history", and examples include "post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS), post-inguinal hernia repair, pain caused by trauma, after abdominal surgery, radiation, and radicular pain from spinal or sacral issues".

Ischemic orchitis/testicular atrophy

Statements

Recommendations

Orchitis is defined as postoperative inflammation of the testicle occurring within 1–5 days after surgery. It is felt to be due to acute thrombosis of the delicate venous pampiniform plexus rather than an arterial injury [25, 26]. It is most common after an inguinal scrotal herniorrhaphy when extensive dissection of the spermatic cord has been performed. The presenting symptoms are a low-grade fever with a painful, enlarged, firm testicle. The differential diagnosis includes scrotal hematoma and testicular torsion. Management is supportive with scrotal support and anti-inflammatory agents. Duplex ultrasound scanning is useful when infarction is suspected. Ischemic orchitis may result in testicular necrosis within days or have a slower course resulting in testicular atrophy during a period of several months. Fortunately most patients recover from ischemic orchitis uneventfully without testicular atrophy. Interestingly, most patients who develop testicular atrophy do not give a history of orchitis. It is not yet known whether laparoscopy will have an advantage over conventional surgery because of the more proximal dissection in the preperitoneal space. However, in one large analysis of a prospectively maintained database containing of 8,050 TAPP laparoscopic hernia repairs, orchitis and testicular atrophy was reported to be extremely low at 0.1 and 0.05% respectively. Interestingly, this group removes all indirect sacs despite the size except in rare circumstances of excessive inflammation [3]. Nevertheless, based primarily of the extensive writings of the late George Wantz, undue dissection of the cord and testicle to remove an indirect inguinal hernia sac completely is not recommended [25, 27–30]. The hernia sac can be divided at a convenient point in the inguinal canal with the distal aspect left open. The proximal sac is then dissected from the cord structures and ligated.

### Scrotal masses [^114CB4wZ]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography, and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses.

### Testicular infarction and spontaneous scrotal rupture secondary to acute epididymo-orchitis [^1143wztB]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Epididymo-orchitis is a common cause of acute unilateral testicular pain. Both infectious or non-infectious causes have been proposed and, rarely, testicular abscess formation and even infarction can occur as a severe complication. We present here a case of acute epididymo-orchitis leading to testicular abscess formation, infarction and spontaneous rupture through the scrotal wall despite appropriate antibiotic treatments. Orchidectomy and partial scrotectomy were performed during surgical exploration for management of the non-viable testis and associated scrotal sinus. Clinical vigilance is important to prevent this complication by close clinical follow up with ultrasonography and even early surgical decompression to prevent testicular loss.

### Case report on secondary testicular necrosis due to fulminant epididymitis: ultrasonographic evaluation and diagnosis [^111DXEzz]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Epididymitis is a common condition with possible severe complications. If epididymitis is suspected we suggest to start medical treatment promptly. In our experience, scrotal ultrasound should be performed for the diagnosis of epididymitis and orchitis and should be repeated if there is a suspicion of doubtful blood supply to the testicle. This case provides the first clinical evidence to support associated funiculitis in this disease. Also this case stresses the usefulness of ultrasonography in the diagnosis and management of testicular necrosis secondary to epididymitis/ epididymo-orchitis.

### Chronic scrotal pain syndrome: management among urologists in Switzerland [^111A7HkQ]. European Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction and Objectives

Management of patients presenting with chronic or recurrent pain located in the scrotum is often very challenging. Evidence-based literature and clinical practice guidelines for the management of chronic scrotal pain syndrome (CSPS) are not available. We assessed the current perception and management of chronic scrotal pain syndrome by urologists in Switzerland.

Methods

In July 2004, all the members of the Swiss Society of Urology received a questionnaire focusing on diagnostic and treatment practices for the management of chronic scrotal pain syndrome. The questionnaire consisted of 6 topics concerning practice setting, incidence, aetiology, diagnostics, therapy and treatment success rate.

Results

103 questionnaires were completed (63%). All but 2 (2%) responding Swiss urologists see a mean of 6.5 new patients per month (range 1–30). 79% of Swiss urologists consider CSPS to be infectious or post-infectious in nature. Furthermore, a history of vasectomy, psychosomatic disorders, chronic prostatitis, neuromuscular disorders, a history of inguinal surgery, and idiopathic aetiology were mentioned in decreasing order. The most commonly used examinations are urinalysis in 96% and ultrasound in 93%. Additional assessments include blood sampling, duplex ultrasound, assessment for coexisting chronic prostatitis, and referral to an Orthopaedist, Rheumatologist or Psychiatrist. The predominant medication prescribed for CSPS is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent given for a mean of 15.5 days. An antibiotic trial is prescribed by 82% for a mean of 20.5 days. 74% consider epididymectomy the treatment option of choice in recurrence. Inguinal orchiectomy is performed by 7%, microsurgical spermatic cord denervation is performed by 6% of surgeons. Mean estimated recurrence rate after conservative treatment is 48% and thus higher than after epididymectomy with 18%.

Conclusions

Chronic pain located in the scrotum is a common clinical condition in Switzerland. Most urologists consider an infection or post-infectious alterations as the predominant aetiology for CSPS. Consequently, an antibiotic trial in combination with an anti-inflammatory agent is prescribed as first-line therapy. Recurrence rates for conservative treatment are estimated high which is in contradiction to the presumed aetiology. Therefore, further evaluation of this poorly described disease complex is required.

### Scrotal pain in the absence of torsion; need for vigilance [^1127KrQs]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Epididymitis is a common presentation of acute testicular pain seen in the emergency department, the differential diagnosis being testicular torsion. The vast majority of young men with epididymitis have an infective aetiology and this settle with antibiotic treatment. The clinical course of a patient who presented with testicular pain is described. At ultrasonography, the patient was found to have the uncommon condition of testicular microlithiasis, a condition that has been linked to malignant disease. Emergency doctors should be aware of the potential consequences of returning scrotal pain consistent with epididymitis to the community on antibiotic treatment alone. All patients with probable epididymitis should have either a scrotal ultrasound or specialist follow up.

### Spermatic cord abscess: a rare complication of epididymo-orchitis, the diagnosis and management [^111oYqfK]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

We present a case of a 54-year-old man who had a history of poorly controlled diabetes and end-stage renal failure on haemodialysis. He presented with an acute left groin swelling that was diagnosed to be a rare occurrence of spermatic cord abscess. Two months prior to this, he had had an episode of bacterial epididymo-orchitis that was treated with oral antibiotics. An urgent CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out incarcerated inguinal hernia. The spermatic cord abscess was initially managed with appropriate intravenous antibiotics and ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. When the pus eventually accumulated in the scrotum, an open incision and drainage of the scrotum was also performed. He achieved complete resolution after 2 months.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111bLhC9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Classification and causes of hypogonadism — definitions and therapeutic implications: Causes of hypogonadism may be organic or functional, a distinction that has important clinical implications. Organic hypogonadism (also referred to as "classical" hypogonadism) is caused by a congenital, structural, or destructive disorder that results in permanent hypothalamic, pituitary, or testicular dysfunction (primary or secondary hypogonadism). In contrast, functional hypogonadism is caused by conditions that suppress gonadotropin and T concentrations but that are potentially reversible with treatment of the underlying etiology. The classification of hypogonadism as primary or secondary has therapeutic implications, as spermatogenesis can be stimulated and fertility can be restored with appropriate gonadotropin therapy in patients with secondary hypogonadism but not in patients with primary hypogonadism. Additionally, evaluating secondary hypogonadism may uncover a deficiency/excess of other pituitary hormones or a hypothalamic or pituitary tumor that may require management, and secondary hypogonadism can result from functional causes (e.g., obesity, opioids, or systemic illness) that might be reversible by treating the underlying condition or discontinuing the offending medication. Table 1 lists causes under Primary Hypogonadism — Organic (e.g. KS; Cryptorchidism; Some types of cancer chemotherapy, testicular irradiation/damage, orchiectomy; Orchitis; Testicular trauma, torsion; Advanced age) and Functional (e.g. Medications [androgen synthesis inhibitors]), and under Secondary Hypogonadism — Organic (e.g. Hypothalamic/pituitary tumor; Iron overload syndromes; Infiltrative/destructive disease of hypothalamus/pituitary; Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism) and Functional (e.g. Hyperprolactinemia; Opioids, anabolic steroid use, glucocorticoids; Nutritional deficiency/excessive exercise; Severe obesity, some sleep disorders; Organ failure [liver, heart, and lung]; Comorbid illness associated with aging).

### National recommendations for the management of children and young people with IgA vasculitis: a best available evidence, group agreement-based approach [^1155xE4v]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objective

IgA vasculitis (IgAV) is the most frequently experienced subtype of vasculitis seen in children. Most children fully recover, however, complications including chronic kidney disease are recognised. The aim of this project was to use a best available evidence, group agreement, based approach to develop national recommendations for the initial management of IgAV and its associated complications.

Methods

A fully representative multiprofessional guideline development group (GDG), consisting of 28 members, was formed and met monthly. Graded recommendations were generated using nationally accredited methods, which included a predefined scope, open consultation, systematic literature review, evidence appraisal, review of national or international guidelines and a period of open consultation. Audit measures and research priorities were incorporated.

Results

The IgAV GDG met over a 14-month period. A total of 82 papers were relevant for evidence synthesis. For the initial management, four topic areas were identified with five key questions generating six graded recommendations related to classification, specialist referral and musculoskeletal involvement. For the associated complications, five topic areas with 12 key questions generated 15 graded recommendations covering nephritis, gastrointestinal and testicular involvement, atypical disease and follow-up. Open consultation feedback was incorporated. The guidelines were endorsed by the UK Kidney Association and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and are available online.

Conclusion

Despite IgAV being a rare disease with limited evidence, a national standardised approach to the clinical management for children and young people has been achieved. This should unite approaches to care and act as a foundation for improvement.

### The patient with chronic epididymitis: characterization of an enigmatic syndrome [^117FykPe]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We provide a baseline description of men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, explore relevant associations that may be important etiological factors and suggest a classification system and specific symptom assessment tool.

Materials and Methods

Men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, described as symptoms of discomfort or pain at least 3 months in duration in the scrotum, testicle or epididymis localized to 1 or each epididymis on clinical examination, completed an extensive specific clinical inventory questionnaire. Evaluation included demographics, preceding and concurrent clinical history, duration since diagnosis, associated and previous clinical associations, frequency and severity of prostatitis, voiding and sexual symptoms, specific and general quality of life, and history of investigation and/or treatment for the condition. Volunteers with no past or concurrent history of chronic epididymitis completed similar clinical inventory questionnaires.

Results

A total of 50 consecutive men 21 to 83 years old (average age 46) diagnosed with chronic epididymitis who had an average symptom duration of 4.9 years (range 0.25 to 29) were enrolled in the study. The average pain score plus or minus standard deviation was 4.7 ± 2.1 (range 0 to 10). Of the men 16% were reasonably satisfied with their quality of life. Although 66% of the patients thought about the symptoms some or a lot, in only 30% did symptoms keep them from doing the kinds of things that they would usually do. The most common previous therapies recollected by the patients were antibiotics (74%) and anti-inflammatory agents (36%). At the time of the survey 26% of the men were on some type of pain medication. There were no significant epidemiological, sexual, medical or associated factors that differentiated patients with chronic epididymitis from the 20 controls. A chronic epididymitis classification system (inflammatory, obstructive and epididymalgia) and a symptom assessment index based on assessing pain and quality of life-impact was developed.

Conclusions

This comprehensive clinical survey of men diagnosed with chronic epididymitis is the first step for defining and characterizing this particular population. Development of a classification system and symptom assessment index may direct further studies in the etiology, epidemiology and management of chronic epididymitis.

### Study protocol: patient reported outcomes for bladder management strategies in spinal cord injury [^114FLtCt]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Study procedures

The study procedures are summarized in Fig. 1. Upon enrollment participants will undergo an interview with a trained study coordinator gathering information including demographics, SCI injury specifics, pertinent past medical and surgical history, past and current bladder management, SCI-related complications, and urologic follow-up over time. If acute rehabilitation location is known, records will be obtained and SCI injury specifics and management will be confirmed. After the enrollment interview participants will answer a panel of questionnaires designed to assess many aspects of patient reported bladder outcomes and QoL. These questionnaires were deemed relevant by investigators and the Patient Advisory Panel. Every three months for the next 12 months after enrollment, the same panel of questions will be electronically sent to the participants, along with non-validated questions about changes in bladder management or urologic complications occurring in the intervening 3 months.

Fig. 1
Summary of study procedures

Longitudinal follow-up will occur for 12 months. A subject can potentially switch bladder-management strategy group during the course of the follow-up or experience a urologic complication. Figure 2 illustrates possible scenarios using 3 example patients. QoL data will not be collected within 3 months of a major surgery (bladder augmentation, urinary diversion), however, other interventions such as first-time Onabotulinum toxin A injection will be assessed at the next scheduled 3-month interval after the intervention. Urinary complications will be assessed in a similar fashion. These complications will include but are not limited to: admission for UTI/pyelonephritis, urinary stone episode, any urological complication (orchitis, gross hematuria, etc.), need for surgical treatment to treat complications of previous surgery. We estimate that switching bladder-management strategy (for example, participant 1 in Fig. 2) could happen for approximately 10–15% of patients based upon the experience of the research team.

### Cutting-edge issues in autoimmune orchitis [^115nd1PX]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Autoimmune orchitis is a relevant cause of decreased fecundity in males, and it is defined as a direct aggression to the testis with the concomitant presence of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA). The presence of these specific antibodies has been observed in approximately 5–12% of infertile male partners. Primary autoimmune orchitis is defined by isolated infertility with ASA but without evidence of a systemic disease. Secondary causes of orchitis and/or testicular vasculitis are uniformly associated with autoimmune diseases, mainly in primary vasculitis such as polyarteritis nodosa, Behçet's disease, and Henoch-Schönlein purpura. The overall frequencies of acute orchitis and ASA in rheumatic diseases are 2–31% and 0–50%, respectively. The pathogenesis of primary/secondary autoimmune orchitis is not completely understood but probably involves the access of immune cells to the testicular microenvironment due to inflammation, infection or trauma, leading to apoptosis of spermatocytes and spermatids. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs are indicated in autoimmune orchitis-associated active systemic autoimmune diseases. However, there are no standardized treatment options, and the real significance of ASA in infertile men is still controversial. Assisted reproductive technologies such as intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) are therapeutic options for male infertility associated with these autoantibodies. ICSI is considered to be the best choice for patients with severe sperm autoimmunity, particularly in males with low semen counts or motility.

American Urological Association — scrotal injury evaluation and management: For blunt scrotal injuries, clinicians should perform scrotal ultrasonography for most patients having findings suggestive of testicular rupture (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). For most penetrating scrotal injuries, clinicians should perform prompt surgical exploration with repair or orchiectomy (when non-salvageable) given the high rate of testicular injury and limited sensitivity of ultrasound in this setting (Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade C). Surgeons should perform scrotal exploration and debridement with tunical closure (when possible) or orchiectomy (when non-salvageable) in patients with suspected testicular rupture (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B).

### Diagnosis and classification of autoimmune orchitis [^114yoeGH]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune orchitis is characterized by testis inflammation and the presence of specific antisperm antibodies (ASA). It is classified in two categories. Primary autoimmune orchitis is defined by infertility and asymptomatic orchitis associated with ASA (100%) directed to the basement membrane or seminiferous tubules in infertile men, without any systemic disease and usually asymptomatic. Secondary autoimmune orchitis is characterized by symptomatic orchitis and/or testicular vasculiti's associated with a systemic autoimmune disease, particularly vasculitis. These patients typically demonstrate testicular pain, erythema and/or swelling. ASA in secondary autoimmune orchitis have been reported in up to 50% of patients, especially in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. The pathogenesis of primary as well as secondary autoimmune orchitis is still unknown. Although the etiology is likely to be multifactorial, testicular inflammation, infection or trauma may induce T cell response with pro-inflammatory cytokine production with a consequent blood-testis-barrier permeability alteration, ASA production and apoptosis of spermatocytes and spermatids. ASA is known to cause immobilization and/or agglutination of spermatozoa, which may block sperm-egg interaction resulting in infertility. Assisted reproduction has been used as an efficient option in primary cases and immunosuppressive therapy for secondary autoimmune orchitis, although there is no double-blind, randomized trial to confirm the efficacy of any treatment regimens for these conditions.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^114j2S3K]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Fournier gangrene — this variant of necrotizing soft tissue infection involves the scrotum and penis or vulva; the average age at onset is 50–60 years, and eighty percent of patients have significant underlying diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus; early features include fever, pain, erythema, and swelling of the genitalia, with progression to cutaneous necrosis and crepitus indicating gas in soft tissue; disease is usually limited to skin and subcutaneous tissue with testes, glans penis, and spermatic cord typically spared, may extend to the perineum and anterior abdominal wall, and most cases are caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora, with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species sometimes present and S. aureus known to cause this infection as the sole pathogen; management requires prompt, aggressive surgical debridement to remove all necrotic tissue while sparing deeper structures when possible.

### Bacillus calmette-guerin (Tice bcg) [^115oAU8s]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

BCG LIVE (TICE BCG) is not a vaccine for the prevention of cancer. BCG Vaccine, not BCG LIVE (TICE BCG), should be used for the prevention of tuberculosis. For vaccination use, refer to BCG Vaccine prescribing information.

Handling Precautions

TICE BCG is an infectious agent. Physicians using this product should be familiar with the literature on the prevention and treatment of BCG-related complications, and should be prepared in such emergencies to contact an infectious disease specialist with experience in treating the infectious complications of intravesical BCG. The treatment of the infectious complications of BCG requires long-term, multiple-drug antibiotic therapy. Special culture media are required for mycobacteria, and physicians administering intravesical BCG or those caring for these patients should have these media readily available.

BCG Infection

Instillation of TICE BCG with an actively bleeding mucosa may promote systemic BCG infection. Treatment should be postponed for at least 1 week following transurethral resection, biopsy, traumatic catheterization, or gross hematuria.

Systemic BCG Reaction

Deaths have been reported as a result of systemic BCG infection and sepsis.2,3Patients should be monitored for the presence of symptoms and signs of toxicity after each intravesical treatment. Febrile episodes with flu-like symptoms lasting more than 72 hours, fever ≥ 103°F, systemic manifestations increasing in intensity with repeated instillations, or persistent abnormalities of liver function tests suggest systemic BCG infection and may require antituberculous therapy. Local symptoms (prostatitis, epididymitis, orchitis) lasting more than 2 to 3 days may also suggest active infection (see WARNINGS, Management of Serious BCG Complications section).

Laboratory Tests

The use of TICE BCG may cause tuberculin sensitivity. Since this is a valuable aid in the diagnosis of tuberculosis, it is advisable to determine the tuberculin reactivity by PPD skin testing before treatment.

Antimicrobial Therapy

Intravesical instillations of BCG should be postponed during treatment with antibiotics, since antimicrobial therapy may interfere with the effectiveness of TICE BCG (see PRECAUTIONS). TICE BCG should not be used in individuals with concurrent infections.

Bladder Capacity

Small bladder capacity has been associated with increased risk of severe local reactions and should be considered in deciding to use TICE BCG therapy.

### Unilateral vasectomy for intractable epididiymo-orchitis in patients with anorectal malformation [^116xBak3]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Male patients treated for anorectal malformations (ARM) and recto-urethral fistula (RUF) tend to develop recurrent epididymo-orchitis (EO) which occurs approximately in 20% of all them. The optimal management of this condition is unclear because of the extreme its rarity and the unavailability of detailed analysis in literature. To date the majority of this patients benefits from medical treatment and symptoms reduce over time but few data have been published in literature about management of patients with intractable EO.

Objective

To describe the efficacy of unilateral vasectomy in patients operated on for anorectal malformations with RUF and affected by intractable EO.

Study Design

We present five patients who met the criteria for intractable EO, and followed at our centre four of whom have undergone unilateral vasectomy.

Results

The first episode of EO presented at 42,00 mos ± 29.39. Initially, patients were all managed with analgesics and antibiotics. For the failure of therapy, five patients were all offered unilateral vasectomy but only four families accepted procedure. Surgical treatment was performed as a day case without complications. Postoperative follow up was 88,50 mos ± 68.36. Prompt and durable resolution of symptoms was observed.

Discussion

The long-term effects of recurrent EO in ARM are often underestimated. Prompt and appropriate intervention should prevent this undesirable sequela. Unfortunately, the optimal management of this complication is unclear, partly because of its extreme rarity. The established management needs to follow the route of correcting underlying anomalies and providing long-term analgesic and antibiotics but this may have undesired side effects. We therefore offered families vasectomy for complete symptom resolution and/or drug withdrawal. Vasectomy, as a form of treatment for, can be justified if it can prevent pain, infection and destruction of the testes. Early vasectomy may save enough functional testis tissue.

Conclusion

To date, the only available treatment to achieve definitive resolution of symptoms in intractable unilateral EO is vasectomy. Long-term effects of such procedure on fertility are unknown. The treatment of recurrent EO in cases without site predilection remains a matter of contention.

### Case report on secondary testicular necrosis due to fulminant epididymitis: ultrasonographic evaluation and diagnosis [^1168jrcR]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute scrotal pain is frequently encountered at the emergency department. The differential diagnosis is broad, with sometimes difficult differentiation. Different causes consist of acute epididymitis, testicular torsion, Fournier's gangrene, torsion of appendix testis, trauma, post-vasectomy pain, inguinal hernia, mumps orchitis, testicular cancer, immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis, and acute idiopathic scrotal edema. Due to the extensive list of diagnosis the standard of care is to identify causes that need immediate action. Testicular torsion and Fournier's gangrene are examples needing urgent surgical intervention. In acute epididymitis/ epididymo-orchitis medical treatment should start promptly, ultrasonography can help to prove the diagnosis and help with the prognosis of this infection.

Testicular torsion and major epididymo-orchitis can be difficult to distinguish. This distinction is made on blood results with infectious episodes resulting in higher C-reactive protein levels. One rare complication in epididymitis is testicular necrosis, with an incidence of 1–2% of epididymitis cases. In case of post-infectious necrosis, the presentation to surgery-time was significantly longer than in testicular torsion.

On ultrasonography epididymo-orchitis necrosis can be recognized by a juxta-epididymal string-of-bead sign, contrasting the whirlpool/knot sign, seen in testicular torsion. Reduction of color doppler signalling with high intratesticular resistive indices and negative diastolic flow increase the likelihood of testicular necrosis associated with epididymo-orchitis. Further assessment of suspected testicular necrosis and its vascularity can be performed using ultrasound microbubble contrast.

Surgical management in necrosed testis is an orchiectomy. Fasciotomy in early hypoperfusion has been suggested in the past, but no clinical outcomes have been reported. This is therefore not routinely done. Partial hypoperfusion and necrosis of the testis can be treated conservatively with close follow-up.

A Medline search was initiated to discuss similar cases and their treatment approaches using MeSH terms: testis, orchitis, epididymitis, necrosis and infection. There is currently a lack of data and clinical guidance in patients presenting with these complications. Together with the available literature, this case report can support clinicians in their daily practise.

### Germ cell testicular tumors-contemporary diagnosis, staging and management of localized and advanced disease [^114sajLF]. Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Germ cell testicular tumors are the most commonly diagnosed cancer in young men, with cure rates exceeding 95%. Clinical stage 1 disease is the most common manifestation, with radical orchiectomy curing the majority of Clinical stage 1 patients, making active surveillance the treatment of choice, with a cancer specific survival nearing 100% and low relapse rates. However, in metastatic disease, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are curative options. Chemotherapy remains the mainstay of therapy for advanced disease with surgical management of residual disease. Patients with advanced disease should be treated in high volume experienced academic centers with multidisciplinary teams. Research exploring refinement of diagnosis and treatment, and lowering treatment burden is underway.

### Evaluation of scrotal masses [^114b3aAa]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Scrotal masses are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from benign conditions to those requiring emergent surgical intervention. Painful scrotal masses require urgent evaluation. Characteristics that suggest testicular torsion include rapid symptom onset, nausea and vomiting, high position of the testicle, and abnormal cremasteric reflex. Doppler ultrasonography or surgical exploration is required to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical repair must occur within six hours of symptom onset to reliably salvage the testicle. Epididymitis/orchitis have a slower onset and are associated with a C-reactive protein level greater than 24 mg per L (228.6 nmol per L) and increased blood flow on ultrasonography. Acute onset of pain with near normal physical examination and ultrasound findings is consistent with torsion of the testicular appendage. Testicular malignancies cause pain in 15% of cases. If ultrasonography shows an intratesticular mass, timely urology referral is indicated. Inguinal hernias are palpated separate to the testicle and can cause pain. Emergent surgery is indicated for a strangulated hernia. Hydrocele, varicocele, and scrotal skin lesions may be managed in nonurgent settings. A biopsy should be performed to rule out cancer in patients with scrotal skin lesions that are erosive, vascular, hyperkeratotic, or nonhealing, or that change color or have irregular borders.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^112z9Pyc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Epididymitis and orchitis — diagnostic evaluation emphasizes age-related etiologies and initial testing: Epididymitis in sexually active post pubertal boys and men under 35 years of age is most frequently associated with Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, while in men over 35 years of age, E. coli (and other Enterobacterales), Pseudomonas spp., and gram-positive organisms that cause UTI and prostatitis may also cause invasive infections of the epididymis and testis; urinalysis, urine culture, and a urine sample for nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for sexually transmitted infections are recommended, and NAAT testing is the most sensitive method to detect organisms associated with GC and CT; additional diagnostic testing and follow-up is recommended if symptoms do not improve within 48–72 hours of initiation of antibiotic therapy; with the exception of mumps, isolated orchitis without epididymitis is uncommon in adults, and diagnostic testing includes the detection of mumps virus RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), IgM serology for mumps antibodies, or acute and convalescent IgG serology; other viral causes, primarily in children and adolescents, include Coxsackie virus, rubella virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella-zoster virus.

### Influence of bladder management on epididymo-orchitis in patients with spinal cord injury: clean intermittent catheterization is a risk factor for epididymo-orchitis [^112oEj6x]. Spinal Cord (2006). Low credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective study, based on cases of spinal cord injury (SCI).

Objectives

To establish hazard ratios for risk of epididymo-orchitis in SCI.

Setting

South Korea.

Methods

A total of 140 male patients injured before 1987 were eligible for this investigation and have been followed up on a yearly basis from January 1987 to December 2003.

Results

The average age at which the lesion occurred was 24.8 years old (range, 18–53). The average time since SCI was 16.9 years (range, 1–37). A total of 34 lesions (24.3%) were complete and 106 (75.7%) were incomplete. Over the 17 years, 39 patients (27.9%) were diagnosed with epididymo-orchitis. Epididymo-orchitis was more common for patients with a history of urethral stricture (66.7 versus 25.2%, P = 0.014). We also found that epididymo-orchitis was more common for patients on clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) than with indwelling urethral catheterization (42.2% versus 8.3%, P = 0.030). In multivariate analysis, patients on CIC had a 7.0-fold higher risk (odds ratio, 6.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.26–38.53; P = 0.026); however, a history of urethral stricture lost statistical significance (P = 0.074). For other variables, no positive association with epididymo-orchitis was observed.

Conclusions

In this study, CIC was an independent risk factor for the development of epididymo-orchitis in patients with SCI. In addition, our findings suggest that urethral stricture may be a contributing factor for the development of epididymo-orchitis in these patients. Correct instructions about CIC are of utmost importance.

### Mumps complications and effects of mumps vaccination, england and wales, 2002–2006 [^117UJPZJ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

The mumps outbreak in England and Wales led to a clear increase in hospitalizations caused by mumps complications, which mirrored the outbreak curve. From April 1, 2002, through March 31, 2006, the estimated hospitalization rate from HES data was 6.1% overall. A much lower rate of hospitalization (2.9%) was derived from the enhanced surveillance forms. In contrast, the rate of mumps orchitis estimated from HES data was lower than that found by enhanced surveillance. This may be explained by the fact that most mumps orchitis cases were managed in primary care. Most reported case-patients with mumps meningitis and pancreatitis were admitted to the hospital, but the estimated rate of these complications was low (< 0.5%) by using either method.

On the basis of the rate of hospital episodes and data from enhanced surveillance, the complication rates observed here are low in comparison to results of studies from the prevaccine era. Previously published complication rates for mumps suggest that orchitis is the most common complication in 15%–30% of adult men with mumps. Mumps meningitis has been reported in 1%–10%, mumps pancreatitis in 4%, and mumps oophoritis in 5% of persons with mumps. The much lower rates observed in our study likely reflect the fact that the denominator is derived from population-based surveillance which aims to capture all cases of diagnosed mumps. Because the United Kingdom provides free universal access to primary care, we were able to ascertain milder cases that may not have been included in studies that use secondary care data or in studies conducted in other countries.

### Doxyclycline hyclate (doxycycline hyclate) [^1112L51J]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2 Dosage in Adult Patients

● The usual dosage of doxycycline hyclate tablets is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg daily. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours.

● In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

● For certain selected specific indications, the recommended duration or dosage and duration of doxycycline hyclate tablets in adult patients are as follows:

Streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.
Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis: 100 mg by mouth twice-a-day for 7 days.
Uncomplicated gonococcal infections in adults (except anorectal infections in men): 100 mg, by mouth, twice-a-day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.
Nongonococcal urethritis (NGU) caused by C. trachomatis and U. urealyticum: 100 mg by mouth twice-a-day for 7 days.
Syphilis - early: Patients who are allergic to penicillin should be treated with doxycycline 100 mg by mouth twice-a-day for 2 weeks.
Syphilis of more than one year's duration: Patients who are allergic to penicillin should be treated with doxycycline 100 mg by mouth twice-a-day for 4 weeks.
Acute epididymo-orchitis caused by N. gonorrhoeae: 100 mg by mouth, twice-a-day for at least 10 days.
Acute epididymo-orchitis caused by C. trachomatis: 100 mg, by mouth, twice-a-day for at least 10 days.

### Acute epididymitis in boys: evidence of a post-infectious etiology [^11782Dd4]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We studied the etiology and management of pediatric epididymitis.

Material and Methods

We performed 1-year prospective study in children with epididymitis. All patients underwent an immediate sonographic study of the scrotum. Microbiological studies included throat and urine cultures as well as viral cultures of nasopharyngeal and stool specimens. Serological tests for group A streptococcus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae as well as for enteroviruses, adenoviruses, influenza and parainfluenza viruses in the appropriate seasons were performed in patients and controls.

Results

A total of 44 patients 2 to 14 years old (mean age 9.8 ± 3.2) were studied. Hospital admissions peaked during the summer and winter. The incidence of epididymitis was around 1.2/1,000 boys yearly. One patient had familial Mediterranean fever and another had Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Microbiological studies of the urine, throat, nasopharynx and stool yielded bacterial/viral growth in 9 patients (20.4%). Serological studies revealed significantly elevated titers to certain pathogens in patients with epididymitis compared with controls, including M. pneumoniae (53% vs 20%), enteroviruses (62.5% vs 10%) and adenoviruses (20% vs 0%). Most patients were treated with analgesics and 3 patients received antibiotics intravenously. Systemic and local signs and symptoms resolved gradually in 1 to 7 days.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that epididymitis in boys is not rare and it is mostly an inflammatory phenomenon (presumably post-infectious) with a benign course. The treatment of these patients is basically with analgesics with a little role for antibiotics.

### Urotrauma guideline 2020: AUA guideline [^116kcya3]. The Journal of Urology (2021). High credibility.

Guideline Statement 30c — suspected testicular rupture management states that surgeons should perform scrotal exploration and debridement with tunical closure (when possible) or orchiectomy (when non-salvageable) in patients with suspected testicular rupture (Standard; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Testicular rupture after blunt or penetrating scrotal trauma may be suggested by scrotal ecchymosis and swelling or difficulty in identifying the contours of the testicle on physical exam; early exploration and repair may prevent complications, such as ischemic atrophy of the testis and infection; repair of the ruptured testis by debriding non-viable tissue and closing the tunica albuginea is preferred when possible, and tunica vaginalis flap or graft may be used to provide closure when the tunica albuginea cannot be closed primarily.

### Are antibiotics necessary for pediatric epididymitis? [^116sJFvD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the percentage of cases of epididymitis in pediatric patients that is of bacterial cause and to identify factors that predict a positive urine culture.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with acute epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis in 1 pediatric emergency department for 11 years. Charts were reviewed for historical, physical, laboratory, and radiologic data. A positive urine culture was used to identify patients with a bacterial cause of epididymitis.

Results

A total of 160 patient records were initially identified as having a diagnosis of epididymitis; of these, 20 met exclusion criteria or did not have records available for review and 140 cases of epididymitis were reviewed. Patients' age ranged from 2 months to 17 years, with a median age of 11 years. Of these patients, 91% received empiric antibiotic therapy. Also, of these patients, 97 (69%) had a urine culture sent, of whom 4 (4.1%; 95% confidence interval, 1.1%-10.2%) were positive. Of the 4 positive urine cultures, 3 had organisms not sensitive to usual empiric therapy for urinary tract infections. The boys with positive urine cultures were not significantly different from the other patients in age, maximum temperature, or number of white blood cells on urinalysis.

Conclusions

Given the low incidence of urinary tract infections in boys with epididymitis, in prepubertal patients, antibiotic therapy can be reserved for young infants and those with pyuria or positive urine cultures. Because it is difficult to predict which patients will have a positive urine culture, urine cultures should be sent on all pediatric patients with epididymitis.

### Scrotal emergencies [^112R1AC5]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as an acute painful swelling of the scrotum or its contents, accompanied by local signs or general symptoms. Early identification and skillful management of testicular torsion is critical, as it may threaten testicular viability and future fertility if not managed expediently and appropriately. The cremasteric reflex and testicular sonography are frequently used, yet imperfect, diagnostic tools in assessing for testicular torsion. Other emergent conditions include incarcerated inguinal hernia, Fournier's gangrene, and any form of genitourinary trauma until proven otherwise. This article reviews the evaluation and management of the acute scrotum in the emergency department.

A search of EBSCO through January 13, 2016, using the key words epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis and child, children, or pediatric, identified 542 potential studies. Twenty-seven retrospective studies met the inclusion criteria, containing patients aged 21 years or younger with acute epididymitis or epididymoorchitis. The number and age of patients, urine cultures and urinalysis results, number of patients treated with antibiotics, and incidence were extracted.

Results

A total of 1496 patients with acute epididymitis were identified. A urinalysis was obtained for 1124 patients, and 190 (16.9%) were positive. Aurine culturewas obtained for 670 patients, and 100 (14.9%) were positive. Fourteen studies addressed antibiotic administration wherein 652 patients were with acute epididymitis and 554 (85%) received antibiotics. Of 502 patients with urinalysis results, urine culture results, and antibiotic treatment rates, 54 (10.8%) were positive for a bacterial source. Antibiotics were administered to 410 (81.7%) of these 502 patients.

Conclusions

Practitioners should consider only prescribing antibiotics to patients with acute epididymitis if there is an abnormal urinalysis or urine culture.

Management of Sex Partners

Sex partners should be referred for evaluation, testing, and presumptive treatment if they had sexual contact with the partner during the 60 days preceding the patient's onset of symptoms or chlamydia diagnosis. Although the exposure intervals defining identification of sex partners at risk are based on limited data, the most recent sex partner should be evaluated and treated, even if the time of the last sexual contact was > 60 days before symptom onset or diagnosis.

If health department partner management strategies (e.g. disease intervention specialists) are impractical or unavailable for persons with chlamydia, and if a provider is concerned that sex partners are unable to promptly access evaluation and treatment services, EPT should be considered as permitted by law (see Partner Services). Compared with standard patient referral of partners, this approach to therapy, which involves delivering the medication itself or a prescription by the patient or collaborating pharmacy, has been associated with decreased rates of persistent or recurrent chlamydia among women. Providers should provide patients with written educational materials to give to their partners about chlamydia, which should include notification that partners have been exposed and information about the importance of treatment. These materials also should inform partners about potential therapy-related allergies and adverse effects, along with symptoms indicative of complications (e.g. testicular pain among men and pelvic or abdominal pain among women). Educational materials for female partners should include information about the importance of seeking medical evaluation, especially if PID symptoms are present; undertreatment of PID among female partners and missed opportunities for diagnosing other STIs among women are concerning. MSM with chlamydia have a high risk for coexisting infections, especially undiagnosed HIV, among their partners and might have partners without HIV who could benefit from HIV PrEP. Data are also limited regarding effectiveness of EPT in reducing persistent or recurrent chlamydia among MSM; thus, shared clinical decision-making regarding EPT for MSM is recommended. Having partners accompany patients when they return for treatment is another strategy that has been used successfully for ensuring partner treatment (see Partner Services). To avoid reinfection, sex partners should be instructed to abstain from condomless sexual intercourse until they and their sex partners have been treated (i.e. after completion of a 7-day regimen) and any symptoms have resolved.

### Impact of deploying multiple point-of-care tests with a' sample first' approach on a sexual health clinical care pathway. A service evaluation [^112aPc1i]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2017). Low credibility.

Criteria for inclusion in the pathway, deliberately selected to increase likelihood of having CT/NG-positive patients to enable worthwhile impact assessment on patient management, were: patients aged ≥ 16 years; males not having passed urine in preceding 2 hours; symptomatic (males with symptoms suggestive of urethritis; females with vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, intermenstrual bleeding or postcoital bleeding) or sexual contacts of CT/NG-positive individuals. Exclusion criteria were patients not fulfilling the inclusion criteria, and patients with complex symptoms or histories.

The routine clinical pathway at the St George's walk-in SHC is depicted in figure 1. Briefly, patients presenting to the clinic are self-triaged at registration as asymptomatic (for an STI check-up with no other complaints or needs) or as not asymptomatic (have symptoms or other needs). Asymptomatic patients follow a 'quick-check' pathway, seeing non-medical staff who confirm pathway eligibility and collect appropriate samples. Symptomatic patients wait to have a consultation with a clinician, resulting in a management plan including examination and diagnostic tests. Microscopy is conducted to provide POCT results for non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) (males) and BV and TV (females) and then treatment given based on overall clinical diagnosis. Patients are then clinically discharged. NAAT laboratory results are available in 1–14 days.

### Doxycycline (okebo) [^112c1aTq]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

THE USUAL DOSAGE AND FREQUENCY OF ADMINISTRATION OF DOXYCYCLINE DIFFERS FROM THAT OF THE OTHER TETRACYCLINES. EXCEEDING THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS.

Adults

The usual dose of oral doxycycline is 200 mg on the first day of treatment (administered 100 mg every 12 hours or 50 mg every 6 hours) followed by a maintenance dose of 100 mg/day. The maintenance dose may be administered as a single dose or as 50 mg every 12 hours. In the management of more severe infections (particularly chronic infections of the urinary tract), 100 mg every 12 hours is recommended.

Pediatric Patients:

For all pediatric patients weighing less than 45 kg with severe or life-threatening infections (e.g. anthrax, Rocky Mountain spotted fever), the recommended dosage is 2.2 mg/kg of body weight administered every 12 hours. Children weighing 45 kg or more should receive the adult dose (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

For pediatric patients with less severe disease (greater than 8 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg), the recommended dosage schedule is 4.4 mg per kg of body weight divided into two doses on the first day of treatment, followed by a maintenance dose of 2.2 mg per kg of body weight (given as a single daily dose or divided into twice daily doses). For pediatric patients weighing over 45 kg, the usual adult dose should be used.

The therapeutic antibacterial serum activity will usually persist for 24 hours following recommended dosage.

When used in streptococcal infections, therapy should be continued for 10 days.

Administration of adequate amounts of fluid along with capsule and tablet forms of drugs in the tetracycline class is recommended to wash down the drugs and reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and ulceration. (See ADVERSE REACTIONS)

If gastric irritation occurs, it is recommended that doxycycline be given with food or milk. The absorption of doxycycline is not markedly influenced by simultaneous ingestion of food or milk.

Studies to date have indicated that administration of doxycycline at the usual recommended doses does not lead to excessive accumulation of doxycycline in patients with renal impairment.

Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infections in Adults (Except Anorectal Infections in Men)

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for 7 days. As an alternate single visit dose, administer 300 mg stat followed in one hour by a second 300 mg dose.

Acute Epididymo-orchitis Caused by N. gonorrhoeae

100 mg, by mouth, twice a day for at least 10 days.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® newly diagnosed palpable scrotal abnormality [^114Yknyv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Palpable scrotal abnormalities are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from indolent benign conditions to aggressive tumors, and infectious and vascular processes. In these patients the diagnostic workup typically begins with a complete clinical, history, and physical examinations, including analysis of risk factors. If imaging is required, ultrasound examination is the diagnostic modality of choice. In few select patients with very large scrotal masses, MRI may be appropriate. However, the use of gadolinium-based contrast should be evaluated critically depending on specific patient factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Acute parotitis due to familial mediterranean fever: a case report [^1176r1Rb]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In regions with a high prevalence of FMF, maintaining a strong clinical suspicion for the disease is essential in patients presenting with recurrent organ involvement characterized by episodic attacks. The atypical findings observed in our case, including parotitis and orchitis, highlight the diverse and often unpredictable clinical manifestations. Prompt diagnosis and intervention are paramount to prevent severe complications, with amyloidosis being one of the most serious consequences. By recognizing and addressing FMF in a timely manner, health care providers can effectively mitigate the risk of long-term complications and improve patient outcomes.

### Does transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients with idiopathic chronic orchialgia? A randomized controlled trial [^1125Vww4]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Idiopathic chronic orchialgia (ICO) is a stressful clinical condition for both the patient and the doctor. It may develop at any age, but the majority of patients are young males, 20–30 years old, with persistent or intermittent unilateral or bilateral scrotal pain lasting at least 3 months. This pain significantly disturbs the patient's daily activities and quality of life (QoL), inciting the patient to search for suitable treatment.–

Chronic orchialgia may be caused by tumors, inguinal hernias, infections, varicoceles, hydroceles, spermatoceles, trauma, radiating pain, or postoperative vasectomy or herniography. It has been estimated to be idiopathic in 25–50% of patients. In these cases with unknown etiology, the pain may be recalcitrant to several types of treatment.

Conservative treatment includes scrotal support, antibiotics and analgesics, alpha-adrenergic antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin and carbamazepine, and allopurinol. Possible surgical treatment for ICO includes microsurgical denervation of the spermatic cord, microsurgical testicular denervation, and orchiectomy. There are many physical therapy modalities to relieve and control ICO-associated pain, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), interferential (IF) therapy, pelvic floor muscle training, and radiofrequency treatment.–

TENS is a nonpharmacological and noninvasive method generally utilized for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Despite various clinical trials demonstrating the effectivity of TENS for pain reduction, there is still much debate over which conditions TENS should be used to treat and what parameters must be utilized for these treatments. Earlier reports demonstrated that TENS diminishes pain through both central and peripheral mechanisms. Centrally, opioid, serotonin, and muscarinic receptors in the spinal cord and brainstem are stimulated by TENS. Peripherally, opioid and α-2 noradrenergic receptors are involved in TENS-induced analgesia.

TENS is one of the most widely used electroanalgesia modalities. It is used for different types of conditions, such as rheumatoid and arthritic, neuropathic, lower back, and cancer-related pain.–

ICO is a chronic condition and requires conservative treatment. Furthermore, it is clear that TENS is widely used in different cases. To our knowledge, there are limited data about its application in treating ICO; thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of TENS on patients with ICO.

### Thrombosed varicocele-a rare cause for acute scrotal pain: a case report [^115MaPxY]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Acute scrotal pain has various causes. Testicular torsion, torsion of appendages and Epididymo-orchitis are common causes, while varicocele thromboses are a rare cause. Varicocele thromboses can occur post operatively or spontaneously. Five cases of post-operative and five cases of spontaneous thromboses have been described till date. The traditional advice in the management of thrombosed varicocele has been to manage it conservatively in all patients by drugs and scrotal support with little description of the surgical treatment. Herein, we present an unusual sixth case of spontaneous thromboses of varicocele and discuss its presentation and surgical management. We would also like to highlight the differentiating points between spontaneous thrombosis and post operative in vitro clot formation in the varicoceles, as these two entities can often be confused for each other.

Case presentation

A 68 year-old man presented with excruciating scrotal pain of one week duration. Doppler study of scrotum revealed left varicocele with no evidence of Epididymo-orchitis. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics, analgesics and scrotal elevation. He had no relief and continued to have severe pain. Clinical examination was normal. Patient underwent exploratory surgery on a semi- emergent basis. Exploration revealed normal testis with thrombosed varicoceles. Patient underwent Varicocelectomy. Postoperatively patient had immediate pain relief. Histopathology revealed prominent thrombosed varicocele. A varicocelectomy specimen (done for primary infertility) was used for comparison. The differentiating points between the two entities were noted.

Conclusion

Spontaneous thrombosis of varicocele is a rare cause of acute scrotal pain. Pain out of proportion to clinical features is characteristic. Patients not responding to medical therapy may need varicocelectomy. Varicocelectomy may give immediate relief. Histopathology is useful in this disorder.

### Imaging of the scrotum: beyond sonography [^114zvy5v]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Inflammatory processes

In our series, we described a case of epididymo-orchitis evolved into abscess formation, complicated by an intra-scrotal fistula poorly characterized by sonography; in that occasion, particularly thanks to T2-weighted sequences, MRI allowed identifying fistulous track and its relationship to close structures. We also reported three cases of severely inhomogeneous testicular echogenicity, in which MRI allowed excluding focal signal intensity abnormalities or focal areas of pathologic contrast-enhancement (CE), differentiating between a chronic orchitis from a neoplastic process, thus preventing unnecessary surgery.

In the literature, nevertheless we found cases of chronic granulomatous orchitis confused with tumour and undergone orchiectomy on the basis of MRI findings of testicular enlargement, hypointensity on T2-weighted images and increased signal on DW images.

Finally, MRI utility in early diagnosis of Fournier gangrene and in pre-operative planning is illustrated in a few works, accurately depicting fascial spread of the inflammatory process and necrotic component.

Tumours

In a study conducted on 165 testicle-containing scrotal compartments (84 patients), MRI proved 100% sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for precise localization of scrotal focal lesions, excellently differentiating testicular from extra-testicular ones.

Muglia et al. found that MRI allowed reliable characterization of testicular tumours and pseudotumors in 88% of the cases (n = 15); findings not recognized at US that were essential to define the neoplastic nature of the process were the presence of hemorrhagic intralesional components and extension to tunica albuginea or epididymis. Nevertheless, in the same series, two lesions suspected for tumours at MRI revealed chronic orchitis at pathological exam after surgery.

Some reports described hypointensity signal on T2-weighted images and lack of restricted diffusion on DWI as useful in discriminate between paratesticular fibrous pseudotumor and malignancies, clearly affecting patient management avoiding radical surgical intervention.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Symptoms of bladder irritability, related to the inflammatory response induced, are reported in approximately 60% of patients receiving TICE®BCG. The symptoms typically begin 4 to 6 hours after instillation and last 24 to 72 hours. The irritative side effects are usually seen following the third instillation, and tend to increase in severity after each administration.

The irritative bladder adverse effects can usually be managed symptomatically with products such as pyridium, propantheline bromide, oxybutynin chloride, and acetaminophen. The mechanism of action of the irritative side effects has not been firmly established, but is most consistent with an immunological mechanism.3There is no evidence that dose reduction or antituberculous drug therapy can prevent or lessen the irritative toxicity of TICE BCG.

"Flu-like" symptoms (malaise, fever, and chills) which may accompany the localized, irritative toxicities often reflect hypersensitivity reactions which can be treated symptomatically. Antihistamines have also been used.5

Adverse reactions to TICE BCG tend to be progressive in frequency and severity with subsequent instillation. Delay or postponement of subsequent treatment may or may not reduce the severity of a reaction during subsequent instillation.

Although uncommon, serious infectious complications of intravesical BCG have been reported.2,3,6The most serious infectious complication of BCG is disseminated sepsis with associated mortality. In addition, M. bovis infections have been reported in lung, liver, bone, bone marrow, kidney, regional lymph nodes, and prostate in patients who have received intravesical BCG. Systemic infections may be manifested by pneumonitis, hepatitis, cytopenia, vasculitis, infective aneurysm and/or sepsis after a period of fever and malaise during which symptoms progressively increase. Some male genitourinary tract infections (orchitis/epididymitis) have been resistant to multiple-drug antituberculous therapy and required orchiectomy.

### Testosterone (Testopel) [^114EN95y]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

MALES

Androgens are indicated for replacement therapy in conditions
associated with a deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone.

a. Primary hypogonadism (congenital or acquired)
- testicular failure due to cryptorchidism, bilateral torsion,
orchitis, vanishing testes syndrome; or orchiectomy.

b. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (congenital or
acquired) - gonadotropic LHRH deficiency, or pituitary
- hypothalamic injury from tumors, trauma or radiation.

If the above conditions occur prior to puberty, androgen
replacement therapy will be needed during the adolescent years for
development of secondary sex characteristics. Prolonged androgen
treatment will be required to maintain sexual characteristics in these
and other males who develop testosterone deficiency after puberty.

Safety and efficacy of TESTOPEL®(testosterone pellets) in men with "age-related hypogonadism" (also referred to as "late-onset hypogonadism") have not been established.

c. Androgens may be used to stimulate puberty in
carefully selected males with clearly delayed puberty. These
patients usually have a familial pattern of delayed puberty that is
not secondary to a pathological disorder; puberty is expected to
occur spontaneously at a relatively late date. Brief treatment with
conservative doses may occasionally be justified in these patients
if they do not respond to psychological support. The potential
adverse effect on bone maturation should be discussed with the
patient and parents prior to androgen administration. An x-ray of
the hand and wrist to determine bone age should be taken every 6
months to assess the effect of treatment on epiphyseal centers (see WARNINGS).

### Epididymitis and orchitis: an overview… [^117QgwCu]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Treatment Empiric treatment of epididymitis should be initiated based on likely pathogens, before laboratory testing is complete. Treatment focuses on curing infection, improving symptoms, preventing transmission, and reducing future complications. If gonococcal or chlamydial infection is likely, treatment should consist of ceftriaxone, a single 250-mg dose intramuscularly, and doxycycline, 100 mg orally twice daily for 10 days. 7, 12, 13 Azithromycin, a single 1-g dose orally, may be substituted for doxycycline if treatment compliance is questionable.

13 If enteric organisms, such as coliform bacteria, are likely or the patient is allergic to cephalosporins or tetracyclines, treatment should include ofloxacin, 300 mg orally twice daily for 10 days, or levofloxacin, 500 mg orally once daily for 10 days. 7, 12, 13 Patients who are immunocompromised should receive the same treatment as those who are immunocompetent. In addition to antibiotic treatment, analgesics, scrotal elevation, limitation of activity, and use of cold packs are helpful in the treatment of epididymitis. Patients should be advised of possible complications, including sepsis, abscess, infertility, and extension of the infection. Epididymitis and orchitis usually can be treated in the outpatient setting with close follow-up.

2–4 Inpatient care is recommended for intractable pain, vomiting, suspicion of abscess, failure of outpatient care, or signs of sepsis. Orchitis treatment is mostly supportive and should include bed rest and the use of hot or cold packs for pain. Antibacterial medications are not indicated for the treatment of viral orchitis, and most cases of mumps-associated orchitis resolve spontaneously after three to 10 days. Epididymoorchitis requires appropriate antibiotic coverage, as with epididymitis. Follow-up Follow-up is recommended three to seven days after initial evaluation and initiation of treatment to evaluate for clinical improvement and for the presence of a testicular mass.
