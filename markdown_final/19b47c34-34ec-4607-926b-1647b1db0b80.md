## Question

What is the significance of gastritis with pit microabscess?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the significance of gastritis with pit microabscess. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what a "pit microabscess" means histologically and anatomically. Then, I should consider the likely etiologies, especially Helicobacter pylori, and competing differentials. Next, I will review how this maps to the updated Sydney classification and what it signifies diagnostically and prognostically. After that, I need to translate this into clinical actions, including testing and treatment, and end with limitations of the term and risk stratification implications.

> Let me first confirm the histopathologic construct: gastric pits are invaginations of the surface epithelium, and H. pylori exhibits a striking biologic tropism for differentiated pit cells, which is mechanistically linked to urea chemotaxis and TlpB-dependent sensing, making pits a preferred colonization niche [^115aC92o] [^113shXuP] [^11555tQQ] [^117RVFNt]. A microabscess, by definition, is a microscopic aggregate of neutrophils; so "pit microabscess" most plausibly denotes neutrophilic collections within or immediately adjacent to gastric pits on biopsy, implying acute activity superimposed on chronic inflammation at the pit interface where H. pylori resides [^115aC92o].

> Wait, let me verify the likely etiologies before jumping to conclusions: the dominant cause of chronic active gastritis worldwide is H. pylori, and its "active" component is defined histologically by neutrophils, which in this anatomic context would manifest as pit-centric microabscesses given the organism's pit tropism and mucous-layer localization [^112Jv52y] [^111RGxts] [^115aC92o]. But I should keep a differential in mind; drug-induced patterns such as ARB-associated injury can show active inflammation with distinctive midzonal or full-thickness lamina propria patterns rather than a top-heavy, pit-centric process, and immune checkpoint inhibitor–related gastritis can also present with chronic active changes, though it typically comes with an oncologic context and broader clinicopathologic spectrum [^116Gdhjh] [^114dpwjG]. Phlegmonous or intramural gastric abscesses are suppurative infections of the wall and are far more extensive than microscopic pit microabscesses, so they are mechanistically distinct but remind us that bacterial processes can generate suppurative gastritis in other settings [^112hjT74].

> I will now examine the diagnostic and histologic significance: in the updated Sydney system, "activity" is graded by the density of neutrophils, and neutrophils clustering in or around pits would operationalize high activity, i.e., chronic active gastritis in a topographic niche favored by H. pylori colonization [^111RGxts] [^115eMBZS]. Hold on, I should verify the pattern clues: H. pylori gastritis is often "top-heavy", with antral-predominant or antral-restricted inflammation in certain phenotypes, whereas ARB-induced injury tends to be midzonal or full mucosal thickness and autoimmune gastritis shows corpus-predominant changes with antral sparing unless mixed, so pit microabscesses in a top-heavy context strengthen the inference of H. pylori rather than drug or autoimmune etiologies [^116Gdhjh] [^115eMBZS].

> Next, I should review what this means clinically: if pit microabscesses are seen, I need to check for H. pylori using validated nonserologic tests or biopsy-based methods, and if positive, initiate eradication therapy with an evidence-based first-line regimen, followed by confirmation of cure because this is an infectious disease with transmission and progressive mucosal damage [^114cUymh] [^116ov7Qz] [^111BpyUH]. Let me ensure I am consistent with consensus guidance: Maastricht VI/Florence recommends treatment for all H. pylori–infected individuals, and ACG/AAFP-aligned regimens include bismuth quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy as appropriate to local resistance patterns, with post-treatment testing to document eradication [^114cUymh] [^111BpyUH].

> I should confirm the prognostic implications: persistent "activity" signals ongoing epithelial damage that feeds into the atrophy–intestinal metaplasia–dysplasia sequence, and staging systems such as OLGA/OLGIM link extent and severity of atrophy or IM to gastric cancer risk, so pit microabscesses function as a marker of an active, potentially progressive phase that merits eradication and risk-stratified follow-up if atrophy/IM is present [^111RGxts] [^116udq3i]. But wait, I need to emphasize the broader disease context: H. pylori gastritis is the major risk factor worldwide for gastric cancer and ulcer disease, so identifying activity at the pit level has implications beyond symptom control, including cancer prevention through timely eradication [^112Jv52y].

> Let me consider population-level relevance to not miss the forest for the trees: H. pylori infects roughly half the global population, though prevalence is lower in North America, where it remains substantial at 30–40%, so a biopsy report noting pit microabscesses will be clinically meaningful for a large number of patients encountered in routine practice [^115aC92o] [^114HWZu4]. I should double-check that regional resistance patterns might influence regimen choice, reinforcing the need for guideline-concordant therapy and confirmation of eradication to interrupt the inflammatory cascade [^114cUymh].

> Hold on, I should verify limitations of the term itself: "pit microabscess" is a descriptive phrase rather than a standardized Sydney item, and I do not see a validated, independent scoring construct for pit microabscesses per se, so its significance must be inferred from the recognized "activity" parameter and the known pit tropism of H. pylori; pathologists may use such descriptive language in reports that otherwise follow Sydney constructs, prompting clinician–pathologist dialogue for clarity [^111RGxts] [^111WgsX7]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline formalizes this term; I do not find specific grading for pit microabscesses beyond generic neutrophilic "activity", which supports treating it as a histologic marker of active inflammation rather than a separate category [^111RGxts].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially leaned toward calling pit microabscesses pathognomonic for H. pylori, but I should correct myself because that's too strong: while pit-centric neutrophilic activity is characteristic in H. pylori given its pit tropism, chronic active gastritis can have H. pylori–negative causes, including drug-induced injury and immune-mediated patterns, so "pathognomonic" is inaccurate and "highly suggestive in the right context" is more precise [^116Gdhjh] [^115vYwnj] [^114dpwjG]. Let me explicitly state the self-correction: pit microabscesses raise a high index of suspicion for H. pylori, but negative testing or discordant clinicopathology should trigger a search for alternative etiologies and targeted stains or ancillary tests on tissue when necessary [^115eMBZS].

> I should double-check the practical next steps when this appears on a pathology report: confirm H. pylori with noninvasive testing such as urea breath test or stool antigen, or biopsy-based special stains or immunohistochemistry if the initial histology is equivocal, then treat and confirm eradication; if atrophy or IM is present, apply OLGA/OLGIM principles to guide risk stratification and surveillance strategies in collaboration with gastroenterology [^114mFbpG] [^114VgkT2] [^111RGxts]. But wait, let me verify coordination with the endoscopist and pathologist: because descriptive terms can be variably used, a brief clinico-pathologic discussion can clarify whether neutrophils are pit-limited or more diffuse, whether organisms were visualized, and whether special stains were performed or should be added to increase diagnostic yield [^111WgsX7] [^115eMBZS].

> In summary, gastritis with pit microabscess signifies neutrophil-rich "activity" centered on the pit compartment that is most consistent with active H. pylori gastritis given the organism's pit tropism, warrants prompt testing and eradication with post-treatment confirmation, and cues cancer risk assessment if chronic damage such as atrophy or intestinal metaplasia is present; however, I need to ensure I exclude non–H. pylori causes of active gastritis before declaring it definitive, since the term is descriptive and not a formal category in standardized grading systems [^115aC92o] [^114cUymh] [^111RGxts].

Gastritis with pit microabscesses is most often due to **H. pylori infection** [^112Jv52y] and is defined histologically by **neutrophil clusters in gastric pits** [^111RGxts]. Diagnosis relies on **gastric biopsies** with H&E and special stains [^115eMBZS], plus **H. pylori testing**; endoscopy may show erythema, erosions, or ulcers [^112jXaxU]. Management centers on **H. pylori eradication** with bismuth or concomitant quadruple therapy, PPIs, and stopping NSAIDs; confirm eradication [^114cUymh] and monitor for complications such as ulcers, bleeding, or cancer [^111BpyUH] [^111Fjpiw].

---

## Histopathological features

- **Neutrophil clusters**: Neutrophils within gastric pits or foveolae, forming microabscesses [^115jcATq].
- **Chronic inflammation**: Lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria [^111RGxts].
- **H. pylori organisms**: Often seen on special stains (Giemsa, Warthin-Starry, immunohistochemistry) [^115eMBZS].
- **Epithelial damage**: Erosion or ulceration may be present [^112jXaxU].

---

## Etiological factors

- **Helicobacter pylori infection**: The primary cause, with tropism for differentiated pit cells via urea chemotaxis and TlpB [^113shXuP] [^115aC92o].
- **NSAID use**: Can cause acute erosive gastritis with neutrophilic infiltration [^112jXaxU] [^1124xoJm].
- **Autoimmune gastritis**: May coexist with H. pylori gastritis, complicating diagnosis [^114NN9dJ] [^114eM2Dw].
- **Other infections**: Rarely, other bacteria or fungi may cause similar inflammation [^1154bWGM].

---

## Clinical presentation

Clinical presentation typically features **epigastric pain** as the most common symptom, with nausea, vomiting, and dyspepsia [^114HWZu4]. Severe cases may present with **gastrointestinal bleeding**, manifesting as hematemesis or melena [^117KnGjN].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis relies on **endoscopy** to identify erythema, erosions, or ulcers, and **biopsy** is essential for definitive confirmation [^113vTx2F] [^111RGxts]. Histopathology with H&E and special stains detects H. pylori and neutrophilic activity [^115eMBZS]. Non-invasive tests such as the **urea breath test**, **stool antigen**, or serology can detect H. pylori [^114mFbpG].

---

## Management strategies

- **H. pylori eradication**: Bismuth quadruple or concomitant therapy for 10–14 days [^111BpyUH] [^112hCqoz].
- **Proton pump inhibitors**: Reduce acid and promote healing [^116ov7Qz].
- **NSAID cessation**: Stop or switch to alternatives [^112jXaxU] [^1124xoJm].
- **Follow-up**: Confirm eradication and monitor for complications [^114VgkT2] [^112YLL44].

---

## Potential complications

Complications include **peptic ulcer disease** and **gastrointestinal bleeding** [^115YAUbr]. Chronic inflammation and atrophy increase the risk of **gastric cancer** [^111Uu3X2]; pernicious anemia can occur in the setting of autoimmune gastritis [^114eM2Dw].

---

## Prognosis

Favorable with treatment, as **eradication and acid suppression** usually resolve inflammation [^117KnGjN]; poor without treatment carries a risk of **ulcers, bleeding, and cancer** [^114HWZu4].

---

Gastritis with pit microabscesses is a histologic pattern of active gastritis, most often from H. pylori, and **requires biopsy-based diagnosis and targeted therapy** to prevent complications [^1133SVng].

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^113shXuP]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

The human gastric epithelium forms highly organized gland structures with different subtypes of cells. The carcinogenic bacterium *Helicobacter pylori* can attach to gastric cells and subsequently translocate its virulence factor CagA, but the possible host cell tropism of *H. pylori* is currently unknown. Here, we report that *H. pylori* preferentially attaches to differentiated cells in the pit region of gastric units. Single-cell RNA-seq shows that organoid-derived monolayers recapitulate the pit region, while organoids capture the gland region of the gastric units. Using these models, we demonstrate that *H. pylori* preferentially attaches to highly differentiated pit cells, marked by high levels of GKN1, GKN2, and PSCA.

Directed differentiation of host cells enables enrichment of the target cell population and confirms *H. pylori's preferential attachment and CagA translocation into these cells. Attachment is independent of MUC5AC or PSCA expression and instead relies on bacterial TlpB-dependent chemotaxis towards host cell-released urea, which scales with host cell size.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^112Jv52y]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Worldwide, the most common cause of chronic gastritis is infection with H. pylori. H. pylori causes progressive damage to the gastric mucosa and is now accepted as playing a causative role in a number of important diseases, including duodenal ulcer disease, gastric ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Indeed, H. pylori-induced gastritis is considered the most important risk factor for peptic ulcer and its complications as well as for gastric cancer.

The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), issued in 1989 by the International Conference for the Tenth Revision of the ICD, was endorsed by WHO at the 43rd General Assembly in 1990 and has been used for disease statistics since 1994 among member countries of WHO. In the ICD-10, all digestive diseases are classified under the K code with different two-digit numbers. However, H. pylori was not integrated into gastritis classification in the gastritis section (K29) of ICD-10, even though H. pylori gastritis is the predominant type of gastritis and is clinically by far the most relevant because of its predisposing role in severe gastroduodenal complications. Moreover, the ICD-10 classification of gastritis is not organized according to aetiology but is merely a mixture of phenotype and aetiology and also includes duodenitis. Therefore, a revision of the gastritis and duodenitis classification based on all possible aetiologies was proposed after the working group meeting for the ICD-11 revision.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, specifically with respect to first-line regimens, AAFP 2023 guidelines recommend administering bismuth quadruple therapy (PPI, bismuth, tetracycline, and metronidazole or tinidazole) or concomitant therapy (non-bismuth quadruple therapy, which includes PPI, clarithromycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole or tinidazole) as first-line therapy in patients with H. pylori infection.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^112jXaxU]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Gastric erosions are defined as superficial mucosal breaks with a diameter of less than 3 mm or less than 5 mm. This small size makes it less likely to confound erosions with peptic ulcers, which by definition, penetrate the muscularis mucosae.

Gastric erosions can be detected in the context of H. pylori infection but are more frequently caused by the intake of mucosal-damaging drugs, in particular, aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Furthermore, several different morphological forms were noted after the eradication of H. pylori, such as (a) flat, (b) raised, (c) haemorrhagic, and (d) appearing as bleeding spots with localization in the antrum in the absence of drugs, possibly owing to hyperacidity after eradication therapy.

From a clinical perspective, the most relevant aspect of erosions is that patients taking NSAIDs and having numerous erosions in the stomach are at increased risk of subsequently developing ulcers. Few studies on the clinical significance or natural history of gastric or duodenal erosions have been reported. Thus, it is important to conduct prospective research in which erosions in the stomach and duodenum are separately reported in conjunction with the category of gastritis, which is needed to better understand the natural history of gastric erosions and their potential to progress to ulceration and bleeding. Validated scores for reporting erosions for research purposes should be used.

- **Clinical question (CQ) 6**: Is H. pylori gastritis an infectious disease irrespective of symptom and complications?

- **Statement 6**: H. pylori gastritis should be defined as an infectious disease.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^111CWwha]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Preference for pit cell depends on urea chemotaxis and cell size. We then analyzed the possible role of secreted factors. To test whether gland cells would secrete bactericidal proteins to repel or kill bacteria, we incubated bacteria with supernatants from the differentiated cells. The supernatants did not have an effect, although infection did lead to the upregulation of some known antimicrobials (Supplementary Fig. 9).

To test whether pit cells would attract bacteria, we employed a classical chemotaxis assay. All cell-conditioned media attracted bacteria, but conditioned medium from pit cells attracted about twice as many bacteria as conditioned medium from gland cells (Fig. 5a). Urea is a major chemoattractant for H. pylori. To test whether the observed chemotaxis was due to urea, we added 500 mM of urea, which has been shown to abrogate H. pylori chemotactic response to urea. Indeed, the high urea abrogated the response to the pit cell-conditioned media (Fig. 5b). Deletion of TlpB, the H. pylori gene for the chemoreceptor that recognizes urea, abrogates the preference for the pit cells (Fig. 5c). TlpB mutant bacteria also did not prefer pit cells in infections (Fig. 5d).

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115YAUbr]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

H. pylori is a major human pathogen that causes chronic and progressive gastric mucosal damage. It is etiologically related to peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, and gastric atrophy. In addition, H. pylori is closely associated with gastric MALT lymphoma, dyspepsia, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. H. pylori-positive individuals are the primary reservoir for the transmission of the infection.

The decision to eradicate a chronic infection in society should be based on quantitative data regarding the outcomes of untreated infections. H. pylori causes a chronic infection similar to asymptomatic syphilis or tuberculosis, and the final outcome for any individual cannot be predicted. H. pylori infection differs from many other chronic infectious diseases because it is always transmissible, thereby putting others at risk. As gastric damage is progressive, the lack of an obvious clinical manifestation at diagnosis has no predictive value for the lifetime risk to an individual patient, their family, or the community.

Benefits of H. pylori eradication for an individual depend partially on the degree and extent of damage that has already occurred and the reversibility of that damage. Potential benefits of eradication include stopping the progression of mucosal damage, stabilization or reduction in the risk of developing gastric cancer, resolution of mucosal inflammation, stabilization or improvement of gastric mucosal function, return of the normal mechanisms governing acid secretion, and the cure of H. pylori-related peptic ulcer disease.

### Helicobacter pylori infection [^114HWZu4]. Deutsches Arzteblatt International (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Helicobacter pylori infection:

- **Definition**: H. pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes chronic infection and inflammation of the stomach and duodenum.

- **Pathophysiology**: H. pylori infection is transmitted via the fecal-oral and oral-oral routes. Horizontal transmission and environmental transmission through contaminated water also occur.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of H. pylori infection in North America is decreasing over time but remains substantial at 30–40%. The infection is typically acquired in childhood and is more prevalent among non-White races and ethnicities, those living in crowded or poor sanitary conditions, and early-generation immigrants from countries where H. pylori is endemic. H. pylori resistance rates to antibiotics are increasing in most parts of the world.

- **Disease course**: H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of various gastrointestinal diseases, including functional dyspepsia, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric intestinal metaplasia, and gastric cancer.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Although successful eradication of H. pylori infection prevents the development and progression of H. pylori-associated diseases, the efficacy of treatment regimens has decreased due to increased antibiotic resistance. Globally, the annual recurrence, reinfection, and recrudescence rates of H. pylori are 4.3%, 3.1%, and 2.2%, respectively.

### Characteristics of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated gastritis: Report from a major tertiary care center [^1137Gcqe]. The Oncologist (2023). Low credibility.

This report contributes to the identification and management of this pathology by providing data on a large collection of cases describing gastritis in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. It offers a comprehensive clinicopathological picture, enabling clinicians to recognize the disease pattern of ICI gastritis rather than focusing on a single aspect. The results of this study are clinically relevant because they will enable prescribers to identify and treat patients with ICI-induced gastritis early, minimizing interruptions in immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

### The histological spectrum of ARB-induced gastritis [^116Gdhjh]. Histopathology (2022). Low credibility.

While active chronic gastritis is a non-specific pattern with a broad differential, several features can guide pathologists toward a diagnosis of ARB-induced gastric injury. The lamina propria infiltrate in ARB-induced gastritis usually involves the full thickness of the mucosa or is midzonal, which is distinct from the usual top-heavy infiltrate seen in H. pylori gastritis. Significant antral inflammation is present in most cases, which can help differentiate ARB-induced gastritis from autoimmune gastritis that would show antral sparing.

Prominent surface epithelial damage can also serve as a clue to the presence of drug-induced gastric injury. While not always evident, intra-epithelial lymphocytosis and/or subepithelial collagen thickening could further alert pathologists to the possibility of ARB-induced gastric injury. While several of the histological changes seen in ARB-induced gastritis can also be observed in non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-related gastric injury, including surface epithelial damage, active inflammation, and intra-epithelial lymphocytosis, the presence of a prominent lymphoplasmacytic lamina propria infiltrate is not typical of NSAID-related injury.

Another clue to the diagnosis of ARB-induced GI tract injury is the presence of histological changes in the duodenum. In our study, the findings in the gastric and duodenal biopsies were closely correlated in 11 of 14 cases. Three cases that showed subepithelial collagen deposition in the stomach exhibited similar features in the duodenum, and active inflammation and intra-epithelial lymphocytosis were noted.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^11555tQQ]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) reveals that H. pylori binds to a subpopulation of pit cells.

- **Experimental setup**: Gastric organoids were generated from healthy gastric tissue and used to obtain 2D monolayers. The monolayers were infected with GFP-expressing H. pylori (MOI 1) for 6 hours and subjected to scRNA-seq.

- **Flow cytometry analysis**: Representative flow cytometry dot plots of naïve and infected monolayers were created. Cells were gated as indicated based on GFP signal (H. pylori) and propidium iodide (PI) and subjected to scRNA-seq.

- **Data visualization**: Single-cell transcriptomes from the different gates were integrated and projected using a t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) 2D projection, with the sample origin being color-coded. Using known gastric marker genes for specific gastric cell types, cell identities were assigned.

- **Marker expression**: The expression of known markers specific for pit cells (MUC5AC), neck cells (MUC6), and chief cells (PGC) was color-coded and projected on top of the t-SNE displayed.

- **Infection distribution**: The percentage of H. pylori-infected cells per cluster was identified. Two clusters were composed of pit cell progenitors (clusters 1 and 2), and one cluster was composed of progenitor cells (cluster 3). The smallest cluster, cluster 4, contained 8% of the total number of cells in the sample and represented the highest differentiated pit cells, containing the highest percentage of infected cells (65%). In contrast, clusters 1 and 2, representing pit cell progenitors, had 25% and 26% of cells infected, respectively.

### Staging and grading of chronic gastritis [^115jcATq]. Human Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic gastritis is an inflammatory condition of the gastric mucosa that may include structural alterations of the glandular compartment. The semiquantitative scoring systems advocated in the Sydney Systems and the subsequent Atrophy Club Guidelines remain essential for the recognition of the spectrum of the lesions detectable in gastric inflammatory disease. However, most practicing pathologists find them too cumbersome to use in their routine diagnostic activities.

In this article, we propose a reporting system for chronic gastritis in staging and grading. Staging conveys information on the topography and extension of the gastric atrophic changes, whereas grading represents the semiquantitative assessment of the combined severity of both mononuclear and granulocytic inflammation. This system could offer gastroenterologists a more immediate perception of the overall condition of the gastric mucosa while also providing useful information about gastric cancer risk.

Acute phlegmonous gastritis, a suppurative infection of the gastric wall, has a high mortality rate. This disease remains a mystery to most clinicians. The rarity of this disease and its nonspecific presentation make early diagnosis difficult, especially in the emergency department. We describe a case of acute phlegmonous gastritis presenting as gastric wall abscess in a 55-year-old woman who visited the emergency department, illustrating the severity of this disease, the difficulty in its diagnosis, and its unusual presentation.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: Expert review [^111ky3op]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for atrophic gastritis, more specifically diagnostic endoscopy, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend that providers should recognize the typical endoscopic features of atrophic gastritis. These features include a pale appearance of the gastric mucosa, increased visibility of vasculature due to thinning of the gastric mucosa, and loss of gastric folds. If there is concomitant intestinal metaplasia, features such as light blue crests and white opaque fields should also be noted. Since these mucosal changes are often subtle, techniques to optimize evaluation of the gastric mucosa should be performed.

### Gastritis and gastric atrophy [^112e2vVL]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address the changing nature of interpreting gastritis, particularly its Helicobacter association. Historically, the review examines gastritis through cancer risk staging systems.

Recent findings highlight key aspects: Helicobacter is linked to various forms of gastritis. This review focuses on the extremes of the disease, starting with antral-predominant gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori infection, which can progress to oxyntic-predominant disease with atrophy. The role of Helicobacter pylori in autoimmune gastritis associated with pernicious anemia remains unresolved. Currently, gastritis staging systems like the Baylor and Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment are available for assessing cancer risk.

As most gastric carcinomas develop on a backdrop of atrophic gastritis, and risk magnifies with the extent of atrophy, an index of atrophy location and extent may help predict patients at higher risk for carcinoma. Staging patients for cancer risk is now feasible. However, in the evolving field of gastritis, where numerous issues remain unresolved, a more descriptive classification or staging system will likely prove more beneficial.

### Autoimmune gastritis, with or without pernicious anemia: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical management [^114eM2Dw]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory condition involving the destruction of the gastric oxyntic mucosa through the autoimmune-mediated loss of parietal cells, with replacement by atrophic and metaplastic tissue. Histologically, AIG is characterized by atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa, which is corpus-predominant atrophic gastritis, with or without replacement by metaplastic mucosa. Classically, antral mucosa architecture is preserved, but this might not be the case in more advanced stages or if there is concomitant infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).

AIG falls under the umbrella of "atrophic gastritis", which comprises several conditions where the downstream histologic consequence of chronic environmental (e.g. H. pylori) or non-environmental triggers is gastric atrophy — that is, the disappearance of the native gastric glands and thinning of the mucosa. There is abundant literature on chronic H. pylori gastritis leading to progression to multifocal atrophic gastritis (MAG) and, in a small minority, neoplastic transformation and progression to adenocarcinoma; however, the literature on pathogenesis, epidemiology, and management of AIG is sparse in comparison. Moreover, the heterogeneity across the literature with respect to criteria used to diagnose AIG further contributes to our incomplete understanding of this condition, as well as practice pattern variability. For example, pernicious anemia (PA), a late-stage manifestation of AIG, is characterized by megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency.

### Primer: Histopathology for the clinician — how to interpret biopsy information for gastritis [^111WgsX7]. Nature Clinical Practice. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

Gastroenterologists can be frustrated, at times, by surgical pathology reports of gastritis that either do not match what was seen endoscopically or do not indicate the presence of a specific disease. This might be because of one or more factors.

- **Correlation issues**: The correlation between the endoscopic diagnosis of gastritis and histologic gastritis is poor. There are a limited number of well-known histologic gastritides that yield specific diagnoses.

Reports that are purely descriptive are, therefore, common and might require discussion between the endoscopist and the pathologist.

Typically, the surface of the normal corpus, when the stomach is empty and not distended, is almost invariably in folds, also called rugae, which vary in size depending on the degree of insufflation during the endoscopic assessment. In contrast, the surface of the normal fundus and antrum is smooth. The color of the normal gastric mucosa, as indeed of the whole GI tract, is velvety, glossy dark rose or red with a regular arrangement of the collecting venules, usually visible as red spidery vessels in the normal corpus. The presence of these collecting venules is characteristic of a normal stomach without H. pylori (sensitivity 93%, specificity 48%). With white light, high-resolution endoscopes, the round 'pit patterns' of the corpus and elongated 'pit patterns' of the antrum can be seen without magnification or enhancement.

- **Normal gastric corpus and antrum mucosal surface pattern**: The round 'pit patterns' of the corpus (Ai) and elongated 'pit patterns' of the antrum (Di) can be seen without magnification or enhancement. In the corpus (Ai), the red collecting venules (CV) are evident as well as the round dark red crypt openings (CO). The vascular anatomy becomes more pronounced with NBI (Aii & Dii). The visible anatomical components seen on magnification NBI include the dark brown 'crypt openings' (CO), the dark brown sub-epithelial capillary network (SECN), and the light brown marginal crypt epithelia (MCE).

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis: Expert review [^1118RoQV]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to provide clinicians with guidance on the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis, a common preneoplastic condition of the stomach. The primary focus is on atrophic gastritis due to chronic *Helicobacter pylori* infection, the most common etiology, or due to autoimmunity. At the time of writing, clinical guidance for best practices related to the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis remains very limited in the United States, leading to poor recognition of this preneoplastic condition and suboptimal risk stratification.

There is heterogeneity in the definitions of atrophic gastritis, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and gastric neoplasia in the literature, which has led to confusion in clinical practice and research. Accordingly, the primary objective of this Clinical Practice Update is to provide clinicians with a framework for the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis. By focusing on atrophic gastritis, this Clinical Practice Update is intended to complement the 2020 American Gastroenterological Association Institute guidelines on the management of gastric intestinal metaplasia. These recent guidelines did not specifically discuss the diagnosis and management of atrophic gastritis.

Providers should recognize that a diagnosis of intestinal metaplasia on gastric histopathology implies the diagnosis of atrophic gastritis because intestinal metaplasia occurs in underlying atrophic mucosa, although this is often not distinctly noted on histopathologic reports.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^115TunbB]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

For decades, endoscopic 'gastritis', gastric erosions, and even histological findings of gastric inflammation have failed to attract much attention from clinicians, as the majority of patients with these findings remain asymptomatic. Although gastritis is often used to describe dyspeptic symptoms, the presence of such symptoms correlates poorly with histological or endoscopic gastritis. While the term 'gastritis' is still used as a concept to explain dyspeptic symptoms, gastritis as a term refers to gastric inflammation, often accompanying structural mucosal changes. This gastric inflammation (gastritis) has long been associated with peptic ulcer, gastric cancer, and pernicious anaemia, but the cause or causes of gastritis remain poorly understood. The discovery that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) was a cause of gastritis focused attention on the aetiology, natural history, and prognosis of gastritis.

### Clinical manifestations of Helicobacter pylori-negative gastritis [^115vYwnj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

There are data to suggest the existence of non-Helicobacter pylori gastritis. However, the risk factors and clinical course for H. pylori-negative gastritis remain unclear. We aimed to examine the prevalence and determinants of H. pylori-negative gastritis in a large multiethnic clinical population.

- **Methods**: We conducted a cross-sectional study among patients scheduled for an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy or attending selected primary care clinics and eligible for screening colonoscopy at a single Veterans Affairs medical center. We identified cases of H. pylori-negative gastritis, H. pylori-positive gastritis, and H. pylori-negative nongastritis, where gastritis was defined by the presence of neutrophils and/or mononuclear cells. Risk factors for H. pylori-negative gastritis were analyzed in logistic regression models.

- **Results**: A total of 1240 patients had information from all biopsy sites, of whom 695 (56.0%) had gastritis. H. pylori-negative gastritis was present in 123 patients (9.9% of all study subjects and 17.7% of all patients with gastritis). Among all patients with gastritis, African Americans were statistically significantly less likely than non-Hispanic whites to have H. pylori-negative gastritis (odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.14–0.43). Conversely, PPI users were more likely to have H. pylori-negative gastritis than H. pylori-positive gastritis compared with nonusers (odds ratio, 2.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.17–3.49). The cumulative incidence of gastric erosions and ulcers was higher in patients with H. pylori-negative gastritis.

### Insights into endoscopic imaging [^115FGeEN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Kudo et al. delved into the polyp morphology and decoded the crypt pattern by introducing the first pit pattern classification. Based on this innovative concept, other investigatory groups with expertise in optical diagnosis demonstrated a different evaluation of mucosal surface analysis. To anticipate the complexity and to standardize the NBI observation criteria, an international cooperative group (Colon Tumor NBI Interest Group - CTNIG) has recently developed a simple NBI magnifying observation classification (NICE classification: NBI International Colorectal Endoscopic Classification), which classifies NBI into types 1–3.

Dr. Yao et al. have recently proposed a systematic but simple classification system based on microvascular (MV) pattern and microsurface (MS) pattern ('VS' classification system) using NBI with ME to visualize the morphology of gastric mucosal capillaries. The main listed indications were as follows:

- **Routine screening endoscopy**: Distinguishing between small early gastric cancer and focal gastritis.
- **Preoperative assessment**: Evaluating the lateral extent of early gastric cancer for curative endoscopic resection.

As such, ME with NBI appeared to be a reliable imaging technique for the characterization and delineation of early gastric cancer.

In another study, Dr. Hisabe and colleagues present a prospective feasibility and validity study to evaluate the usefulness of the same VS classification system in differentiating neoplastic from non-neoplastic polyps in the colon. The comparison of the VS classification system (using ME with NBI) with pit pattern analysis (using…

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^116qYmn8]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

Conventional endoscopy is, in most hands, an inadequate tool for diagnosing atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. Therefore, it remains mandatory that a biopsy is carried out, allowing histomorphological assessment of the gastric mucosa according to the Sydney classification. However, image-enhanced endoscopy has improved the accuracy and reproducibility of endoscopic diagnosis of premalignant gastric lesions. This includes chromoendoscopy, high-resolution magnification endoscopy, and image-enhanced endoscopy combined with magnification. These methods are now routinely available in Japan and will be increasingly used worldwide. Adequate evaluation of the stomach mucosa with each of these methods requires appropriate training and offers the advantage of targeted biopsies.

- **Image enhanced endoscopy**:
	- **Narrow band imaging (NBI) of the gastric mucosa**: Round homogeneous sized pits with regularly arranged collecting venules are shown. This pattern, named 'RAC' pattern in the corpus mucosa, highly indicates a Helicobacter pylori negative state. In the H. pylori-infected mucosa with inflammation, pit patterns are elongated, varied in sizes and shapes with spaces between them. Collecting venules are obscured due to inflammation.
	- **When intestinal metaplasia develops**: The pit pattern is further elongated with light blue lines (light blue crest sign) decorating the pits' margins.
	- The images were provided by Dr. Kazuyoshi Yagi.

- **Blue laser imaging (BLI) of the gastric mucosa**:
	- BLI is a new modality.

These advanced methods of image-enhanced endoscopy offer clear advantages in the specific diagnosis and evaluation of gastric conditions.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^114mFbpG]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

There has been significant technical progress in diagnostic tools for GI diseases. Advanced endoscopy with image-enhanced modalities and magnification allows diagnosis of gastritis with a high degree of accuracy, even before histological confirmation. Furthermore, non-invasive diagnostic tests such as the ¹³C-urea breath test, faecal antigen test, and serological parameters serve as surrogate markers of H. pylori gastritis and indicators of gastritis severity.

- **Classification systems**: Systems for grading gastritis, such as the Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA) and Operative Link for Gastric Intestinal Metaplasia Assessment (OLGIM), have also been proposed, in addition to the internationally accepted Sydney System. Their utility needs to be evaluated and agreed upon.

In 2013, the Japanese government insurance policy approved eradication therapy for H. pylori-positive gastritis after endoscopic examination to exclude more serious diseases such as ulcer and cancer, in line with the Japanese guidelines for H. pylori management. However, no global consensus has been published on when to recommend eradication therapy for H. pylori gastritis and how to follow up after eradication.

Since global awareness of gastritis is still confounded by a number of controversial issues as described above, a meeting was set up in Kyoto to achieve global consensus on H. pylori gastritis; to attempt conceptual changes in gastritis classification in general; and to agree on diagnosis and management strategies with special reference to FD and cancer prevention.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the diagnosis and management of patients at risk of gastric adenocarcinoma [^111Uu3X2]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

Gastric atrophy

GA is diagnosed histopathologically by two specific features: the presence of chronic inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and plasma cells that expand the lamina propria, and the loss of the pre-existent gastric glands.

There is inconsistency in the histopathological diagnosis and severity of GA between pathologists, resulting in low interobserver agreement by histopathologists when staging GA using the OLGA (Operative Link on Gastritis Assessment) staging system, based on biopsies taken using the Sydney protocol. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that accurate endoscopic staging of the severity of GA are strongly linked to gastric adenocarcinoma risk and that the interobserver and intraobserver agreement of endoscopic severity assessment, in experienced hands, is moderate to excellent.

The prevalence of CAG (including GA) worldwide correlates with the prevalence of H. pylori -associated gastritis, increases with age and tends to be slightly more common in men. Prevalence is typically determined using gastroscopy and serum pepsinogen. In Western populations, the prevalence varies from 0% to 8.3%, depending on age. Studies performed in high-incidence areas such as Japan and China showed a prevalence of CAG of between 33% and 84%.

### Spontaneous resolution of intramural gastric abscess without treatment [^115R5buy]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

A gastric wall abscess is a type of phlegmonous gastritis characterized by inflammation confined to the stomach wall and abscess formation. It is caused by biopsy, polypectomy, cancer, and accidental ingestion of foreign objects. Endoscopic drainage has been considered useful. No case of spontaneous alleviation of gastric wall abscess has been reported previously.

A 57-year-old man with no previous medical history swallowed a fish bone (flounder). The next day, he complained of epigastric discomfort and fever. He came to our hospital 10 days after the onset of the symptoms, and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. A submucosal tumor (SMT)-like protrusion was observed in the anterior wall just below the stomach cardia, as well as pus discharge from the top of the lump (Fig. 1A). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed fluid collection in the gastric wall (Fig. 2), and these findings were consistent with that of a gastric abscess.

On the next day, endoscopy revealed that the protrusion suspected as a gastric wall abscess had clearly shrunk, but pus discharge was observed (Fig. 1B). Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) showed an inhomogeneous lesion of mixed echogenicity located mainly in the submucosal layer with mucosal involvement (Fig. 1C), consistent with the reported features of EUS of gastric wall abscess. Streptococcus spp. was detected on pus culture.

Three days later, the subjective symptoms had completely alleviated; the SMT-like protrusion had further shrunk, as observed via endoscopy. The SMT-like protrusion was not observed via upper endoscopy performed 1 month later.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^1158xZLx]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

The categorization of H. pylori gastritis according to gastritis subsites, together with the assessment of gastritis severity, allows prediction of an individual's risk of developing severe gastroduodenal complications and, in particular, gastric cancer. Depending on the gastric subsites involved, gastric function and, in particular, gastric acid secretion may be profoundly affected, resulting in gastric acid hypersecretion, hyposecretion, or even achlorhydria.

Subsite characterization of gastritis is also critically important for identifying those patients who remain at high risk after H. pylori eradication and thus are candidates for regular endoscopic and histological follow-up. Patients with severe atrophic gastritis (with or without intestinal metaplasia) in the corpus or with severe corpus predominant gastritis are those at highest risk for progression to gastric cancer of the intestinal type and for diffuse-type gastric cancer. In diffuse-type gastric cancer, the prevalence of antral atrophic gastritis is almost identical to that seen in the intestinal type but is slightly less with corpus atrophic gastritis than with intestinal type gastric cancer.

- **Is it necessary to categorize gastritis according to histology (severity) and/or endoscopy?** It is advisable to categorize gastritis according to histology, because the risk of development of gastric cancer in H. pylori gastritis varies according to the extent and severity of inflammation and atrophy.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^112YRPmf]. Gut (2015). High credibility.

The global consensus meeting on H. pylori gastritis has set a new landmark for gastritis, which has continued to be an ill-conceived clinical entity placed between a histological picture and upper abdominal symptoms.

In spite of the fact that gastritis had been long recognized as an important clinical entity, generations of gastroenterologists have neglected the importance of treating this nosological entity. Rudolf Schindler described chronic gastritis as a serious disease and a precursor of gastric cancer, considering their relationship as being of outstanding importance in the fight against gastric cancer.

The discovery of H. pylori has revolutionized the pre-existing concepts of gastritis by assigning a specific etiology to this entity underlying PUD and gastric cancer. The majority of these serious conditions are manifestations developed on the background of chronic gastritis caused by a unique infectious agent, H. pylori. For PUD, guidelines unanimously recommend eradication as the primary treatment for those with positive H. pylori tests. However, there has been no consensus on how and when to manage individuals with H. pylori gastritis itself, which is crucial to the efficiency of gastric cancer prevention because most patients with chronic gastritis may remain asymptomatic until the appearance of severe complications.

Furthermore, both gastritis and duodenitis were recognized as important causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, encouraging our attention to these conditions now that anti-thrombotic therapies are increasingly being used.

### Characteristics of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated gastritis: Report from a major tertiary care center [^114dpwjG]. The Oncologist (2023). Low credibility.

This report hopes to contribute to the identification and management of this pathology by providing data on a large collection of cases describing gastritis in the setting of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. We provide a complete clinicopathological picture rather than focusing on one aspect alone, enabling clinicians to recognize the disease pattern of ICI gastritis. Like other researchers, we have detected that the disease spectrum, in terms of presentation, clinical course, and histopathology, varies widely. We also summarize previously published data regarding histological characteristics to provide important diagnostic clues for ICI gastritis using a similar framework as other investigators.

There are several limitations to our study. Due to the retrospective design, we were unable to report long-term outcomes for all patients in our cohort. We only had access to 17 (14 histologic slides reviewed and 3 reports) out of 25 histology reports. Hence, we can only describe the clinical and endoscopic characteristics of the other 8 patients. We also acknowledge that gastritis seen in patients included in this study can be attributed to other etiologies, including NSAID use, chemotherapy, and radiation. We have described these variables in our results and only included patients who presented within 12 weeks of immunotherapy administration. We also excluded cases where biopsy showed luminal malignancy or H. pylori gastritis.

To conclude, ICI therapy-associated gastritis often occurs with other gastrointestinal toxicities. Common patterns of inflammation include chronic active gastritis and reactive gastropathy.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: Expert review [^111TLM4t]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Unlike most infectious diseases where therapy is guided by knowledge of antibiotic sensitivity profiling of the target organism, or at least by knowledge of strains within the relevant geographical region, H. pylori treatment has remained largely empiric. For refractory cases, it may seem obvious that sensitivity testing should be considered after two failed attempts at treatment [BPA #10]. However, in practice, the situation is complicated by the logistical challenges of obtaining resistance profiles for H. pylori, as well as the lack of convincing data demonstrating the superiority of selecting treatment based on sensitivity testing compared to empirically selecting treatment based on prior antibiotic exposure, as further discussed below.

Standard methodology to test for antibiotic sensitivity involves promptly transporting gastric biopsies in sterile containers at room temperature to the receiving microbiology laboratory, where they undergo a relatively labor-intensive process to grow the microbial colonies in micro-aerophilic conditions over several days. Once it is confirmed that the bacteria are indeed H. pylori, for example, based on morphology, urease, catalase, and oxidase activity, the bacteria are then tested for viability in the presence of the relevant antibiotics. Because few hospitals or endoscopy centers in the US offer this service in-house, the biopsy specimens for sensitivity testing are usually sent in refrigerated packaging to a commercial laboratory.

### Helicobacter pylori eradication in patients on long-term treatment with NSAIDs reduces the severity of gastritis: a randomized controlled trial [^1124xoJm]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). High credibility.

Maintenance use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is often complicated by gastropathy. In non-NSAID users, eradication of Helicobacter pylori is associated with decreased mucosal inflammation and may halt the progression to atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, but the continuous use of NSAIDs may interfere with these processes.

- **Goal**: To investigate the effect of H. pylori eradication on gastric mucosal histology during long-term NSAID use, with and without gastroprotective therapy.

- **Study**: Patients were eligible for inclusion if they were on long-term NSAIDs and were H. pylori-positive on serologic testing. Patients were randomly assigned to either eradication or placebo. Gastritis was assessed according to the updated Sydney classification for activity, chronic inflammation, gastric glandular atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and H. pylori density.

- **Results**: Biopsy specimens were available for histology of 305 patients. Of these, 48% were on chronic gastroprotective medication. Significantly less active gastritis, inflammation, and H. pylori density were found in the eradication group compared with the placebo group in both corpus and antrum (P < 0.001). In the corpus, less atrophy was found in the eradication group compared with the placebo group.

- **Conclusions**: H. pylori eradication in patients on long-term NSAID therapy leads to healing of gastritis despite ongoing NSAID therapy.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^117KnGjN]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

H. pylori gastritis is an infectious disease leading to chronic active gastritis of varying severity in virtually all infected subjects. There is significant variability in the interindividual expressions of gastric mucosal structural damage, and accordingly, the associated physiological perturbations also vary. H. pylori gastritis may remain clinically unapparent or evolve into severe complications. The rate of progression is unpredictable, and the most severe clinical expression is gastric cancer, which is often incurable by the time of diagnosis.

Cure of H. pylori infection leads to the healing of the inflamed gastric mucosa, which may return to normal. Eradication of H. pylori may improve or resolve dyspeptic symptoms and usually cures peptic ulcer disease (PUD). H. pylori gastritis is a disease that can be cured, thus preventing severe complications. If H. pylori gastritis has progressed to more severe forms, including atrophic gastritis with or without intestinal metaplasia or severe corpus predominant gastritis, the risk of gastric cancer is increased, and eradication of the infection at this stage needs to be integrated with a follow-up strategy.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^115aC92o]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In terms of prevalence, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a very successful human pathogen that colonizes the stomach of approximately 50% of the global population. Although most infected individuals remain asymptomatic, the persistence of the pathogen and the resulting inflammation are associated with an increased risk of developing gastric diseases, including peptic ulcer, chronic active gastritis, and gastric adenocarcinoma.

H. pylori evades the luminal gastric acid by replicating in the mucus layer close to the epithelial cells or by colonizing the glands. Bacteria can attach to epithelial cells by binding to Lewis antigens, frequently presented by host glycoproteins, including mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), CEA cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAMs), and β1-integrin. Binding to integrins promotes the expression of a bacterial type 4 secretion system (T4SS), which then translocates a bacterial protein, the cytotoxicity-associated gene A (CagA), into the host cell, where it is phosphorylated by host proteins. CagA translocation can lead to a loss of cell polarity, which can allow H. pylori to obtain nutrients. The bacterial T4SS and its effector CagA are thus considered the key drivers of pathogenicity and major risk factors for the development of gastric cancer. Bacterial peptidoglycan and ADP-heptose induce an NF-κB inflammatory response, which is thought to further drive tissue destruction and subsequent compensatory proliferation.

The gastric epithelium is organized into flask-like invaginations, the gastric units, which are further organized into regions: pit, isthmus, and gl.

### Features that aid identification of autoimmune gastritis in a background of active Helicobacter pylori infection [^114NN9dJ]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Helicobacter pylori-associated and autoimmune gastritis may coexist in a subset of patients who require treatment for both disorders.

- **Objective**: To delineate findings that identify autoimmune gastritis in the background of H. pylori infection.

- **Design**: We examined cases of (1) patients with H. pylori-associated gastritis who had successful eradication therapy and subsequent biopsies diagnostic of autoimmune gastritis, and (2) H. pylori-associated gastritis wherein pathologists noted features of autoimmune gastritis during original interpretation. Control patients underwent H. pylori eradication but lacked evidence of autoimmune gastritis or H. pylori infection after 10 years of follow-up.

- **Results**: Eight subjects had H. pylori-associated gastritis followed by H. pylori-negative sampling that showed autoimmune gastritis. Review of original samples showed full-thickness inflammation of oxyntic mucosa in 8 of 8 and oxyntic gland loss in 7 of 8 cases. Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia, pyloric metaplasia, and intestinal metaplasia were present in 4 of 8 (80% of 5 tested cases), 4 of 8, and 3 of 8 cases, respectively. Features of autoimmune gastritis were noted at the time of their original H. pylori diagnosis in 11 study subjects. Ten of 11 samples displayed full-thickness inflammation of oxyntic mucosa and/or partial loss of oxyntic glands; 8 of 11 had ECL cell hyperplasia (all tested cases), 6 of 11 showed pyloric metaplasia, and 4 of 11 harbored intestinal metaplasia. Except for full-thickness oxyntic mucosa inflammation, these features were absent in controls.

### Re.ga.in.: The real-world gastritis initiative-updating the updates [^114kLp2q]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

At the end of the last century, a far-sighted 'working party' held in Sydney, Australia, addressed the clinicopathological issues related to gastric inflammatory diseases. A few years later, an international conference in Houston, Texas, USA, critically updated the seminal Sydney classification. In line with these initiatives, the Kyoto Global Consensus Report, flanked by the Maastricht-Florence conferences, added new clinical evidence to the gastritis clinicopathological puzzle.

The most relevant topics related to gastric inflammatory diseases have been addressed by the Real-world Gastritis Initiative (RE.GA. IN.), from disease definitions to clinical diagnosis and prognosis. This paper reports the conclusions of the RE.GA. IN. consensus process, which culminated in Venice in November 2022 after more than eight months of intense global scientific deliberations. A forum of gastritis scholars from five continents participated in the multidisciplinary RE.GA. IN. consensus. After lively debates on the most controversial aspects of the gastritis spectrum, the RE.GA. IN. Faculty amalgamated complementary knowledge to distil patient-centred, evidence-based statements to assist health professionals in their real-world clinical practice. The sections of this report focus on:

- **Epidemiology of gastritis**: Exploration of the distribution and determinants of gastric inflammation.
- **Helicobacter pylori as dominant aetiology**: Examination of its role in environmental gastritis and as the most important determinant of the gastric oncogenetic field.
- **Evolving knowledge on gastric autoimmunity**: Insights into the immune responses affecting gastric tissues.
- **Clinicopathological relevance of gastric microbiota**: Understanding the impacts of microbial presence in the stomach.

Cases are usually diagnosed either with a combination of imaging modalities such as upper gastrointestinal series, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and endoscopic ultrasound or in conjunction with endoscopy and laparotomy. The authors describe a case of intramural gastric abscess in which the diagnosis was made preoperatively using axial, coronal, and sagittal reformations obtained with multidetector CT.

### Gastric wall abscess presenting as thoracic pain: rare presentation of an old disease [^1154bWGM]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Acute phlegmonous gastritis, a suppurative infection of the gastric wall, has a high mortality rate. This disease remains a mystery to most clinicians. The rarity of this disease and its nonspecific presentation make early diagnosis difficult, especially in the emergency department. We describe a case of acute phlegmonous gastritis presenting as a gastric wall abscess in a 55-year-old woman who visited the emergency department, illustrating the severity of this disease, the difficulty in its diagnosis, and its unusual presentation.

### Acute phlegmonous gastritis complicated by subphrenic abscess [^117RvSTp]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Phlegmonous gastritis (PG) is a rare and potentially fatal disease characterized by bacterial infection of the gastric wall. Its clinical features are nonspecific, which may delay diagnosis and treatment.

- **Case report**: We report a case of a previously healthy 53-year-old woman with localized PG complicated by subphrenic abscess formation. She was treated successfully with antibiotics and percutaneous catheter drainage.

- **Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?**: Early diagnosis and treatment initiation are important for improving outcomes. Emergency physicians should consider PG as a differential diagnosis in cases of acute abdomen.

### Update on the pathologic approach to the diagnosis of gastritis, gastric atrophy, and Helicobacter pylori and its sequelae [^115eMBZS]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Biopsy sampling of the gastric mucosa during diagnostic endoscopy provides information that cannot be obtained otherwise. The most common indication for gastric biopsy is to determine whether the patient is infected with Helicobacter pylori and whether the stomach exhibits gastritis. Microscopic examination of gastric biopsy specimens offers, in addition to H. pylori status, details about the grade, extent, and topography of gastritis- and atrophy-related alterations in the gastric mucosa. This information allows for further assessment of the risk and likelihood of various gastric disorders.

The presence of atrophy, characterized by the loss of mucosal glands, results in failures in the secretory functions of the corresponding mucosa and leads to disruptions in the homeostasis of normal gastric physiology. The grade of atrophy of the corpus mucosa linearly correlates with peak and maximal output of acid. The presence of advanced (moderate or severe) corpus atrophy indicates an extremely hypochlorhydric or achlorhydric stomach wherein a typical peptic ulcer is unlikely or impossible, despite a possible H. pylori infection.

Some well-characterized and common topographic phenotypes of H. pylori gastritis and atrophic gastritis can be delineated as follows:

- **Duodenal ulcer phenotype of gastritis**: Predominance or restriction of H. pylori-related inflammation in the antrum, associated with a nonatrophic corpus mucosa. This phenotype is the most common and is linked with an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease, particularly duodenal ulcers.

### Gastric wall abscess presenting as thoracic pain: rare presentation of an old disease [^113b4dgS]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Suppurative gastritis (SG) is an uncommon, often fatal condition characterized by a suppurative bacterial infection of the stomach arising from a local or disseminated hematogenous infection. SG can occur in a diffuse, localized, or mixed form. The most common type, the diffuse form, initially involves the gastric submucosa with posterior extension to all layers of the gastric wall. This progression results in extensive gangrene of the stomach and the much rarer intramural localized gastric abscess. We report a case of acute phlegmonous gastritis and discuss the diagnosis and treatment of this rare disease.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^1118mUh1]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

Urea is a byproduct of amino acid catabolism. Because larger cells produce more protein, it is likely that large cells may secrete more urea than small cells. As mentioned above, flow cytometry analysis had shown that cells in the ENR_FRTi_ condition (pit cells) are larger than cells in the ENRWFGTiNi condition (gland cells) (Supplementary Fig. 7b–e). This is also visible in the histological staining of organoids (Fig. 5e–g). Matching cells in the ENR_FRTi_ condition (pit cells) produce about three times higher concentrations of urea than cells in the ENRWFGTiNi condition (gland cells) (Fig. 5h). If urea secretion scaling with size were a major determinant of H. pylori preference, this would also be visible in all differentiated cells (irrespective of whether these are pit or gland cells). Indeed, flow cytometry analysis showed that percentages of H. pylori-infected cells correlate to the cell size, even in the absence of pit cells (ENRWFGNiTi) (Fig. 5i, j).

We conclude that urea chemotaxis leads to H. pylori's preferential binding to large cells and that the binding preference to differentiated pit cells is rooted in the cell size.

- **H. pylori localizes in close proximity to highly differentiated pit cells in vivo**: Having observed preferential binding of H. pylori to a subpopulation of highly differentiated pit cells in vitro, we examined whether this preference could be observed in vivo. For this, we used H. pylori-positive gastric biopsies from donors who underwent endoscopy diagnosis. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that H. pylori was predominantly found next to c

### Management of infection: The Maastricht VI/Florence consensus report [^114cUymh]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori infection is formally recognized as an infectious disease, an entity that has been included in the International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision. This recognition leads to the recommendation that all infected patients should receive treatment. In the context of the wide clinical spectrum associated with Helicobacter pylori gastritis, specific issues persist and require regular updates for optimized management. The identification of distinct clinical scenarios, proper testing, and adoption of effective strategies for prevention of gastric cancer and other complications are addressed.

H. pylori treatment is challenged by the continuously rising antibiotic resistance, demanding susceptibility testing with consideration of novel molecular technologies and careful selection of first-line and rescue therapies. The roles of H. pylori and antibiotic therapies, and their impact on the gut microbiota, are also considered. Progress made in the management of H. pylori infection is covered in the present sixth edition of the Maastricht/Florence 2021 Consensus Report, where key aspects related to the clinical role of H. pylori infection were re-evaluated and updated.

Forty-one experts from 29 countries, representing a global community, examined the new data related to H. pylori infection in five working groups:

- **Indications/associations**
- **Diagnosis**
- **Treatment**
- **Prevention/gastric cancer**
- **H. pylori and the gut microbiota**:

The results of the individual working groups were presented for final consensus voting that included all participants.

### Evidence that gastric pit dysplasia-like atypia is a neoplastic precursor lesion [^113gpzn3]. Human Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Most gastric cancers develop via an intestinal metaplasia (IM)-dysplasia-carcinogenic pathway. We have noted that some patients with chronic gastritis exhibit dysplasia-like atypia (DLA), which is limited to the pit epithelium but does not involve the surface epithelium. This study was conducted to determine the clinical and biological characteristics and outcomes of DLA, offering insights into its role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.

The study involved 102 consecutive patients with resected gastric cancer, a separate cohort of patients (n = 166) with chronic gastritis and IM in their index gastric biopsies, and 44 controls. All specimens were evaluated for clinical and pathological features of the cancer in the resection cohort, as well as the background mucosa. Among the 102 patients with gastric cancer, 50 (49%) exhibited DLA in areas of mucosa adjacent to or near conventional dysplasia or cancer, a value significantly higher than the controls (DLA 6.8%; P < .0001).

Gastric cancer patients with DLA demonstrated significantly higher age at presentation, exhibited intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, low-grade differentiation, stage 1 tumors, and had a higher rate of chronic gastritis, IM, atrophy, and conventional dysplasia in the background mucosa compared to patients without DLA. DLA showed intestinal-type differentiation, and a higher Ki-67 rate and MUC6 positivity compared with IM. Among the 166 patients with biopsies, DLA was identified in 24 (14%). On follow-up, 38% of positive cases showed persistent DLA, whereas 25% progressed to conventional low-grade dysplasia.

Based on these results, we conclude that…

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^1133SVng]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

To present results of the Kyoto Global Consensus Meeting, which was convened to develop global consensus on (1) classification of chronic gastritis and duodenitis, (2) clinical distinction of dyspepsia caused by Helicobacter pylori from functional dyspepsia, (3) appropriate diagnostic assessment of gastritis, and (4) when, whom, and how to treat H. pylori gastritis.

- **Design**: Twenty-three clinical questions addressing the above-mentioned four domains were drafted, for which expert panels were asked to formulate relevant statements. A Delphi method using an anonymous electronic system was adopted to develop the consensus, the level of which was predefined as ≥ 80%. Final modifications of clinical questions and consensus were achieved at the face-to-face meeting in Kyoto.

- **Results**: All 24 statements for 22 clinical questions, after extensive modifications and the omission of one clinical question, were achieved with a consensus level of > 80%. To better organize the classification of gastritis and duodenitis based on etiology, a new classification of gastritis and duodenitis is recommended for the 11th international classification. A new category of H. pylori-associated dyspepsia, together with a diagnostic algorithm, was proposed. The adoption of grading systems for gastric cancer risk stratification, and modern image-enhancing endoscopy for the diagnosis of gastritis, were recommended. Treatment to eradicate H. pylori infection before preneoplastic changes develop, if feasible, was recommended to minimize the risk of more serious complications of the infection.

### Helicobacter pylori shows tropism to gastric differentiated pit cells dependent on urea chemotaxis [^117RVFNt]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

In this study, we have characterized the highly differentiated pit cell as a preferential target cell for H. pylori binding. This subset of pit cells is characterized by the expression of high levels of MUC5AC, GKN1, GKN2, CEACAM5, PSCA, and PHGR1. MUC5AC contains Lewis B antigens, which are known to be bound by H. pylori adhesins. PSCA is a membrane-anchored glycoprotein expressed in several organs including the stomach. Its function has not been elucidated yet, but genetic variants of this gene have been associated with gastric cancer. However, in our experiments, MUC5AC or PSCA expression was dispensable for the binding. CEACAM5 is a receptor for HopQ, an H. pylori adhesin. In our sample, the CEACAM5 transcript was only detected in a fraction of the target cell population, thus it is likely that this is not the only factor important for bacterial binding in our setting. Instead, we found that chemoattraction to the host cell metabolite urea underlies the preferential binding to differentiated pit cells. Urea attraction has been described early using capillary tube assays. Recent work has identified that H. pylori directly senses urea via the chemoreceptor TlpB. TlpB has an unusually high affinity for urea, and H. pylori can detect concentrations as low as 50 nM. Simultaneous degradation of urea by H. pylori-secreted urease prevents the receptor from being saturated. This highly sensitive urea-sensing by TlpB is important for the long-term colonization of the stomach. Interestingly, TlpB gene expression is regulated via targeting a variable G-repeat in its sequence.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^111RGxts]. Gut (2015). High credibility.

The updated Sydney System has been globally implemented into clinical practice and requires proper assessment of all the relevant characteristics of H. pylori gastritis, including atrophy and intestinal metaplasia at different gastric subsites. Categorizing gastritis is clinically relevant because the 'phenotype' of H. pylori gastritis determines the risk of progression to gastroduodenal complications.

The severity and extent of atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia are well established as indicators of the increased risk for developing gastric cancer. Similarly, severe H. pylori-induced corpus gastritis is associated with an increased risk for gastric cancer. New staging systems for the characterization of gastritis have been introduced to assess the gastric cancer risk. They are used in clinical practice and are either based on the severity of atrophy in various gastric subsites (OLGA) or on intestinal metaplasia (OLGIM). Both systems, discussed further in section 3, are reported to have a positive impact on patient management.

- **Gastric erosions and chronic gastritis**: Gastric erosions should be reported separately from gastritis. The natural history and clinical significance of gastroduodenal erosions depend on etiology and need further clarification.

### Gastritis staging as a clinical priority [^116udq3i]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). High credibility.

The elective background for gastric adenocarcinoma is the atrophic transformation of the gastric mucosa. The extent of mucosal atrophy basically parallels the risk of developing gastric cancer. This means that either noninvasive (serology) or invasive (endoscopy/histology) methods enabling the atrophic transformation to be quantified can be used theoretically to assess a given patient's gastric cancer risk. This review aims to focus on the reliability of histology gastritis Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment-staging system for assessing the 'personalized' cancer risk in individuals with (atrophic) gastritis.

### Type I helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide stimulates toll-like receptor 4 and activates mitogen oxidase 1 in gastric pit cells [^116opZNX]. Infection and Immunity (2001). Low credibility.

Guinea pig gastric pit cells express an isozyme of gp91-phox, mitogen oxidase 1 (Mox1), and essential components for the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (p67-, p47-, p40-, and p22-phox). Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Escherichia coli LPS have been shown to function as potent activators for the Mox1 oxidase. These cells spontaneously secreted about 10 nmol of superoxide anion (O₂⁻)/mg of protein/h under LPS-free conditions. They expressed the mRNA and protein of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) but not those of TLR2.

LPS from type I H. pylori at 2.1 endotoxin units/ml or higher stimulated TLR4-mediated phosphorylations of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 and its binding protein 1. This induction increased TLR4 and p67-phox and upregulated O₂⁻ production 10-fold.

- **Contrast with mutants**: None of these events occurred with H. pylori LPS from complete or partial deletion mutants of the cag pathogenicity island.

- **Bioactive component**: Lipid A was confirmed to be a bioactive component for the priming effects. Removal of bisphosphates from lipid A completely eliminated the effects, suggesting the importance of the phosphorylation pattern, besides the acylation pattern, for bioactivity.

Despite H. pylori LPS generally being accepted as having low toxicity, our results suggest that type I H. pylori lipid A may be a potent stimulator for innate immune responses of gastric mucosa by stimulating the TLR4 cascade and Mox1 oxidase in pit cells.

### Classification of gastric pit patterns by confocal endomicroscopy [^117A6n8J]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Confocal endomicroscopy is a newly developed endoscopic imaging technology that provides 1000-fold magnification cross-sectional images of the gastrointestinal surface and subsurface tissue during routine endoscopy. The gastric pit patterns identified by confocal endomicroscopy and their correlation with histopathologic examination have not yet been established.

- **Objective**: Our purpose was to explore the appearance of various kinds of gastric pits and clarify the relationship between gastric pit patterns and histopathologic findings.

- **Design**: Descriptive study.

- **Setting**: Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, China.

- **Patients**: A total of 132 consecutive patients underwent confocal endomicroscopy after 7 healthy volunteers had been examined in vivo. Additionally, 10 samples resected from 10 patients with gastric cancer were examined ex vivo using confocal endomicroscopy. The confocal images obtained from the 132 patients were compared with the histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimens from the corresponding confocal imaging sites in a prospective and blinded fashion.

- **Main outcome measurements**: The relationship between the pit patterns and histopathologic findings.

- **Results**: Gastric pit patterns were classified into seven types. Normal mucosa with fundic glands mainly showed type A (round pits), and corporal mucosa with histologic gastritis showed type B (noncontinuous short rod-like). Normal mucosa with pyloric glands mainly showed type C (continuous short rod-like), and antral mucosa with histologic gastritis showed type D (elongated and tortuous branch-like). Goblet cell presence and other histopathologic features were also assessed.

### Prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors, CagA status, and the outcome of Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^111SXyH2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

To assess whether prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in patients infected with Helicobacter pylori has adverse effects on gastritis, we studied 34 H. pylori-positive individuals with reflux esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, or nonulcer dyspepsia. Half of them were on maintenance treatment with PPIs (mean, 8 years) and half were not. H. pylori and CagA status were tested serologically. Gastric biopsies were classified histopathologically by the updated Sydney classification.

Proton pump inhibitors in H. pylori gastritis are associated with significantly less antral inflammation and lower H. pylori density, regardless of CagA status. There was a tendency toward more antral atrophy in patients with the CagA strain who were undergoing maintenance treatment with PPIs (p = 0.08), but there was an opposite tendency in CagA-negative individuals (p = 0.08). Intestinal metaplasia was seen more frequently in CagA-positive, treated individuals (p = 0.028).

These findings support the hypothesis that CagA status is important in the progression to atrophy and that maintenance treatment with PPIs accelerates this progression, while reducing inflammatory infiltration.

### Kyoto global consensus report on Helicobacter pylori gastritis [^111EmDHg]. Gut (2015). Low credibility.

- **Consensus statement**: In relation to ICD-11, the classification of gastritis has been discussed extensively.

- **Section 1 - Classification of gastritis in relation to ICD-11**:

	- **CQ1 - Is the ICD-10 classification for gastritis appropriate?**
		- **Statement 1**: The ICD-10 classification for gastritis is obsolete in view of the discovery of H. pylori.
		- **Grade of recommendation**: strong
		- **Evidence level**: high
		- **Consensus level**: 100%
		- **Comment**: The ICD-10 classification of gastritis was formulated in 1989 and is still in effect in most countries. At the time of formulation, the classification of gastritis and duodenitis (K29) was rudimentary as it was based on macroscopic and histomorphological criteria; the only aetiological factor assigned was alcohol. The histological classification of gastritis considered mainly aspects of atrophy and autoimmunity. The discovery of H. pylori had not been taken into account, possibly because even though the release came after the discovery of Campylobacter pylori (H. pylori), the role of H. pylori in disease was still controversial. The recognition of H. pylori infection as the primary cause of chronic gastritis proved to be a breakthrough that reopened the chapter on gastritis and its role in disease. At present, no classification of gastritis would be complete without including H. pylori as the aetiological cause.

	- **CQ2 - Is the proposed ICD-11 classification for gastritis appropriate?**
		- **Statement 2**: The newly proposed classification of gastritis in the ICD-11 β version is an improvement because it is based on aetiological factors.

		- **Evidence level**: moderate
		- **Consensus level**: 100%
