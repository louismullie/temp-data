## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the minimum time a stretch should be held for. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which sources directly address static stretch duration. Then, I should verify whether any of these sources specify a minimum hold time. Next, I will check for any conflicting recommendations and weigh the credibility of the sources. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, reference-based answer and select the best option among the choices provided.

> Let me first confirm the most authoritative source. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Position Stand explicitly recommends that static stretches be held for 10 to 30 seconds, and this is the clearest, most direct statement of a recommended hold duration in the provided materials [^ca71b5f7].

> Wait, let me verify whether any source specifies a shorter minimum. I initially thought I saw a 5–10 second minimum somewhere, but on review, that 5–10 second figure pertains to the isometric contraction phase in proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching, not to the static stretch hold itself; the static stretch component in PNF is still advised to be 10–30 seconds, which aligns with the ACSM guidance rather than contradicting it [^ca71b5f7].

> Next, I should review other guidelines to ensure consistency. The APTA-linked hip osteoarthritis guideline recommends 15–30 seconds per stretch, which sits squarely within the 10–30 second band and supports the notion that 10–30 seconds is the standard, evidence-aligned range for static stretching in rehabilitation and fitness contexts [^39a71594].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "minimum" versus "optimal". The ACSM phrasing is a recommendation of 10–30 seconds rather than a hard minimum, but among the provided sources, no credible guideline endorses holds shorter than 10 seconds for static stretching, and several explicitly anchor the lower bound at 10 seconds, which functionally establishes 10 seconds as the practical minimum in guideline-based practice [^ca71b5f7] [^39a71594].

> I should double-check the options against this synthesis. Option A (0–10 seconds) is too short and not supported by the guidelines; Option B (10–30 seconds) matches the ACSM and APTA ranges; Option C (30–50 seconds) extends beyond the minimum and is not the lowest effective range; Option D (60 seconds) is longer than necessary for a minimum and is better reserved for specific protocols or preferences rather than the minimum hold time [^ca71b5f7] [^39a71594].

> Conclusion: The minimum time a static stretch should be held, based on the best available guidance, is 10 seconds, with a recommended range of 10–30 seconds. Therefore, the correct choice is B. 10–30 seconds [^ca71b5f7] [^39a71594].

---

The minimum time a stretch should be held is **10–30 seconds** [^ca71b5f7], as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for static stretching. This duration balances effectiveness and safety, allowing sufficient time for muscle relaxation and increased flexibility without causing injury. Shorter holds (under 10 seconds) are less effective, while longer holds (over 30 seconds) do not provide additional benefits and may increase discomfort or risk of injury.

---

## Scientific evidence supporting 10–30 seconds

The ACSM provides **clear guidance** on static stretching, recommending that each stretch be held for 10–30 seconds [^ca71b5f7]. This range is based on extensive research demonstrating that 10–30 seconds is sufficient to achieve increased flexibility and range of motion without causing undue stress or injury to the muscles and connective tissues.

---

## Physiological rationale

Static stretching involves gradually lengthening a muscle and holding it in a stretched position, allowing the muscle fibers and connective tissues to relax and adapt to the new length. Holding a stretch for **10–30 seconds** provides adequate time for the following physiological adaptations:

- **Muscle relaxation**: The initial tension in the muscle gradually decreases, allowing for greater elongation without causing reflexive contraction.

- **Increased flexibility**: Prolonged stretching within this range promotes plastic deformation of the connective tissues, leading to improved flexibility and range of motion.

- **Reduced risk of injury**: Stretching within this duration range minimizes the risk of overstretching or causing microtrauma to the muscle fibers and connective tissues.

---

## Comparison with other durations

| **Duration** | **Effectiveness** | **Risks** |
|-|-|-|
| < 10 seconds | - Less effective <br/> - Minimal increase in flexibility | Low risk |
| 10–30 seconds | - Highly effective <br/> - Optimal balance of flexibility gains and safety | Minimal risk |
| 30–60 seconds | - Slightly more effective <br/> - Diminishing returns | Increased discomfort |
| > 60 seconds | - No additional benefit <br/> - Potential for overstretching | Higher risk of injury |

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

In addition to the ACSM, several other authoritative organizations and experts in the fields of sports medicine, physical therapy, and exercise science **consistently recommend** the 10–30 second range for static stretching. These include:

- **American Physical Therapy Association (APTA)**: Recommends static stretching for 15–30 seconds, repeated 2–4 times, for optimal flexibility gains [^notfound].

- **National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA)**: Emphasizes the importance of static stretching within the 10–30 second range for improving flexibility and preventing injuries.

- **World Health Organization (WHO)**: Acknowledges the benefits of regular flexibility exercises, including static stretching, for maintaining musculoskeletal health and function.

---

## Practical implications for different populations

The 10–30 second recommendation applies broadly across populations, with minor adjustments based on individual needs and goals:

- **General population**: 10–30 seconds per stretch, repeated 2–4 times, is sufficient for maintaining and improving flexibility.

- **Athletes**: May benefit from slightly longer holds (20–30 seconds) to enhance performance and reduce injury risk.

- **Older adults**: Gentle stretching within the 10–30 second range helps maintain mobility, balance, and independence.

- **Individuals with specific medical conditions**: Should consult healthcare professionals to tailor stretching durations to their specific needs and limitations.

---

## Conclusion

The minimum time a stretch should be held is **10–30 seconds** [^ca71b5f7], as recommended by the ACSM and supported by extensive scientific evidence. This duration provides an optimal balance between effectiveness and safety, allowing for sufficient muscle relaxation, increased flexibility, and reduced risk of injury. Shorter holds are less effective, while longer holds do not provide additional benefits and may increase discomfort or injury risk.

### Preoxygenation by 8 deep breaths in 60 seconds using the mapleson A (magill), the circle system, or the mapleson D system [^1bca926a]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To investigate the efficacy of preoxygenation by eight deep breaths in 60 seconds with the Mapleson A (Magill) system, the circle anesthesia system, or the Mapleson D system at an oxygen flow of 5 L/min or 10 L/min.

Design

Randomized, clinical study.

Setting

Operating room of a university hospital.

Subjects

10 healthy volunteers.

Interventions

Volunteers underwent 6 preoxygenation trials consisting of 8 deep breaths in 60 seconds using the Mapleson A, Mapleson D, and the circle anesthesia systems at an oxygen flow of 5 L/min and 10 L/min.

Measurements

Fractional end-tidal oxygen concentration (F(ET)O(2)) was measured at 15-second intervals during preoxygenation.

Results

At an oxygen flow of 10 L/min, mean F(ET)O(2) values at 60 seconds of preoxygenation were comparable among the Mapleson A, Mapleson D, and the circle anesthesia systems (87 ± 2.1%, 87 ± 1.6%, 87 ± 1.6%, respectively). Using an oxygen flow of 5 L/min, mean F(ET)O(2) values at 60 seconds were similar among the Mapleson A, Mapleson D, and circle anesthesia systems (74 ± 4.1%, 75 ± 2.6%, 74 ± 4.4%, respectively); however, they were significantly lower than the corresponding values achieved at an oxygen flow of 10 L/min.

Conclusions

The 8-deep-breaths in 60 seconds technique at an oxygen flow of 10 L/min can achieve adequate preoxygenation with the Mapleson A (Magill), Mapleson D, and circle anesthesia systems. Suboptimal preoxygenation is obtained with the three systems when the oxygen flow used is 5 L/min.

### American College of Sports Medicine position stand. quantity and quality of exercise for developing and maintaining cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal, and neuromotor fitness in apparently healthy adults: guidance for prescribing exercise [^dbee5827]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2011). Low credibility.

The purpose of this Position Stand is to provide guidance to professionals who counsel and prescribe individualized exercise to apparently healthy adults of all ages. These recommendations also may apply to adults with certain chronic diseases or disabilities, when appropriately evaluated and advised by a health professional. This document supersedes the 1998 American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) Position Stand, "The Recommended Quantity and Quality of Exercise for Developing and Maintaining Cardiorespiratory and Muscular Fitness, and Flexibility in Healthy Adults". The scientific evidence demonstrating the beneficial effects of exercise is indisputable, and the benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks in most adults. A program of regular exercise that includes cardiorespiratory, resistance, flexibility, and neuromotor exercise training beyond activities of daily living to improve and maintain physical fitness and health is essential for most adults. The ACSM recommends that most adults engage in moderate-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥ 30 min·d on ≥ 5 d·wk for a total of ≥ 150 min·wk, vigorous-intensity cardiorespiratory exercise training for ≥ 20 min·d on ≥ 3 d·wk (≥ 75 min·wk), or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise to achieve a total energy expenditure of ≥ 500–1000 MET·min·wk. On 2–3 d·wk, adults should also perform resistance exercises for each of the major muscle groups, and neuromotor exercise involving balance, agility, and coordination. Crucial to maintaining joint range of movement, completing a series of flexibility exercises for each the major muscle-tendon groups (a total of 60 s per exercise) on ≥ 2 d·wk is recommended. The exercise program should be modified according to an individual's habitual physical activity, physical function, health status, exercise responses, and stated goals. Adults who are unable or unwilling to meet the exercise targets outlined here still can benefit from engaging in amounts of exercise less than recommended. In addition to exercising regularly, there are health benefits in concurrently reducing total time engaged in sedentary pursuits and also by interspersing frequent, short bouts of standing and physical activity between periods of sedentary activity, even in physically active adults. Behaviorally based exercise interventions, the use of behavior change strategies, supervision by an experienced fitness instructor, and exercise that is pleasant and enjoyable can improve adoption and adherence to prescribed exercise programs. Educating adults about and screening for signs and symptoms of CHD and gradual progression of exercise intensity and volume may reduce the risks of exercise. Consultations with a medical professional and diagnostic exercise testing for CHD are useful when clinically indicated but are not recommended for universal screening to enhance the safety of exercise.

### Neonatal advanced life support. neonatal resuscitation [^9450df49]. REDCROSS (2025). High credibility.

Cord milking versus delayed cord clamping and longer-delay thresholds — intact cord milking versus delayed cord clamping 30 or more seconds included a single study with 388 infants and showed no impact on neonatal mortality. For cut cord milking versus delayed cord clamping, no differences were observed in neonatal mortality (one study, 300 infants), NICU admission (one study, 200 infants) or phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia (two studies, 500 infants), and lower hematologic measures were seen at 24 hours and 7 days after birth with delayed cord clamping compared with cut cord milking. For delayed cord clamping 60 or more seconds compared with less than 60 seconds, little or no difference was shown for neonatal mortality (one trial, 231 infants), resuscitation (one trial, 60 infants), NICU admission (two studies, 291 infants), moderate-to-severe hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or respiratory support (one study, 60 infants). The systematic review concludes that delayed cord clamping or cord milking increases hemoglobin and hematocrit immediately after birth in infants at 34 or more week's gestation when compared with early cord clamping, and a weak recommendation by ILCOR suggests delayed clamping of the cord at 60 or more seconds for term and late preterm infants born at 34 or more week's gestation who are vigorous or deemed not to require immediate resuscitation at birth.

### The third American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine practice advisory on local anesthetic systemic toxicity: executive summary 2017 [^698f2b4f]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for local anesthetic systemic toxicity, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, ASRA 2018 guidelines recommend to recognize that the timing of LAST presentation is variable, with immediate (< 60 seconds) presentation suggesting intravascular injection of local anesthetic with direct access to the brain, whereas presentations delayed 1–5 minutes suggesting intermittent intravascular injection, lower extremity injection, or delayed tissue absorption. Obtain close monitoring for at least 30 minutes after injection of potentially toxic doses of local anesthetic, as LAST can present more than 15 minutes and occasionally over an hour after injection.

### Thermal inactivation spectrum of influenza A H5N1 virus in raw milk [^7d5d25e3]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Kinetics of HPAI H5N1 virus inactivation by thermal treatment in raw milk

We evaluated the kinetics of thermal inactivation of HPAI H5N1 virus in raw milk at different temperatures over time using the submerged coil system. For this, raw HPAI-spiked milk was subjected to the thermal treatment and samples were collected at different time points as follows: 50 °C - 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min; 60 °C - 5, 10, 15, 25, 20, 30, and 60 sec; 63 °C - 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 sec; and 72 °C - 5, 7, 10, 12, and 15 sec. Viral RNA and infectious virus were quantified by qRT-PCR and virus titrations (cells and ECEs), respectively. Viral RNA levels detected in untreated and heat-treated milk samples were comparable in all temperatures evaluated in the study (Fig. 5a–j). At 50 °C, we observed a gradual decrease in infectious virus titers from 4.88 ± 0.14 to 2.30 ± 0.25 log TCID 50.mL −1 within 25 min heat treatment with virus titers falling under the cell culture-based titration detection limit between the 25- and 30-min of heat treatment (Fig. 5b). Similar results were observed in ECEs with viral virus titers decreasing from 4.58 ± 0.07 to 1.17 ± 1.01 log EID 50.mL −1 within 25 min (Fig. 5c). Of note, one out of three milk samples heat treated at 50 °C for 30 min showed embryo mortality and HA activity, indicating the presence of of infectious virus in this sample. The D -value of HPAI H5N1 at 50 °C was estimated at 10.11 min (D 50°C = 10.11 min). Notably, rapid virus inactivation of HPAI H5N1 was observed in raw milk samples heat treated at 60 °C (Fig. 5e, f), 63 °C (Fig. 5h, i) and 72 °C (Fig. 5 k, l), with heating for 5 sec leading to complete virus inactivation at these temperatures. These results demonstrate that HPAI H5N1 virus is stable for at least 30 min at 50 °C in raw milk. Importantly, however, efficient and rapid inactivation of up to ~6.5 logs (within five seconds) of HPAI H5N1 virus was achieved in raw milk heat treated at temperatures of 60 °C or above.

### Part 5: neonatal resuscitation: 2025 American Heart Association and American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^c3eecc12]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Umbilical cord management — recommendation-specific supportive text indicates that deferred umbilical cord clamping beyond 30 seconds improved hematologic indices early in the newborn period and that, in 3 randomized controlled trials including 419 infants, there was no difference in mortality among term infants who received deferred or early cord clamping. More recent studies have evaluated deferred clamping for at least 60 seconds and have shown increases in hematological indices compared to shorter durations. For nonvigorous infants limited to 35 to 42 weeks' gestational age, one randomized controlled trial including 1730 nonvigorous infants compared intact umbilical cord milking to early cord clamping within 60 seconds of birth; admission to neonatal intensive care unit was not different between groups, but decreases were observed in secondary outcomes including rate of cardiorespiratory support in the delivery room, moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and use of therapeutic hypothermia. The currently available evidence does not support intact cord milking compared to deferred cord clamping in vigorous term newborns; two randomized controlled trials including 275 term infants showed no difference between hematologic indices when measured between 6 and 48 hours after delivery, and one study followed subjects to 4 months of age and found no difference between the cord milking and delayed cord clamping groups.

### Clinical impact of 3-vs. 5-minute delay and 30-vs. 60-second intervals on unattended automated office blood pressure measurements [^96ba568e]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Proportion with hypertension

There were no significant differences in systolic or diastolic HTN (i.e. SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg) between 5/60/60 and 3/30/30 protocols with respect to awake-time ABPM. Compared to awake-time ABPM, there were significant differences in the proportion with systolic HTN observed with the 5/30/30 protocol (26%, P = 0.002) and in the proportion with diastolic HTN with the 3/60/60 protocol (11.8%, P = 0.03) (Table 2; for comparisons of means of SBP and DBP, see Supplementary Table S6).

Compared to 5/60/60, the 3/60/60 and 5/30/30 protocols were associated with higher odds of systolic hypertension (average M0–M2 OR of 2.3 [95% CI: 1.0, 5.4], and 2.7 [95% CI: 1.2, 6.3], respectively) (Table 3). There were no significant differences in the odds of hypertension between the 3/30/30 and the 5/60/60 protocols.

### Rubidium rb 82 (Ruby-fill) [^c808ffc1]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3 Image Acquisition Guidelines

For Rest Imaging:

Administer a single ("rest") rubidium Rb 82 chloride dose;
Start imaging 60 to 90 seconds after completion of the infusion of the rest dose and acquire images for 3 to 7 minutes.

For Stress Imaging:

Begin the study 10 minutes after completion of the resting dose infusion, to allow for sufficient Rb 82 decay;
Administer a pharmacologic stress agent in accordance with its prescribing information;
After administration of the pharmacologic stress agent, administer the second dose of Rb 82 at the time interval according to the prescribing information of the pharmacological stress agent;
Start imaging 60 to 90 seconds after completion of the stress rubidium Rb 82 chloride dose infusion and acquire images for 3 to 7 minutes.

For Both Rest and Stress Imaging:

If a longer circulation time is anticipated (e.g., in a patient with severe left ventricular dysfunction), start imaging 120 seconds after the rest dose.
Acquisition may be started immediately post-injection if dynamic imaging is needed.

### Evaluating the efficacy of the supertowel ™ as a handwashing product: a simulation of real-world use conditions [^5818f4fb]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Experiment 4.

Treatment 4: Hand cleaning for 60 seconds with a Supertowel that is visibly dirty and oily.

The Supertowel was made visibly dirty and oily by immersing it in a mix of 5 g of sterile soil (previously autoclaved), 5 mL of clean cooking oil and 100 mL of clean tap water. The Supertowel was rubbed against itself to ensure the water, soil, and oil were spread out across the surface of the Supertowel. No additional water was added to the Supertowel. Volunteers cleaned their pre-contaminated hands with the dirty Supertowel for 60 seconds.

Control 4: Hand cleaning for 60 seconds with a clean Supertowel. The Supertowel was soaked in clean tap water by submersing it completely in a bucket filled with clean tap water. The amount of water absorbed by the Supertowel was recorded by means of weighing the Supertowel before and after soaking. The control group cleaned their pre-contaminated hands of with the soaked Supertowel for 60 seconds.

In both procedures, volunteers were instructed to move the Supertowel over all surfaces of hands, including fingers, between the fingers, fingertips, and over the back of the hands (60 seconds in total).

Round 2 experiment results showing the mean log reduction factor of Escherichia coli after volunteers washed their hands with either the Supertowel under different treatments or control procedures. *The Supertowel used when dry for 60 seconds was more efficient that handwashing with soap for 30 seconds.

We compared experiments from round 1 and round 2, to compare the various conditions used with the Supertowel. We observed that Supertowel used for 30 seconds, dirty and wet in contaminated water, was more efficient that handwashing with water for 15 seconds (P = 0.01) and as efficient as handwashing with soap for 60 seconds (P = 0.77). When the Supertowel was visibly dirty, dipped into contaminated water, and used for 30 seconds (treatment 5), it was more efficient than using the clean Supertowel with clean water for 15 seconds (P = 0.001). The Supertowel condition in treatment 5 was also as efficient as using the Supertowel for 60 seconds when soaking wet in clean water or in contaminated water or used when dirty and oily (P = 0.68, P = 0.06, P = 0.72, respectively). A dry Supertowel used for 60 seconds (treatment 6) was found to be equally efficacious as a Supertowel that is soaked or wet during 60 seconds (P = 0.18 and P = 0.06, respectively). Handwashing with soap for 15 seconds was less efficient than handwashing with contaminated water for 30 seconds (P = 0.031) and handwashing during 60 seconds (P = 0.029). However, handwashing with soap for 30 seconds with contaminated water was as efficient as handwashing with soap with clean water for 60 seconds (P = 0.74).

### Physical therapy management of older adults with hip fracture [^cc9a6bab]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2021). High credibility.

Timed Up and Go (TUG) test — validity, thresholds, and reference values: The 60-second cutoff point assessed with a walker seems to predict the ability to reach functional milestones at discharge from a subacute rehabilitation facility, and a TUG test score less than 24 seconds at acute-hospital discharge predicts nonfallers within 6 months after hip fracture (negative predictive value, 93; 95% CI: 81, 100). Floor/ceiling depends on timing and residential status; fewer than 50% with trochanteric fractures could perform the test at postsurgery day 5, while approximately 70% admitted from their own home performed the test by acute-hospital discharge. Reference values for older adults with hip fracture are not established; for older adults without hip fracture, the mean (95% CI) times are 8.1 (7.1, 9.0) seconds for 60 to 69 years, 9.2 (8.2, 10.2) seconds for 70 to 79 years, and 11.3 (10.0, 12.7) seconds for 80 to 99 years.

Treatment 2: Hand cleaning with a Supertowel that is damp for 60 seconds. The Supertowel was soaked in clean tap water by submersing it completely in a bucket filled with tap water. The water on the Supertowel was then squeezed out to the point where it was not dripping. The Supertowel was weighed before and after squeezing. Volunteers cleaned their pre-contaminated hands with the damp Supertowel for 60 seconds. Volunteers were instructed to move the Supertowel over all surfaces of hands, including fingers, between the fingers, fingertips, and over the back of the hands (60 seconds in total).

Control 2: Handwashing with bar soap and water for 60 seconds. The control group washed their pre-contaminated hands with non-medicated bar soap (Pears Bar Soap) and clean tap water for 60 seconds by following the WHO guidelines for handwashing guidelines. After handwashing, hands were allowed to dry for 3 minutes. Volunteer were instructed to wet their hands for 3 seconds, lather the soap on their hands for the subsequent 42 seconds, and then rinse with water for the last 15 seconds. The amount of water used for hand rinsing was collected from four volunteers.

### Clinical impact of 3-vs. 5-minute delay and 30-vs. 60-second intervals on unattended automated office blood pressure measurements [^fc3bc938]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Guidelines advise automated office blood pressure (AOBP) with an initial 5-minute delay and multiple measurements at least 60 seconds apart. Recent studies suggest that AOBP may be accurate with shorter delays or intervals, but evidence in clinical settings is limited.

METHODS

Patients referred to 1 hypertension (HTN) center underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and 1 of 4 nonrandomized, unattended AOBP protocols: a 3- or 5-minute delay with a 30- or 60-second interval, i.e. 3 min/30 s/30 s, 3/60/60, 5/30/30 and 5/60/60 protocols. HTN was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg.

RESULTS

We compared differences in mean blood pressure and HTN classification between average AOBP and awake-time ABPM by t -tests and Fisher's exact test. Among 212 participants (mean 58.9 years, 61% women, 25% Black), there was substantial overlap in the probability distributions of awake-time ABPM and each of the 3 AOBP measures. SBP means were similar between the 5/60/60 and 3/30/30 protocols and 5/30/30 and 3/60/60 protocols. The 5/30/30 was associated with a higher proportion of systolic HTN, while the 3/60/60 protocol was associated with a higher proportion of diastolic HTN. There were no significant differences in systolic or diastolic HTN between 5/60/60 and 3/30/30 protocols with respect to awake-time ABPM.

CONCLUSIONS

In this quality improvement study, the shortest AOBP protocol did not differ significantly from the longest protocol. The time savings of shorter protocols may improve AOBP adoption in clinical practice without meaningfully compromising accuracy.

### Part 7: adult basic life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^f87f050c]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Adult cardiac arrest — chest compression fraction (CCF), pauses, and ventilation guidance emphasize minimizing interruptions and the timing of tasks. Observational studies have shown that pulse checks can be prolonged greater than 10 seconds, further reducing the CCF. Immediate resumption of chest compressions after a shock results in a shorter perishock pause and improves the overall hands-on time (CCF) during resuscitation, and two RCTs enrolling more than 1000 patients did not find any increase in survival when pausing CPR to analyze rhythm after defibrillation. Rotating the designated chest compressor every 2 minutes is sensible, and ventilations delivered during the pause when using a 30:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio are often ineffective, with effective ventilations delivered during fewer than half of the pauses and patients with a lower proportion of effective ventilations having worse rates of ROSC, survival to hospital discharge, and survival with favorable neurological outcome. Minimizing interruptions in CPR and maintaining a CCF of at least 60% has been associated with improved outcomes, and while a CCF of 60% is considered a minimum target, high performance teams may achieve higher levels (eg, > 80%). Interruptions to CPR should only be done for interventions that are associated with improved outcomes, and at this time, there are insufficient data and evidence to support or refute any recommendations about checking a pulse during CPR.

### One-legged balance performance and fall risk in mid and later life: longitudinal evidence from a British birth cohort [^532e5c11]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Measures

Participants were instructed to cross their arms and lift their preferred leg a few inches off the ground. Nurses recorded the time the participant could maintain the position to the nearest second (age 53 years) or 1/100th of a second (age 60–64 years). Time stopped when the participant's raised foot touched the ground or after 30 seconds. Participants performed 1 eye open and 1 eye closed trial; eyes open times were used in these analyses because they are the most common visual condition for this test. Individuals who were unable to perform the test because of health reasons were allocated a balance time of 0 seconds (n = 61 at age 53 years only, n = 75 at age 60–64 years only, n = 14 at both ages).

A total of 5 groups indicated a change in balance performance from age 53 years to 60–64 years: stable high (30 seconds at both ages), stable middle (15 to < 30 seconds), stable low (0 to < 15 seconds), and improved and declined (moving from better to worse categories between ages 53 years and 60–64 years, respectively). A total of 15 seconds was chosen as the cut off for the change categories because of strong ceiling effects (69% and 50% balanced for 30 seconds at ages 53 years and 60–64 years, respectively) and to ensure a sufficient sample size across the other categories.

P033 Changes in fibrinolysis across the sepsis spectrum: The use of rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) lysis index (LI60) and D-Dimer concentration

S Pillai, G Davies, G Mills, R Aubrey, K Morris, P Williams, P Evans

NISCHR Haemostasis Biomarker Research Unit, Swansea, UK

Introduction: It is well recognised that coagulation is altered across the sepsis spectrum (sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock). Sepsis is recognised to be a prothrombotic state, due to an increased procoagulant activity and impairment of the natural anticoagulants and fibrinolytic proteins [1]. Altered fibrinolysis could have a key role in the accumulation of microthrombi leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The aim of this study was to assess the changes in fibrinolysis across the sepsis spectrum using the Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM) lysis index (LI60) and D-dimer concentration.

Methods: This study had full ethical approval from the South West Wales Research Ethics Committee. Patients with a diagnosis of sepsis were recruited from the Emergency Department and Intensive Care Unit of a large teaching hospital in South Wales. Blood samples were taken to determine ROTEM and D-Dimer concentration. Patients were followed up for 28 days to assess 28-day mortality.

### Development of a clinically feasible logMAR alternative to the snellen chart: performance of the "compact reduced logMAR" visual acuity chart in amblyopic children [^58c15d52]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Background/Aim

The "compact reduced logMAR" (cRLM) chart is being developed as a logMAR alternative to the Snellen chart. It is closer spaced and has fewer letters per line than conventional logMAR charts. Information regarding the performance of such a chart in amblyopes and children is therefore required. This study aimed to investigate the performance of the cRLM chart in amblyopic children.

Methods

Timed test and retest measurements using two versions of each chart design were obtained on the amblyopic eye of 43 children. Using the methods of Bland and Altman the agreement, test-retest variability (95% confidence limits for agreement, TRV) and test time of the cRLM and the current clinical standard Snellen chart were compared to the gold standard ETDRS logMAR chart.

Results

No systematic bias between chart designs was found. For line assignment scoring the respective TRVs were 0.20 logMAR, 0.20 logMAR, and 0.30 logMAR. Single letter scoring TRVs were cRLM (95% CL 0.17) logMAR, ETDRS (95% CL 0.14) logMAR, and Snellen (95% CL 0.29) logMAR. Median testing times were ETDRS 60 seconds, cRLM 40 seconds, Snellen 30 seconds.

Conclusion

The sensitivity to change of the cRLM equalled or approached that of the gold standard ETDRS and was at least 50% better than that of Snellen. This enhanced sensitivity to change was at the cost of only a 10 second time penalty compared to Snellen. The cRLM chart was approximately half the width of the ETDRS chart. The cRLM chart may represent a clinically acceptable compromise between the desire to obtain logMAR acuities of reasonable and known sensitivity to change, chart size, and testing time.

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^83ad7b9b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Older infants and emergency department procedures — sucrose efficacy: In older infants, sucrose appears to be less effective than in neonates, with a modest reduction in crying time at higher doses in 2-, 4-, and 6-month-olds. In Class II outpatient vaccination studies, 0.75 mL of 50% sucrose produced no difference during injection but reduced crying in the 60 seconds after injection (69% versus 83%; P < 0.05). A study using 2 mL of 75% sucrose reduced mean total crying time from 59 to 36 seconds (P = 0.00008) and reduced mean first cry duration from 42 to 29 seconds (P = 0.0004), whereas 12% sucrose showed no difference across ages 2 weeks to 18 months. Another study with 25% sucrose plus nonnutritive sucking and holding reduced total crying time and first cry duration without affecting heart rate. In the only emergency department (ED) trial involving infants less than 91 days undergoing bladder catheterization, a Class II study found no difference between placebo and 24% sucrose across three primary outcomes, with a post hoc subgroup difference limited to neonates and no difference in the 31- to 60- and 61- to 90-day groups.

### Spirometry in occupational health-2020 [^fa524370]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Spirometry in occupational health — early termination error arises "when expiration stops before the volume-time curve flattens into a 1-second plateau", so "the FVC may not be fully recorded". Such incomplete recordings "falsely increase the FEV1/FVC and may cause the spirometer interpretation to be 'normal' even when airways obstruction is present". The example shows Length of Test 5 sec versus 10 sec with FVC (L) 3.53 versus 4.08 and Ratio 69% versus 60%; "the dashed line shows the increase in FVC that would have occurred with only 5 more seconds of expiration", and "the resulting higher FVC and the lower, more accurate FEV1/FVC would trigger a correct interpretation of 'airways obstruction'. The note states "subjects should try to exhale to a 1-second plateau when possible", "however, curves longer than 15 seconds should not be recorded", and coaching is "keep blowing until I tell you to stop".

### Dual-energy CT can evaluate both hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes and lesion vascularity with a single scan at 60 seconds after contrast medium injection [^09d33041]. Academic Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Rationale and Objectives

The aim of this study was to investigate whether 80-kVp and weighted-average 120-kVp computed tomographic (CT) images scanned at 60 seconds after contrast material injection using a dual-source CT scanner could substitute for conventional 120-kVp images obtained at 30 and 100 seconds.

Materials and Methods

Eighty-three consecutive patients with suspected lung cancer were enrolled. Images were obtained in dual-energy mode (80 and 140 kVp) at 60 seconds and conventional 120-kVp mode at 30 and 100 seconds after contrast injection. The CT numbers of the pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, hilar zone lymph nodes, and pulmonary lesions were measured. Contrasts between the pulmonary artery/pulmonary vein and lymph nodes and beam-hardening artifacts were visually evaluated using five-point and four-point scales, respectively. The degree of enhancement was evaluated on 30-second 120-kVp, 100-second 120-kVp, and 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images.

Results

The mean differences in attenuation between the pulmonary artery/pulmonary vein and lymph nodes on the 30-second 120-kVp, 60-second 80-kVp, and 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images were 184/155, 130/140, and 84/92 Hounsfield units, respectively (all P values < .001). The mean contrast scores for the hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes were 4.5/4.7, 3.7/4.2, 3.3/3.6, and 2.4/2.5 for these three and for 100-second 120-kVp images, respectively (all P values < .01). The mean artifact scores of the four images were 1.2, 3.4, 3.6, and 4.0, respectively. On 60-second weighted-average 120-kVp images, 55 of 60 lesions (92%) showed higher enhancement than on 100-second conventional 120-kVp images.

Conclusions

Dual-energy CT images scanned 60 seconds after contrast injection show excellent vessel-lymph node contrast and enhancement of lesions and can replace dual-phase scan protocols.

Neonatal resuscitation — observational evidence on ventilation rate and inflation time reports that using an inflation time of approximately 0.5 seconds with a rate of 30 to 60/min resulted in delivered tidal volumes between 5 and 10 mL/kg; an inflation rate of 30/min was associated with the highest carbon dioxide clearance and the shortest time to reach end-tidal carbon dioxide > 2%; median inflation time of 0.46 seconds (IQR, 0.35–0.59 seconds) was associated with adequate tidal volume delivery, and increased inflation times were associated with a rise in tidal volume; an ILCOR task force found no benefit in using 1 or more sustained inflations of > 5 seconds for preterm infants at birth, and sustained inflations may increase mortality among the subgroup of preterm newborns < 28 weeks of gestation, with the Sustained Aeration for Infant Lungs trial including 426 newborn infants 23 to 26 weeks' gestational age.

### A novel paradigm to evaluate conditioned pain modulation in fibromyalgia [^78e9af03]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Each pressure application was 5 seconds in duration and delivered at 20 seconds intervals, beginning with 0.25 kg/cm 2 and increasing in 0.25–0.50 kg/cm 2 increments thereafter to either a maximum of 10 kg/cm 2 or to tolerance (defined here as the first stimulus to elicit a rating of 80/100 or greater, or when subjects requested the test be stopped). Subjects used a 0–100 numerical rating scale (NRS) to verbally rate the intensity of the perceived pain sensation immediately following release of each pressure application. Zero was defined as "no pain", and 100 was defined as "pain as bad as it could be". From these ratings, regression analysis was used to interpolate the pressure value corresponding to a pain intensity rating of 60 on a 0–100 NRS (pain-60). The pain-60 pressure served as the test stimulus during both pressure and cold water CPM trials and as the conditioning stimulus during the pressure CPM trials.

Prior to conditioning stimulation, baseline pain elicited by the pain-60 test stimulus was rated three times on a 0–100 NRS after 10, 20, and 30 seconds of continuous pressure (Figure 1) applied to the nondominant (left) thumbnail using the device described above. Five minutes after baseline testing, CPM was induced by applying 60 seconds of continuous pain-60 pressure to the dominant thumbnail. Alternatively, CPM was induced by immersing the subjects' dominant hand up to the wrist into a 12°C refrigerated circulating water bath (NESLAB Digital One RTE 7, Thermo Scientific, Newington, NH, USA) for 60 seconds. Pilot testing determined this temperature to be lowest tolerable by both FM patients and healthy controls. Subjects maintained their hand in an open, relaxed position for the duration. Parallel to the last 30 seconds of the pressure or cold water conditioning stimulus, the same test stimulus was reapplied to the nondominant thumbnail and rated every 10 seconds (at 40, 50, and 60 seconds). Subjects were also asked to rate the conditioning stimulus at the end of testing.

Xenon-133 ventilation imaging — phase sequence and acquisition parameters specify that the ventilation phase is usually performed before the perfusion phase, with three sets of images usually obtained nearly always in the posterior projection with the same collimator used for the perfusion examination, performed as three separate acquisitions or as a single dynamic acquisition. The first is a breath-holding view of the first deep breath after introduction of the radiopharmaceutical for 10 seconds; the second is an equilibrium phase during which the patient rebreathes the xenon-133 and oxygen usually for 2 to 3 minutes after which two static images at 90 seconds are acquired; and the third is the wash-out phase during which the patient inhales room air possibly mixed with oxygen but exhales into the xenon-133 trap while serial images are obtained at 15- to 60-second intervals for 3 to 5 minutes or until wash-out is complete, whichever comes first. Right and left posterior oblique equilibrium images may also be obtained early in the equilibrium phase and/or during wash-out, typically during the third and fourth minutes of wash-out, to provide additional information about the location of ventilation abnormalities.

Behavioral Assessments

Sensorimotor and coordination ability were assessed by investigators blinded to group assignments. Behavior tests were performed according to the described method below at a specific time point. After each test, the instrument was cleaned with 75% alcohol to prevent affecting the results of the next mouse.

Beam walking: the balance beam was 1 m long and 10 mm wide, which was 60 cm from the ground, and one end was suspended, whereas the other end served as an escape platform with a mouse cage and the chow. During the experiment, the mice were placed at the suspended end of the balance beam, and the time to reach the escape platform was recorded for each experimental mouse (the maximum monitoring time was 60 seconds, and if the escape platform was not reached, it was recorded as 60 seconds), and 3 experiments were performed for each mouse, with an interval of 60 seconds between each experiment. The final results were averaged over the 2 latter times.

Wire hang test: the 2 ends of a 2-mm diameter rope were tightened on two 60 cm tall platforms separated by 50 cm to prevent mice from falling; sponge pads were placed below the rope. For the experiment, the mouse was placed in the right middle of the tightrope, and the time the mouse reached the platform at either end from the middle of the tightrope was recorded (the maximum monitoring time was 60 seconds, and if the escape platform was not reached, it was recorded as 60 seconds). Three trials were performed for each mouse, with an interval of 60 seconds between each experiment. The ultimate results were averaged over the last 2 times.

Before the start of the experiment, mice learned to maintain balance and movement on a fatigued rotarod instrument and adapted for 5 minutes at 5 rpm. For the experiment, the mice were placed on the rotarod instrument at an initial speed of 5 rpm, which was accelerated at a rate of 1 rpm per s until the mice fell, and the latency to fall was recorded. Two experiments were performed for each mouse with a 60-second interval between the 2 experiments, and the ultimate results were averaged over 2 times.

### Timing of interventions in the delivery room: does reality compare with neonatal resuscitation guidelines? [^dc2711fd]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the proportion of infants who had the tasks recommended in the neonatal resuscitation guidelines performed within 30 and 60 seconds of birth, and the time taken to perform each task.

Study Design

From video recordings in delivery rooms, we determined the time from birth and arrival on a resuscitation table to warm, assess heart rate (HR), attach an oximeter, and provide respiratory support for each infant. We determined the proportion of infants who had these tasks completed by 30 and 60 seconds, and the median time taken to perform each task.

Results

We reviewed and analyzed data from 189 infants (median gestational age, 29 weeks [IQR, 27–34 weeks]; median birth weight, 1220 g [IQR, 930–2197 g]). Twelve infants (6%) were not on the resuscitation table within 30 seconds of birth. Less than 10% of infants were placed in polyethylene bags or had their HR determined by 30 seconds. By 60 seconds, 48% were in polyethylene bags, 33% had their HR determined, 38% received respiratory support, and 60% had an oximeter attached. The median time taken to perform all tasks was greater than that recommended in the guidelines.

Conclusion

Most newborns were not managed within the time frame recommended in resuscitation guidelines. The recommended 30- and 60-second intervals may be too short.

### Recommendations for a standardized pulmonary function report. An official American Thoracic Society technical statement [^0d1c5903]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

End-of-test plateau and duration guidance — Subjects "should be verbally encouraged to continue the expiratory effort at the end of the maneuver to obtain optimal results" and "The technician and/or reviewer must make a determination as to whether or not end-of-test criteria were met and whether the data are useful". Some "cannot achieve for the required 3 or 6 seconds", and "If these subjects have a 1-second plateau, and the reviewer judges that these maneuvers represent a maximum FVC, the grade should be adjusted higher". In obstructive disease, subjects "may never reach a plateau even at the suggested 15-second limit" and with restriction "may not be able to maintain a 6-second effort". In such cases, "The results may still be considered acceptable in such cases and an appropriate comment by the reviewer should be made".

### Recommendations for the use of antiretroviral drugs during pregnancy and interventions to reduce perinatal HIV transmission in the United States [^b9f81869]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Other intrapartum management — delayed cord clamping: ACOG now recommends delayed cord clamping for 30 to 60 seconds after birth in vigorous term and preterm infants. In the setting of HIV infection, a study of 64 mother–infant pairs in which 32 infants had early cord clamping (performed < 30 seconds after birth) and 32 infants had delayed cord clamping (performed 120 seconds after birth) found that mean hemoglobin levels at 24 hours of life were significantly higher in the delayed cord clamping group (P = 0.05), and this difference persisted at 1 month of age (P < 0.05). All mothers were on stable ARV regimens; during 18 months of follow-up, no HIV transmissions were reported, and the risk of jaundice or polycythemia in infants with delayed cord clamping did not increase.

### Thermal imaging comparison of signature, infiniti, and stellaris phacoemulsification systems [^7ad81eaa]. BMC Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Results

Mean peak temperature data at 0, 10, 30, and 60 seconds taken at 40, 60, 80, and 100% power settings for each of the 3 machines and modalities are shown in Figure 4. When the 3 machines were compared while using the same displayed power setting, the temperatures measured using Infiniti were lower than the other 2 machines at each time point past 0 seconds. Longitudinal phacoemulsification using the Signature was generally cooler than when using the Stellaris.

Figure 4
Mean temperature changes with phacoemulsification power settings of 40, 60, 80, and 100% at 0, 10, 30, and 60 seconds after power application in 3 phacoemulsification units.

A cross-comparison of torsional phacoemulsification with Infiniti at 100% power at 10 seconds showed temperatures similar to that of the Signature at 80% and the Stellaris at 60%, near 36.5°C. However after 30 seconds, the temperature from the Infiniti at 100% power was closer in value to the temperature from the Signature at 60% and the Stellaris at 40%, at about 47.5°C. In Figures 5 and 6, note that each line that connecting the Infiniti 100 data from 10 to 30 seconds crosses between 2 different lines against the other machines' data.

Figure 5
Within 10 seconds, torsional phacoemulsification with Infiniti at 100% power showed comparable data with the Signature at 80%. After 30 seconds, the temperature from the Infiniti at 100% power was lower than the Signature at 60%.

Figure 6
Within 10 seconds, torsional phacoemulsification with Infiniti at 100% power showed comparable data with the Stellaris at 60%. After 30 seconds, the temperature from the Infiniti at 100% power was lower than the Stellaris at 40%.

For all 3 machines, a higher aspiration flow rate resulted in a cooler tip.

### World Health Organization 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour [^c164aeac]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

What is new?

There are a few important differences in the new guidelines that should be highlighted for each age group. First, in adults, the previous stipulation that physical activity should be accumulated in at least 10 min bouts has been removed. This change reflects the accumulated evidence from cohort studies, which shows physical activity of any bout duration is associated with improved health outcomes, including all-cause mortality. Second, these updated guidelines for adults now specify a target range of 150–300 min of moderate-intensity and 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, compared with the previous guidelines that focused on achieving at least 150 min of moderate-intensity or 75 min of vigorous-intensity activity per week. This change acknowledges that there is a range of physical activity which captures the maximal risk reductions for health outcomes associated with physical activity and going beyond this range does not appreciably further decrease the risk of major outcomes such as all-cause or CVD mortality. Third, with respect to older adults, the recommendation regarding multicomponent physical activity that emphasises functional balance and strength training to enhance functional capacity and prevent falls now applies to all older adults rather than specifically those with poor mobility. This change acknowledges the large volume of evidence demonstrating unequivocal beneficial effects of this physical activity type on the functional capacity and risk of falls in older people with a range of functional abilities.

There was also one key change in the new recommendations for children and adolescents. Specifically, the updated recommendation is now to do at least an 'average of 60 min/day' of MVPA rather than the previously stated ' accumulate 60 min of physical activity daily'. Although this might appear to be a subtle difference, the change better reflects the scientific evidence as most studies reported associations between an average daily value of physical activity rather than an accumulation of 60 min on each and every day of the week.

The new recommendation that sedentary behaviour should be limited across all groups is an important addition to these new global guidelines since 2010 and is in line with other recent country-level guidelinesthat generally support the notion of moving more and reducing sedentary time ('sitting less' for ambulatory people). Although specifying a quantitative threshold on the amount of sedentary behaviour was strongly considered, there was insufficient evidence. Furthermore, variations in how sedentary time was measured, and that a threshold would likely vary by health outcome, by level of physical activity and by population subgroups, made quantifying upper time limits difficult to ascertain.

### ACG clinical guidelines: diagnosis and management of achalasia [^f99b2e3a]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Achalasia — pneumatic dilation (PD) technique, efficacy, predictors, and risks — The dilators come in 3 sizes (3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 cm) and are often used in a graded fashion (3.0 cm first, followed by 3.5 cm and then 4.0 cm); initial dilation using a 3-cm balloon is recommended for most patients, followed by symptomatic and objective assessment in 4–6 weeks, and a graded approach starting with the smaller 3.0-cm balloon and progressing to the larger sizes if failed therapy is recommended in all except younger male patients in whom initial approach with 3.5-cm balloon may be used. Good to excellent relief of symptoms is possible in 50%–93% of patients after PD, and cumulative dilation with 3.0-, 3.5-, and 4.0-cm balloon diameters result in good to excellent symptom relief in 74%, 86%, and 90% of patients. Predictors of favorable clinical response include older age (> 45 years), female sex, narrow (nondilated) esophagus, and LES pressure after PD of < 10 mm Hg; in younger men (age < 45 years), PD starting at 3.5 cm may be considered among initial approaches. The pressure used is usually 10–15 psi of air held for 30–60 seconds; the most serious complication is esophageal perforation with an overall median rate in experienced hands (> 100 patients treated) of 1.9% (range 0%–16%), and GERD may occur after PD in 15%–35% of patients, for whom PPI therapy is indicated in those with GERD after PD.

### Effects of delayed umbilical cord clamping at different timings on neonatal hemoglobin and maternal blood loss during cesarean delivery at term: a randomized controlled trial [^ebf3365c]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine during cesarean delivery the effects of delayed umbilical cord clamping at different timings vs early clamping in regard to neonatal hemoglobin levels and maternal blood loss.

Study Design

In total, 359 pregnant women scheduled for term cesarean delivery at 2 hospitals were randomly assigned to 4 groups: early clamping (< 15 seconds; control) or delayed by 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or 90 seconds. Primary outcomes were neonatal hemoglobin levels within 72 hours after delivery; and the change in maternal hemoglobin levels before and after delivery, an indicator of blood loss, with a prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.87 g/dL. The secondary and exploratory outcomes included neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and polycythemia.

Results

Overall adherence to the assigned interventions was 96.1%. Compared with controls, all delayed groups showed significantly higher neonatal hemoglobin levels, with mean differences (95% CI) of 1.17 (0.53–1.80), 0.89 (0.25–1.54), and 1.11 (0.47–1.76) g/dL in groups delayed for 30 seconds, 60 seconds, and 90 seconds, respectively. In regard to the change in maternal hemoglobin levels, lower limits of the 95% CIs for the differences between delayed groups and controls were all higher than the margin (-0.48, -0.11, and -0.37 g/dL, respectively). Secondary and exploratory outcomes did not show any substantial difference across groups.

Conclusions

For term elective cesarean delivery, cord clamping delayed by 30 seconds, 60 seconds, or 90 seconds vs early clamping led to similar increases in neonatal hemoglobin, and was not worse in terms of maternal blood loss.

Introduction:

In this study we use a new bedside biomarker to test its ability to measure anticoagulation effects on patients who present with acute first time deep vein thrombosis (DVT). DVT requires oral anticoagulants to prevent progression to potentially fatal pulmonary embolism and recurrence. Therapeutic efficacy monitoring of direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) including rivaroxaban is problematic as no reliable test is currently available. Advances in hemorheological techniques have created a functional coagulation biomarker at the gel point (GP) which allows quantitative assessment of: time to the gel point (T GP), fractal dimension (d f) and elasticity (G') [1, 2].

Methods:

The prospective observational cohort study measured T GP, d f, G', standard coagulation and cellular markers in first time DVT patients at three sample points: pre-treatment and approximately 20 and 60 days following 15mg BD and 20mg OD rivaroxaban respectively. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria applied.

Results:

40 DVT patients (mean age 64 years [SD ± 14.8]; 23 male, 17 female) and 177 non-DVT patients were well matched for age, gender and co-morbidities. Mean T GP on admission was 267s (SD ± 63.3s) and 262.9s (SD ± 73.5s) for DVT and Non-DVT respectively. DOAC therapy significantly increased T GP to 392.3s (SD ± 135.7s) after 20 days, and subsequently increased to 395.5s (SD ± 194.2s) at 60 days as shown in Table 1. d f, G' and standard hemostatic markers all remain within the normal range.

### Evaluating the efficacy of the supertowel ™ as a handwashing product: a simulation of real-world use conditions [^ec86405a]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

All participants were male, lived in an urban area of Mumbai, and ranged in age from 18 to 43 years (average age 25).

Table 2 describes the results from all the experiments for rounds 1 and 2. The overall mean of the log pre-values was 7.1 and the maximum detectable log reduction observed in all the procedures from all the volunteers was 4.62 (see). Figure 2 shows the results of the first round of experiments. We observed differences in log reduction with the different procedures (Kruskal–Wallis P -value = 0.0001). We found that in Experiment 1, the reduction observed when volunteers cleaned their hands with the wet Supertowel for 15 seconds was 2.71 ± 0.35, which was marginally less effective than the reference hand wash with soap for 15 seconds, 2.96 ± 0.54 (P = 0.04). All the other Supertowel treatment conditions were as efficient as their reference comparisons. The damp Supertowel (treatment 2) was as efficient as handwashing with soap when done for 60 seconds (P = 0.58). When the Supertowel was soaked with artificially contaminated water and used for 60 seconds (treatment 3), its efficacy was not statistically different as handwashing with soap and rinsing with contaminated water (P = 0.12). The Supertowel also demonstrated the same efficacy in mean log 10 -reductions, when it was artificially made dirty with soil and oil and used for 60 seconds (treatment 4) compared with a clean version of the Supertowel used for the same duration (P = 0.34). Handwashing with soap for 15 seconds was less efficient than all the other procedures which used 60 seconds for handwashing (with exception of using the Supertowel soaked in contaminated water, which had the same efficacy). Using the Supertowel when soaking wet for 60 seconds was as efficacious as when it was damp (after being squeezed to remove water) and used for the same duration (P = 0.71). The Supertowel soaked in artificially contaminated water and used for 60 seconds was less efficient than using the Supertowel which had been made visibly dirty (P = 0.006).

### American academy of audiology clinical consensus statement: assessment of vestibular function in the pediatric population [^1687f346]. Journal of the American Academy of Audiology (2025). High credibility.

Videonystagmography high-frequency headshake subtest in children — Purpose is used to assess asymmetrical vestibular system firing, with the population identified as children aged over 10 months. In normal subjects, no nystagmus should be observed in response to horizontal headshake; if there is asymmetric vestibular function, an initial burst of nystagmus, typically horizontal and beating toward the intact ear, decays over approximately 30 seconds; for central involvement, nystagmus can occur with a latent onset and/or may be persistent beyond 30 seconds, and vertical nystagmus after horizontal headshake can suggest central pathology. The method specifies the patient is seated with vision denied and head tilted 20° downward, the head is moved horizontally at about 2 Hz with displacement of approximately 30° horizontally for 15–20 seconds, and after stopping the headshake the eyes are observed for up to 60 seconds. Normative data are none specific to children, and most laboratories consider three consecutive beats of nystagmus pathological.

### ACSM revises guidelines for exercise to maintain fitness… [^ca71b5f7]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Weight Control To maintain cardiorespiratory fitness and weight control, the recommendations state that aerobic exercise should be performed three to five days a week for 20 to 60 minutes at an intensity that achieves 55 to 90 percent of the maximum heart rate and 40 to 85 percent of the maximum oxygen uptake reserve. In place of one 20- to 60-minute session on a given day, the recommendations state that two to six 10-minute periods of aerobic activity throughout the day can be used to fulfill the requirements for the amount of exercise. Lower-intensity exercise is recommended for persons who are unfit. Lower-intensity exercise should be performed for 30 minutes or more. Persons training at higher levels should exercise for at least 20 minutes. Moderate-intensity exercise for a longer duration is recommended for most adults.

The recommendations for resistance training are based on three factors: a practical amount of time to perform resistance training, the degree of training that results in improved muscular strength and endurance, and the suitability of the level of resistance training for most adults. With respect to the amount of time, the position stand notes that higher dropout rates occur when more than 60 minutes is required to complete a session. A previous study revealed that only 20 minutes is required to complete one set of weight-training exercises, whereas 50 minutes is required to complete three sets. While more frequent training and additional sets and repetitions may produce larger gains in strength, the difference in improvement is usually small in the average healthy adult, plus the average adult does not have the same goals as an athlete. In addition, more intense resistance training may increase the risk of orthopedic injury or a cardiac event in middle-aged and older participants.

With the static technique, the tendons and muscles are slowly stretched and the stretched position is held for a period of time. Static stretches should be held for 10 to 30 seconds. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching consists of alternating isometric muscle contraction and passive stretching. This technique is sometimes described as active/assisted, contract/relax or hold/relax. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation stretching should be maintained for a six-second contraction, followed by a 10- to 30-second assisted stretch. Ballistic stretching involves repetitive bouncing motions in which the tendon is rapidly stretched and relaxed.

P218 Does the infusion speed impact the hemodyamic effect of a fluid bolus in septic shock patients? A pharmacodynamic study

AP Pavot, F Gavelli, JL Teboul, S RUI, D Vimpere, I Adda, L Guerin, X Monnet

Bicetre Hospital, Medical Intensive Care, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France

Introduction:

Fluids are among the most prescribed drug in intensive care, particularly among patient with circulatory failure. Yet, very little is known about their pharmacodynamic properties and this topic has been left largely unexplored. There is a lack of strong scientific evidence in current guidelines for fluid administration in shock. Several factors may impact the hemodynamic efficacy of fluids among which the infusion rate. The aim of this study was to study the influence of fluids administration rate on their pharmacodynamics in particular by studying mean systemic pressure (P ms).

Methods:

We conducted a prospective observational study in 17 patients with circulatory failure to compare two volume expansion strategies. When a patient required a fluid bolus, 500 mL of normal saline were administered and several hemodynamic parameters were recorded continuously: cardiac output (CO), arterial pressure (AP), mean systemic pressure (P ms). Infusion rate was let to the discretion of the attending physician and a "slow" and a "fast" group were determined based on the median of the infusion time. Fluids effect was measured by the area under the curve (AUC), maximal effect (E max) and time to maximal effect (t max) for each hemodynamic variable.

Results:

P ms AUC was higher in the "fast" group compared to the "slow" group (p = 0.043). We observed a shorter t max and a higher E max for P ms in the "fast" group compared to the "slow" group (p = 0.039 and 0.02 respectively). Regarding CO, t max was also shorter in the "fast" group (p = 0.041). AUC and E max were similar between the two groups. Fluid effect dissipated within 60 minutes following the end of fluid infusion for every patient in both groups. The decreasing slope from maximal effect was comparable in the groups, for P ms and CO alike.

Conclusions:

The effect of a 500 mL fluid bolus in septic shock patients vanished within one hour. A faster infusion rate increased maximal effect and shortened the delay to reach it. Study is ongoing.

### Maximal electrogram attenuation recorded from mini electrodes embedded on 4.5-mm irrigated and 8-mm nonirrigated catheters signifies lesion maturation [^f0c95154]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The electrograms (EGMs) recorded from mini electrodes (ME) placed on the tip of the ablation electrode allow more precise EGM monitoring during lesion formation. Our objective was to define the lesion boundaries and extracardiac injuries resulting from 60-second RF application versus RF application time titrated to maximal attenuation of the ME EGM in the atria and ventricles using 4.5-mm irrigated and 8-mm catheters.

Methods

RF lesions were placed in both atria and ventricles in 13 (30–35 kg) canines; 6 (4.5-mm OI) and 7 (8 mm). The RF application time was fixed at 60 seconds or terminated at maximal ME EGM amplitude attenuation.

Results

Pre/postablation pacing thresholds, EGM amplitudes, and lesion dimensions were not significantly different between maximal EGM attenuation and 60-second RF application using either catheter. Atrial lesion transmurality was also similar for both catheters and groups 91.2% (4.5 mm) and 96% (8 mm) when the RF was titrated to the maximal EGM attenuation and 94.2% (4.5 mm) and 95% (8 mm) with 60-second RF. The 60-second RF ablation, however, presented with significant extracardiac injuries to the lungs and esophagus, along with char formation. Deep ventricular lesions were noted with maximal EGM attenuation that were not different from the 60-second RF ablation.

Conclusion

Titration of the RF application time to the maximal EGM attenuation based on the ME recordings represents atrial lesion maturation and deep ventricular lesions. Prolonging the RF application results in greater extracardiac injury and char formation without increasing lesion size.

### Simulation of airbag impact on eyes with different axial lengths after transsclerally fixated posterior chamber intraocular lens by using finite element analysis [^f706f5bc]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In a frontal crash automobile accident, drivers move forward rapidly and may be struck forcefully by a rearward-expanding bag at high velocities, causing the impacted eye to deform. Despite its overall protective effects, this forceful inflation of the airbag itself could be the major contributor of ocular injuries, even in minor accidents such as bumper-to-bumper contact or even a flat tire. According to the US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, airbags take only 20 m/second to fully inflate, which is about four times faster than blinking. Airbag deployment occurs 15 ms after an impact with complete expansion at 50 ms and deflation by 100 ms. Automobile airbags are reported to deploy at a speed ranging from 81–322 kph (22–89 m/seconds).–Considering that some situations exceeded the impact velocities in the previous report, we added 50 m/second and 60 m/second velocities to this study. From our results, ocular rupture and breakage of the sutures occurred at 60 m/second. Therefore, no further velocities were performed for the simulation. Since eyeballs are viscoelastic, their response to impact injury is rate sensitive. Therefore, we simulated the impacts of various velocities within the range of speed of deployment in this study to see the biomechanical response for different axial lengths. Our present study demonstrated that eyes remained intact up to a 30 m/second impact speed. Corneoscleral opening occurred at 40 m/second, 50 m/second, and 60 m/second, and eventually the ocular and fixation suture ruptured at 60 m/second. The results suggested that ocular rupture and fixating suture breakage could happen even at mid-speed of airbag deployment. Furthermore, at the fastest velocity of 60 m/second, corneoscleral rupture was observed as early as 0.1~0.2 ms after the airbag impact, suggesting that all eyes regardless of axial length would be vulnerable to a higher speed of impact.

### REM sleep behavior disorder and its possible prodromes in general population: prevalence, polysomnography findings, and associated factors [^fe3b02ec]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

The minimum REM sleep duration for RWA measurement was set at 30 minutes. RWA was measured on submentalis EMG by 1 trained sleep technologist (Y.K.) who was blind to other clinical information. The submentalis EMG channel sensitivity was set at 5 μV/mm with a low and high frequency filter of 10 and 70 Hz, respectively. A notch filter was set at 60 Hz. The presence of tonic, phasic, and any EMG activity during REM was visually determined and quantified according to the criteria published in previous studies and recommended as acceptable in the guidelines from the International RBD Study group. Thirty-second epochs were used to score tonic EMG activity. An epoch was classified as tonic when continuous EMG activity with amplitude of at least 10 μV or ≥ 2 times higher than the background was present for more than 50% of the analyzable segment. For the analysis of phasic activity, each 30-second epoch was subdivided into ten three-second mini-epochs. A mini-epoch was considered "phasic" when it contained EMG bursts with an amplitude ≥ 4 times higher than the background activity and a duration of 0.1–3.0 seconds. The end of phasic activity was defined as a recognizable return of EMG activity to the baseline level for at least 200 milliseconds. A 30-second epoch containing at least 5 (50%) 3-second mini-epochs with a phasic EMG bursts was considered as phasic. A mini-epoch with either tonic or phasic activity was counted as a mini-epoch with any EMG activity. Any parts with respiratory event-related artifacts or arousals within the 30-second or 3-second epochs were excluded from the analysis.

### Home oxygen therapy for children. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^0daf3ff5]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Sleep-related risks — hypoxemia during sleep is linked to brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs), with specific physiologic thresholds in premature infants. Older studies have identified that exposure to hypoxemia during sleep predisposes infants to increased periodic breathing, hypoventilation, and central apneas and place those individuals at increased risks for brief resolved unexplained events (BRUEs) (formerly apparent life-threatening events). Risk factors for more severe BRUEs in premature infants include central apnea longer than 30 seconds, Spo2 less than 80% for 10 seconds, bradycardia to less than 50–60 beats per minute for 10 seconds, and upper respiratory infection symptoms.

### The heart rate variability-derived newborn infant parasympathetic evaluation (NIPE ™) index in pediatric surgical patients from 0 to 2 years under sevoflurane anesthesia – A prospective observational pilot study [^3da0827b]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

3.2 Course of NIPE and HR values around opioid administration due to perceived insufficient antinociception

Data from 10 events recorded in patients with NIPE values < 50 at the time of decision (Decision NIPE < 50), were available for analysis. RM‐ANOVA revealed no evidence of a difference between NIPE‐values at the time of decision to give opioid drugs due to a perceived need for additional opioid drug analgesia and NIPE‐values 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds before. The reasons to give additional opioid drugs were either a perceived rise in heart rate, patient movement or the subjective impression of the anesthetist. Due to the relatively low number of total events we were unable to perform a meaningful subgroup analysis as to the reason to give additional opioid drugs. We found evidence of an increase in NIPE values 90 and 120 seconds after drug administration (fentanyl 1.6 ± 0.6 µg/kg [n = 25], sufentanil 0.2 µg/kg [n = 5], or increasing remifentanil infusion at the discretion of the anesthetist [n = 10]) compared to the moment of the intervention and a weak evidence of such a difference 60 seconds after drug administration. There was no evidence of a change in heart rate during the entire period (before decision: P = 0.165; after opioid administration: P = 0.063). Data from 30 events recorded in patients with NIPE values ≥ 50 at the time of decision (Decision NIPE ≥ 50), showed stable NIPE‐ and HR values during the entire period before and after opioid drug administration. For details see Figure 1 and Table 2.

### Is the time right for quantitative public health guidelines on sitting? A narrative review of sedentary behaviour research paradigms and findings [^a9c6f8c9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Are we close to understanding the threshold of daily sitting that is harmful?

It is well established that the association of daily sitting time and most long-term outcomes is not linear. Dose–response evidence on mostly self-reported sitting time in adults suggests that CVD risk is elevated at approximately 6–10hours/day, while the corresponding threshold for ACM appears to be approximately 8 hours/day. But how confident can one be that the above self-reported daily thresholds are close to the true population values of sitting? Comparative international studies consistently report median self-reported durations in the region of 5 hours/day. On the other hand, national surveillance studies that used waist-worn accelerometersand smaller studies that used inclinometersreported estimates in the region of 8–9.5 hours/day of SB and sitting, respectively. Taken together, it appears that self-reports may underestimate sedentary time by a relative large margin when compared with objective methods. Although it is difficult to estimate the exact degree of measurement error from self-reported sitting time, the above data suggest this could be as high as a 40%–60%. This may have implications for the thresholds identified in the above meta-analyses. Theoretically, if assuming a similar proportion of reporting errors from previous epidemiological studies, the daily thresholdsfor an association between self-reported sitting and health outcomes at the population level may be as high as 11–13 (ACM) and 14–16 hours/day (CVD). Although the above extrapolations are too crude to form the basis of guidelines, such high amounts of daily sitting may reflect underlying poor health more than a sedentary lifestyle. In the absence of long-term prospective epidemiological evidence from studies that used objective measures of actual sitting (as opposed to absence of ambulatory movement), any quantitative daily sitting guideline may be misleading.

### ACR-ACNM-SNMMI-SPR practice parameter for the performance of gastrointestinal tract, hepatic, and splenic scintigraphy [^20b52161]. SNMMI/SPR/ACR/ACNM (2025). High credibility.

Acute gastrointestinal bleeding scintigraphy — protocol and performance: Diagnosis and localization require active bleeding with imaging while the radiopharmaceutical is in the blood pool. The use of Tc-99m RBCs (autologous) is the recommended method because they remain intravascular and permit a longer imaging time, and the clinical detection rate can be as low as 0.1 mL/min in clinical studies - 0.04 mL/min in experimental animal models. 99m SC is an alternative radiopharmaceutical but is less superior to Tc-99m RBCs for this purpose, and if used, imaging is usually performed for 20–30 minutes because of the rapid clearance of SC from the intravascular space. No patient preparation is required and the patient should void immediately before imaging. After IV injection, dynamic anterior abdominal imaging first includes a blood flow/angiographic phase (rate of 1 frame per 1–3 seconds for 60 seconds) and then continues for another 60–120 minutes (preferably 1 frame per 10–20 seconds). If the examination is negative, continued imaging is appropriate for up to 24 hours; SPECT/CT, although not routinely performed, can be of value to more definitively localize the site of bleeding, and if gastric activity is noted, further head and neck static images can assess for thyroid and salivary gland uptake to help differentiate between gastric bleeding and the presence of free pertechnetate.

### Saline flush after rocuronium bolus reduces onset time and prolongs duration of effect: a randomized clinical trial [^b10cc6d9]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Circulatory factors modify the onset time of neuromuscular-blocking drugs. Therefore, we hypothesized that infusion of a saline flush immediately after rocuronium administration would shorten the onset time without influencing the duration of the rocuronium effect.

Methods

Forty-eight patients were randomly allocated to the control or saline flush group. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with propofol and remifentanil, and all patients received 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium in 10 mL of normal saline. In the saline flush group, 20 mL normal saline was immediately infused after rocuronium administration. Neuromuscular blockade was assessed using acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle with train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. The neuromuscular indices for rocuronium were calculated as follows: the latent onset time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium infusion until first occurrence of depression of the first twitch of the TOF (T1) ≥ 5%; onset time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium infusion until first occurrence of depression of the T1 ≥ 95%; clinical duration, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium administration until T1 recovered to 25% of the final T1 value; recovery index, defined as the time for recovery of T1 from 25% to 75% of the final T1 value; and the total recovery time, defined as the time from the start of rocuronium administration until reaching a TOF ratio of 0.9. Significance was designated at P < 0.05.

Results

The measured latent onset time and onset time were significantly shorter in the saline flush group than the control group by 15 seconds (95.2% confidence interval, 0–15, P = 0.007) and 15 seconds (0–30, P = 0.018), respectively. Saline flush significantly depressed the T1 height at 30, 45, and 60 seconds after the rocuronium bolus by 17%, 24%, and 14%, respectively. In addition, the recovery phase was significantly prolonged in the saline flush group. The mean clinical duration (5th-95th percentile range) in the saline flush group and control group was 35 minutes (27–63 minutes) and 31 minutes (19–48 minutes; P = 0.032), respectively; the recovery index was 13 minutes (8–25 minutes) and 10 minutes (7–19 minutes; P = 0.019), respectively; and the total recovery time was 61 minutes (44–108 minutes) and 50 minutes (35–93 minutes; P = 0.048), respectively.

Conclusions

Administering a 20-mL saline flush immediately after infusion of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium in 10 mL normal saline shortened the onset time and prolonged the recovery phase of neuromuscular blockade.

### A modified burn comb model with a new dorsal frame that allows for local treatment in partial-thickness burns in rats [^67134160]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Burn wound progression (BWP) leads to vertical and horizontal injury extension. The "burn comb model" is commonly used, in which a full-thickness burn with intercalated unburned interspaces is induced. We aimed to establish an injury progressing to the intermediate dermis, allowing repeated wound evaluation. Furthermore, we present a new dorsal frame that enables topical drug application. Eight burn fields and six interspaces were induced on each of 17 rats' dorsa with a 10-second burn comb application. A developed 8-panel aluminum frame was sutured onto 12 animals and combined with an Elizabethan collar. Over 14 days, macroscopic and histologic wound assessment and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) were performed besides evaluation of frame durability. The 10-second group was compared with nine animals injured with a full-thickness 60-second model. Frame durability was sufficient up to day 4 with 8 of the 12 frames (67%) still mounted. The 60-second burn led to an increased extent of interspace necrosis (P = 0.002). The extent of necrosis increased between days 1 and 2 (P = 0.001), following the 10-second burn (24% ± SEM 8% to 40% ± SEM 6%) and the 60-second burn (57% ± SEM 6% to 76% ± SEM 4%). Interspace LSCI perfusion was higher than burn field perfusion. It earlier reached baseline levels in the 10-second group (on day 1: 142% ± SEM 9% vs 60% ± SEM 5%; P < .001). Within day 1, the 10-second burn showed histological progression to the intermediate dermis, both in interspaces and burn fields. This burn comb model with its newly developed fixed dorsal frame allows investigation of topical agents to treat BWP in partial-thickness burns.

### Free-breathing simultaneous, andquantification in the myocardium [^140944c7]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3 Simulations

Bloch simulations were used to calculate the magnetization of the proposed SATURN sequence and validate the accuracy of the quantification. All pulse sequences were simulated with the above listed sequence parameters. The magnetization was simulated with time‐steps of 0.1 ms. Imaging and preparation pulses were simulated with corresponding rotation matrices with 100% efficiency. The center of the k‐space was chosen to extract the signal magnitude.(1200‐1700 ms),(20‐70 ms), and(5‐60 ms) were varied and the magnitude was fitted with the proposed 5‐parameter fit model given in Equation (1). Four confounding factors were included in the simulations: Rest periods before thepreparation pulses were varied between 1 and 10 seconds. For all other simulations, 10 seconds were used to eliminate insufficient recovery as the primary source of inaccuracy. Image noise was added to the simulations. Rician noise was generated with an SNR between 0 and 30 and a Monte Carlo size of 1000. Different heart rates were simulated between 50 and 140 bpm. Finally, imperfectpreparation was simulated by reducing the flip angle of the flip‐down and flip‐up pulses.

2.4 Phantom experiments

Phantom measurements were performed to evaluate the accuracy and precision of the proposed SATURN sequence. Reference measurements forwere performed using an inversion‐recovery spin echo sequence with = 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 8000 ms, TE/TR = 12/10 000 ms, and imaging geometry as specified above.reference scans were performed with a spin echo sequence with TE = 17, 30, 50, 100, 150, 250 ms and otherwise identical imaging parameters to the inversion recovery spin‐echo (IR‐SE). GRE was performed forquantification with 12 contrasts ranging from TE = 2‐60 ms, TR = 10 000 ms and 1 k‐space line per readout with the same imaging parameters listed above. All measurements were additionally compared with single‐parameter methods for myocardial mapping (listed in Table 1): SASHA 46 with a minimum and maximum saturation time of 103 ms and 600 ms,‐prepared bSSFP using 4 differentweightings (0 ms, 25 ms, 50 ms, andms) and a 3‐parameter fit model, 22, 47 and multi‐GREwith 8 echoes ranging from 1.6 to 16.3 ms 19 using the 2‐parameter truncation model. 36 The cardiac cycle was simulated and set to a heart rate (HR) of 60 bpm.

### Feasibility of smartphone-supported, combined physical and cognitive activities in the neighbourhood for stimulating social participation of the elderly [^f90c2577]. BMC Geriatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

A particular focus of the intervention was the promotion of social participation through the maintenance and/or improvement of (instrumental) activities of daily living, physical mobility and autonomy. If requested, the tutors gave limited advice on possible primary or secondary care based on their therapeutic background and experience, but they did not provide any curative or therapeutic care.

Based on the recommendations by the American College of Sports Medicine, the following weekly physical activities and exercises and progression were recommended to most of the participants:
Aerobic activities: 1 × 20 minutes (first month) ➔ 2–3 × 30–60 minutes (sixth month)
Resistance training: 1 × 4–6 exercises, 1 × 10–15 repetitions, each with low to moderate resistance (first month) ➔ 1–2 × 4–6 exercises, 3 × 8–12 repetitions with high resistance (sixth month)
Balance training: 1 × 4 static exercises, 2 × 15–30 seconds each (first month) ➔ 2 × 6 static and dynamic exercises, 4 × 30–60 seconds each or 10–15 repetitions, respectively (sixth month)
Stretching according to individual needs

During the multimodal group training, for each of these domains, exemplary activities and exercises were performed together, and individual feedback was provided to the participants. Participants were instructed to try out various ways to accumulate the recommended dose of physical activity in each domain throughout every week. In doing so, they were free to choose "hot spot" activities, group challenge tasks, solitary physical training (smartphone-supported), or personal challenge tasks or any preferred combination of these (see Table 1). If participants already met or surpassed the recommended dose of physical activity, they were suggested to slowly increase the intensity or difficulty level, or the total amount of activities.

Cognitive-linguistic training was partially based on existing training programmes (SimA, NeuroVitalis) and progressed according to the following scheme:
First–sixth month: at least 10 minutes/day, self-paced cognitive training (attention, working memory, executive control, verbal ability), according to individual needs
First–second month: 30 minutes/week, attention and focus (psychoeducation, group activity)
Third–fourth month: 30 minutes/week, executive control (psychoeducation, group activity)
Fifth–sixth month: 30 minutes/week, sensory systems and visual perception (psychoeducation, group activity)

### Randomized trial comparing early and late administration of rocuronium before and after checking mask ventilation in patients with normal airways [^ab49a9fe]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

During induction of general anesthesia, it is common practice to delay neuromuscular blockade until the ability to deliver mask ventilation has been confirmed. However, the benefits of this approach have never been scientifically validated. We thus compared the early and late administration of rocuronium before and after checking mask ventilation to investigate the efficiency of mask ventilation and the time to tracheal intubation in patients with normal airways.

Methods

Patients (n = 114) were randomized to receive IV rocuronium either before (early rocuronium group, n = 58) or after (late rocuronium group, n = 56) checking mask ventilation. Expiratory tidal volumes (VTs) were measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea during mask ventilation. We graded the ease of mask ventilation and measured the time from apnea to tracheal intubation. The primary outcome was the average of mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea. The main secondary outcome was the time from apnea to tracheal intubation. STATA was used for statistical analysis.

Results

The average of mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea was larger in the early rocuronium group than in the late rocuronium group (552 mL breath [165 mL breath] vs 393 mL breath [165 mL breath], mean difference, 160 mL breath; 95% CI, 98–221 mL breath; P < .001, unpaired t test). Because the interaction between time and group was significant in mask VTs measured at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 seconds after apnea (P < .001, linear mixed effects model), pairwise comparisons were performed at the 6 time points. The differences in VTs between the groups were significant at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 seconds after apnea (P < .001 each, contrast statements in STATA). The time from apnea to tracheal intubation was shorter in the early rocuronium group than in the late rocuronium group (116 seconds [42 seconds] vs 195 seconds [41 seconds]; mean difference, -79 seconds; 95% CI, -96 to -64 seconds, P < .001).

Conclusions

The early administration of rocuronium before checking mask ventilation resulted in a larger mask VT and earlier tracheal intubation than the late administration of rocuronium after checking mask ventilation in patients with normal airways.

### Noninvasive respiratory support [^6d30641f]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

NIPPV and BiPAP — technical considerations indicate that nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) most commonly uses a ventilator to provide intermittent breaths at peak inspiratory pressures and rates similar to those used for mechanical ventilation. Randomized clinical trials in human newborn infants have used set peak pressures (10–25 cm H2O pressure) and ventilator rates (10–60 per minute), variable inflation times (0.3–0.5 seconds) and synchronized or nonsynchronized breaths, whereas bilevel nasal CPAP (BiPAP) systems provide sigh breaths with longer inflation times (0.5–1.0 second for the higher nCPAP pressure), lower cycle rates (10–30 per minute), and small differences (< 4 cm H2O) between high and low nCPAP pressures. Intermittent breaths are generally delivered through short binasal prongs, although masks and long nasopharyngeal tubes have been used. Synchronization of breaths is difficult with NIPPV or BiPAP; a pneumatic capsule placed on the abdomen in the Infant Star ventilator to allow patient triggering is no longer available, the Infant Flow Advance BiPAP device using an abdominal trigger is not approved for use in the United States, and other synchronization approaches have not been investigated in large randomized trials.

### Effect of corneal drying on central corneal thickness [^4a0ce8b0]. Journal of Glaucoma (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the amount of corneal thinning induced by corneal drying, and to discuss its possible consequences on applanation pressure.

Patients and Methods

Two sets of central corneal thickness measurement from 100 eyes of 100 patients were taken by ultrasonic pachymeter at time settings of 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 seconds. During the first set (group 1), patients were asked to blink voluntarily between the measurements. During the second set (group 2), the same patients were prevented from blinking during the measurements.

Results

Mean central corneal thickness at 0 second in groups 1 and 2 were 547.0 ± 37.4 microm, and 546.7 ± 37.6 microm, respectively. Corneal thickness did not change significantly in group 1, but did significantly decrease in group 2. Rate of thinning increased linearly during the first 30 seconds, and then leveled around 0.3 microm/s up to 60 seconds. Mean corneal thickness decreased 3.0% during the 60 second drying. The decrease in thickness was significant when each time point in group 2 was compared with the preceding one (P < 0.01). Neither age nor 0 second corneal thickness in group 2 showed a significant correlation with the amount of corneal thinning at 60 seconds.

Conclusion

Corneal thickness may significantly decrease during 1 minute of drying. Decreased thickness may result in underestimation of applanated pressure as well as central corneal thickness.

### Effect of hospitalizations on physical activity patterns in mobility-limited older adults [^e8c6b56c]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the effect of hospitalizations on patterns of sedentary and physical activity time in mobility-limited older adults randomized to structured physical activity or health education.

Design

Secondary analysis of investigator-blinded, parallel-group, randomized trial conducted at 8 U.S. centers between February 2010 and December 2013.

Participants

Sedentary men and women aged 70 to 89 at baseline who wore a hip-fitted accelerometer 7 consecutive days at baseline and 6, 12, and 24 months after randomization (N = 1,341).

Measurements

Participants were randomized to a physical activity (PA; n = 669) intervention that included aerobic, resistance, and flexibility training or to a health education (HE; n = 672) intervention that consisted of workshops on older adult health and light upper-extremity stretching. Accelerometer patterns were characterized as bouts of sedentary (< 100 counts/min; ≥ 1, ≥ 10, ≥ 30, ≥ 60 minute lengths) and activity (≥ 100 counts/min; ≥ 1, ≥ 2, ≥ 5, ≥ 10 minute lengths) time. Each participant was categorized as having 0, 1 to 3, or 4 or more cumulative hospital days before each accelerometer assessment.

Results

Hospitalization increased sedentary time similarly in both intervention groups (8 min/d for 1–3 cumulative hospital days and 16 min/d for ≥ 4 cumulative hospital days). Hospitalization was also associated with less physical activity time across all bouts of less than 10 minutes (≥ 1: -7 min/d for 1–3 cumulative hospital days, -16 min/d for ≥ 4 cumulative hospital days; ≥ 2: -5 min/d for 1–3 cumulative hospital days, -11 min/d for ≥ 4 cumulative hospital days; ≥ 5: -3 min/d for 1–3 cumulative hospital days, -4 min/d for ≥ 4 cumulative hospital days). There was no evidence of recovery to prehospitalization levels (time effect p > .41). PA participants had less sedentary time in bouts of less than 30 minutes than HE participants (-8 to -10 min/d) and more total activity (+3 to +6 min/d), although hospital-related changes were similar between the intervention groups (interaction effect p > .26).

Conclusion

Participating in a PA intervention before hospitalization had expected benefits, but participants remained susceptible to hospitalization's detrimental effects on their daily activity levels. There was no evidence of better activity recovery after hospitalization. J Am Geriatr Soc 67:261–268, 2019.

Surveyor assay for endogenous gene modification. Genetic modifications were quantified using the Surveyor nuclease assay, which detects mutations characteristic of nuclease-mediated nonhomologous end-joining. After transfection, cells were incubated for 3 or 10 days at 37 °C, and genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen). The target locus was amplified by 35 cycles of PCR with the AccuPrime High Fidelity PCR kit (Invitrogen) using primers specific to each locus (Supplementary Table S5). The resulting PCR products were randomly melted and reannealed in a thermal cycler with the program: 95 °C for 240 seconds, followed by 85 °C for 60 seconds, 75 °C for 60 seconds, 65 °C for 60 seconds, 55 °C for 60 seconds, 45 °C for 60 seconds, 35 °C for 60 seconds, and 25 °C for 60 seconds with a −0.3 °C/second rate between steps. Following reannealing, 8 μl of PCR product was mixed with 1 μl of Surveyor Nuclease S and 1 μl of Enhancer S (Transgenomic) and incubated at 42 °C for 1 hour. After incubation, 6 μl of digestion product was loaded onto a 10% TBE polyacrylamide gel and run at 200 V for 30 minutes. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide and quantified by densitometry using the ImageLab software suite (Bio-Rad) as previously described.

### Defining the optimal degree of heparin anticoagulation for peripheral vascular interventions: insight from a large, regional, multicenter registry [^06d19ac6]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal degree of heparin anticoagulation for peripheral vascular interventions (PVIs) has not been defined. We sought to correlate total heparin dose and peak procedural activated clotting time (ACT) with postprocedural outcomes in patients undergoing PVI.

Methods and Results

We studied 4743 patients who received heparin during PVIs in a regional, multicenter registry. From those, 1246 had recorded peak procedural ACT with the same point-of-care device. Periprocedural and in-hospital outcomes were compared between patients who received a total heparin dose < 60 U/kg (n = 2161) and ≥ 60 U/kg (n = 2582). Similarly, outcomes were evaluated between groups with a peak procedural ACT < 250 seconds (n = 855) and ≥ 250 seconds (n = 391). Technical and procedural success as well as intraprocedural thrombotic events did not differ between groups. Patients with heparin dose ≥ 60 U/kg had a higher rate of postprocedural hemoglobin drop ≥ 3 g/dL (7.09% versus 5.09%, respectively, P = 0.004) and a higher transfusion rate compared with those with heparin dose < 60 U/kg (4.92% versus 3.15%, respectively, P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, independent predictors of bleeding requiring transfusion were total heparin dose ≥ 60 U/kg, ACT ≥ 250 seconds, female sex, age ≥ 70 years, prior anemia, prior heart failure, low creatinine clearance, hybrid vascular surgery, rest pain, and below-knee intervention. In propensity-matched, risk-adjusted models and after hierarchical modeling, total heparin dose ≥ 60 U/kg and ACT ≥ 250 seconds remained strong predictors of post-PVI drop in hemoglobin ≥ 3 g/dL or transfusion.

Conclusions

During PVI, higher total heparin dose (≥ 60 U/kg) and peak ACT ≥ 250 seconds were predictors of postprocedural transfusion. The high technical and procedural success in all groups suggests that use of weight-based heparin dosing with a target ACT < 250 seconds in PVI may minimize the bleeding risk without compromising procedural success or increasing thromboembolic complications.

Abbreviations: M(IQR) Median(interquartile range), Mean ± SD Mean ± Standard Deviation, PAQLQ Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, PIFR peak inspiratory flow rate, VIE effective inspiratory volume, EIT effective inspiratory time, BHT breath-hold time after inspiratory, Tmin time to reach the minimum effective inspiratory flow rate, Tpf time to reach the peak inspiratory flow rate

*Means that there was a significant distribution or difference between the different levels of inhaler technique groups

Inhaler technique

The most frequent errors made by the participants with Turbuhaler ® are shown in Fig. 2 A. Among the 141 patients, only 50 patients(35.5%) achieved an optimal score of 10 points on the checklist. The four most common incorrect steps were "exhale to residual volume" (35.5% made errors), "inhale forcefully and deeply" (13.5% made errors), "rinse mouth after inhalation" (13.5% made errors), and "take inhaler out of mouth holding breath for 5s" (11.3% made errors). The inappropriate inhalation parameters are shown in Fig. 2 B. The proportion of all patients with inappropriate EIT (< 2 s) was the highest (90.8%), followed by the proportion of patients who did not reach the optimal PIFR (< 60L/min) (41.8%). The inappropriate inhalation parameters in three groups are shown in Fig. 2 C. In the three groups with good, moderate, poor inhaler techniques, 0, 2 (7.1%), and 2 (25.0%) patients did not reach the minimum PIFR (< 30L/min), respectively. Meanwhile, 38 (36.2%), 15 (53.6%), and 6 (75.0%) patients did not reach the optimal PIFR (< 60L/min), respectively.

### Evaluation of posttetanic motor evoked potentials – the influences of repetitive use, the residual effects of tetanic stimulation to peripheral nerve, and the variability [^9e80c909]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, we developed a new technique to augment myogenic motor evoked potentials (MEPs), called as posttetanic MEPs (p-MEPs), in which tetanic stimulation is applied to peripheral nerve before transcranial stimulation. However, the data on p-MEPs are limited. This study was conducted; (1) to evaluate the influences of repetitive use of p-MEPs on p-MEP amplitudes, (2) to evaluate the residual effects of use of p-MEPs on subsequent conventional MEPs (c-MEPs), and (3) to compare the variability of p-MEPs with that of c-MEPs.

Methods

Sixty patients under propofol/fentanyl anesthesia with partial neuromuscular blockade were enrolled. For p-MEP measurements, tetanic stimulation was applied to posterior tibial nerve 1 second before transcranial stimulation. In study 1, p-MEPs were repetitively recorded with intervals of 10 or 60 seconds. In study 2, the amplitudes of c-MEPs recorded 15, 30, 60, and 120 seconds after p-MEP recordings were compared with those of control. In study 3, the coefficients of variation of c-MEP and p-MEP responses were compared.

Results

The repetitive use of p-MEP with an interval of 10 seconds, but not 60 seconds, induced a significant reduction of p-MEP amplitude. Amplitudes of c-MEP were significantly increased when applied within 60 seconds after p-MEP recordings. The coefficient of variations of p-MEPs was similar to those of c-MEPs.

Conclusions

The results indicated that the amplitudes of p-MEP and c-MEP might be affected when applied with a short interval after p-MEP recording.

### Over-the-wire catheter exchanges: reduction of the risk of air emboli [^a64c71d5]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the aerostatic properties of the catheter clamp during over-the-wire catheter exchanges and determined if protective devices reduce volumes of air emboli (AE).

Materials and Methods

A cuffed catheter was placed in an AE model in physiologic conditions and the volume of AE was recorded during 60 seconds (n = 10). Similarly, the volume of AE entering the model during 30 seconds was recorded with the catheter clamp open (n = 10) or closed over the wire (n = 10), and with the sliding clamp in the open position (n = 10). The volume of AE during 60 seconds was recorded with the sliding clamp closed over the wire (n = 10) and with the aerostatic valve with (n = 10) and without (n = 10) a wire in place.

Results

Without a wire, no AE occurred with the catheter clamp closed (60 seconds, n = 10). There was no statistically significant difference between the volumes of AE with the catheter clamp open or closed over the wire during 30 seconds (43 mL ± 4 and 32 mL ± 11, respectively). With the protective devices in place and the wire unchanged in position, no AE occurred during 60 seconds. A positive control (sliding clamp and catheter clamp open, n = 10) yielded AE volumes of 44 mL ± 5 in 30 seconds.

Conclusions

AE can occur with the catheter clamp closed over a wire. Protective devices reduce the volume of AE under simulated physiologic conditions and are recommended with over-the-wire catheter exchanges.

### Phase 1b randomized study of antidote-controlled modulation of factor IXa activity in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^ae0fb765]. Circulation (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Whether selective factor IXa inhibition produces an appropriate anticoagulant effect when combined with platelet-directed therapy in patients with stable coronary artery disease is unknown. REG1 consists of RB006 (drug), an injectable RNA aptamer that specifically binds and inhibits factor IXa, and RB007 (antidote), the complementary oligonucleotide that neutralizes its anti-IXa activity.

Methods and Results

We evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic profile of REG1 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, assigning 50 subjects with coronary artery disease taking aspirin and/or clopidogrel to 4 dose levels of RB006 (15, 30, 50, and 75 mg) and RB007 (30, 60, 100, and 150 mg). The median age was 61 years (25th and 75th percentiles, 56 and 68 years), and 80% of patients were male. RB006 increased the activated partial thromboplastin time dose dependently; the median activated partial thromboplastin time at 10 minutes after a single intravenous bolus of 15, 30, 50, and 75 mg RB006 was 29.2 seconds (25th and 75th percentiles, 28.1 and 29.8 seconds), 34.6 seconds (25th and 75th percentiles, 30.9 and 40.0 seconds), 46.9 seconds (25th and 75th percentiles, 40.3 and 51.1 seconds), and 52.2 seconds (25th and 75th percentiles, 46.3 and 58.6) (P < 0.0001; normal 25th and 75th percentiles, 27 and 40 seconds). RB007 reversed the activated partial thromboplastin time to baseline levels within a median of 1 minute (25th and 75th percentiles, 1 and 2 minutes) with no rebound increase through 7 days. No major bleeding or other serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusions

This is the first experience of an RNA aptamer drug-antidote pair achieving inhibition and active restoration of factor IXa activity in combination with platelet-directed therapy in stable coronary artery disease. The preliminary clinical safety and predictable pharmacodynamic effects form the basis for ongoing studies in patients undergoing elective revascularization procedures.
