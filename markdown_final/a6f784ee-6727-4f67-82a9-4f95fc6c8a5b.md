## Question

what is a good controller medication for asthma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a good controller medication for asthma is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational role of inhaled corticosteroids as first-line controllers. Then, I should verify how severity and current control status guide step-based therapy and the modern role of ICS-formoterol Maintenance and Reliever Therapy. Next, I will examine add-on options for uncontrolled disease, account for pediatric considerations, and confirm implementation details such as inhaler technique, adherence, and follow-up. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic recommendation that aligns with major guidelines and evidence, while double-checking where preferences diverge among GINA, NHLBI, and BTS/NICE/SIGN guidance.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disease, and controllers should contain inhaled corticosteroid to reduce airway inflammation, improve control, and lower exacerbation risk, even in milder disease; multiple high-credibility sources converge here, and the NHLBI 2020 update reiterates that ICS are the preferred long-term controller class while GINA emphasizes that controllers contain ICS to reduce both symptoms and risk [^111XN5KB].

> I need to check how severity and control are operationalized, because treatment intensity follows from that; GINA reminds us that severity is assessed retrospectively from the treatment required to achieve control and that the historical distinction between intermittent and mild persistent disease is arbitrary, with baseline symptom frequency not reliably predicting the need for daily ICS or an ICS-containing reliever, so I should not over-weight daytime symptom counts when choosing strategy [^111XN5KB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about mild disease management; the NHLBI 2020 Step 2 recommendation for those aged 12 years and older offers two acceptable options, either daily low-dose ICS with SABA as needed or concomitant intermittent ICS used with SABA at times of worsening symptoms, whereas GINA has increasingly favored ICS-containing reliever strategies to reduce severe exacerbation risk, so I should align the choice to patient preference, adherence, and local labeling while recognizing both are guideline-concordant options [^112h6GxW] [^112WXZFZ].

> Next, I should review the preferred approach for moderate-to-severe persistent asthma; wait, I almost defaulted to simply escalating ICS dose, but NHLBI 2020 makes a strong recommendation for single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used as both maintenance and reliever therapy in patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe disease because it outperforms higher-dose ICS alone and same-dose ICS-LABA with SABA reliever in preventing exacerbations, with the rapid-onset formoterol enabling reliever use and the integrated ICS exposure adapting during symptom worsening, a strategy also reflected in contemporary GINA and UK BTS/NICE/SIGN pathways and supported by review data for budesonide-formoterol MART reducing exacerbations with similar or lower maintenance ICS burden [^111NPNLz] [^112WXZFZ] [^111tJcSz] [^111a3w1W].

> I will now examine add-on therapy when asthma remains uncontrolled despite good adherence and technique on at least moderate-dose ICS-LABA; let me verify the role of LAMA, because overusing oral corticosteroids should be avoided, and both NHLBI 2020 and a high-credibility JACI review support adding LAMA to ICS-LABA for additional bronchodilation and modest exacerbation risk reduction in selected patients aged 12 years and older, with single-inhaler triple therapy an option where available and generally well tolerated [^1177Woec] [^113Wcp1A].

> Let me consider age-specific nuances; for adults and adolescents, the MART approach is on-label with selected preparations and aligns with guideline preferences, while in children 5 to 11 years, initial therapy is typically twice-daily pediatric low-dose ICS with SABA as needed, and MART in this age group may be off-label and requires careful assessment of the child's ability to manage the regimen, so I need to ensure labeling, device skills, and supervision are in place; for children under 5 years, evidence is limited and simplified ICS-based regimens remain the cornerstone [^116cTeuf] [^112WXZFZ].

> Before stepping up any therapy, I should double-check foundational implementation issues; GINA and BTS/SIGN emphasize verifying inhaler technique, assessing adherence in a nonjudgmental way, addressing comorbidities and triggers, documenting the treatment step, and providing a written action plan, and I should also remember to avoid SABA-only treatment in maintenance strategies given risk signals and to arrange follow-up within appropriate intervals to review control and risk factors [^112WXZFZ] [^1172m4Pe] [^111EpqPw].

> Now, I need to ensure proper monitoring and safe step-down once control is sustained; GINA recommends considering step down after at least 3 months of good control with stable lung function, and when stepping down I should reduce ICS dose by about 25 to 50 percent where possible, not abruptly stop ICS, recognize that stopping LABA can worsen control, and provide a clear action plan and close follow-up; pragmatic data suggest step-down strategies must be individualized and monitored because noninferiority to maintenance therapy is not guaranteed, and a Cochrane analysis reinforces caution when withdrawing LABA from stable ICS-LABA regimens [^113V7ZRi] [^116XzVR2] [^116RJgLJ] [^115x6jtX] [^115yhppk].

> But wait, what if there is an exacerbation or acute worsening during this process; I should confirm that for severe exacerbations, a short course of oral corticosteroids is recommended with practical dosing guidance and counseling about adverse effects, and for mild asthma in adults and adolescents, using ICS-formoterol as reliever can reduce the risk of severe exacerbations, which dovetails with the broader shift away from SABA-only rescue and toward anti-inflammatory reliever strategies [^111vyWEz] [^113AGVuf] [^111EpqPw].

> Let me synthesize the final recommendation and sanity-check it against the guidelines; for most patients aged 12 years and older with persistent asthma, the best overall controller strategy is low-dose ICS-formoterol used as single-inhaler maintenance and reliever therapy because it reduces severe exacerbations and simplifies care, with escalation to moderate dose if needed and, if still uncontrolled despite verified adherence and technique, consideration of adding LAMA or referring for specialist evaluation and phenotype-directed options, while for those unable to use formoterol in a MART regimen, an alternative is fixed-dose ICS-LABA maintenance with a SABA reliever recognizing that adding LABA to ICS improves control over ICS alone, and for mild disease, daily low-dose ICS plus SABA or intermittent ICS with SABA at worsening are acceptable per NHLBI though many systems now favor ICS-containing reliever approaches, with all choices anchored in education, action plans, and regular follow-up to step down when stable [^111NPNLz] [^111tJcSz] [^112FUEGC] [^112h6GxW] [^112WXZFZ].

---

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the **preferred first-line therapy** for persistent asthma; they reduce airway inflammation, improve symptoms, and lower exacerbation risk [^111XN5KB]. If control remains inadequate with ICS alone, add a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) [^112FUEGC] to create an **ICS-LABA combination**, which further improves control [^112FUEGC] and reduces exacerbations [^112WXZFZ]. In moderate-to-severe asthma, **single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART)** [^111NPNLz] with ICS-formoterol [^111tJcSz] is recommended to reduce exacerbations and simplify treatment. Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) or long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) [^113W2wX5] are alternatives or add-ons [^112WXZFZ] when ICS or ICS-LABA therapy is insufficient or not tolerated [^1177Woec]. Controller therapy should be **individualized** [^112WXZFZ] based on severity, control, and patient factors, with regular monitoring and stepwise adjustment [^114nrzF9].

Regarding medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, more specifically with respect to ICSs and LABAs, NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend offering ICS-formoterol in a single inhaler used as both daily controller and reliever therapy in patients aged 12 years and older with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma rather than:

- **Higher-dose ICS as daily controller therapy** and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy
- **Same-dose ICS-LABA as daily controller therapy** and short-acting β-agonist for quick-relief therapy.

### Optimizing asthma management: Role of long-acting muscarinic antagonists [^113W2wX5]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with asthma who are suboptimally responsive to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) are frequently exposed to oral corticosteroids and high-dose ICS, which can lead to significant side effects. Long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) have demonstrated efficacy and safety in a subset of these patients. This review summarizes the results of key studies using LAMAs in patients with asthma aged 12 years or older.

LAMA as an add-on treatment improved lung function and asthma control in patients with uncontrolled asthma across studies. The efficacy of LAMAs as an add-on to ICS was superior to that of placebo and ICS dose escalation and comparable with that of LABAs. LAMA plus ICS plus LABA provided modest improvements in bronchodilation and increased the time to first severe exacerbation versus ICS plus LABA. Single-inhaler triple therapy was associated with decreased health care resource utilization and improved cost-effectiveness versus multiple inhalers. LAMAs were generally well tolerated; asthma exacerbations, bronchitis, and nasopharyngitis were common adverse events with LAMA in combination with ICS alone or ICS plus LABA.

Thus, the overall evidence presented in this review supports the use of add-on LAMA treatment as a reasonable option in patients with asthma uncontrolled with ICS plus LABA or ICS alone.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^112WXZFZ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, specifically with respect to initial assessment, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend assessing symptom control, future risk of adverse outcomes, and treatment issues in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients presenting with asthma. The following actions are advised:

- **Assess symptom control**: Consider the last 4 weeks or longer.

- **Identify other risk factors**: Look for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, or side effects.

- **Measure lung function**: This should be done at diagnosis/initiation of treatment, 3–6 months after starting ICS-containing treatment, and periodically (at least once every 1–2 years), with more frequent assessment in at-risk patients and those with severe asthma.

- **Document treatment step**: Ensure the patient's treatment step is properly recorded.

- **Inhaler technique and adherence**: Watch for correct inhaler technique, assess adherence, and monitor for side effects.

- **Asthma action plan**: Verify that the patient has a written asthma action plan.

- **Assess patient's attitudes and goals**: Inquire about the patient's attitudes and goals for their asthma management and medications.

- **Evaluate multimorbidity**: Consider contributions to symptoms and poor quality of life, as well as sometimes poor asthma control, such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety.

### Medical therapy for asthma: Updates from the NAEPP guidelines [^111QJSJM]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proper care of patients with asthma involves the triad of systematic chronic care plans, self-management support, and appropriate medical therapy. Controller medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta2 agonists, and leukotriene receptor antagonists, are the foundation of care for persistent asthma and should be taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred controller medication. Studies have demonstrated that when inhaled corticosteroids are used consistently, they improve asthma control more effectively than any other single long-term control medication.

Combining long-acting beta2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids is effective and safe when inhaled corticosteroids alone are insufficient, and such combinations are an alternative to increasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids. For patients with mild persistent asthma, leukotriene receptor antagonists are an alternative, second-line treatment option. They are easy to use, have high rates of compliance, and can provide good symptom control in many patients. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can also be used as an adjunctive therapy with inhaled corticosteroids, but for persons 12 years and older the addition of long-acting beta2 agonists is preferred.

Inhaled short-acting beta2 agonists are the most effective therapy for rapid reversal of airflow obstruction and prompt relief of asthmatic symptoms. Increasing the use of short-acting beta2 agonists or using them more than two days per week or more than two nights per month generally indicates inadequate control of asthma.

### Inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β2-agonist pharmacological profiles: effective asthma therapy in practice [^111hgwgB]. Respiratory Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Fixed-dose combinations of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting β2-agonists (LABAs) have been used to manage asthma for several years. They are the preferred therapy option for patients who do not achieve optimal control of their asthma with low-dose ICS monotherapy.

In Europe, four ICS/LABA products are commercially available for asthma maintenance therapy: fluticasone propionate/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate, budesonide/formoterol fumarate, and beclometasone dipropionate/formoterol fumarate. Other combinations are likely to be developed over the next few years, such as mometasone/formoterol fumarate, fluticasone furoate/vilanterol, and mometasone/indacaterol.

Data from randomized controlled clinical trials do not demonstrate a clear overall efficacy difference among ICS/LABA combinations approved for asthma therapy. Conversely, pharmacological data indicate that there may be certain advantages to using one ICS or LABA over another due to the specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles associated with particular treatments.

This review article summarizes the pharmacological characteristics of the various ICSs and LABAs available for the treatment of asthma, including the potential for ICS and LABA synergy. It also provides insight into the rationale for the development of the latest ICS/LABA combination approved for asthma maintenance therapy.

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111uKEpJ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Medications and strategies for symptom control and risk reduction**: Asthma medications are categorized as controllers, relievers, and add-on therapies.

	- Controllers contain ICS, which reduce airway inflammation, control symptoms, and reduce the risks of exacerbations, even in mild asthma, and of asthma death. Treatment with ICS may reduce exacerbation-related declines in lung function. "Maintenance" therapies are controllers that are prescribed for daily use.

	- Relievers (low-dose ICS–formoterol or SABA) contain rapid-onset bronchodilators. They are used "as needed" for quick relief of symptoms, including during exacerbations. Using ICS–formoterol as a reliever (often called an "anti-inflammatory reliever" or "AIR") also reduces the risk of severe exacerbations, compared with a SABA reliever, both with or without maintenance controller treatment. SABA or ICS–formoterol is also recommended before exercise if needed to prevent exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

	- Add-on therapies are mainly for patients with difficult-to-treat or severe asthma (see below).

When choosing medications, consider local guidelines, regulatory approvals, and payer criteria.

### Improvement in symptoms and pulmonary function of asthmatic patients due to their treatment according to the global strategy for asthma management (GINA) [^113FUpUn]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Several previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of applying various guidelines in the management of asthma. For example, it has been shown that the regular measurement of PEF can lead to a reduction of drug use in asthmatic patients, especially of bronchodilators and corticosteroids, reduction of asthma symptoms and increase in PFT values, and better prediction of asthma attack. It has also been suggested that regular PEF measurement is useful for determining the drug regimen in asthmatic patients. Taken together, the above studies emphasize the benefit of employing standard guidelines in the management of asthma.

However, in undeveloped and developing countries, guidelines are poorly applied. Our previous studies showed that most asthmatic patients in Iran were not well treated and were not able to administer their inhaler drugs correctly. Dashash and Mukhtar also showed that in Saudi Arabia, prescribing for asthmatic children did not conform to national guidelines for the treatment of asthma. They recommend increasing the use of asthma management guidelines by practitioners. In another study, Hijazi et al. showed that patient management is deficient in Kuwait, documentation was inadequate, and adherence to the international guidelines was partial. Other studies also suggest that major efforts should be directed to applying guidelines in the management of asthma.

Few studies have previously tested the effect of applying guidelines in the management of asthma in countries of our region. Alamoudi examined the efficacy of a management protocol in reducing emergency visits and…

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111XN5KB]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Asthma severity is assessed retrospectively, after at least 2–3 months of treatment, from the level of treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) does not distinguish between "intermittent" and "mild persistent" asthma, as this historical distinction was arbitrary, with no evidence of a difference in the treatment response. Severe asthma remains uncontrolled despite optimized treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), or it requires such treatment to prevent it from becoming uncontrolled. It is essential to distinguish between severe asthma and difficult-to-treat asthma, which may be uncontrolled due to factors such as incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, comorbidities like obesity, and environmental exposures.

The definition of asthma severity works well at the severe end of the spectrum but is less useful for describing mild asthma. Patients with infrequent or no interval symptoms can still experience severe exacerbations. This risk is reduced equally by either daily ICS treatment or by using ICS-formoterol only for symptom relief, with baseline symptom frequency not predicting the necessity for daily ICS use.

### Asthma maintenance and reliever therapy: Should this be the standard of care [^111a3w1W]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The goal of asthma management is to achieve optimal asthma control, defined by the absence of daytime symptoms, nighttime waking, reliever use, functional limitation, and lung function stability, while also reducing future risks of asthma exacerbations, deterioration in lung function, and the medication's adverse effects. The most widely used maintenance therapy is inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). This review considered the evidence in which the combination of the ICS budesonide and the rapid-onset long-acting β-agonist (LABA) formoterol can be used as a standard of care for maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

- **Data sources**: The archival literature of peer-reviewed studies on the efficacy and safety of budesonide-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy in moderate to severe asthma.

- **Results**: The ICS-LABA combination containing budesonide-formoterol reduces the future risk of severe asthma exacerbations and provides similar levels of day-to-day asthma control when compared with using high-dose ICS alone or combination ICS-LABA therapy and short-acting β 2 -agonist as a reliever.

- **Conclusion**: Budesonide-formoterol as a single combination maintenance and reliever inhaler is effective in reducing asthma exacerbation risk, requires a lower maintenance dose of ICS, and results in a simplified approach to asthma management.

### BTS/NICE/SIGN joint guideline on asthma: Diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024) - summary of recommendations [^113Waoay]. Thorax (2025). Low credibility.

Initial management of newly diagnosed asthma in people aged 12 and over:

- **Offer a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)/formoterol combination inhaler**: This should be taken as needed for symptom relief by individuals aged 12 and over with newly diagnosed asthma [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024]. In November 2024, only certain budesonide/formoterol inhalers were licensed for as-needed AIR therapy in mild asthma. Using any other ICS/formoterol inhalers would therefore be off-label. The evidence supporting the use of budesonide/formoterol is based on the use of a dry powder inhaler.

- **Treatment adjustments for highly symptomatic individuals**: If the person needing asthma treatment is highly symptomatic (for example, experiencing regular nocturnal waking) or presents with a severe exacerbation, start treatment with low-dose MART in addition to treating the acute symptoms as indicated. This may include a course of oral corticosteroids. Consider stepping down to as-needed AIR therapy using a low-dose ICS/formoterol inhaler at a later date if their asthma is controlled [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024].

For a short explanation of why the committee made these recommendations and how they might affect practice, consult the full guideline. Comprehensive details of the evidence and the committee's discussion are available in the published documentation.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111NVwZX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Considering the overall balance between benefits and harms, the Expert Panel judged the SCIT recommendation as conditional because individuals may consider SCIT as adjunct therapy if they have the following characteristics:

- **Place a high value on small improvements**: These individuals prioritize small improvements in quality of life and symptom control.

- **Place a high value on reducing medication use**: They value reductions in long-term and/or quick-relief medication use.

- **Place a lower value on potential systemic reactions**: There is an acceptance of the potential for systemic reactions of varying severity.

The available studies tended to have small samples, and study reports did not characterize the races of participants or the social determinants of health that they experienced. Studies of SCIT used different protocols and lacked standardized formulations or uniform durations of follow-up. The efficacy of SCIT, which has an acceptable burden of harms, is based on its impact on asthma quality of life and asthma-related symptoms, though the certainty of evidence remains low. The decision to use SCIT should be a shared one between the individual and the healthcare provider, considering the individual's asthma severity and willingness to accept potential harms related to SCIT. Clinicians should administer SCIT in settings capable of monitoring and treating reactions.

The Expert Panel's enthusiasm for recommending SCIT is tempered by the slight risk of harms and variability in access due to costs and geographical location. This variability can hinder equitable health access.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^112h6GxW]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

For individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (i.e. one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

- **Implementation guidance**: Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.

Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).

Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two-step therapy.

### BTS/NICE/SIGN joint guideline on asthma: diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024) - summary of recommendations [^111tJcSz]. Thorax (2025). High credibility.

These recommendations are for people aged 12 and over who are on the treatment pathway recommended by previous NICE and BTS/SIGN guidelines.

- **Transferring people aged 12 and over from other treatment pathways**: Change treatment for people with confirmed asthma who are currently using a short-acting beta 2 agonist (SABA) only to a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination inhaler used as needed (as-needed AIR therapy).

- **Consider changing treatment to low-dose MART**: For people with asthma that is not controlled on:
	- Regular low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed.
	- Regular low-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler plus SABA as needed.
	- Regular low-dose ICS and supplementary therapy (LTRA) plus SABA as needed.
	- Regular low-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler and supplementary therapy (LTRA) plus SABA as needed.

- **Consider changing treatment to moderate-dose MART**: For people with asthma that is not controlled on:
	- Regular moderate-dose ICS plus SABA as needed.
	- Regular moderate-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler plus SABA as needed.
	- Regular moderate-dose ICS and supplementary therapy (LTRA or LAMA, or both) plus SABA as needed.
	- Regular moderate-dose ICS/LABA combination inhaler and supplementary therapy (LTRA or LAMA, or both) plus SABA as needed.

When changing from low- or moderate-dose ICS (or ICS/LABA combination inhaler) plus supplementary therapy to MART, consider whether to stop or continue the supplementary therapy based on the degree of benefit achieved when first introduced.

### Evidence-based asthma management [^116UfNTS]. Respiratory Care (2004). Low credibility.

In 2002, the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program published evidence-based guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma, but there are some unresolved asthma-management issues that need further research. For asthmatic children, inhaled corticosteroids are more beneficial than as-needed use of beta(2) agonists, long-acting beta(2) agonists, theophylline, cromolyn sodium, nedocromil, or any combination of those. Leukotriene modifiers are an alternative but not a preferred treatment; they should be considered if the medication needs to be administered orally rather than via inhalation.

Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are effective long-term asthma-control medications, but they are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether cromolyn benefits the maintenance of childhood asthma. Cromolyn sodium and nedocromil are alternatives, but not preferred treatments for mild persistent asthma. Cromolyn may be useful as a preventive therapy prior to exertion or unavoidable exposure to allergens. Regular inhalation of corticosteroids controls asthma significantly better than as-needed beta(2) agonists.

No studies have examined the long-term impact of regular inhaled corticosteroids on lung function in children ≤ 5 years old. As monotherapy, inhaled corticosteroids are more effective than long-acting beta(2) agonists. The asthma-control benefit of inhaled corticosteroids decidedly outweighs the risks from inhaled corticosteroids. There is no high-level evidence that low-to-medium-dose inhaled corticosteroids have ocular to.

Regarding the medical management for severe asthma phenotypes, specifically concerning LAMAs, the NHLBI 2020 guidelines recommend considering adding LAMA to ICS-LABA rather than continuing the same dose of ICS-LABA in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma.

### A proposed revision of the stepwise treatment algorithm in asthma [^111sZBzt]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

To the editor:

The stepwise approach to the pharmacologic treatment of asthma is a core foundation of asthma guidelines. Through this approach, treatment intensity is increased in discrete steps to obtain symptom control and reduce exacerbation risk, and is decreased following a period of prolonged control. The stepwise approach is usually shown by an algorithm, as illustrated in the 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) strategy update. Here, we review the 2020 GINA stepwise algorithm and suggest alternative evidence-based algorithms that address potential problems with the currently recommended approach.

- **Personalized management for adults and adolescents**: To control symptoms and minimize future risk. The 2020 Global Initiative for Asthma algorithm. Reprinted by permission from reference. BDP = beclomethasone dipropionate; HDM = house dust mite; ICS = inhaled corticosteroid; LABA = long-acting β2-agonist; LTRA = leukotriene receptor antagonist; OCS = oral corticosteroids; SABA = short-acting β2-agonist; SLIT = sublingual immunotherapy.

### Considering therapeutic options in the real world [^116FVHes]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2003). Low credibility.

When choosing a drug regimen, physicians can rely on two models: their own clinical experience and results from clinical trials. Both options have problems. Overall, patients with persistent asthma symptoms often have improved outcomes with the use of long-term controller medications on a daily basis to prevent exacerbations of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) are generally recognized as the most effective treatment for the underlying inflammatory characteristics of asthma.

However, despite adequate dosing, some patients with persistent asthma remain symptomatic while taking an ICS. It may be beneficial to administer combination therapy with an ICS and a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) in this subset of asthma patients. Another anti-inflammatory choice for persistent asthma is the leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA), either as monotherapy or in combination with an ICS.

Regardless of the treatment regimen prescribed, the choice of medication depends on many factors, including patient preference, physician comfort with the regimen, and cost.

### Optimal asthma control: Time for a new target [^113Xumkj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

The stepwise approach to pharmacological treatment in adult asthma mandates that asthma treatment is progressively stepped up to achieve symptom control and reduce the risk of exacerbations, and stepped down following a period of prolonged control. This review proposes that in adults without good asthma control, well-controlled asthma can only be achieved in approximately 70% of patients across the strata of severity. This is possible only if there is a progressive increase in inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2 agonist therapy to a maintenance inhaled corticosteroid dose that causes the same magnitude of systemic side effects as oral prednisone at a 5-mg daily dose. Another consideration is that, in a person with asthma, there are numerous overlapping disorders that can present with symptoms indistinguishable from asthma. Comorbidities contribute to poor control, and lifestyle/environmental factors require treatment in their own right, which, if specifically managed, might lead to better outcomes.

The disparity between patients' perceptions and guideline assessments of control may be due to partially controlled asthma being associated with near-maximal levels of quality of life, with minimal impairment. Finally, it is widely assumed that asthma symptom control equates to the elimination of risk of asthma attacks, an assumption that may not apply to many patients, particularly those with more severe asthma. We propose that further research be undertaken to determine the optimal levels of asthma control and the potential value of different treatment targets, such as control of type-2 inflammation.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^114N84ew]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The methodology framework used for this update, GRADE, is the internationally recommended approach for developing recommendations that clinicians can trust. This framework endorses a systematic and transparent approach to decision-making, uses established criteria to rate the certainty of evidence, and determines the strength of the recommendations. Recommendations developed using GRADE combine certainty of evidence with patient values and preferences, weighing the benefits and harms of making treatment recommendations. Importantly, the recommendations are based on the key questions that clinicians, both generalists and specialists, wanted answered.

Users of these recommendations may be disappointed by the absence of many strong recommendations — that is, recommendations that clinicians should adhere to for almost all individuals with asthma as the standard of care. This is not, however, surprising given the variations in asthma phenotypes and endotypes and in the outcomes used in the studies reviewed to develop the recommendations. When the GRADE framework is used, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are initially rated as offering a high certainty of evidence, but issues with study designs (e.g. lack of blinding or placebo control), heterogeneity of study results, or small numbers of events may result in downgrading the certainty of evidence. For most of the asthma recommendations, the overall certainty of the evidence was downgraded because of inconsistencies in study results, risk of bias, or absence of critical standardized outcome measures.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1167KLGk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

In GRADE, each recommendation has a direction, meaning that the recommendation is either for, or against the use of an intervention. Each recommendation is also either strong or conditional, as explained in Table IE. Strong recommendations are those for which, in the judgment of the Expert Panel after it has reviewed all of the evidence and individual judgments, all or almost all people would choose the recommended course of action. Conditional recommendations are those for which, after reviewing all of the evidence and individual judgments, the Expert Panel believes that many informed people are likely to make different decisions about whether to take the recommended course of action. A conditional recommendation implies that engaging in a shared decision-making process is essential for individuals with asthma and their health care providers.

The Expert Panel drafted, discussed, and revised the recommendations multiple times before all eligible members (those who did not have a conflict of interest for the topic) voted on each recommendation. The Expert Panel achieved consensus when more than 90% of the Expert Panel members voted in favor of a recommendation. If less than 90% of members voted in favor of a recommendation, the relevant topic team continued to revise the recommendation until it achieved consensus approval according to these criteria.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^1176KhHc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

Outcomes did not differ in the groups treated with the two alternate regimens in the three studies, in individuals aged 12 years and older. However, because none of these studies was powered as an equivalence study, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation. Although the studies had high certainty of evidence for asthma control and quality of life, they had low certainty of evidence for exacerbations and, taken together, resulted in overall low certainty for the recommendation statement. The Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison for children aged 4 to 11 years because the only small included study in this population had low certainty of evidence, and one additional study had a study design that precluded evaluation for this key question.

- **Recommendation 11**: In individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to be adherent to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow.

- **Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence**

- **Implementation guidance**: This recommendation addresses temporary increases in the dose of an ICS that is otherwise taken as controller therapy in response to worsening asthma. For this recommendation, a short-term increase in ICS dose refers to a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose. For individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to their daily ICS regimen, the same consideration applies.

### Is asthma control more than just an absence of symptoms? An expert consensus statement [^111mbunn]. Respiratory Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Definitions and measures of asthma control used in clinical trials and in clinical practice vary considerably. There is also misalignment between patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in terms of understanding and managing asthma control. This study aimed to progress towards a consensus definition of asthma control and evaluate disparities between HCP and patient perspectives.

- **Basic procedures**: A two-stage Delphi questionnaire involving asthma specialists sought to identify areas of consensus on aspects of asthma control in clinical practice. Results were compared with those of a structured literature review to assess if existing guidance and measures of asthma control used in studies correlated with practice. Eighty-two panelists took part in the Delphi questionnaire. The structured literature review included 185 manuscripts and 31 abstracts.

- **Main findings**: Panelists agreed that there was no standard definition of asthma control, confirmed by a total of 19 different composite consensus/guideline definitions and/or validated measures of control being identified across the Delphi study and literature review. Panelists agreed on the positive associations of well-controlled asthma with patient outcomes, but not on the components or thresholds of a working definition of control.

- **Principal conclusions**: A universally accepted definition and measure of asthma control that is utilized and understood by patients, HCPs, and researchers is required.

### GINA guidelines on asthma and beyond [^117Kb3cg]. Allergy (2007). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines are systematically developed statements designed to help practitioners and patients make decisions regarding the appropriate health care for specific circumstances. These guidelines are based on the scientific evidence of therapeutic interventions. The first asthma guidelines were published in the mid-1980s when asthma became a recognized public health problem in many countries. The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) was launched in 1995 as a collaborative effort between the NHLBI and the World Health Organization (WHO). The first edition was opinion-based, but updates were evidence-based. A new update of the GINA guidelines was recently made available, focusing on the control of the disease. Asthma guidelines are prepared to stimulate the implementation of practical guidelines to reduce the global burden of asthma. Although asthma guidelines may not be perfect, they appear to be the best vehicle available to assist primary care physicians and patients to receive the best possible care for asthma.

### BTS/NICE/SIGN joint guideline on asthma: Diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024) - summary of recommendations [^116cTeuf]. Thorax (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacological management in children aged 5 to 11 years:

- **Initial management in children aged 5 to 11 years**: Offer a twice-daily paediatric low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), with a short-acting beta 2 agonist (SABA) as needed, as initial treatment for children aged 5 to 11 years with newly diagnosed asthma.

- **Medicine combination and sequencing in children aged 5 to 11 years**:

	- **MART pathway**: Consider paediatric low-dose MART for children with asthma that is not controlled on paediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed, as long as they are assessed to have the ability to manage a MART regimen. In November 2024, no asthma inhalers were licensed for MART in children under 12, so this use would be off-label. The evidence supporting the use of MART in children aged 5 to 11 is based on the use of a dry powder inhaler.

	- **Conventional pathway**: Consider adding a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) to twice daily paediatric low-dose ICS plus SABA as needed when a child is assessed as unable to manage the MART regimen. Give the LTRA for a trial period of 8 to 12 weeks (unless there are side effects), then stop it if it is ineffective.

### Guidelines for asthma management: A review and comparison of 5 current guidelines [^115vixQ2]. Respiratory Care (2008). Low credibility.

The first clinical practice guidelines for the assessment and management of asthma were published over 20 years ago in New Zealand and Australia. During the same period, British and Scottish groups were collaborating on a United Kingdom version of asthma guidelines. Shortly after the introduction of the New Zealand and Canadian guidelines, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the United States National Institutes of Health participated in two additional asthma guideline endeavors, which were published in the early 1990s.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute formed the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program to develop asthma guidelines for the United States, and participated with an international task force to develop guidelines for the treatment of asthma in all countries, resulting in the formation of the Global Initiative for Asthma in the mid-1990s. The asthma guidelines issued by professional societies and other groups prior to the late 1990s were primarily based on consensus or expert opinion in each guideline committee, though those opinions were based on the available studies.

The early guidelines played a vital role in bridging the gap between various treatment options and recent discoveries in basic science, serving as the vehicle to implementation into daily clinical practice. Asthma guidelines have been published and revised in dozens of countries around the world and have become reputable directives or "road maps" in asthma diagnosis, treatment, and management for patients of all ages. The guidelines have similar formats.

### The effects of different follow-up management on asthma control: A prospective cohort study [^112ZkXGP]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory airway disorder characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms, impaired pulmonary function, and acute exacerbations requiring emergency medical intervention. Epidemiological data indicate approximately 358 million asthma cases worldwide, of which only 28.5% have achieved optimal disease control. Substantial evidence demonstrates that uncontrolled asthma correlates significantly with inadequate patient education, deficient self-management competencies, and improper inhalation techniques, underscoring the critical need for enhanced long-term follow-up strategies.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) emphasizes the pivotal role of regular follow-up in disease management. While conventional clinic-based follow-ups provide comprehensive clinical evaluations, they are hampered by a 35% attrition rate. Telephone follow-ups, despite improving accessibility, yield only 62.3% patient satisfaction rates. Emerging mobile health technologies present novel solutions, with clinical trials demonstrating that app-based interventions can enhance asthma control rates by 40%.

WeChat is the main social media platform for Chinese people, accounting for 86% of the users. It shows a special prospect in chronic disease management and has improved the drug compliance of chronic disease patients by 2.1 times. Nevertheless, robust comparative evidence evaluating different asthma follow-up modalities remains scarce.

This 12-month prospective cohort study systematically compared three follow-up methods: telephone, WeChat, and respiratory outpatient clinic.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111ocp5s]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for asthma, particularly in relation to avoiding exacerbating medications, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend deciding on prescribing oral or ophthalmic β-blockers on a case-by-case basis. It is advised to initiate treatment under close supervision by a specialist.

### Pragmatic randomized controlled trial for stepping down asthma controller treatment in patients controlled with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting β-agonist: Step-down of intervention and grade in moderate asthma study [^115x6jtX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). High credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend stepping down controller treatment when the condition is well-controlled for a certain time. However, the optimal step-down strategy for well-controlled patients receiving a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) remains unclear.

- **Objective**: This study was a randomized, open-label, three-arm, parallel pragmatic trial comparing two kinds of step-down approaches for maintaining treatment.

- **Methods**: Adults with asthma, aged 18 years or older and who had been stable with low-dose ICS/LABA for at least 3 months, were enrolled. Subjects (n = 225) were randomly allocated into one of three groups: maintaining low-dose ICS/LABA (G1), discontinuing LABA (G2), and reducing ICS/LABA to once daily (G3). They were observed for 6 months. The primary endpoint was a change in Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores between randomization and the final 6-month follow-up.

- **Results**: The change in ACT was analyzed in the per-protocol population. Noninferiority was not demonstrated in either step-down group compared with the maintenance group (95% confidence interval of the difference, G2 vs G1 = -1.40 to 0.55; G3 vs G1 = -1.19 to 0.77). Although over 90% of patients were fine, higher rates of treatment failure were observed in step-down groups (G1: 0%, G2: 9.46%, and G3: 9.09%; p = 0.027). There were no significant differences between step-down approaches in terms of ACT change or treatment failure.

- **Conclusions**: Both step-down methods were not noninferior to maintenance of treatment. Step-down therapy can be attempted under appropriate clinical supervision.

### BTS/NICE/SIGN joint guideline on asthma: Diagnosis, monitoring and chronic asthma management (November 2024) - Summary of recommendations [^113Wcp1A]. Thorax (2025). High credibility.

For individuals aged 12 and over with asthma, the combination and sequencing of medication is critical for effective management.

- **Medicine combination and sequencing**: Offer a low dose of ICS/formoterol combination inhaler, used only as needed, to individuals whose asthma is not controlled. For those whose asthma remains uncontrolled on this regimen, offer a moderate-dose maintenance and reliever therapy (MART).

	- **FeNO levels and blood tests**: For patients with asthma not controlled on moderate-dose MART, despite good adherence, check the fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) level and eosinophil count, if available. If elevated, refer to a specialist. If levels are not raised, a trial use of either leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) in addition to moderate-dose MART is suggested. Conduct the trial over 8 to 12 weeks.

		- **Post-trial evaluation**: At the end of the trial, if asthma control has improved, continue the current treatment. If asthma control is still inadequate, start a trial of the other medicine (LTRA or LAMA). Discontinue the LTRA or LAMA and start the complementary medicine if no improvement is noted.

- **Referral to specialists**: Refer patients to asthma care specialists if asthma is not controlled despite moderate-dose MART and trials of LTRA and LAMA [BTS/NICE/SIGN 2024].

For a concise explanation of the rationale and potential practice implications of these recommendations, further details are available in the full guidelines document.

### The asthma controller step-down yardstick [^1169Nf5g]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to disease management in which the assessment of impairment and risk is linked to step-based therapy. Using this model, controller treatment is adjusted upward or downward according to a patient's level of asthma control over time. Strategies for stepping up controller therapy are well described, and the adult and pediatric asthma yardsticks provide operational recommendations based on patient profiles. Strategies for stepping down controller treatment are less clear, although stepping down to the minimum effective therapy is important and should be considered when a patient's asthma has been well controlled for an adequate period as defined by risk and impairment. This yardstick presents recommendations for when and how to step down asthma controller therapy according to guideline-defined control levels. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat patients with asthma with a practical and clinically relevant framework for implementing a step-down in controller therapy.

### Asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for poorly controlled asthma [^113CdJX3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management that involves assessment of impairment and risk, followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. The fact that many patients still experience severe symptoms that negatively affect quality of life suggests that asthma control remains an objective to be achieved. Tools are available to help patients and families manage the day-to-day and short-term variability in asthma symptoms; however, when and how to implement a sustained step-up in therapy is less clear.

The Asthma Yardstick is a comprehensive update on how to conduct a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for the patient with not well-controlled or poorly controlled asthma. Patient profiles and step-up strategies are based on guidelines, newer data, and the authors' combined clinical experience, and are intended to provide a practical and clinically meaningful guide toward the goal of well-controlled asthma for every patient. The development of this tool comes in response to the continued need to proactively address the sustained loss of asthma control at all levels of severity.

### Differential effects of maintenance long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid on asthma control and asthma exacerbations [^112FUEGC]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2007). High credibility.

Combination therapy with long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) has become established as effective maintenance treatment for asthma.

- **Objective**: To compare and contrast the efficacy and safety of LABAs/ICSs against different maintenance ICS strategies in adults with asthma.

- **Methods**: Cochrane systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (to April 2004) were identified that compared the addition of LABA to ICS against three inhaled corticosteroid strategies: (1) a similar dose (n = 4312 subjects), (2) a higher dose (n = 4951), and (3) a similar dose in steroid-naive subjects (n = 968). The outcomes evaluated were asthma exacerbations, asthma control, and adverse effects. Pediatric studies were excluded.

- **Results**: The addition of LABA to ICSs significantly reduced the risk of exacerbations compared with a similar ICS dose, with a number needed to treat of 18. The effects of LABA/ICSs on exacerbations compared with the other maintenance inhaled corticosteroid strategies were not statistically significant. LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids led to significant improvements in asthma control compared with all three maintenance ICS strategies. There was an increased risk of tremor with LABA/ICSs that reached significance for initial therapy, with a number needed to harm of 21, and compared with higher ICS doses, with a number needed to harm of 74.

- **Conclusion**: Maintenance asthma therapy with LABA/ICSs has differential effects on asthma control and asthma exacerbations.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for asthma, with specific emphasis on clinical follow-up, the BTS/SIGN 2019 guidelines recommend asking specific questions about medication use and assessing prescribing and any other data available to evaluate adherence. It is advised to explore attitudes towards medication as well as practical barriers to adherence in a nonjudgmental manner.

### Improving asthma management: The case for mandatory inclusion of dose counters on all rescue bronchodilators [^1156rZAa]. The Journal of Asthma (2013). Low credibility.

Asthma remains a serious global health challenge. Poor control of asthma symptoms is due in part to the incorrect use of oral inhaler devices that deliver asthma medications, such as poor inhalation techniques or the use of a metered dose inhaler (MDI) after the recommended number of doses is expelled.

- **Objective**: To review published research on the potential for patients to overestimate or underestimate the amount of asthma rescue medication in MDIs without integrated dose-counting mechanisms.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed and EMBASE using the search terms "dose counter and asthma" and "dose counter and metered dose inhaler" for English-language publications up to July 2012, with a manual search of references from relevant articles.

- **Results**: Up to 40% of patients believe they are taking their asthma medication when they are actually activating an empty or nearly empty MDI. The device design makes it impossible for an MDI to cease delivering drug doses at an exact point, and the number of actuations in an MDI may be twice the nominal number of recommended medication doses. Once the recommended number of medication doses is expelled, remaining actuations deliver decreasing concentrations of active medication and increasing concentrations of propellants and excipients. This phenomenon, called "tail-off", is particularly problematic when medications are formulated as suspensions, as are rescue medications to control acute bronchospasm. Reliable inhalation of rescue medication could reduce asthma-related morbidity.

By helping to ensure that patients receive accurate measurements of their medication doses, dose counters could play a vital role in improving asthma management outcomes.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EpqPw]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of asthma, particularly in the context of exacerbation within primary care settings (monitoring and discharge), the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend several key strategies:

- **Inclusion of regular maintenance ICS-containing treatment**: Patients should receive regular inhaled corticosteroids as part of their maintenance therapy.

- **As-needed reliever medication**: Offer a choice between low-dose ICS-formoterol, ICS-short-acting β-agonist, or a short-acting β-agonist. Additionally, prescribe a short course of oral corticosteroids to be included in discharge medications.

- **Avoidance of short-acting β-agonist-only treatment**: Avoid prescribing treatment that relies solely on short-acting β-agonists.

- **Review of inhaler technique and adherence**: Before discharge, ensure patients have their inhaler technique and adherence reviewed.

- **Advice on reliever inhaler usage**: Patients should be advised to use their reliever inhaler only as needed, rather than on a routine schedule.

- **Follow-up appointment schedule**: Arrange a follow-up appointment within 2–7 days, considering the clinical and social context to ensure appropriate ongoing management.

### Patients' perspective of barriers and facilitators to taking long-term controller medication for asthma: A novel taxonomy [^1169CcFF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

We classified within this domain barriers and matching facilitators related to patients' beliefs, perceptions, fears, and knowledge. The belief that their asthma is not serious was reported by patients who refrained from taking their medication because they disregarded the importance of their symptoms and often did not recognize asthma as a chronic condition that needed to be controlled to prevent short-term events and long-term sequelae. Fears of addiction or dependence on their medication were raised by patients who expressed concerns of becoming dependent on medication. Similarly, some patients mentioned the belief of decreasing effectiveness of the medication over time, as they assumed that daily use of medication would lead to a need for increased dosage in the future. None of these three barriers were matched by any facilitator.

The perception that medication should be used in response to symptoms, and not on a regular basis, translated into patients' intake of medication solely when experiencing symptoms, with discontinuation when symptoms abated. In contrast, the perception that self-management should be used in anticipation of triggers was a facilitator reported by patients who understood the disease as a chronic condition, accepted the need for long-term use of medication, and knew how to increase dosage of medications in anticipation of potential triggers that could result in an asthma flare-up/exacerbation.

Another barrier was inadequate or limited knowledge about their medication, reported by patients who were unsure about whether…

### Global initiative for asthma strategy 2021: Executive summary and rationale for key changes [^111LZyUb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

- **Assessment of asthma**: Asthma control is defined as the extent to which the features of asthma are apparent or have been reduced or eliminated by controller treatment. Assess asthma control within two domains: symptom control and risk of adverse outcomes, particularly exacerbations.

- **Symptom control**: Assess symptom control from asthma-related symptom frequency, night waking, and activity limitation, and, for patients using short-acting β2-agonist (SABA) reliever, the frequency of SABA use. Other symptom control tools include the Asthma Control Test and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (preferably the five-item version).

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111Vkt1Y]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Unfortunately, there is no established dosage or duration of oral corticosteroids (OCS) determined to control asthma symptoms without causing adverse events (AEs). Experts are calling for "OCS stewardship" to reduce the risks, including adrenal insufficiency (AI), related to OCS use. To mitigate the potential for AEs, OCS use should be minimized by optimizing inhaled and biologic therapies for asthma. The availability of newer biologics has allowed for the advent of OCS-sparing therapies in asthma, although the process by which long-term corticosteroids should be tapered and/or discontinued has not been established. Consideration should be given to the risk of symptom recurrence and withdrawal-induced AI.

In 2020, a consensus statement on the use of OCS was issued by 131 practitioners of specialties who frequently use OCS, mostly pulmonologists, respiratory disease specialists, and allergists. Of the participating experts, more than 95% concurred that, ultimately, the goal in asthma should be to avoid the use of OCS. When OCS are required, the dosage and duration should be minimized as much as possible. Experts also agreed that individualized tapering to a minimally effective dosage (or complete discontinuation) should be attempted in all patients receiving OCS for maintenance therapy regardless of comorbid conditions. For AI risk, the experts agreed that AI is insufficiently assessed and that patients on long-term OCS therapy should be assessed for the risk and presence of AI. This includes patients receiving OCS dosages in excess of 2.0 g per year or more than 4 repeat courses of short-term OCS in one year.

### Why and how to step down chronic asthma drugs [^11416gE4]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic airways disease. The goal of asthma management is to control symptoms while minimizing the side effects of treatment. Following a period of stable asthma, clinicians should consider stepping down treatment. This approach is recommended by guidelines. Step-down has been studied for several types of asthma drug regimens, and certain approaches may have lower risk than others.

- **Specific step-down approaches**: Systematic reviews of multiple trials support optimizing inhaled corticosteroid dosing when stepping down oral corticosteroid, reducing inhaled corticosteroid from a higher dose, lowering inhaled corticosteroid-long acting bronchodilator (ICS-LABA) dose while adding ICS-LABA on-demand, adding leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) while lowering inhaled corticosteroid dose, and using allergen immunotherapy when reducing inhaled corticosteroid from a higher dose.

- **Increased risk of asthma exacerbation**: Systematic reviews of multiple trials support an increased risk of asthma exacerbation for patients who completely stop taking inhaled corticosteroid or long-acting bronchodilator.

- **Implementation strategies**: Strategies to implement step-down in practice include the use of risk prediction as well as tools to support shared decision-making and communication about risk between clinicians and patients.

### The disease management approach to controlling asthma [^114XYDe7]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Asthma has become an important public health issue worldwide, and certain groups, such as children, are at particular risk of the disease. Often, asthma remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Despite these worrying trends, the disease management approach to asthma control can help most asthma patients achieve a "normal" way of life. The increased prevalence and greater diagnostic awareness of asthma have placed increased demands on healthcare resources, but effective asthma control can minimize the personal, social, and economic burdens of asthma.

Early diagnosis and immediate anti-inflammatory treatment are the first steps in gaining control of symptoms. A stepwise approach is then used to classify asthma severity and treatment, with the number and frequency of medications increasing (step up) as asthma severity increases and decreasing (step down) when asthma is under control. This stepwise approach to asthma management necessitates regular review of treatment once asthma is under control. However, effective asthma management is dependent on successful patient education, adherence to prescribed medication, and good doctor-patient partnerships.

Treatment guidelines recommend the use of a written asthma management plan that should be agreed upon between the doctor and patient. These plans should cover all aspects of asthma treatment, including prevention steps for long-term control and action steps to stop attacks once a worsening in asthma has been recognized. This comprehensive approach to asthma management increases the likelihood of achieving asthma control.

### Approaches to stepping up and stepping down care in asthmatic patients [^113YRs3j]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

The variability in symptom control is a challenging feature of asthma, necessitating careful monitoring and the need to step up and step down individualized therapeutic regimens over time. This stepwise concept in asthma therapy can be considered in at least three contexts:

- **Long-term strategy**: For lack of control that persists over long periods, an increase in the overall medication or a step-up long-term strategy is indicated.

- **Short-term strategy**: A second approach, the step-up short-term strategy, is used during a temporary loss of acceptable control, such as at the onset of a viral respiratory tract illness. In these cases, a step-up in therapy is usually terminated in 3 to 10 days once asthma control has been satisfactorily achieved.

- **Intermittent strategy**: Finally, for treating symptoms related to the variability of asthma on a day-to-day basis, inhaled corticosteroids used concomitantly with a β-agonist have been evaluated, though this treatment is not currently approved in the United States. We will term this particular intervention a step-up intermittent strategy.

Here, we summarize the existing data regarding these three approaches to step-up care and step-down management. Additionally, we identify areas where more comparative studies are necessary to provide further guidance to clinicians regarding proper step-up and step-down strategies in the care of asthma.

### Is it time to leave behind the concept of asthma control and severity steps [^117Spg4M]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Low credibility.

After 25 years of GINA, we need an overarching strategy. The resounding changes in GINA 2019 should be accompanied by another major change in the general strategy of asthma management. The concept of control asthma and step strategy was established in 1997 by GINA; but still, there is a great gap between GINA objectives and outcomes. O'Byrne and colleagues proposed a continuum of care approach, where patient-adjusted therapy would comprise both a controller and reliever (usually ICS/fast-acting LABA) in a single inhaler. We use a similar approach in our asthma centre.

### Comparative effectiveness of long term drug treatment strategies to prevent asthma exacerbations: Network meta-analysis [^112NjQXk]. BMJ (2014). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: A systematic review and data extraction were conducted to identify randomized controlled trials. We assessed all Cochrane systematic reviews on chronic asthma published before August 1, 2011, selecting 16 reviews on drug interventions in adults. We evaluated all studies included in these reviews, as well as those listed as rejected by the Cochrane authors. An update search was performed on August 1, 2013, using the same search terms reported in the reviews. This search was conducted in the Cochrane Airways Group register of trials, which includes trials on asthma in Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We screened all references of included reports for eligible trials.

- **Eligibility criteria**: Eligible reports were full-text randomized controlled trials lasting at least 24 weeks, comparing different drug strategies for asthma maintenance treatment in adults, and reporting on exacerbations. No restrictions were applied regarding language or publication date. For inclusion in the analysis, each intervention needed evaluation in at least two separate trials.

- **Assessment procedure**: One investigator eliminated reports that were not full-text publications or on interventions lasting less than 24 weeks. Two investigators independently evaluated all remaining reports based on title and abstract. The full text was then assessed against the inclusion criteria. Two investigators (RL and JC) used standardized forms to independently extract data on the publication, patient characteristics, interventions, outcomes, and risk factors.

### Determinants of future long-term asthma control [^111eqLbt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Asthma control has been hypothesized to be inversely related to asthma severity, directly related to effective management, and also related to other definable factors, but empiric data to support this construct are few.

- **Objective**: We sought to identify independent prospective determinants of future long-term asthma control among asthma severity, management, demographic, and comorbidity predictors.

- **Methods**: Surveys were completed by a random sample of 2250 health maintenance organization members aged 18 to 56 years with persistent asthma. Linked computerized pharmacy data provided baseline and follow-up year medication dispensings. The outcome was follow-up year long-term asthma control, as assessed using a previously validated 4-level scale based on the number of short-acting beta-agonist canister dispensings.

- **Results**: Oral corticosteroids (odds ratio [OR], 1.9) or unscheduled visits (OR, 1.2) in the prior year, any prior asthma hospitalizations (OR, 1.4), smoking (OR, 2.2), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR, 1.9), male sex (OR, 1.5), black race (OR, 1.3), and lower educational level (OR, 1.1) were independently associated with poorer control in ordinal logistic regression analyses. Regular inhaled corticosteroids (OR, 0.7), long-acting beta-agonists (OR, 0.7), and asthma specialist care (OR, 0.6) were independently associated with better control.

- **Conclusions**: Markers of asthma severity and other patient characteristics are inversely related to future asthma control, but effective management strategies are associated with improved asthma control.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116RJgLJ]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically with respect to the adjustment of treatment and stepping down, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend the following options when stepping down treatment:

- **Step 5: High-dose ICS-LABA plus oral corticosteroids**: Add biologic therapy for cases of type 2-high severe asthma if eligible and reduce oral corticosteroids. Optimize inhaled therapy and reduce oral corticosteroid dose. Use a sputum-guided approach to reducing oral corticosteroids and switch to alternate-day dosing for low-dose oral corticosteroids.

- **Step 5: Biologic therapy plus high-dose ICS-LABA**: Discontinue other add-on medications, especially oral corticosteroids. Then consider reducing inhaled corticosteroid-long-acting β-agonist dose.

- **Step 4: Moderate-to-high-dose ICS-LABA maintenance treatment**: Continue combination ICS-LABA with a 50% reduction in ICS component by using available formulations. Recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration. Switch to maintenance and reliever therapy with ICS-formoterol with a lower maintenance dose.

- **Step 4: Medium-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever**: Reduce maintenance ICS-formoterol to low dose and continue as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol reliever.

- **Step 4: High-dose ICS plus second controller**: Reduce ICS dose by 50% and continue the second controller.

- **Step 3: Low-dose ICS-LABA maintenance**: Reduce ICS-LABA to once daily. Recognize that discontinuing LABA may lead to deterioration.

- **Step 3: Low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever**: Reduce maintenance dose.

### Stopping long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) for adults with asthma well controlled by LABA and inhaled corticosteroids [^115yhppk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Poorly controlled asthma often leads to preventable exacerbations that require additional medications, as well as unscheduled hospital and clinic visits. Long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) are commonly given to adults with asthma whose symptoms are not well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). US and UK regulators have issued warnings for LABA in asthma, recommending they be used "for the shortest duration of time required to achieve control of asthma symptoms and discontinued, if possible, once asthma control is achieved".

- **Objectives**: To compare cessation of long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA) versus continued use of LABA/inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS) for adults whose asthma is well controlled. This involves determining whether stopping LABA:
	1. Results in loss of asthma control or deterioration in quality of life.
	2. Increases the likelihood of asthma attacks or 'exacerbations'.
	3. Increases or decreases the likelihood of serious adverse events of any cause.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), www. ClinicalTrials.gov, www.who.int/ictrp/en/, reference lists of primary studies and existing reviews, and manufacturers' trial registries (GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and AstraZeneca). We searched all databases from their inception to April 2015, without imposing any restriction on the language of publication.

- **Selection criteria**: We looked for parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least eight weeks' duration, in which adults whose asthma was well controlled by any dose of ICS+LABA combination therapy were randomly.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^114nrzF9]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, specifically concerning treatment adjustment and stepping up, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend escalating treatment with the following adjustment options when asthma remains uncontrolled despite good adherence and proper inhaler technique:

- **Day-to-day adjustment using an anti-inflammatory reliever**: Adjust the number of as-needed doses of ICS-formoterol according to symptoms. This adjustment can be made by the patient if the reliever inhaler is budesonide-formoterol or beclometasone-formoterol, with or without maintenance ICS-formoterol.

- **Short-term step up (for 1–2 weeks)**: Increase the dose of maintenance ICS for 1–2 weeks. This can be done by the patient following a written asthma action plan or by a healthcare provider, particularly during viral infections or seasonal allergen exposure.

- **Sustained step up (for at least 2–3 months)**: Increase the low dose of maintenance ICS to a medium dose when symptoms are confirmed to be due to asthma, inhaler technique and adherence are satisfactory, and modifiable risk factors such as smoking have been addressed. If there is no response after 2–3 months, reduce the dose to the previous level and consider offering alternative treatments or referring to a specialist center.

### Associations of patient outcomes with level of asthma control [^112iAoaa]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Despite effective medications, asthma remains a significant burden to the US health care system.

- **Objective**: To determine whether partly and uncontrolled asthma in respondents to the Asthma Insights and Management (AIM) survey was associated with adverse outcomes, such as visits to health care professionals and medication use, compared with well-controlled asthma.

- **Methods**: The AIM survey, conducted in 2009, included 2,500 patients with asthma who were 12 years or older. We classified patients into levels of control and compared use of health care services and limitations of activities in patients whose asthma was well controlled versus those with partly and uncontrolled asthma.

- **Results**: Patients who reported lower income and educational status and lacked health insurance were less likely to have had well-controlled asthma. Respondents with uncontrolled asthma were more likely to report ever use of oral steroids (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–3.2) and over-the-counter medicine (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 2.0–3.7) compared with patients whose asthma was well controlled. Respondents with partly and uncontrolled asthma were also significantly more likely to report ever visiting physicians, specialists, or the emergency department or being hospitalized for asthma compared with those whose asthma was well controlled (ORs ranging from 2.1 to 5.6). Finally, respondents whose asthma was uncontrolled had increased odds (ORs ranging from 14 to 34) of reporting that asthma limited their activities compared with respondents whose asthma was well controlled.

### Long-term control medication use and asthma control status among children and adults with asthma [^113NihEv]. The Journal of Asthma (2017). Low credibility.

Uncontrolled asthma decreases quality of life and increases health care use. Most people with asthma need daily use of long-term control (LTC) medications to manage asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. Ongoing assessment of a person's level of asthma control and medication use is important in determining the effectiveness of treatment to decrease the frequency and intensity of symptoms and functional limitations.

- **Objective**: To assess the use of LTC medication among children and adults with asthma and identify contributing factors for LTC medication use.

- **Methods**: We used the 2006–2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) child and adult Asthma Call-back Survey (ACBS) data to assess the level of asthma control and LTC medication use. Asthma control was classified as well controlled and uncontrolled using guideline-based measures. We used multivariable logistic regression models to identify contributing factors for LTC medication use and having uncontrolled asthma.

- **Results**: Among persons with asthma, 46.0% of children and 41.5% of adults were taking LTC medications, and 38.4% of children and 50.0% of adults had uncontrolled asthma. Among children with uncontrolled asthma (38.4%), 24.1% were taking LTC medications and 14.3% were not taking LTC medications. Among adults with uncontrolled asthma (50.0%), 26.7% were taking LTC medications and 23.3% were not taking LTC medications.

- **Conclusions**: Using BRFSS ACBS data to assess the level of asthma control and LTC medication use can identify subpopulations of persons with asthma.

### Stability of asthma symptom control in a longitudinal study of mild-moderate asthmatics [^111Reaqi]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Achieving and maintaining symptom control is a primary goal of asthma management. Although factors associated with the likelihood of achieving symptom control have been studied, there are unanswered questions on the stability of symptom control, that is, the tendency of individuals to remain at a given symptom control level over time.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to evaluate the stability of symptom control using a longitudinal cohort of mild-moderate asthmatics.

- **Methods**: Participants reported symptom control using the Global Initiative for Asthma criteria at five assessments during the one-year follow-up period. We described variability in the stability of symptom control between individuals and used a random-effects logistic regression model to evaluate the impact of multiple factors on the stability of symptom control.

- **Results**: A total of 429 individuals (67% female, mean age 51.6) contributed 2141 study visits. Individuals varied from completely stable in symptom control (18% remained at the same control level in all five visits) to completely unstable (12% changed the control level between all subsequent visits). Only 4% of between-individual variation in the stability of symptom control was explained by the included exposures, and a secondary analysis indicated that the history of symptom control stability was the best predictor of stability.

- **Conclusions**: The tendency to remain at a given control level varies significantly among patients with asthma. Only a small fraction of this variability is explained by observable characteristics.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111vyWEz]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of asthma, particularly in the context of exacerbation management, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend considering the addition of a short course of oral corticosteroids. This is advised at a dosage of 40–50 mg/day for 5–7 days for adults and adolescents, or 0.5 mg/kg/day with a maximum of 40 mg/day for 3–5 days for children, specifically for severe exacerbations. Symptoms indicating severe exacerbations include a peak expiratory flow or FEV1 less than 60% of the personal best or predicted value, or inadequate response to previous treatment over 2–3 days.

- **Morning dosing**: Prefer morning dosing after the first dose to minimize insomnia.
- **Patient advice**: Advise patients about potential adverse effects.
- **Tapering**: Do not offer tapering if oral corticosteroids are taken for less than 2 weeks.

### The risks, benefits, and uncertainties of stepping down asthma medications [^11381pRD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Stepwise adjustments have been suggested as a framework to manage chronic asthma over time. In this framework, individuals with good asthma control and a low risk for future asthma exacerbations may be considered for a reduction or "step down" of their chronic asthma medications. In this article, we discuss how patients may benefit or be harmed by stepping down asthma medications. Based on the literature presented in this article, we recommend that clinicians discuss the option of stepping down with patients when symptoms are stable, lung function is near normal, and biomarkers (if measured) are near normal. Other factors that should be considered in the decision to step down include the length of asthma stability, age of the patient, time of year, and patient preferences. Reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroid by 25% to 50% appears to be the safest method of stepping down. A clear plan of care and follow-up is needed when stepping down asthma medications because many patients are likely to have re-exacerbations.

### Inhaled corticosteroids safety and adverse effects in patients with asthma [^1167wHtk]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma is a common inflammatory airway disease for which the most commonly used controller medications are inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Asthma control is difficult to achieve in individuals with severe asthma, comprising 5% to 10% of individuals with asthma, even with high doses of ICS and other anti-inflammatory drugs. In this clinical context, the adverse effects of ICS, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, reduction in growth velocity, osteoporosis, diabetes, and respiratory infections, become more probable and impact the quality of life of severe asthmatics. Here, we summarize the evidence of ICS-related adverse effects, particularly in patients with asthma. The possibility of using biologic agents earlier for severe asthma has the potential to prevent or reduce the occurrence of corticosteroid-related adverse effects and reduce corticosteroid-related costs.

### GINA 2020: What's new and why [^113mgoAr]. The Journal of Asthma (2021). Low credibility.

The Global Initiative against Asthma (GINA) 2020 strategy has been released with several changes and updates. GINA recommends continuing medications, avoiding nebulization and spirometry, and ensuring a written asthma action plan during COVID-19 times. An easy flowchart in GINA 2020 specifies the management step to follow according to the patient's symptoms. Clinicians need to be aware of these changes and the evidence behind them.

### Post hoc analysis of initial treatments and control status in the INITIAL study: an observational study of newly diagnosed patients with asthma [^111oebUu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Two pivotal long-term goals of asthma management are symptom control and risk reduction. Evaluation of symptom control constitutes the basis of treatment decisions in a continuous asthma management cycle composed of assessment, treatment adjustment, and response review recommended by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Criteria used to assess clinical control have evolved from a combination of symptoms and lung function (peak expiratory flow [PEF] or forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1]) endorsed by GINA 2012, to symptoms alone in GINA 2014 and subsequent GINA updates. The removal of lung function from the assessment of asthma control is based on the rationale that, although still important in predicting risk of exacerbations, lung function testing results, i.e. spirometry, sometimes provide equivocal or even little utility for determining the level of clinical control. Valid tools that can be used to assess symptom control include simple screening tools (e.g. the 4-item questionnaires endorsed by GINA), categorical symptom control tools (e.g. Royal College of Physicians' Three Questions Tool), and numerical tools (e.g. Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]).

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with or without long-acting β2 agonist (LABA), have been recommended by GINA as the mainstay initial controller treatment. Leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) may be considered as an alternative option or add-on medication at steps 2 to 4. LTRA belongs to anti-leukotrienes and renders anti-inflammatory as well as bronchodilating effects by inhibiting leukotriene receptors.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: A report from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Coordinating Committee Expert Panel Working Group [^111X2tdK]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The Expert Panel identified several limitations in the process used to identify topics and develop recommendations, including the following:

- **Discussion and planning**: A better mechanism is needed to identify topics that require updates and reduce the time between updates. The process would benefit from developing a plan about how to tailor guideline recommendations in the emerging era of personalized medicine.

- **Professional engagement**: Expanding engagement with professional societies might benefit both the development and implementation of new recommendations.

The Expert Panel also recognized several overarching research gaps:

- **Core outcome measures**: Research studies need to use the core outcome measures identified in the 2012 Asthma Outcomes Workshop. Federal agencies that contributed to the 2012 workshop report should require funded studies to measure outcomes as recommended in that report. Given the availability of new information on asthma outcomes, the workshop report should be reexamined to determine whether it requires revision.

- **Clinical relevance and stakeholder input**: The clinical relevance of changes in outcome measures should be formally established to provide minimal important differences (MIDs) for all asthma outcomes such as exacerbations and asthma symptoms, as well as the cutoffs for tests. Clinical relevance should be determined using a wide range of stakeholder input, especially from individuals with asthma, who should also be included as members of the Expert Panel.

This section highlights the ongoing need for updates to outcome definitions and the inclusion of diverse stakeholder perspectives in future guidelines.

### The pediatric asthma yardstick: Practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for children with inadequately controlled asthma [^112PixgH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management involving assessment of impairment and risk, followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. However, for children with asthma, achieving control can be elusive. Although tools are available to help children and families track and manage day-to-day symptoms, when and how to implement a longer-term step-up in care is less clear. Furthermore, treatment is challenged by the three age groups: adolescence (12–18 years old), school age (6–11 years old), and young children (≤ 5 years old). What works for one age group might not be the best approach for another.

The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick provides an in-depth assessment of when and how to step-up therapy for the child with not well or poorly controlled asthma. Development of this tool follows others in the Yardstick series, presenting patient profiles and step-up strategies based on guidance documents but modified according to newer data and the authors' combined clinical experience. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat children with asthma practical and clinically relevant recommendations for each step-up and each intervention, with the intent of helping practitioners better treat their pediatric patients with asthma, particularly those who do not always respond to recommended therapies.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116XzVR2]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for asthma, particularly in relation to treatment adjustment and stepping down, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend the following: Engage the patient in the process of stepping down, document asthma status — symptom control, lung function, and risk factors — provide a written asthma action plan with clear instructions on how and when to resume previous treatment if symptoms worsen, and ensure the patient has sufficient medication to resume the previous dose if necessary. Additionally, it is important to monitor symptoms and/or peak expiratory flow and to schedule a follow-up visit.
