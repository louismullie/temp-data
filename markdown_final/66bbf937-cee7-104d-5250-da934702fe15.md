## Question

What is the best mri modality for multiple sclerosis (with and or without contrast?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the best MRI modality for multiple sclerosis, including when to use contrast and when not to use contrast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context, distinguishing diagnosis from monitoring. Then, I should verify the core sequences that fulfill dissemination-in-space and dissemination-in-time criteria. Next, I will examine the role and safety of gadolinium-based contrast agents and when they meaningfully change management. After that, I should review advanced sequences and field strength considerations. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, protocol-level recommendation and state the bottom line clearly with supporting evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame, because the "best" modality depends on whether we are diagnosing suspected MS versus monitoring established MS, and whether we are in a routine follow-up or a high-activity scenario. For diagnosis, we need to demonstrate dissemination in space and time and exclude mimics, whereas for monitoring we prioritize detection of new activity and safety surveillance, and this distinction drives contrast use and sequence selection [^912a55cb] [^aafb5617].

> I will now examine the core sequences. Wait, let me verify the current consensus: 3D FLAIR is the foundational brain sequence for lesion detection and longitudinal comparison because it improves sensitivity and enables isotropic reformatting, and it should be complemented by 3D T2-weighted imaging and a pre- and post-contrast 3D T1-weighted sequence to assess enhancement and T1 black holes. Spinal cord imaging with sagittal T2 and STIR or DIR, plus axial T2 through suspicious areas, is essential when brain MRI is nondiagnostic or symptoms localize to the cord, and this combination addresses DIS and DIT while supporting the differential diagnosis [^912a55cb] [^aafb5617] [^cfa510da].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about contrast. I need to check when gadolinium truly adds value. Gadolinium-enhanced T1 detects active blood–brain barrier breakdown and can substitute for clinical DIT when enhancing and nonenhancing lesions coexist, but routine contrast at every follow-up is no longer necessary because new or enlarging T2/FLAIR lesions capture most clinically relevant activity, and macrocyclic agents are preferred over linear agents due to deposition concerns. Thus, contrast is most impactful at diagnosis, when high lesion burden obscures new activity, when clinical worsening suggests occult activity, or when safety issues like PML are a concern, whereas in stable patients without new T2 lesions, contrast rarely changes management [^912a55cb] [^6c99c864] [^8a5e5e32] [^1f68ac75] [^d7daa1fa].

> Let me consider advanced sequences and field strength, because I should confirm whether these meaningfully alter diagnostic yield in routine practice. Susceptibility-weighted imaging to assess the central vein sign and paramagnetic rim lesions can improve specificity in ambiguous cases, and 3D TSE post-contrast T1 may detect more enhancing lesions than 3D GRE at 3T, but higher field strength alone does not consistently improve fulfillment of DIS/DIT in CIS cohorts, so 1.5T with optimized protocols remains acceptable. Quantitative MRI and myelin water imaging are promising for research and may refine tissue-specific assessment, but they are not yet standard for routine care [^aafb5617] [^f2cc3fb9] [^f74288e9] [^c5ccbc28] [^fe8b794f].

> Next, I should review practical protocol choices and timing, and I need to ensure they align with guidelines. For suspected MS, obtain brain and spinal cord MRI with contrast when feasible to establish DIS/DIT and exclude mimics. For established MS, annual brain MRI with 3D FLAIR and 3D T2, plus pre- and post-contrast 3D T1 when clinically indicated, is reasonable, with spinal cord MRI every 1–2 years or when new myelopathic symptoms arise. Re-baseline imaging 4–6 months after starting or changing therapy helps interpret early treatment effects, and standardized 3D acquisitions with thin slices and no gap improve comparability across time points [^912a55cb] [^c1a1c357] [^912a55cb].

> But wait, what if the lesion burden is high and subtle new activity is hard to see on T2 alone? I should double-check the evidence that contrast still helps in that niche. Yes, in patients with confluent white matter disease or very high lesion load, gadolinium can unmask new enhancing lesions that are not obvious on FLAIR, and ring enhancement patterns may portend more destructive pathology; conversely, in low-activity patients without new T2 lesions, the incremental yield of contrast is minimal, supporting selective rather than routine use [^8a5e5e32] [^1f68ac75] [^d7daa1fa].

> I will now synthesize the answer. The best MRI modality for MS is a standardized 3D multi-sequence protocol anchored by 3D FLAIR for lesion detection and 3D T1 pre- and post-contrast for enhancement and black holes, with 3D T2 for complementary lesion assessment and dedicated spinal cord sequences when indicated. Contrast is essential at diagnosis and in selected monitoring scenarios but can often be omitted in stable follow-up when no new T2 lesions are present, balancing diagnostic yield with safety and stewardship principles [^912a55cb] [^aafb5617] [^6c99c864].

> Bottom line, and I should confirm this aligns with high-credibility guidance: for diagnosis, use brain and spinal MRI with gadolinium when feasible to establish DIS/DIT and exclude mimics. For routine monitoring of stable patients, rely on 3D FLAIR and 3D T2 to detect new or enlarging lesions and reserve contrast for suspected activity, high lesion burden, or safety surveillance. Advanced sequences and higher field strength can refine specificity but are not mandatory for standard care, and macrocyclic agents are preferred when contrast is used [^912a55cb] [^aafb5617] [^6c99c864].

---

The best MRI modality for MS is a **3D FLAIR sequence** [^912a55cb] for brain imaging because it maximizes lesion detection and supports accurate dissemination-in-space assessment, with 3D T1-weighted imaging for brain and spinal cord to assess atrophy and black holes [^c1a1c357]. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging is essential at diagnosis to demonstrate dissemination in time and active inflammation [^b282122a], but for routine follow-up, contrast is not mandatory if high-quality 3D FLAIR and T2 sequences are used, as new T2 lesions capture most activity [^6c99c864] [^1f68ac75]. Spinal cord MRI is recommended when brain MRI is inconclusive or symptoms localize to the cord [^cfa510da] [^6c45abe3]. Advanced techniques (e.g. central vein sign, quantitative MRI) may improve specificity but are not yet standard of care [^062aebed] [^c5ccbc28].

## Core MRI sequences for MS

| **Sequence** | **Role in MS imaging** | **Clinical utility** |
|-|-|-|
| 3D FLAIR | - Gold standard for brain imaging <br/> - Detects periventricular, juxtacortical, and cortical lesions <br/> - Enables accurate DIS assessment | - High sensitivity for MS lesions <br/> - Essential for diagnosis and monitoring [^912a55cb] [^aafb5617] |
| 3D T1-weighted | - Assesses brain and spinal cord atrophy <br/> - Detects black holes (chronic lesions) | - Important for prognosis and monitoring neurodegeneration [^c61af5b6] [^c5ccbc28] |
| T2-weighted | - Complements FLAIR for lesion detection <br/> - Useful for posterior fossa and spinal cord lesions | - Essential for comprehensive lesion assessment [^bb14681b] [^cfa510da] |
| Gadolinium-enhanced T1 | - Demonstrates active inflammation (BBB disruption) <br/> - Supports DIT at diagnosis | - Critical at diagnosis <br/> - Optional for routine follow-up [^b282122a] [^6c99c864] |

---

## Role of contrast enhancement

Contrast-enhanced MRI is **essential at diagnosis** to demonstrate dissemination in time via simultaneous enhancing and non-enhancing lesions, confirming active inflammation and supporting an earlier MS diagnosis [^b282122a] [^a116876e]. For routine follow-up, contrast is not mandatory if high-quality 3D FLAIR and T2 sequences are used, as new T2 lesions capture most disease activity; contrast can be reserved for suspected activity, high lesion burden, or safety concerns (e.g. PML surveillance) [^6c99c864] [^1f68ac75] [^8a5e5e32].

---

## Spinal cord MRI

Spinal cord imaging is recommended when brain MRI is inconclusive or symptoms localize to the cord, as cord lesions contribute to DIS and provide prognostic information [^cfa510da] [^6c45abe3]. Whole-cord coverage with T2 and STIR or DIR sequences is advised to maximize lesion detection [^cfa510da].

---

## Advanced MRI techniques

Advanced techniques such as the **central vein sign**, quantitative MRI, and myelin water fraction imaging may improve diagnostic specificity and provide insights into pathophysiology, but they are not yet standard in clinical practice due to limited availability and need for standardization [^062aebed] [^c5ccbc28].

---

## Field strength and protocol considerations

3T MRI offers higher sensitivity than 1.5T but does not consistently improve diagnostic fulfillment of DIS/DIT; therefore, **1.5T with optimized protocols remains acceptable** [^f74288e9] [^73422e88]. Standardized protocols with 3D sequences, thin slices, and no gap are recommended to ensure consistent lesion detection and comparability across scans [^912a55cb] [^ee0a60fd].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial diagnosis**: 3D FLAIR, 3D T1, T2, and gadolinium-enhanced T1 of brain and spinal cord [^b282122a] [^cfa510da].
- **Routine follow-up**: 3D FLAIR and T2 sequences; contrast reserved for suspected activity or safety concerns [^6c99c864] [^1f68ac75].
- **Spinal cord MRI**: Use when brain MRI is inconclusive or symptoms localize to the cord [^cfa510da] [^6c45abe3].
- **Advanced techniques**: Consider when available, but not standard of care [^062aebed] [^c5ccbc28].

---

The best MRI modality for MS is a **3D FLAIR-based protocol** with 3D T1 and T2, adding contrast at diagnosis and selectively at follow-up; spinal cord MRI is used when indicated, and advanced techniques are adjunctive rather than routine [^912a55cb] [^aafb5617].

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^260c1587]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Closing remarks

Reading of MRI scans should be done in the appropriate clinical context. The premise of these guidelines and criteria is that we assume a basic knowledge of what constitutes a lesion. The largest linear measurement for lesion definition should be ≥ 3 mm in at least one plane. Therefore, lesion identification should be done by trained, expert personnel. Image quality must be of a high standard. A conservative approach in identifying lesions should be adopted.

In the diagnostic work-up of patients with a suspicion of MS, the use of post-contrast sequences provides important information for the differential diagnosis. However, it should be noted that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently made a safety communication for the long-term effects of repeated administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), following the description of deposition of gadolinium in the brains of some patients who underwent multiple contrast-enhanced MRI scans. At the time of this writing, the impact of these safety concerns remains unknown.

MRI remains a valuable tool in identification of children and adults with MS, both at the time of an incident attack and when applied serially to confirm the chronic nature of this disease. More advanced imaging techniques inform on regional CNS involvement with greater sensitivity and may add to diagnostic specificity. Whether MRI features consistent with MS in the absence of clinical involvement can confirm MS diagnosis remains an area of controversy that requires further study and deliberation, particularly given evidence that some such individuals demonstrate focal and global loss of tissue integrity yet are not currently eligible for MS-directed therapies. As higher field-strength imaging and newer sequences better approximate pathology-level interrogation of the CNS, the fundamental question of what defines a disease like MS will need to be answered.

### 2021 MAGNIMS-CMSC-NAIMS consensus recommendations on the use of MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis [^912a55cb]. The Lancet: Neurology (2021). High credibility.

The 2015 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis and 2016 Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centres guidelines on the use of MRI in diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis made an important step towards appropriate use of MRI in routine clinical practice. Since their promulgation, there have been substantial relevant advances in knowledge, including the 2017 revisions of the McDonald diagnostic criteria, renewed safety concerns regarding intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents, and the value of spinal cord MRI for diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring purposes. These developments suggest a changing role of MRI for the management of patients with multiple sclerosis. This 2021 revision of the previous guidelines on MRI use for patients with multiple sclerosis merges recommendations from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis study group, Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centres, and North American Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis Cooperative, and translates research findings into clinical practice to improve the use of MRI for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of individuals with multiple sclerosis. We recommend changes in MRI acquisition protocols, such as emphasising the value of three dimensional-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery as the core brain pulse sequence to improve diagnostic accuracy and ability to identify new lesions to monitor treatment effectiveness, and we provide recommendations for the judicious use of gadolinium-based contrast agents for specific clinical purposes. Additionally, we extend the recommendations to the use of MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis in childhood, during pregnancy, and in the post-partum period. Finally, we discuss promising MRI approaches that might deserve introduction into clinical practice in the near future.

### The role of MRI in the diagnosis of MS [^4e9d6c70]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely used imaging technique in the investigation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although MS remains a clinical diagnosis, MRI has become an invaluable tool in understanding and monitoring the disease, and is commonly used to confirm the clinical diagnosis. Various imaging techniques can be used but T2-weighted brain imaging remains the standard tool. The officially endorsed imaging criteria for MS places greater emphasis on the spatial and temporal distribution of lesions than on their individual appearance. This review focuses on the more typical findings in MS, and considers the current role of MRI in the diagnosis.

Use of contrast agent

Gd is frequently used for its ability to highlight regions of altered blood–brain barrier and thus areas of active inflammation, thereby providing an indicator of current disease activity and a means to assess DMTs efficacy and safety in PML surveillance. However, evidence suggests a retention of Gd in the body, following a scan. Therefore, the Gd for routine MRI scans should be used when necessary, with specific macrocyclic Gd agents being recommended over linear agents for safety reasons. Since Gd may be used both at diagnosis and during DMTs or natural history monitoring, the authors felt that, in line with published recommendation, Gd should be used only when deemed to be clinically necessary: (1) at diagnosis, (2) in cases of high lesion burden to identify new lesions, (3) to confirm the clinical suspicion of disease activity (e.g. worsening in disability, for which a relapse is suspected, but no clear episode is identifiable), and (4) where it may critically inform treatment decisions (e.g. assessment of treatment efficacy or safety).

### MRI in multiple sclerosis: current status and future prospects [^f235d050]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

Many promising MRI approaches for research or clinical management of multiple sclerosis (MS) have recently emerged, or are under development or refinement. Advanced MRI methods need to be assessed to determine whether they allow earlier diagnosis or better identification of phenotypes. Improved post-processing should allow more efficient and complete extraction of information from images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy should improve in sensitivity and specificity with higher field strengths and should enable the detection of a wider array of metabolites. Diffusion imaging is moving closer to the goal of defining structural connectivity and, thereby, determining the functional significance of lesions at specific locations. Cell-specific imaging now seems feasible with new magnetic resonance contrast agents. The imaging of myelin water fraction brings the hope of providing a specific measure of myelin content. Ultra-high-field MRI increases sensitivity, but also presents new technical challenges. Here, we review these recent developments in MRI for MS, and also look forward to refinements in spinal-cord imaging, optic-nerve imaging, perfusion MRI, and functional MRI. Advances in MRI should improve our ability to diagnose, monitor, and understand the pathophysiology of MS.

MRI techniques, including conventional T(2)-weighted and gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T(1)-weighted images, have provided important insights into the pathophysiology of MS. Although the correlation of MRI measures with clinical disability and outcome continues to be investigated, MRI measures are routinely used both in clinical practice and in MS research. In addition to its use as a diagnostic tool, MRI is used as a surrogate marker to monitor disease progression and response to therapy. A variety of MRI measures are used in drug development studies and have aided our understanding of the potential benefits and possible mechanisms of action of drug therapies. Advances in MRI techniques may further elucidate the pathology of MS, thus providing opportunities for new treatment strategies.

### MRI in multiple sclerosis: clinical and research update [^0a965204]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Clinical MRI is of paramount importance for multiple sclerosis diagnosis but lacks the specificity to investigate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying disease onset and progression. The application of advanced MR sequences allows the characterization of diverse and complex pathological mechanisms, granting insights into multiple sclerosis natural history and response to treatment.

Recent Findings

This review provides an update on the most recent international guidelines for optimal standard imaging of multiple sclerosis and discusses advantages and limitations of advanced imaging approaches for investigating inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration. An overview is provided for methods devoted to imaging leptomeningeal enhancement, microglial activation, demyelination, neuronal metabolic damage and neuronal loss.

Summary

The application of magnetic resonance (MR) guidelines to standard-of-care MR protocols, although still limited, would substantially contribute to the optimization of multiple sclerosis management. From an academic perspective, different mechanism-specific imaging techniques are available and offer a powerful tool to elucidate multiple sclerosis pathogenesis, monitor disease progression and guide therapeutic choices.

### MRI: role in optimising treatment [^954de110]. Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an extremely sensitive diagnostic tool that provides us with highly detailed images of the living human brain. Since it was first applied to multiple sclerosis (MS) in clinical trials in the 1980s, MRI has become established as a reliable, sensitive and reproducible technique for studying the pathophysiology of this complex disease. It has provided a variety of surrogate measures for clinical trials, and continues to offer new methods for the detection and monitoring of the physical and chemical changes in the brains of living patients. The unique sensitivity of conventional MRI measures for detecting MS pathology has made MRI an attractive tool for optimising treatment in clinical practice for individual patients.

### A single, early magnetic resonance imaging study in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis… [^fcc5ea09]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Results Two hundred fifty patients were included in the study. The comparison of the diagnostic performance of various MRI criteria for identifying early converters to CDMS showed similar sensitivity and specificity between early and delayed MRIs. In addition, the use of less stringent criteria for DIS yielded better sensitivity and similar specificity, particularly when assessed in the first weeks after CIS onset. Compared with the McDonald criteria, these new MRI criteria are similarly specific for clinically definite MS, more sensitive, 6and based on the findings of T2-weighted images alone, without the need for gadolinium enhancement. However, because the development of a new T2 lesion is mandatory for demonstrating DIT, at least 2 MRIs are always needed to establish the MRI-based diagnosis of MS, although a minimum interval between symptom onset and the MRI study is not required.
7.

The various criteria used to demonstrate DIS were selected according to differences in their diagnostic performance in previous studies, 4, 6, 9 which indicated that the Barkhof-Tintoré criteria are more stringent than the Swanton and Frohman criteria. Early and delayed MRIs were classified as positive if they met the MRI criteria of DIS and DIT. Fulfillment of the various MRI criteria for DIS in early and delayed MRIs is indicated in Table 3. As would be expected, the number of patients who met the criteria for DIS increased when the less restrictive Frohman or Swanton criteria were applied. These criteria predicted early conversion to CDMS with good sensitivity, although specificity was rather low. Fulfillment of criteria for DIS and DIT in early and delayed images is indicated in Table 4. Similar high specificity was demonstrated for all 3 sets of MRI criteria, but higher sensitivity was achieved with the less stringent criteria for DIS.

The requirement of DIT in addition to DIS decreases sensitivity but increases specificity. The comparison between the diagnostic properties of a single, early MRI and a single, delayed MRI for identifying converters to CDMS showed similar results, with early MRI yielding slightly higher sensitivity. This difference disappeared when early converters were excluded from the early MRI analysis. Moreover, ADEM is rather unusual in the adult population, and there are several clinical, biological, and MRI features that can be used to differentiate patients with ADEM from those with MS. 18, 19.

### Use of gadolinium-based contrast agents in multiple sclerosis: a review by the ESMRMB-GREC and ESNR multiple sclerosis working group [^6c99c864]. European Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive technique for detecting inflammatory demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS) and plays a crucial role in diagnosis and monitoring treatment effectiveness, and for predicting the disease course. In clinical practice, detection of MS lesions is mainly based on T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. Contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL) on T1-weighted sequences are related to (sub)acute inflammation, while new or enlarging T2 lesions reflect the permanent footprint from a previous acute inflammatory demyelinating event. These two types of MRI features provide redundant information, at least in regular monitoring of the disease. Due to the concern of gadolinium deposition after repetitive injections of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), scientific organizations and regulatory agencies in Europe and North America have proposed that these contrast agents should be administered only if clinically necessary. In this article, we provide data on the mode of action of GBCAs in MS, the indications of the use of these agents in clinical practice, their value in MS for diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring purposes, and their use in specific populations (children, pregnant women, and breast-feeders). We discuss imaging strategies that achieve the highest sensitivity for detecting CELs in compliance with the safety regulations established by different regulatory agencies. Finally, we will briefly discuss some alternatives to the use of GBCA for detecting blood-brain barrier disruption in MS lesions. CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: Although use of GBCA at diagnostic workup of suspected MS is highly valuable for diagnostic and prognostic purposes, their use in routine monitoring is not mandatory and must be reduced, as detection of disease activity can be based on the identification of new or enlarging lesions on T2-weighted images. KEY POINTS:
- Both the EMA and the FDA state that the use of GBCA in medicine should be restricted to clinical scenarios in which the additional information offered by the contrast agent is required.
- The use of GBCA is generally recommended in the diagnostic workup in subjects with suspected MS and is generally not necessary for routine monitoring in clinical practice.
- Alternative MRI-based approaches for detecting acute focal inflammatory MS lesions are not yet ready to be used in clinical practice.

### Novel MRI approaches to assess patients with multiple sclerosis [^274f0826]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review summarizes novel MRI approaches for the investigation of lesion burden and understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Recent Findings

Recent technical advances are improving our ability to detect and define the nature of focal lesions and 'diffuse' tissue damage in MS as well as the functional consequences of such structural abnormalities. New contrast agents allow to monitor the pluriformity of MS inflammation. Double inversion recovery sequences enable us to detect and monitor the evolution of MS lesions in the cortex. High and ultra-high field scanners are improving imaging of MS-related abnormalities at an unprecedented resolution. Furthermore, this new generation of scanners has the potential to ameliorate structural and functional MR studies of the disease. All of this has contributed, and is likely to continue to contribute, to the definition of the factors associated with the development of irreversible disability in MS. Finally, new analysis methods have allowed to track regional disease-related changes and are resulting in an increased correlation between MRI and clinical deficits.

Summary

Novel MR approaches highlighted previously unrecognized or neglected aspects of MS pathophysiology, which are likely to improve our understanding of the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of this condition.

Detection of disease activity and monitoring of efficacy

Monitoring MRI scans are useful in naïve patients, as well as at the beginning or following initiation or change of DMTs, or if a relapse is suspected, but cannot be confirmed purely on clinical grounds. Indeed, the importance of MRI to confirm stability is highlighted by the role of radiological activity in the evaluation of treatment response.

Spinal cord MRI can reveal asymptomatic disease activity, as well as predict disease evolution. Therefore, the authors felt that it should be performed regularly in addition to the brain scans, especially, but not exclusively, in patients in whom a previous involvement of the spinal cord has been demonstrated clinically or radiologically. Indeed, about 58% of new spinal cord lesions can be asymptomatic and 25% of patients with relapsing MS develops at least one asymptomatic spinal cord lesion over 1.5 years; when only patients with stable RRMS are considered, 10% of them show subclinical spinal cord lesion activity alone. Asymptomatic spinal cord lesions can also predict relapses, when combined with asymptomatic brain lesions. Therefore, as spinal cord MRI can disclose subclinical disease activity in otherwise clinically stable MS, the authors supported its routine use in patient's monitoring throughout the course of the disease and regardless of the clinical manifestation of MS in the cord.

Gd should be considered to aid detection of new inflammatory activity, when this would be too difficult to detect, due to high lesion burden, as well as for its prognostic utility, e.g. brain ring-enhancement patterns may forebode irreversible tissue damage and thus brain volume loss. In the post-partum period, when monitoring is particularly important because of higher risk of relapse, the use of contrast enhancement may be limited by breastfeeding.

When patients are on specific DMTs, the primary purpose of a follow-up MRI scan is the detection of new inflammatory activity and the exclusion of opportunistic infections for safety of DMT prescription. As DMTs may reach their peak level of activity on MRI months after their initiation, a re-baseline scan beyond this time point is advisable. The authors felt that whether this scan should be performed with or without contrast enhancement should depend on clinical considerations such as the level of inflammatory activity at DMT initiation, the type of medication started and the age of the patient that all together define a risk for active disease. The presence or persistence of a Gd-active MRI scan at re-baseline could predict subsequent clinical and MRI activity and thus could indicate a subgroup of patients at higher risk of activity during DMTs.

### Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging towards clinical application in multiple sclerosis [^c5ccbc28]. Brain (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Conventional MRI provides invaluable information for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of the effectiveness of therapeutics in patients with multiple sclerosis. The term conventional MRI encompasses the methods used in clinical practice to describe pathology by relying on contrast changes in weighted images. These are images that predominantly, but not exclusively, reflect a biophysical contrast mechanism (e.g. T 1 - and T 2 -weighted scans). Using conventional MRI in the multiple sclerosis clinic, it is generally possible to identify the number, location, and activity of multiple sclerosis lesions, although the sensitivity to those characteristics generally varies depending on several technical factors. On the other end, conventional MRI is largely insensitive to the heterogeneity of focal multiple sclerosis lesions and to the pathology affecting CNS tissue outside multiple sclerosis lesions (normal-appearing white and grey matter). Furthermore, conventional MRI is unable to depict the level of damage within different CNS tissue components, such as myelin, axons, and glia.

Better quantification of the extent, type, spatial distribution, and evolution over time of CNS tissue damage in patients with multiple sclerosis could improve our understanding of disease mechanisms. It may also aid in stratification of disease burden, assessment of therapy response and evaluation of subclinical disease progression.

Quantitative MRI can potentially address these needs by providing more sensitive measures of multiple sclerosis pathology and more specific information regarding which tissue component has been damaged (Fig. 1). Unlike conventional MRI, which acquires datasets that have a mixture of weightings and therefore cannot be resolved into a quantitative map, quantitative MRI relies exclusively on acquisitions that can then be used to disentangle the source of signal variations. Moreover, through computational or mathematical modelling, this approach can provide quantitative maps where intensities have physical units. Thus, quantitative MRI techniques are superior to conventional MRI regarding their sensitivity to subtle alterations within lesions and normal-appearing tissueas well as their increased specificity relating to the damage of different tissue components of the CNS (e.g. myelin, axons, glia, iron and blood flow/volume).

### Multiple sclerosis imaging: recent advances [^f134cfe5]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

In this review, we summarize advances in knowledge derived from the application of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based techniques to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) published in the Journal of Neurology over the past year. We highlight the pivotal role played by conventional MRI techniques for a correct and early diagnosis of this condition and the exclusion of alternative disorders. Advanced MR methods have contributed to demonstrating how damage to selected brain structures is related to disease clinical manifestations, thus contributing to overcome the well-known "clinical-radiological" paradox of MS, and ameliorating the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the accumulation of irreversible disability. Finally, we discuss the use of MRI to assess treatment efficacy and optimize therapeutic approaches in this condition.

### Using MRI to make informed clinical decisions in multiple sclerosis care [^896d9caf]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with multiple sclerosis have benefited from an increasingly large number of choices for anti-inflammatory, disease-modifying therapy. One cannot reliably predict how an individual patient will respond to a particular therapy. MRI has become an integral component of therapy selection and monitoring in multiple sclerosis.

Recent Findings

Number of lesions at baseline and new lesions on therapy have implications for long-term prognosis. To achieve best therapeutic outcomes, patients with accumulating lesions may benefit from a change in their therapy. For patients with established stable disease, MRI may be done less frequently.

Summary

Practitioners should be obtaining brain MRI scans to supplement their clinical evaluations and assess for subclinical disease activity. In certain circumstances, changing therapy may be warranted based upon MRI alone, despite the appearance of clinical stability. The appearance of two to five T2-weighted lesions or one to two gadolinium-enhancing lesions represents a threshold of concern.

### Imaging as an outcome measure in multiple sclerosis [^6883b8ad]. Neurotherapeutics (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is sensitive to lesion formation both in the brain and spinal cord. Imaging plays a prominent role in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS. Over a dozen anti-inflammatory therapies are approved for MS and the development of many of these medications was made possible through the use of contrast-enhancing lesions on MRI as a phase II outcome. A similar phase II outcome method for the neurodegeneration that underlies progressive courses of the disease is still unavailable. Although magnetic resonance is an invaluable tool for the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment effects in MS, several imaging barriers still exist. In general, MRI is less sensitive to gray matter lesions, lacks pathological specificity, and does not provide quantitative data easily. Several advanced imaging methods including diffusion tensor imaging, magnetization transfer, functional MRI, myelin water fraction imaging, ultra-high field MRI, positron emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography of the retina study promising ways of overcoming the difficulties in MS imaging.

MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IN THE CLINICAL SETTING

The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis and Therapeutic Monitoring

As evident from pathology studies, MS is a central nervous system (CNS)–wide disease with a chronic course. These hallmarks are reflected in the diagnostic criteria of MS. The McDonald criteria were originally introduced in 2001and underwent several revisions, most recently in 2017. These criteria identify MS or a high likelihood of the disease in patients with typical clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), that is, monophasic clinical episodes with patient-reported symptoms and objective findings reflecting an inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS. Diagnosis requires the fulfillment of 2 criteria: (1) dissemination in time: at least 2 distinct episodes suggestive of MS in the patient history; and (2) dissemination in space: neuroinflammatory damage in different CNS regions.

Because there is no single pathognomonic clinical feature or diagnostic test for MS, the McDonald criteria integrate clinical, imaging, and laboratory findings. However, MRI has gained particular momentum in the MS diagnosisand to rule out common MS mimics. With this, brain and spinal cord MRI remain the most important paraclinical tests to substantiate MS diagnosis, not least due to its ability to sensitively visualize white matter pathology.

Magnetic resonance imaging can be used to determine both dissemination in time and space. Dissemination in time can be confirmed by the simultaneous presence of non–gadolinium-enhancing and gadolinium-enhancing lesions in the CNS or by a new T2-weighted (T2w) hyperintense or T1w contrast-enhancing lesion on a follow-up MRI scan. Dissemination in space can be confirmed by 1 or more T2w hyperintense lesions in 2 or more of 4 characteristic CNS sites, that is, (juxta)cortical, periventricular, infratentorial, and/or spinal cord. Magnetic resonance imaging can also support the identification of mechanisms behind disease progression, including paramagnetic rim lesions, subpial demyelination, distinct spinal cord pathology, and brain and spinal cord atrophy.

### MRI in multiple sclerosis: what is changing? [^6a898424]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize recent findings from the application of MRI in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis (MS), and to review the insights into disease pathophysiology and the utility of MRI for monitoring treatment response.

Recent Findings

New evidence from the application of MRI in patients with clinically isolated syndromes has guided the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis, which has simplified their clinical use while preserving accuracy. Other MRI measures (e.g., cortical lesions and central vein signs) may improve diagnostic specificity, but their assessment still needs to be standardized, and their reliability confirmed. Novel MRI techniques are providing fundamental insights into the pathological substrates of the disease and are helping to give a better understanding of its clinical manifestations. Combined clinical-MRI measures of disease activity and progression, together with the use of clinically relevant MRI measures (e.g., brain atrophy) might improve treatment monitoring, but these are still not ready for the clinical setting.

Summary

Advances in MRI technology are improving the diagnostic work-up and monitoring of MS, even in the earliest phases of the disease, and are providing MRI measures that are more specific and sensitive to disease pathological substrates.

Timing of MRI scans for MS diagnosis and monitoring

The clinical indications for MRI in MS vary from diagnosis to monitoring, as well as from assessment of treatment efficacy to surveillance for opportunistic infections (Table 1). An overview of the suggested timing for MRI scans in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS patients is reported for a period of 5 years in Fig. 1. This period is crucial for its long-term diagnostic and a prognostic value.

Table 1
Indications for MRI in MS

The indication for MRI scanning in MS ranges from diagnosis to disease or DMTs monitoring, as highlighted below. MRI supports diagnosis, as well as disease monitoring. When a relapse cannot be confirmed purely on clinical grounds, MRI scan can be used to confirm clinical suspicion. Monitoring during DMTs aims to detect disease activity, as well as to characterise the type of damage that appears on the scan to exclude opportunistic infections such as PML

The asterisk indicates that MRI monitoring in patients on DMT is relevant to characterise the type of damage, as well as to assess safety of DMT

Fig. 1
Timing of MRI scans in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS patients. The authors advised to perform a brain and spinal cord scan at diagnosis. After the beginning of DMT or after a change in DMT, brain MRI scan was indicated yearly for at least 5 years, with a re-baseline brain scan 4–6 months after initiating or changing DMT. This was to interpret more confidently response to treatment at an early stage of the disease. More frequent scans were left at the discretion of the clinician, based on individual cases. Spinal cord MRI scan was advised every 2 years for at least 5 years after initiation or change of DMT, even in the absence of clear spinal cord signs or symptoms, with more frequent scans left at the discretion of the clinician, based on individual cases. In patients with predominant involvement of the spinal cord, yearly spinal scans may be more appropriate. The initial assessments should be conducted with the use of contrast; subsequent MRI scans for monitoring of disease activity, as well as of DMT efficacy, may include contrast when clinically indicated. The proposed timing assumes the start of DMTs soon after diagnosis. When this is not possible or indicated, monitoring would be left at the discretion of the clinician, but advised to be regular.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis: MRI in clinical practice [^2553877a]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent changes in the understanding and management of multiple sclerosis (MS) have increased the role of MRI in supporting diagnosis and disease monitoring. However, published guidelines on the use of MRI in MS do not translate easily into different clinical settings and considerable variation in practice remains. Here, informed by published guidelines for the use of MRI in MS, we identified a clinically informative MRI protocol applicable in a variety of clinical settings, from district general hospitals to tertiary centres.

Methods

MS specialists geographically representing the UK National Health Service and with expertise in MRI examined existing guidelines on the use of MRI in MS and identification of challenges in their applications in various clinical settings informed the formulation of a feasible MRI protocol.

Results

We identified a minimum set of MRI information, based on clinical relevance, as well as on applicability to various clinical settings. This informed the selection of MRI acquisitions for scanning protocols, differentiated on the basis of their purpose and stage of the disease, and indication of timing for scans. Advice on standardisation of MRI requests and reporting, and proposed timing and frequency of MRI scans were generated.

Conclusions

The proposed MRI protocol can adapt to a range of clinical settings, aiding the impetus towards standardisation of practice and offering an example of research-informed service improvement to support optimisation of resources. Other neurological conditions, where a gap still exists between published guidelines and their clinical implementation, may benefit from this same approach.

### Role of magnetic resonance imaging within diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis [^d576daf7]. Annals of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been improved in recent decades with the incorporation of paraclinical investigations in diagnostic workup. In the last 15 years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an especially valuable tool for supporting MS diagnosis, and specific imaging criteria became fundamental to the guidelines for the diagnosis of MS published in 2001 by an international panel (IP). The new IP criteria include MRI evidence of dissemination in space and time, making it possible to diagnose MS after a single clinical episode. This review considers current evidence concerning the reliability of the new IP criteria for the diagnosis of relapsing-onset MS, discusses strengths and weaknesses of the criteria, and outlines areas which may need modification or should be the focus of future research directed toward improving diagnostic accuracy. It also makes practical recommendations when using MRI and the IP criteria in MS diagnosis, especially in patients with clinically isolated syndromes or atypical presentations. The IP criteria are timely and concrete and introduce an important concept to MS diagnosis. Future modifications, based on emerging evidence, should further facilitate their implementation and improve their accuracy.

### Do all patients with multiple sclerosis benefit from the use of contrast on serial follow-up MR imaging? A retrospective analysis [^d7daa1fa]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Patients with multiple sclerosis routinely have MR imaging with contrast every 6–12 months to assess response to medication. Multiple recent studies provide evidence of tissue deposition of MR imaging contrast agents, questioning the long-term safety of these agents. The goal of this retrospective image-analysis study was to determine whether contrast could be reserved for only those patients who show new MS lesions on follow-up examinations.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed brain MRIs of 138 patients. To increase our sensitivity, we used a previously described computerized image-comparison software to evaluate the stability or progression of multiple sclerosis white matter lesions in noncontrast FLAIR sequences. We correlated these findings with evidence of contrast-enhancing lesions on the enhanced T1 sequence from the same scan.

Results

Thirty-three scans showed an increase in white matter lesion burden. Among those 33 patients, 14 examinations also demonstrated enhancing new lesions. While we found a single example of enhancement of a pre-existing white matter lesion that appeared unchanged in size, that same examination showed an overall increase in lesion burden with enhancement of other, new lesions. Thus, we found that all patients with enhancing lesions had evidence of progression on their noncontrast imaging.

Conclusions

Because all enhancing lesions were associated with new lesions on unenhanced imaging and progression was only evident in 24% of patients, in patients with relapsing-remitting MS, it is reasonable to consider reserving contrast for only those patients with evidence of progression on noncontrast MR images.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^f1784181]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Three main topics were addressed during the workshop: (i) re-examination and definition of features characteristic for individual multiple sclerosis lesions and for patterns of their distribution ('green flags') as defined in the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria; (ii) depiction of lesion patterns that satisfy current multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria, but are not characteristic of multiple sclerosis. They may be associated with other diseases mimicking multiple sclerosis, an artefact or an incidental lesion related to a comorbidity and constitute 'red flags' for multiple sclerosis diagnosis. Examples include ischaemic lesions, peculiar patterns of contrast enhancement, or age-related 'periventricular capping' on T 2 -weighted images. They also encompass distinctive MRI features of recently recognized antibody-mediated diseases (e.g. neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and anti-MOG-IgG disease); and (iii) discussion of emerging features of lesions (e.g. central vein sign, subpial demyelination and lesion rims), which are likely, in the near future, to improve specificity of the diagnostic algorithm for multiple sclerosis.

MRI scan requests and reports

With an increasing number of scans being performed for MS diagnosis and management, there is further need to streamline scan requests and reports. Table 2 reports the proposed essential components of request forms and post-scan reports identified by the authors. Reports should be prepared with sufficient detail to stand alone, should the MRI images be unavailable. The use of the term "progression" on radiological reports was felt by the authors to be inaccurate and thus to be discouraged, with "evidence of radiologically active disease" or "radiological evolution" proposed as alternative terminology.

Table 2
MRI request forms and post-scan reports

The authors suggested that the clinician provides the neuroradiologist with relevant information about the individual patient and his history (left). The post-scan reports should contain information that would allow interpretability of the results (right)

DIT duration in time, DIS duration in space, MS multiple sclerosis, PML progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, DMTs disease-modifying treatments, MRI magnetic resonance imaging

MS lesion count

Whenever possible, absolute lesion counts should be reported, i.e. information about the number of T2-hyperintense, T1-hypointense and T1-hyperintense lesions in the post-contrast T1-weighted scans. This is relevant for both diagnostic, as well as monitoring scans. Where there is high lesion load, especially if lesions are confluent, the authors felt that, although not ideal, a categorical approach to the number of T2-hyperintense lesions would be acceptable (e.g. less than 9 T2-hyperintense lesions, between 10 and 20 hyperintense lesions etc.). For monitoring scans, the detection of new lesions and/or changes in the size of pre-existing lesions should be indicated. Lesion number should be indicated separately for the brain and the spinal cord. Indication of lesion location should be given to support the diagnostic process, as well as to provide clinically meaningful indications on the current or future patients' disability.

Brain and spinal cord volume

Comments on brain or spinal cord volumes should be provided in the report, at least as qualitative evaluation of the presence of MS-related tissue loss, by comparing the last scan with what expected in the normal, age-matched population, or as an assessment of the rate of volume reduction over time, by comparing the last scan with the first (or the most meaningful) available scan for the same patient.

### MR in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple sclerosis: an overview [^33bacd2e]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic, persistent inflammatory-demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that typically presents as an acute clinically isolated syndrome attributable to a monofocal or multifocal demyelinating lesion, which usually affects the optic nerve, spinal cord, or brainstem and cerebellum. Although the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is still based on clinical findings, magnetic resonance imaging is now integrated in the overall diagnostic scheme of the disease because of its unique sensitivity to demonstrate the spatial and temporal dissemination of demyelinating plaques in the brain and spinal cord. Conventional magnetic resonance imaging techniques, such as T2-weighted and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequences are highly sensitive in detecting multiple sclerosis plaques and provide a quantitative assessment of inflammatory activity and lesion load. However, there is a persisting mismatch between clinical and magnetic resonance imaging efficacy of approved treatments, which underlies the fact that this technique does not suffice to explain the entire spectrum of the disease process. In recent years, great effort has been dedicated to overcoming these limitations by using non-conventional magnetic resonance-derived metrics that can selectively measure the more destructive aspects of multiple sclerosis pathology and monitor the reparative mechanisms. These metrics, which include unenhanced T1-weighted imaging, measures of central nervous system atrophy, magnetization transfer imaging, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging, provide a better approximation of the pathological substrate of the multiple sclerosis plaques, have increased our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, and have proven useful for studying the natural history of multiple sclerosis and monitoring the effects of new treatments. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging not only plays an essential role in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, but can also serve as a true biological marker of the severity of this disease.

### Evidence-based guidelines: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines on the use of MRI in multiple sclerosis-clinical implementation in the diagnostic process [^96a78ace]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The clinical use of MRI in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) has advanced markedly over the past few years. Technical improvements and continuously emerging data from clinical trials and observational studies have contributed to the enhanced performance of this tool for achieving a prompt diagnosis in patients with MS. The aim of this article is to provide guidelines for the implementation of MRI of the brain and spinal cord in the diagnosis of patients who are suspected of having MS. These guidelines are based on an extensive review of the recent literature, as well as on the personal experience of the members of the MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS) network. We address the indications, timing, coverage, reporting and interpretation of MRI studies in patients with suspected MS. Our recommendations are intended to help radiologists and neurologists standardize and optimize the use of MRI in clinical practice for the diagnosis of MS.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^0863a9a7]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was formally included in the diagnostic work-up of patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) in 2001 by an International Panel of experts.MS diagnosis requires demonstration of disease dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT) and exclusion of other conditions that can mimic MS by their clinical and laboratory profile. MRI can support and substitute clinical information for MS diagnosis, allowing an earlier and accurate diagnosis and, consequently, earlier treatment.

MRI criteria for MS are based on the presence of focal lesions in the white matter (WM) of the central nervous system (CNS), which are considered typical for this condition in terms of distribution, morphology, evolution, and signal abnormalities on conventional MRI sequences (e.g. T2-weighted, T2-FLAIR, pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted scans). – Several modifications of MRI diagnostic criteria have been proposed over the years. These revisions have simplified the lesion-count models for demonstrating DIS, changed the timing of MRI scanning for demonstrating DIT, and increased the value of spinal cord imaging. – In 2007, the European collaborative research network that studies MRI in MS (MAGNIMS) reviewed the findings of studies that addressed these issues and proposed new MRI criteria to be applied in MS. Those MAGNIMS criteria are currently included in the most recent of the MS diagnostic criteria, known as the 2010 McDonald criteria. Recent consensus guidelines for clinicians regarding optimization of the planning, performance, and interpretation of brain and spinal cord MRI in the MS diagnostic process have also been published and are complementary to the recommendations in this paper.

Since 2011, new data regarding the application of MRI for demonstrating DIS and DIT have become available, and these deserve consideration for future revisions of the MS criteria. Additionally, many improvements in MRI technology have occurred, which resulted in the development of innovative acquisition sequences, the identification of novel pathophysiological mechanisms that may help in the differential diagnosis, and new insights into MS disease activity as evidenced by high-field and ultra-high-field scanners. The MAGNIMS members felt the need for timely revision of these recent findings and consideration of how they should modify the MRI criteria for the diagnosis of MS. A summary of the main revisions or clarifications to the MRI component of the 2010 McDonald criteria for MS we propose is presented in the stand alone panel.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis: MRI in clinical practice [^9bb7ef52]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In this report, we address the need for a standardisation of practice in the use of MRI for MS across clinical settings within the NHS. We suggest MRI scanning protocols and templates for MRI requests and post-scan reports in the attempt to facilitate diagnosis and optimise management of patients with MS, while considering the heterogeneity of resources and expertise that different clinical settings may present. The role of optic nerve imaging in MS was not discussed, as this is not currently included in the imaging diagnostic criteria for MS and, in MS monitoring, its informativeness is established by the clinician in each individual case.

Our proposed protocol aims to strike a balance between the need for frequent and accurate radiological information and the availability of equipment and staffing resources. The timing of MRI scans aims to capture, as early as possible, MS or its evolution that can be amenable to the starting or the changing of DMTs. The MRI acquisition protocol proposes a minimum, standardised set of meaningful information that can be used to manage MS. Indeed, published international guidelines offer guidance on MRI features that are most relevant to the diagnosis of MS. Their implementation in clinical practice, however, has proven to be challenging across clinical settings, especially when the care of MS patients is outside specialist centres. Our proposed application of MRI for MS in clinical practice balances the specialist requirements with practical limitations imposed by limited resources by streamlining acquisition protocols and by standardising the timing of scans to integrate MRI findings in the clinical decision-making process. This effort can aid the impetus towards standardisation of practice and offer an example of research-informed service improvement to support optimisation of resources.

The authors also tackled the issue of effective communication between specialists, i.e. clinicians and radiologists, that is paramount in a multi-disciplinary context. We tailored our suggestions regarding the format of requests and reports for MRI scanning so that they can be used as a standardised, time-sparing tool for obtaining clinically relevant MRI information about MS patients. Indeed, the authors felt that clear, minimal information about the reason for the MRI scan was essential for the radiologist to correctly address the clinician's question. Similarly, quantitative information about the MRI scan was felt to be necessary to manage MS effectively and promptly by clinicians. This quantitative, rather than merely descriptive, approach to MRI scan reporting for diagnostic, as well as for MRI monitoring scans, can contribute to an improved integration of MRI information in the clinical management of patients.

### Overview of magnetic resonance imaging for management of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in everyday practice [^6ee92d0d]. European Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Although the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for diagnosis/differential diagnosis of patients with clinically isolated syndromes suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) is widely accepted, adoption of MRI into clinical practice to monitor disease evolution remains a work in progress. However, an accumulating body of evidence points to a central role for MRI in managing patients with relapsing-remitting MS along the disease continuum. Routine MRI surveillance provides insight into disease activity that is not evident clinically and this information, in turn, can be used to inform prognosis and guide treatment decisions. In Europe, practical guidelines have been developed to reduce the heterogeneity of imaging (both intracentre and intercentre) and improve the quality of MRI assessment and interpretation. Aimed at the general neurologist, this review explores some of the issues associated with MRI and examines evidence supporting its use for routine monitoring of MS patients in everyday practice.

### The contribution of enhancing lesions in monitoring multiple sclerosis treatment: is gadolinium always necessary? [^1f68ac75]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

MRI is highly sensitive for monitoring of disease activity and treatment efficacy in MS. Patients treated with disease modifying therapy (DMT), who experience MRI activity, including contrast-enhancing lesions (CEL) or new/enlarged T2 lesions, should be evaluated for a switch to more effective treatment. Due to recent evidence of gadolinium (Gd) accumulation in the brain after repeated administration of Gd-based contrast agents, FDA recommended to limit its use.

Aim

To investigate the proportion of cases in which MRI activity would be detectable only using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted sequences. Secondary aims were to assess the presence of clinical or demographic variables associated with reactivation of pre-existing lesions and to analyse therapeutic consequences of different types of MRI lesions.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated brain MRI scans, performed between 2014 and 2018, in patients treated with DMT for at least 6 months.

Results

We analysed 906 scans in 255 patients. New/enlarged T2 lesions were detected in 13.7% of cases, CEL in 3.5%, CEL without new T2 lesions (old lesions reactivated) in 1.1%. No variables were associated with old lesions reactivated. CEL with T2 equivalent were at higher risk of DMT switch, compared with new/enlarged T2 lesions without corresponding CEL (OR 4.0, 95% CI 1.5–10.4, p = 0.005).

Conclusions

Reactivation of pre-existing lesions is limited to a tiny fraction of MRI studies. Gd+T1-weighted images could be omitted, in patients treated with DMT for at least 6 months, without relevant loss of information.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis: MRI in clinical practice [^2674dd9a]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is routinely used in clinical practice to detect and monitor inflammatory lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Diagnostic criteria, as well as disease-modifying treatments (DMTs), have more recently increased the demand for MRI scans to allow early diagnosis and monitoring of treatment safety and efficacy. This has increased the burden on equipment and healthcare professionals, requiring rationalisation of resources.

Published guidelines on the use of MRI in MS exist. While these guidelines provide comprehensive recommendations, they do not translate easily into different clinical settings and considerable variation in practice remains. Indeed, wide variations exist in the MRI acquisition protocols and timing of scanning, as well as in the reporting of images. This makes within-patient, as well as between-centre comparisons difficult, delaying diagnosis and affecting treatment decisions. This variability underlines the need for further direction on the implementation of published guidelines to harmonise practice through the development of standardised MRI protocols and reports in MS that are informative, yet feasible and adaptable to a range of clinical settings within the National Health Service (NHS).

Here we report the outcome of a workshop that brought together MS specialists geographically representing the UK NHS and with expertise in MRI and that identified clinically informative MRI protocols applicable in a variety of clinical settings, from district general hospitals to tertiary centres.

### The current role of MRI in differentiating multiple sclerosis from its imaging mimics [^a06aef49]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

MRI red flags proposed over a decade ago by the European Magnetic Resonance Network in MS (MAGNIMS) have guided clinicians in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). However, the past 10 years have seen increased recognition that vascular disease can coexist and possibly interact with MS, improvements in the reliability of ways to differentiate MS from novel antibody-mediated CNS disorders (such as anti-aquaporin-4 antibody and myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody-associated diseases) and advances in MRI techniques. In this Review, MAGNIMS updates the imaging features that differentiate the most common mimics of MS, particularly age-related cerebrovascular disease and neuromyelitis optica, from MS itself. We also provide a pragmatic summary of the clinically useful MRI features that distinguish MS from its mimics and discuss the future of nonconventional techniques that have identified promising disease-specific features.

### Evidence-based guidelines: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines on the use of MRI in multiple sclerosis – establishing disease prognosis and monitoring patients [^2671dd8d]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The role of MRI in the assessment of multiple sclerosis (MS) goes far beyond the diagnostic process. MRI techniques can be used as regular monitoring to help stage patients with MS and measure disease progression. MRI can also be used to measure lesion burden, thus providing useful information for the prediction of long-term disability. With the introduction of a new generation of immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of MS, MRI also makes an important contribution to the monitoring of treatment, and can be used to determine baseline tissue damage and detect subsequent repair. This use of MRI can help predict treatment response and assess the efficacy and safety of new therapies. In the second part of the MAGNIMS (Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS) network's guidelines on the use of MRI in MS, we focus on the implementation of this technique in prognostic and monitoring tasks. We present recommendations on how and when to use MRI for disease monitoring, and discuss some promising MRI approaches that may be introduced into clinical practice in the near future.

### Neuroimaging in multiple sclerosis: neurotherapeutic implications [^3362d3ae]. Neurotherapeutics (2011). Low credibility.

Imaging techniques, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), play an important role in the diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis (MS) and related demyelinating diseases. Findings on MRI studies of the brain and spinal cord are critical for MS diagnosis, are used to monitor treatment response and may aid in predicting disease progression in individual patients. In addition, results of imaging studies serve as essential biomarkers in clinical trials of putative MS therapies and have led to important insights into disease pathophysiology. Although they are useful tools and provide in vivo measures of disease-related activity, there are some important limitations of MRI findings in MS, including the non-specific nature of detectable white matter changes, the poor correlation with clinical disability, the limited sensitivity and ability of standard measures of gadolinium enhancing lesions and T2 lesions to predict future clinical course, and the lack of validated biomarkers of long term outcomes. Advancements that hold promise for the future include new techniques that are sensitive to diffuse changes, the increased use of higher field scanners, measures that capture disease related changes in gray matter, and the use of combined structural and functional imaging approaches to assess the complex and evolving disease process that occurs during the course of MS.

### Multiple sclerosis: clinical update and clinically-oriented radiologic reporting [^47c72e5a]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the nervous system. MR imaging findings play an integral part in establishing diagnostic hallmarks of the disease during initial diagnosis and evaluating disease status. Multiple iterations of diagnostic criteria and consensus guidelines are put forth by various expert groups incorporating imaging of the brain and spine, and efforts have been made to standardize imaging protocols for MS. Emerging ancillary imaging findings have also attracted increasing interests and should be sought for on radiologic examination. In this paper, the authors review the clinical guidelines and approach to imaging of MS and related disorders, focusing on clinically impactful image interpretation and MR imaging reporting.

### Diagnostic value of alternative techniques to gadolinium-based contrast agents in MR neuroimaging-a comprehensive overview [^b87d2bda]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Multiple sclerosis

Multiple sclerosis is the classical indication to use GBCA in neuroimaging. Contrast-enhanced MRI decreases time to diagnosis and helps to identify and characterize multiple sclerosis mimics at first clinical presentation. However, the presumption that all patients with multiple sclerosis should undergo contrast-enhanced MRI has started to change recently. Follow-up imaging of definite disease does not per se require GBCA administration, although GBCA can be used to re-evaluate the original diagnosis or as new baseline before therapeutic changes. Previous studies showed a modest correlation between contrast enhancement and clinical outcome. For example, the relapse rate is not influenced by MRI enhancement status when taking other covariates into account such as disease duration and the relapse is not predicted by the presence of gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI.

Furthermore, several studies have been able to predict contrast enhancement by analysis of non-contrast-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted images MRI with an AUC of 0.72–0.83, by quantification of fractional anisotropy from diffusion tensor imaging with an AUC of 0.93, and by texture analysis of T2-weighted images. Magnetization transfer ratio quantification can also differentiate between contrast-enhancing and non-contrast-enhancing lesions in patients with multiple sclerosis, likely representing the affection of the disease on the BBB integrity.

Non-contrast-enhanced MRI of T2 lesion load and cerebral atrophy show a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.74) with clinical status, and T2 lesion volume only has a moderate correlation with clinical disability at long term follow-up. Newer volumetric quantitative techniques have shown promise in assessing radiological disease status, but they still lack clear correlation to the clinical status of the patients. It can also be noted that patients presenting with multiple sclerosis are relatively young and subject to repeated examinations, which strengthens the case for reducing the use of GBCA in this patient group. Non-contrast-enhanced MRI seems to be able to replace contrast-enhanced MRI for longitudinal follow-up of patients but not at first presentation. Table 2 summarizes the diagnostic performance in the studies described above.

### Neuroinflammatory imaging biomarkers: relevance to multiple sclerosis and its therapy [^3ea5d160]. Neurotherapeutics (2013). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging is an established tool in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). Loss of blood brain barrier integrity assessed by gadolinium (Gd) enhancement is the current standard marker of MS activity. To explore the complex cascade of the inflammatory events, other magnetic resonance imaging, but also positron emission tomographic markers reviewed in this article are being developed to address active neuroinflammation with increased sensitivity and specificity. Alternative magnetic resonance contrast agents, positron emission tomographic tracers and imaging techniques could be more sensitive than Gd to early blood brain barrier alteration, and they could assess the inflammatory cell recruitment and/or the associated edema accumulation. These markers of active neuroinflammation, although some of them are limited to experimental studies, could find great relevance to complete Gd information and thereby increase our understanding of acute lesion pathophysiology and its noninvasive follow-up, especially to monitor treatment efficacy. Furthermore, such accurate markers of inflammation combined with those of neurodegeneration hold promise to provide a more complete picture of MS, which will be of great benefit for future therapeutic strategies.

We discuss the expanded role of MRI in the 2024 McDonald diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis, which include the optic nerve as a fifth anatomical location, in addition to the periventricular, juxtacortical or cortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord regions. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis can now be confirmed when the criteria of dissemination in space are fulfilled with the detection of typical lesions in at least four locations without additional evidence. We recommend appropriate imaging strategies and MRI acquisition protocols for all aspects of multiple sclerosis diagnosis, including fat-saturated sequences for detection of symptomatic optic nerve lesions. Diagnostic imaging should always cover the brain and spinal cord and include susceptibility-sensitive sequences for the assessment of the central vein sign and paramagnetic rim lesions, which can be especially helpful in cases when conventional imaging findings are insufficient to establish a diagnosis. We discuss how to handle the diagnosis of radiologically isolated presentations of multiple sclerosis, which are included in the 2024 criteria. We present recommendations for image interpretation and avoidance of misdiagnosis, and extend the recommendations to the use of MRI in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in older people, children, people with vascular comorbidities or migraine, and people living outside Europe and North America. Finally, we provide recommendations for standardisation of MRI acquisition and communication of results to enable an earlier diagnosis while maintaining high diagnostic specificity.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^09de4a33]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Focal white matter lesions, which are hyperintense on T 2 -weighted scans, are among the pathological hallmarks of multiple sclerosis, and MRI is formally included in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis. Current MRI criteria for multiple sclerosis are based on imaging features that are characteristic of the disease, but are not sufficiently specific. Over time, revisions of the multiple sclerosis diagnostic criteria have improved the sensitivity, particularly adding the capability to confirm the diagnosis at first clinical presentation.

However little attention has been given to describing the imaging features included in these criteria in detail, and guiding neurologists and neuroradiologists in correctly interpreting them. In patients with few lesions, there is a particularly increased risk of misdiagnosis based on MRI. We hope that the guidelines provided will minimize the risk of inappropriate image interpretation and increase the awareness of redflags.

As mentioned earlier, these criteria should only be used in the appropriate clinical context, when onset is characterized by clinical manifestations typical of multiple sclerosis.

Different scanners and field strengths, upgrades in equipment, and changes in acquisition parameters could influence lesion evaluations. However, although high-field MRI enables the detection of a higher number of white matter lesions in CIS and multiple sclerosis patients, field strength has been shown not to affect fulfilment of criteria for dissemination in space and time, also in a multicentre setting.

Accordingly, if MRI studies are performed on scanners with a minimum field strength of 1.5 T and the MRI protocols are standardized using appropriate sequences to obtain good quality images with adequate resolution, lesion assessment and longitudinal monitoring can be performed robustly and independently of these confounding factors.

In challenging situations (e.g. low numbers of lesions and with confounding comorbidities) both the specific characteristics of each individual lesion as well as the overall patterns of lesions (e.g. symmetric central lesion in the pons and deep white matter lesions in ischaemic small-vessel disease) should be taken into account to support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis or other conditions.

Emerging data suggest that advanced MRI sequences can enhance our ability to distinguish key, previously established characteristics of multiple sclerosis (e.g. cortical or perivenular lesions) that will enhance diagnosis because they are highly specific.

Although we focused the discussion on the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria framework, the technical developments, combined with recent discoveries about the links between lesion characteristics and multiple sclerosis pathogenesis, will likely drive future improvements to — and perhaps even rethinking of — current criteria.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to assessment of treatment response, EAN/ECTRIMS 2018 guidelines recommend to assess new or unequivocally enlarging T2 lesions as the preferred MRI method, supplemented by gadolinium-enhancing lesions, to monitor treatment response in patients treated with disease-modifying drugs. Evaluate these parameters by high-quality, standardized MRI and interpret by highly qualified readers with experience in MS.

### MRI in multiple sclerosis: an intra-individual, randomized and multicentric comparison of gadobutrol with gadoterate meglumine at 3 T [^473cb950]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare contrast effects of gadobutrol with gadoterate meglumine for brain MRI in multiple sclerosis (MS) in a multicentre, randomized, prospective, intraindividual study at 3 T.

Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained. Patients with known or suspected active MS lesions were included. Two identical MRIs were performed using randomized contrast agent order. Four post-contrast T1 sequences were acquired (start time points 0, 3, 6 and 9 min). If no enhancing lesion was present in first MRI, second MRI was cancelled. Quantitative (number and signal intensity of enhancing lesions) and qualitative parameters (time points of first and all lesions enhancing; subjective preference regarding contrast enhancement and lesion delineation; global preference) were evaluated blinded.

Results

Seventy-four patients (male, 26; mean age, 35 years) were enrolled in three centres. In 45 patients enhancing lesions were found. Number of enhancing lesions increased over time for both contrast agents without significant difference (median 2 for both). Lesions signal intensity was significantly higher for gadobutrol (p < 0.05 at time points 3, 6 and 9 min). Subjective preference rating showed non-significant tendency in favour of gadobutrol.

Conclusion

Both gadobutrol and gadoterate meglumine can be used for imaging of acute inflammatory MS lesions. However, gadobutrol generates higher lesion SI.

Key Points

Contrast-enhanced MRI plays a key role in the management of multiple sclerosis. Different gadolinium-based contrast agents are available. Number of visibly enhancing lesions increases over time after contrast injection. Gadobutrol and gadoterate meglumine do not differ in number of visible lesions. Gadobutrol generates higher signal intensity than gadoterate meglumine.

### Assessing the risk of early multiple sclerosis in patients with clinically isolated syndromes: the role of a follow up MRI [^e48fba86]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

With increasing evidence that permanent tissue damage occurs early in the course of multiple sclerosis, it is important that treatment trials include patients in the earliest stages of the disease. For many patients with multiple sclerosis the first presentation is a clinically isolated syndrome. Not all patients with a clinically isolated syndrome develop multiple sclerosis, however, and treatment of all such patients would be unwarranted. A single abnormal brain MRI identifies patients at a higher risk for the early development of multiple sclerosis, but current criteria are limited by either poor specificity (T2 lesions) or sensitivity (contrast enhancing lesions). The aim of the study was to assess the positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of MRI indices for the development of multiple sclerosis after 1 year from two MRI examinations obtained 3 months apart.

Methods

MRI examinations were performed in 68 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome, with a clinical assessment after 1 year.

Results

Contrast enhancing lesions at both time points were the most predictive indices for developing multiple sclerosis (positive predictive value 70%) but had low sensitivity (39%). The combination of T2 lesions at baseline with new T2 lesions at follow up had the best overall positive predictive value (53%), sensitivity (83%), and specificity (76%). In patients with T2 lesions at baseline, the presence or absence of new T2 lesions at follow up significantly altered the risk of multiple sclerosis within 1 year (55% and 5% respectively, p < 0.001). Multiple sclerosis also developed in 10% of patients with a normal baseline MRI.

Conclusions

Serial imaging in patients with clinically isolated syndromes improved the positive predictive value, sensitivity, and specificity of MRI for the development of early multiple sclerosis and also identified patients at a lower risk of early multiple sclerosis than would have been expected from their abnormal baseline MRI. Selection of patients with clinically isolated syndromes for therapeutic intervention or clinical trials may benefit from serial MRI, to target those at greatest risk of early development of multiple sclerosis.

### Diagnosis and management of multiple sclerosis: MRI in clinical practice [^b282122a]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis

When the suspicion of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or of MS is raised, both brain and spinal cord scans should be requested. As well as providing information regarding lesion dissemination in space, spinal cord MRI is also valuable for differential diagnosis, when uncertainty exists over the nature of brain lesions. Although currently not routinely performed, MRI scanning of the optic nerve is important in patients who present with symptoms of visual dysfunction to aid the diagnostic process.

The administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent (Gd) is important in the diagnostic workup to demonstrate dissemination in time of lesions. Therefore, it should be included in the diagnostic MRI protocol, when clinical suspicion of CIS or MS has been raised. Gd highlights focal inflammatory activity during the preceding weeks (typically 6–8 weeks) and thus aids earlier diagnosis. Post-contrast MRI scan is also useful for the purpose of differential diagnosis. Figure 2 offers indications of a minimum set of clinically informative MRI acquisitions that could be considered in a MRI protocol for MS diagnosis. Other sequences, e.g. 3D-T2✱echo-planar imaging (EPI) for central vein sign, double inversion recovery (DIR) for cortical lesions, phase-sensitive inversion-recovery (PSIR) for improved detection of spinal cord lesions and MR spectroscopy for atypically looking MS lesions (e.g. tumefactive lesions), may be also considered in addition, if possible and necessary. These sequences are more frequently adopted in specialist centres because they require longer acquisition time and physics expertise for standardisation.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^f9121dc8]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

In patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome, MRI can support and substitute clinical information in the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis by showing disease dissemination in space and time and by helping to exclude disorders that can mimic multiple sclerosis. MRI criteria were first included in the diagnostic work-up for multiple sclerosis in 2001, and since then several modifications to the criteria have been proposed in an attempt to simplify lesion-count models for showing disease dissemination in space, change the timing of MRI scanning to show dissemination in time, and increase the value of spinal cord imaging. Since the last update of these criteria, new data on the use of MRI to establish dissemination in space and time have become available, and MRI technology has improved. State-of-the-art MRI findings in these patients were discussed in a MAGNIMS workshop, the goal of which was to provide an evidence-based and expert-opinion consensus on proposed modifications to MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.

### Impact of post-contrast MRI in the definition of active multiple sclerosis [^8ea81d13]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

For multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes classification, the presence of "disease activity" can be defined by clinical relapses and/or by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions or new/enlarged T2 lesions. Recent MRI and pathology findings have demonstrated Gd deposition in the brain, suggesting to avoid Gd administration when dispensable. In this scenario, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of post-contrast MRIs to the definition of "active" MS phenotype.

Methods

We retrospectively selected 84 "active" relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients according to Lublin 2013, calculating both the number of Gd+ lesions not detectable as new/unequivocally enlarged on T2 images and the proportion of patients who would be still correctly classified as "active" without Gd administration.

Results

13 out of 164 (7.9%) Gd+ lesions did not correspond to a new/enlarged T2 lesion. Gd administration did not modify the classification of MS as "active" in 83 out of 84 subjects (98.8%).

Conclusion

The contribution of Gd+ lesions to the correct classification of RRMS patients as "active" is marginal, thus limiting the need of routine Gd administration for this scope. Further studies are warranted to support these conclusions.

### Assessment of lesions on magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis: practical guidelines [^444b6ed4]. Brain (2019). Medium credibility.

Smoldering/slowly evolving lesions

Pathological studies show that up to 57% of chronic multiple sclerosis lesions are active or mixed (active and inactive). These lesions may be characterized by a slow rate of increase in size and ongoing tissue loss and are more common in cases with long disease duration and progressive multiple sclerosis phenotypes and are termed smoldering or slowly evolving/expanding lesions. Pathologically, they are typified by a 'rim' of iron-laden microglia and/or macrophages with altered morphology, activated microglia and macrophages at the edge, few T cells, and slow rate of ongoing demyelination and axonal loss.

Recently, these slowly evolving lesions have been investigated in vivo with MRI. Susceptibility-based MRI identifies a hypointense rim in some white matter multiple sclerosis lesions that may reflect activity detected with pathology in the periphery of lesions. This rim can persist over years, although it can also gradually disappear, returning to contrast similar to normal-appearing white matter after some years.

This hypointense rim is characteristic of lesions showing significant enlargement over time, although expansion at the edge can be concurrent with volume loss within the lesion or no volume change.

Although T 2 * and phase images at high-field hold promise for identifying smoldering/slowly evolving lesions, at present there is no consensus about the best technique for use in vivo. A method based on the automatic detection of these lesions on conventional brain T 2 - and T 1 -weighted images has been proposed recently.

Interestingly, while slowly evolving lesions are common in multiple sclerosis, they are not found in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, or in cerebrovascular diseases.

Although the evaluation of a peripheral rim could be a promising characteristic to distinguish lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis from other conditions, its role in the diagnostic work-up of patients with clinically isolated syndromes is still unknown. Further research is required before integration into diagnostic criteria, including the assessment of sensitivity and specificity, standardizing the appropriate MRI protocols and establishing the corresponding guidelines.

### Interpreting therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis via MRI contrast enhancing lesions: now you see them, now you don't [^43fbbc05]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Gadolinium (Gd) enhancement of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions on MRI scans is a commonly used outcome measure in therapeutic trials. However, enhancement depends on MRI acquisition parameters that might significantly alter detectability. We investigated how the difference in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability threshold between MRI protocols affects lesion detection and apparent enhancement time using dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. We examined fourty-four relapsing-remitting MS patients with two MRI protocols: 'standard sensitivity' (SS) (1.5 T, single-dose Gd) and 'high sensitivity' (HS) (3 T, triple-dose Gd, delayed acquisition). Eleven patients had at least one enhancing lesion and completed the 1-month follow-up. We acquired DCE-MRI during the HS protocol and calculated BBB permeability. Sixty-five lesions were enhanced with the SS vs. 135 with the HS protocol. The detection threshold of the HS was significantly lower than that of the SS protocol (K trans = 2.64 vs. 4.00E-3 min(-1), p < 0.01). Most lesions (74%) were in the recovery phase; none were in the onset phase and 26% were at the peak of enhancement. The estimated duration of detectability with the HS protocol was significantly longer than for the SS protocol (6–12 weeks vs. 3 weeks). Our observations on the protocol-dependent threshold for detection and time-course help explain discrepancies in the observed effects of anti-inflammatory therapies on MS lesions.

### Gd contrast administration is dispensable in patients with MS without new T2 lesions on follow-up MRI [^64816ba9]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Gd contrast is currently administered routinely in follow-up investigations in patients with MS in both clinical practice and clinical trials. In general, Gd enhancement is interpreted as a hallmark of active inflammation within an MS plaque. There is evidence both on imaging and on histopathologic assessment that linear Gd contrast agents can accumulate in brain tissue, although no clinical correlates have been demonstrated so far. This led to the disapproval of linear Gd agents by the regulatory authorities. It is important to state that there is so far no evidence for possible clinical sequelae of Gd accumulation in the brain; however, debates are ongoing whether there should be changes in the imaging protocol of patients with MS.

Recently, there have been reports showing that macrocyclic Gd compounds might also accumulate in the brain, though to a lesser degree than linear agents. As with any other medical procedure, Gd administration should be driven by the "ALARA" (as low as reasonable achievable) principle.

### Three-tesla MRI does not improve the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: a multicenter study [^f74288e9]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Beyond high-field MRI, various aspects of MS lesion detection are also being evaluated on ultra-high-field MRI. It remains uncertain whether the benefit of a further improved signal-to-noise ratio and an increased resolution will be of clinical relevance. As to be expected, 7T increases the detection rate of T2 lesions, especially for cortical gray matter lesions. It remains to be evaluated if this will influence the fulfilment of the diagnostic criteria for MS in multicenter studies.

Taken together, even though there is a slightly increased detection of periventricular and (juxta)cortical lesions at 3T compared to 1.5T, this does not affect the diagnosis for patients with CIS suggestive of MS. Adding to this the similar performance in detection of spinal cord lesions and gadolinium-enhancing lesions, there is no real added clinical benefit in opting for either one of the field strengths. Altogether, 3T has no added value in the diagnostic workup of patients with CIS.

### Gd contrast administration is dispensable in patients with MS without new T2 lesions on follow-up MRI [^b4bd851c]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

MS is a chronic autoimmune disease of the CNS characterized by the formation of inflammatory plaques, neurodegeneration, and gliosis. The inflammatory attack leads to demyelination and neurodegeneration in the gray and white matter of the CNS. There is still no single diagnostic test for MS, but MRI is regarded as an essential tool for initial diagnosis, monitoring, and assessment of treatment efficacy of patients with MS. Gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agents (GBCA) are used as standard of care in clinical examinations and in MS trials. Gd enhancement shows blood-brain barrier disruption (BBB-D) indicating active inflammation of an MS lesion and is interpreted as a surrogate marker of active disease, often relevant for treatment decisions. Recently, there have been major safety concerns regarding linear GBCAs because Gd depositions were found in the brain after multiple injections of linear Gd agents. Thus, it is important to refine the usage of Gd contrast administration to better understand which MS lesions show Gd contrast enhancement and to further tailor Gd administration to situations where it alters clinical management.

The present study retrospectively investigates whether the routine administration of GBCAs is justified in all follow-up investigations as suggested in current guidelines. This seems especially relevant because in many follow-up investigations, no new T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) lesions are delineated. We analyzed the diagnostic value of the Gd administration in follow-up investigations, if no novel T2/FLAIR hyperintense lesions are found on precontrast scans. We assessed MRI investigations in a large cohort of patients to quantify disease activity on T2 and contrast-enhanced T1 imaging. We analyzed whether GBCA provided additional diagnostic benefit in the assessment of disease activity. We hypothesized that re-enhancement of a preexisting lesion ("lesion reactivation") is rare and that Gd administration might be dispensable if no new T2/FLAIR lesions are found.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^cfa510da]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord imaging

Based on the 2010 McDonald criteria, clinically silent spinal cord lesions can contribute to both DIS and DIT. At symptom onset, spinal cord imaging is recommended in patients with clinical features localized to the spinal cord to rule out alternative cord pathology (e.g. compression, spinal cord tumor, NMO, vasculitides) and in those with non-spinal CIS not fulfilling brain MRI for DIS. In this second group, whole cord imaging showed that the presence of one spinal cord lesion identifies patients at higher risk of MS confirmation. Imaging of the entire cord, using at least two MR sequences (e.g. T2 and STIR, T2 and DIR, T2 and post-contrast T1) is preferable to increase confidence in lesion identification, in part because approximately 40% of spinal cord lesions are found in the thoracolumbar region (Figure 2). – The value of spinal cord imaging for DIT in patients without accrual of deficits referable to the spine is limited, since new clinically silent cord lesions are not frequent.

In summary, whole spinal cord MRI is recommended to meet DIS criteria, whereas it has a limited role for DIT.

### Enabling new insights from old scans by repurposing clinical MRI archives for multiple sclerosis research [^c61af5b6]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling disease affecting over 2.8 million people worldwide, with a disproportionate impact on young populations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers are central to MS phase 2 and 3 clinical trials as primary and secondary efficacy endpoints. Typical imaging protocols include multi-contrast MRI scans to capture distinct aspects of disease evolution: new or enlarging lesions indicate active inflammation on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted images. In contrast, brain atrophy on T1-weighted images is a proxy for neurodegeneration. However, multi-contrast acquisitions are time-consuming, costly, and less available in the clinical setting. Simplifying MRI analysis, particularly through single-contrast brain volume calculations, can expand research opportunities from hospital archives, allowing analysis of previously acquired routine-care scans and potentially making clinical trials less costly by reducing the need for multi-contrast acquisitions.

Although routine MRI monitoring in MS care primarily tracks new or enlarging lesions, untapped potential lies in leveraging this readily available data also to assess brain atrophy, a key contributor to disability worsening often overlooked in standard clinical practice. Unlike the standardised MR acquisition protocols used in pharmaceutical clinical trials, archived routine clinical scans are more heterogeneous and present a major obstacle to the reliable, automated volumetry of brain structures and lesions. We aimed to develop a computationally efficient tool to process these highly heterogeneous scans independent of contrasts, resolutions, and qualities. Such a tool would extract key MRI biomarkers in diverse clinical settings, enable real-world research and pave the way for automatic analysis to aid clinical decision-making.

Recent advances in deep learning and generative models have enhanced our ability to analyse routine-care MRI scans. These advances include tools like SynthSeg and others, primarily focusing on brain segmentation after removing (or inpainting) lesions –. SAMSEG-lesion is a newly introduced model that robustly segments lesions and brain structures across MRI contrasts. A model named WMH-SynthSeg can segment white matter hyperintensities and brain anatomy simultaneously from scans of varying resolutions and contrasts, including low-field portable MRI. However, these tools were not developed or validated to assess treatment effects within the diverse and heterogeneous MS routine care data and clinical trials.

### Progressive multiple sclerosis: from pathogenic mechanisms to treatment [^6b81cc4e]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

During the past decades, better understanding of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis disease mechanisms have led to the development of several disease-modifying therapies, reducing relapse rates and severity, through immune system modulation or suppression. In contrast, current therapeutic options for progressive multiple sclerosis remain comparatively disappointing and challenging. One possible explanation is a lack of understanding of pathogenic mechanisms driving progressive multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, diagnosis is usually retrospective, based on history of gradual neurological worsening with or without occasional relapses, minor remissions or plateaus. In addition, imaging methods as well as biomarkers are not well established. Magnetic resonance imaging studies in progressive multiple sclerosis show decreased blood-brain barrier permeability, probably reflecting compartmentalization of inflammation behind a relatively intact blood-brain barrier. Interestingly, a spectrum of inflammatory cell types infiltrates the leptomeninges during subpial cortical demyelination. Indeed, recent magnetic resonance imaging studies show leptomeningeal contrast enhancement in subjects with progressive multiple sclerosis, possibly representing an in vivo marker of inflammation associated to subpial demyelination. Treatments for progressive disease depend on underlying mechanisms causing central nervous system damage. Immunity sheltered behind an intact blood-brain barrier, energy failure, and membrane channel dysfunction may be key processes in progressive disease. Interfering with these mechanisms may provide neuroprotection and prevent disability progression, while potentially restoring activity and conduction along damaged axons by repairing myelin. Although most previous clinical trials in progressive multiple sclerosis have yielded disappointing results, important lessons have been learnt, improving the design of novel ones. This review discusses mechanisms involved in progressive multiple sclerosis, correlations between histopathology and magnetic resonance imaging studies, along with possible new therapeutic approaches.

### Three-tesla MRI does not improve the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: a multicenter study [^73422e88]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

A tendency towards an increased detection rate of gadolinium-enhancing lesions was seen at 3T. An increased detection of enhancing lesions could be expected at 3T. As T1 relaxation times in brain tissue are increased by high field strength, the contrast between brain tissue and the T1-shortening effect of gadolinium is increased. This relatively increased T1 contrast between brain tissue and gadolinium enhancement makes enhancing lesions easier to detect. The relatively small number of enhancing lesions in this cohort could be an explanation for the difference in detection rate not reaching statistically significance.

Subsequent evaluation of the diagnostic criteria for MS did not result in a significant difference in patients with CIS classified as DIS or DIT between the 2 field strengths. This extends the findings from previous single-center studies, and indicates that, even though 3T slightly increases the detection rate of demyelinating lesions, high-field MRI does not allow a higher number of patients with CIS to be diagnosed with MS. Therefore, diagnostic scans for patients with CIS can be acquired at either 1.5T or 3T, provided protocols are well-optimized.

### New prospects for ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging in multiple sclerosis [^35fad8eb]. Investigative Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Besides its critical role in MS diagnosis, MRI also has a key role in therapeutic monitoring of MS upon initiation of disease-modifying therapy. The most commonly used treatment response measure is new or enlarging lesions on T2w MRI scans. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are another frequently used surrogate marker for clinical activity, but accumulation of new T2w lesions more sensitively gauges subclinical disease activity, especially when assessed using image subtraction. Finally, it is undisputed that brain and spinal cord atrophy can aid in monitoring disease activity, yet quantifying atrophy in the clinical setting is still at risk of substantial confounding factors caused by physiological (eg, diurnal brain size fluctuation, hydration state) or technical parameters (eg, acquisition protocols, gradient distortion, or intrascanner/interscanner variability) (reviewed in Sastre-Garriga et al).

Limitations of Multiple Sclerosis Magnetic Resonance Imaging at Clinical Field Strengths

Early MS treatment is associated with better long-term outcomes, making early diagnosis key for effective patient management. Yet the pressure to diagnose MS early frequently results in misdiagnosis, which can have serious health and financial consequences. Given this, it is noteworthy that the McDonald criteria do not address differentiating MS from other disorders. Instead, the focus of the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria optimizes sensitivity over specificity. In fact, several studies have found suboptimal specificity of the current McDonald criteria for MS diagnosis; these include a retrospective Chinese study including 93 CIS patients, which detected 75% sensitivity but only 47% specificity upon usage of the 2017 McDonald criteria, and a prospective Indian study comprising 82 CIS patients, which showed a specificity of 79%.

### EFNS guidelines on the use of neuroimaging in the management of multiple sclerosis [^146337e3]. European Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Magnetic resonance (MR)-based techniques are widely used for the assessment of patients with suspected and definite multiple sclerosis (MS). However, despite the publication of several position papers, which attempted to define the utility of MR techniques in the management of MS, their application in everyday clinical practice is still suboptimal. This is probably related, not only, to the fact that the majority of published guidelines focused on the optimization of MR technology in clinical trials, but also to the continuing development of modern, quantitative MR-based techniques, that have not as yet entered the clinical arena. The present report summarizes the conclusions of the 'EFNS Expert Panel of Neuroimaging of MS' on the application of conventional and non-conventional MR techniques to the clinical management of patients with MS. These guidelines are intended to assist in the use of conventional MRI for the diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring of patients with MS. In addition, they should provide a foundation for the development of more widespread but rational clinical applications of non-conventional MR-based techniques in studies of MS patients.

### Gadolinium and multiple sclerosis: vessels, barriers of the brain, and glymphatics [^5410bf09]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis is characterized by a cascade of pathobiologic events, ranging from focal lymphocytic infiltration and microglia activation to demyelination and axonal degeneration. MS has several of the hallmarks of an inflammatory autoimmune disorder, including breakdown of the BBB. Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging is currently the reference standard to detect active inflammatory lesions in MS. Knowledge of the patterns and mechanisms of contrast enhancement is vital to limit the radiologic differential diagnosis in the staging and evaluation of MS lesion activity. The aim of this review was the following: 1) to outline the pathophysiology of the effect of lymphocyte-driven inflammation in MS, 2) to describe the effects of gadolinium on the BBB and glymphatic system, and 3) to describe gadolinium enhancement patterns and artifacts that can mimic lesions in MS.

### MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines [^b1318fff]. The Lancet: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Summary

In patients presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can support and substitute clinical information for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis demonstrating disease dissemination in space (DIS) and time (DIT) and helping to rule out other conditions that can mimic MS. From their inclusion in the diagnostic work-up for MS in 2001, several modifications of MRI diagnostic criteria have been proposed, in the attempt to simplify lesion-count models for demonstrating DIS, change the timing of MRI scanning for demonstrating DIT, and increase the value of spinal cord imaging.

Since the last update of these criteria, new data regarding the application of MRI for demonstrating DIS and DIT have become available and improvement in MRI technology has occurred. State-of-the-art MRI findings in these patients were discussed in a MAGNIMS workshop, the goal of which was to provide an evidence-based and expert-opinion consensus on diagnostic MRI criteria modifications.

### An update on neuroimaging of multiple sclerosis [^59eba87c]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The advent of magnetic resonance imaging provided a powerful tool for monitoring the dynamics of pathological changes in multiple sclerosis, but conventional approaches offer only limited information that is directly relevant to clinical progression. Continued developments of imaging methods and their use for diagnosis, monitoring pathology and understanding disease progression are reviewed here.

Recent Findings

Magnetic resonance imaging is now well established as a clinical test for multiple sclerosis, but the specific ways in which imaging information should best be incorporated into diagnostic criteria are still debated. New data defining the substantial pathology in grey matter, regional variation in the progression of pathology and the relationship between the spatial distribution of pathological changes and symptoms are providing an increasingly compelling description of changes relevant to disability. Molecular-imaging approaches promise much more detailed descriptions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, which suggests that adaptive functional changes could limit clinical expression of pathology, are providing further clues to the link between measures of pathology and disability.

Summary

New data further reinforce the view that pathology relevant to clinical progression of multiple sclerosis can be defined by imaging. A range of biologically more specific markers are becoming available using positron emission tomography, as well as magnetic resonance imaging.

### Multiple sclerosis imaging in clinical practice: a European-wide survey of 428 centers and conclusions by the ESNR working group [^67f9187d]. European Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate compliance with the available recommendations, we assessed the current clinical practice of imaging in the evaluation of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Methods

An online questionnaire was emailed to all members and affiliates. Information was gathered on applied MR imaging protocols, gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) use and image analysis. We compared the survey results with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS (MAGNIMS) recommendations considered as the reference standard.

Results

A total of 428 entries were received from 44 countries. Of these, 82% of responders were neuroradiologists. 55% performed more than ten scans per week for MS imaging. The systematic use of 3 T is rare (18%). Over 90% follow specific protocol recommendations with 3D FLAIR, T2-weighted and DWI being the most frequently used sequences. Over 50% use SWI at initial diagnosis and 3D gradient-echo T1-weighted imaging is the most used MRI sequence for pre- and post-contrast imaging. Mismatches with recommendations were identified including the use of only one sagittal T2-weighted sequence for spinal cord imaging, the systematic use of GBCA at follow-up (over 30% of institutions), a delay time shorter than 5 min after GBCA administration (25%) and an inadequate follow-up duration in pediatric acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (80%). There is scarce use of automated software to compare images or to assess atrophy (13% and 7%). The proportions do not differ significantly between academic and non-academic institutions.

Conclusions

While current practice in MS imaging is rather homogeneous across Europe, our survey suggests that recommendations are only partially followed.

Clinical Relevance Statement

Hurdles were identified, mainly in the areas of GBCA use, spinal cord imaging, underuse of specific MRI sequences and monitoring strategies. This work will help radiologists to identify the mismatches between their own practices and the recommendations and act upon them.

Key Points

- While current practice in MS imaging is rather homogeneous across Europe, our survey suggests that available recommendations are only partially followed.
- Several hurdles have been identified through the survey that mainly lies in the areas of GBCA use, spinal cord imaging, underuse of specific MRI sequences and monitoring strategies.

### Three-tesla MRI does not improve the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: a multicenter study [^9c1b95b4]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Previously we reported an interim analysis on interobserver agreement on lesion detection in a subset of the then ongoing prospective CIS project. We now present the full follow-up of the whole cohort.

Participants

For this study, we recruited participants from 6 different MS centers from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis (MAGNIMS) network between July 2013 and September 2015.

Inclusion criteria were defined as follows: (1) for patients only: CIS suggestive of MS as defined by the International Panel on MS diagnosis; (2) for patients only: baseline visit within 6 months after the first onset of clinical symptoms suggestive of demyelination; (3) age at baseline between 18 and 59 years; (4) no medical history of other immunologic disease, malignancy, or vascular pathology; (5) no known claustrophobia or allergy to a gadolinium-based contrast agent.

For the patients with CIS, the study protocol comprised 3 visits: baseline, first follow-up at 3–6 months, and a second follow-up at 12–15 months. Besides MRI, at all 3 time points a medical history was taken and a trained physician assessed the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Information on oligoclonal band status was not available. In case of conversion to clinically definite MS during follow-up (i.e. the occurrence of a second clinical relapse, diagnosed by the treating neurologist) or fulfillment of the radiologic criteria for the diagnosis of MS, patients were excluded from further imaging. Healthy controls only underwent the baseline visit, as no clinical or radiologic changes were to be expected.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consent

Each local institutional review board approved the study and all participants gave written informed consent prior to the first study activity.

### Recommendations to improve imaging and analysis of brain lesion load and atrophy in longitudinal studies of multiple sclerosis [^e1472095]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Focal lesions and brain atrophy are the most extensively studied aspects of multiple sclerosis (MS), but the image acquisition and analysis techniques used can be further improved, especially those for studying within-patient changes of lesion load and atrophy longitudinally. Improved accuracy and sensitivity will reduce the numbers of patients required to detect a given treatment effect in a trial, and ultimately, will allow reliable characterization of individual patients for personalized treatment. Based on open issues in the field of MS research, and the current state of the art in magnetic resonance image analysis methods for assessing brain lesion load and atrophy, this paper makes recommendations to improve these measures for longitudinal studies of MS. Briefly, they are (1) images should be acquired using 3D pulse sequences, with near-isotropic spatial resolution and multiple image contrasts to allow more comprehensive analyses of lesion load and atrophy, across timepoints. Image artifacts need special attention given their effects on image analysis results. (2) Automated image segmentation methods integrating the assessment of lesion load and atrophy are desirable. (3) A standard dataset with benchmark results should be set up to facilitate development, calibration, and objective evaluation of image analysis methods for MS.

General considerations when using MRI for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis

There are general considerations when applying the MRI aspects of the 2017 revision of the McDonald criteria in the diagnostic work-up of patients with suspected multiple sclerosis:
The clinical syndrome should be typical of demyelination.
The criteria should be applied to adult patients (between 18 and 50 years); however, they also perform well in identifying paediatric patients with multiple sclerosis from those suffering from monophasic demyelination, although special care is needed in patients under 11 years. In paediatric cases, the presence of at least one black hole (a hypointense lesion on T 1 -weighted sequence) and at least one periventricular lesion at baseline contribute to distinguish children with multiple sclerosis from those with monophasic demyelination. For a comprehensive review of multiple sclerosis differential diagnosis in pediatric population, which is beyond the scope of this review, see.
In patients older than 50 years or with vascular risk factors, more stringent criteria should be considered [e.g. a higher number of periventricular lesions (abutting the lateral ventricles, see below for details)].
MRI studies should be of adequate quality, with few artefacts and performed on scanners with a minimum field strength of 1.5 T. Using 3D acquisitions or 2D with 3-mm thick slices and no gap between slices (see; for MRI protocols proposed and Table 1 for sequence suggestions) will increase diagnostic yield.
Key MRI sequences include T 2 -weighted and T 1 pre- and post-gadolinium images of the brain and the spinal cord (Table 1).
Multiple sclerosis lesions can occur anywhere in the CNS, and thus MRI of the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine should be considered in patients with symptoms referable to these locations, and for detecting subclinical lesions (particularly in the spinal cord). Indeed, spinal cord assessment can be helpful in establishing dissemination in space when brain MRI findings are not conclusive and might provide significant prognostic information.
Fat-suppressed MRIs of the optic nerves should be considered especially in atypical cases to rule out possible alternative diagnoses.
Lesions should be confirmed on multiple planes to avoid false positive findings due to artefacts and false negative results (Table 1). The acquisition of 3D sequences [e.g. T 2 -fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T 2 -FLAIR)] can allow multi-planar reconstruction, whilst, especially for 2D acquisitions, a second imaging sequence on a different plane (e.g. sagittal) should be acquired.
Serial imaging can support the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, given that multiple sclerosis is characterized by the accrual of lesions over time and in new areas of the CNS.
Interpretation of the MRI scans should be performed by trained (neuro)radiologists or clinicians deeply familiar with the features of multiple sclerosis and disorders considered in the differential diagnosis.
T 2 lesions can increase, decrease or stabilize in size over time; more rarely, small lesions completely disappear.
The pattern of gadolinium-enhancement in multiple sclerosis lesions is variable but almost always transient (2–8 weeks, although typically < 4 weeks).
For the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, there should be at least one typical multiple sclerosis lesion in at least two characteristic regions [periventricular (abutting the lateral ventricles), juxtacortical/cortical, infratentorial, spinal cord] to support dissemination in space.
Brain white matter lesions are common in patients with comorbid vascular disease or migraine, as well as healthy adult subjects, and as non-specific small, rounded deep white matter lesions sparing the periventricular zone and U-fibres can also contribute to some of the lesion burden present on imaging. Currently, it is rarely possible to distinguish whether individual lesions are attributable to demyelination or to a comorbidity.
Especially for patients with a small number of lesions, individual lesion characteristics (size, ovoid shape, orientation perpendicular to ventricles, T 1 hypointensity, pattern of enhancement) are important in determining whether they are characteristic of multiple sclerosis; for patients with a large number of lesions, the distribution (periventricular predilection, combinations of brain and cord lesions, etc.) is more relevant.

### Enabling new insights from old scans by repurposing clinical MRI archives for multiple sclerosis research [^1bd613f1]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers are vital for multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical research and trials but quantifying them requires multi-contrast protocols and limits the use of abundant single-contrast hospital archives. We developed MindGlide, a deep learning model to extract brain region and white matter lesion volumes from any single MRI contrast. We trained MindGlide on 4247 brain MRI scans from 2934 MS patients across 592 scanners, and externally validated it using 14,952 scans from 1,001 patients in two clinical trials (primary-progressive MS and secondary-progressive MS trials) and a routine-care MS dataset. The model outperformed two state-of-the-art models when tested against expert-labelled lesion volumes. In clinical trials, MindGlide detected treatment effects on T2-lesion accrual and cortical and deep grey matter volume loss. In routine-care data, T2-lesion volume increased with moderate-efficacy treatment but remained stable with high-efficacy treatment. MindGlide uniquely enables quantitative analysis of archival single-contrast MRIs, unlocking insights from untapped hospital datasets.

### Comparison of unenhanced and gadolinium-enhanced imaging in multiple sclerosis: is contrast needed for routine follow-up MRI? [^e0a4d66e]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Gadolinium enhanced MRI is routinely used for follow-up of patients with multiple sclerosis. Our aim was to evaluate whether enhancing multiple sclerosis lesions on follow-up MR imaging can be detected by visual assessment of unenhanced double inversion recovery and FLAIR sequences.

Materials and Methods

A total of 252 consecutive MRIs in 172 adult patients with a known diagnosis of multiple sclerosis were reviewed. The co-presence or absence of associated double inversion recovery and FLAIR signal abnormality within contrast-enhancing lesions was recorded by 3 neuroradiologists. In a subset of patients with prior comparisons, the number of progressive lesions on each of the 3 sequences was assessed.

Results

A total of 34 of 252 MRIs (13%) demonstrated 55 enhancing lesions, of which 52 (95%) had corresponding hyperintensity on double inversion recovery and FLAIR. All lesions were concordant between double inversion recovery and FLAIR, and the 3 enhancing lesions not visible on either sequence were small (< 2mm) and cortical/subcortical (n = 2) or periventricular (n = 1). A total of 17 (22%) of the 76 MRIs with a prior comparison had imaging evidence of disease progression: Ten (59%) of these showed new lesions on double inversion recovery or FLAIR only, 6 (35%) showed progression on all sequences, and 1 (6%) was detectable only on postcontrast T1, being located in a region of confluent double inversion recovery and FLAIR abnormality.

Conclusions

There was a high concordance between enhancing lesions and hyperintensity on either double inversion recovery or FLAIR. Serial follow-up using double inversion recovery or FLAIR alone may capture most imaging progression, but isolated enhancing lesions in confluent areas of white matter abnormality could present a pitfall for this approach.

Regarding medical management for multiple sclerosis, more specifically with respect to disease-modifying therapies, discontinuation, AAN 2018 guidelines recommend to assess the likelihood of future relapse in patients with secondary progressive MS by assessing patient age, disease duration, relapse history, and MRI-detected activity (such as frequency, severity, time since most recent relapse or gadolinium-enhanced lesion).

### Outcome measures assisting treatment optimization in multiple sclerosis [^e95d310f]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurologic disease with a varied presentation, and diagnosis is made clinically. Once diagnosed, the type and speed of symptom progression in MS vary, making the clinician's job of assessing disease evolution and treatment responses a perpetual challenge.

Multiple outcome measures, or tools, have been developed for use in MS research and clinical management of persons with MS (pwMS). Such tools have been designed to help determine the progression and severity of disease, including inflammatory activity [clinical relapses or new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions] and neurodegeneration (progression in absence of relapses). These tools are also used to identify evidence of a response to treatment. To ensure effective use, the practicing clinician must first gain an understanding of the benefits and downsides of each tool to determine whether to incorporate it into a patient's evaluation and therapeutic decisions. If the tool is to be incorporated, the clinician must then consider how to effectively implement it and interpret the results. Currently, only a few of the tools in existence are commonly used in research and patient management.

Here we provide an overview of tools that can be used to evaluate the functional (Table 1) and neuroanatomical (Table 2) components of MS, highlighting new data on potential MS biomarkers and how they may be utilized by clinicians in the future. Some patient-reported outcome tools are presented in Table 3 for reference, but they are not detailed in this review. Our aim is to enable clinicians to more accurately assess stability or progression in pwMS and to guide treatment optimization, even in subclinical progression.

Gadolinium-enhancing lesions

Gadolinium enhancement plays an important role in the evaluation of patients suspected of multiple sclerosis. Safety concerns regarding gadolinium administration and its tendency to accumulate in the brain can be mitigated by the use of macrocyclic rather than linear agents and by controlling the frequency of administration at follow-up. It can support dissemination in time when it occurs in some lesions but not others at the time of initial presentation with a demyelinating syndrome. Enhancement in new inflammatory demyelinating lesions is a short-lived feature (typically 2–8 weeks, although typically < 4 weeks) in most cases, thus generally differentiating recent from older lesions. Lesions that enhance for longer than 3 months are exceptional and should raise the possibility of alternative pathology, including sarcoidosis or vascular abnormality such as developmental venous anomaly or capillary telangiectasia (which can be confirmed using susceptibility-weighted imaging).

An enhancing lesion is defined as an area of at least 3 mm with a clear area of hyperintensity on T 1 -weighted images obtained at least 5 min after contrast agent administration (Fig. 5 and Table 2). They are best appreciated on moderately T 1 -weighted spin-echo or gradient-echo images but are more difficult to detect on heavily T 1 -weighted images (such as MPRAGE or PSIR) due to the higher background white matter signal. Although definitive assessment of signal enhancement requires pre-contrast images, spontaneous T 1 -hyperintensity (e.g. with calcification, haemorrhage, melanin) is very rare in multiple sclerosis lesions. However, as this might be observed in the presence of lipid- and iron-laden microglia/macrophages, a pre-contrast T 1 weighted sequence can help to discriminate this cause of T 1 hyperintensity from true contrast-enhancement. Gadolinium enhancement should be confirmed by a corresponding abnormality on T 2 or T 2 -FLAIR images, and if absent, more likely represents flow artefact from nearby vessels or a capillary telangiectasia.

### Three-tesla MRI does not improve the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: a multicenter study [^b84d0c3e]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

MRI protocols

MRI examinations were performed for all participants at both 1.5T and 3T at all 3 visits. For each time point, the scan interval between the different field strengths was less than 72 hours. The scanning measures were based on local optimized acquisition protocols and in accordance with the MAGNIMS guidelines. Acquisition measures were comparable between field strengths. A detailed description of the acquisition protocols for the different vendors has previously been described. In brief, at both field strengths isotropic 3D T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, axial 3 mm T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and proton density (PD), and if available double inversion recovery brain imaging was performed at all time points. Patients received postcontrast T1 spin-echo at baseline only. Spinal cord imaging was performed for all participants at baseline only and consisted of sagittal 3 mm T1WI, T2WI, and PD sequences. For patients only, spinal cord imaging was performed after administration of a single dose of gadolinium-based contrast agent.

Future perspectives

The Panel also noted that some promising measures deserve further investigation before being moved (or not) to diagnostic criteria in the future.

Concerning the identification of the central vein, what remains to be done is the standardization of sequences capable of showing these features on 3.0 and 1.5 tesla scanners, as well as the creation of standardized definitions for identification of central vessels. To date, central vessels have been if they (1) could be visualized in at least 2 perpendicular planes, (2) appeared linear in at least one plane, and (3) were completely surrounded by hyperintense signal in at least one plane (Figure 4). Whether central veins are indeed confirmatory for MS lesions requires further study with appropriate disease comparisons.

Concerning the identification of the hypointense lesional rim on T2✱-weighted magnitude and/or phase images, what remains to be done is the performance of longitudinal studies at both 3.0 and 7.0 tesla; the clinical implementation and standardization of MR sequences among different vendors at 3.0 tesla; the analysis of the value in predicting conversion to MS and disability progression in CIS patients; the study of different MS clinical phenotypes and other neurological conditions that can mimic MS.

Concerning the identification of cortical pathology, higher field-strength imaging is expected to identify CLs more reliably than conventional MRI but is not likely to be available in clinical practice in the near term. More advanced techniques for CL identification at 3.0 tesla may prove valuable in MS diagnosis. The definition of standardized, up-to-date guidelines for CL classification is also pending.

### Use of magnetic resonance imaging to visualize leptomeningeal inflammation in patients with multiple sclerosis: a review [^065451a3]. JAMA Neurology (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system traditionally characterized by an initial relapsing-remitting clinical course and focal inflammatory lesions that have a predilection for the periventricular white matter. Recently, however, histopathologic and imaging studies have illustrated a more complex pathologic substrate involving cortical demyelination, gray matter atrophy, and meningeal inflammation. Neuroimaging advances have facilitated improved detection of cortical pathology, but our understanding of the pathogenesis of cortical disease remains incomplete. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current status and future prospects regarding the emerging role of magnetic resonance imaging to visualize leptomeningeal enhancement in patients with MS and place these findings in the proper pathobiologic and clinical context.

Observations

Cortical atrophy and demyelination along the subpial surface appear early in the disease course in patients with MS but accelerate in progressive stages. Histopathologic studies of patients have shown the presence of inflammatory infiltrates, in some cases with features of B cell-rich tertiary lymph follicles, along the cortical meningeal surface. Recent magnetic resonance imaging data demonstrate the ability to detect such inflammation using high-resolution gadolinium-enhanced contrast scans by the presence of leptomeningeal enhancement. Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging correlation studies indicate that leptomeningeal enhancement is most common in patients with progressive forms of MS and shows a relationship to subpial cortical lesions and cortical atrophy.

Conclusions and Relevance

A growing body of evidence suggests that gray matter demyelination, cortical atrophy, and leptomeningeal inflammation may be important components of progressive MS pathology and provide a new therapeutic target. Leptomeningeal enhancement may prove a useful surrogate marker for such pathology, perhaps improving our understanding of the natural history of progressive MS, although its ultimate effect on therapeutic development and clinical care requires further study.

### Revised recommendations of the consortium of MS centers task force for a standardized MRI protocol and clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and follow-up of multiple sclerosis [^bb14681b]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

An international group of neurologists and radiologists developed revised guidelines for standardized brain and spinal cord MR imaging for the diagnosis and follow-up of MS. A brain MR imaging with gadolinium is recommended for the diagnosis of MS. A spinal cord MR imaging is recommended if the brain MR imaging is nondiagnostic or if the presenting symptoms are at the level of the spinal cord. A follow-up brain MR imaging with gadolinium is recommended to demonstrate dissemination in time and ongoing clinically silent disease activity while on treatment, to evaluate unexpected clinical worsening, to re-assess the original diagnosis, and as a new baseline before starting or modifying therapy. A routine brain MR imaging should be considered every 6 months to 2 years for all patients with relapsing MS. The brain MR imaging protocol includes 3D T1-weighted, 3D T2-FLAIR, 3D T2-weighted, post-single-dose gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted sequences, and a DWI sequence. The progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy surveillance protocol includes FLAIR and DWI sequences only. The spinal cord MR imaging protocol includes sagittal T1-weighted and proton attenuation, STIR or phase-sensitive inversion recovery, axial T2- or T2✱-weighted imaging through suspicious lesions, and, in some cases, postcontrast gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted imaging. The clinical question being addressed should be provided in the requisition for the MR imaging. The radiology report should be descriptive, with results referenced to previous studies. MR imaging studies should be permanently retained and available. The current revision incorporates new clinical information and imaging techniques that have become more available.

### The role of non-conventional MR techniques to study multiple sclerosis patients [^3cccd676]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lacks pathological specificity to the heterogeneous substrates of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and is not able to detect subtle, disease-related changes in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM). As a consequence, the correlation between MRI findings and the long-term evolution of MS is moderate at best. To overcome the limitations of conventional MRI, new quantitative magnetic resonance (MR) techniques, such as cell-specific imaging, magnetization transfer imaging (MTI), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and functional MR imaging (fMRI) have all been recently applied to the study of MS. These techniques should provide more accurate and pathologically specific estimates of the MS lesion burden than conventional MR and should improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to MS-related irreversible disability.

### Quantitative neuroimaging measures of myelin in the healthy brain and in multiple sclerosis [^fe8b794f]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques that are used as markers of white matter (WM) and myelin content include magnetic resonance relaxation‐based and magnetization transfer‐based methods. Both approaches provide WM contrast related to myelin, but are predicated on different assumptions and models, and may not directly correspond to each other (Alexander et al. 2011; De Santis, Drakesmith, Bells, Assaf, & Jones, 2014). Diseases of WM, and multiple sclerosis (MS) in particular have motivated the search for quantitative and specific MRI measures of myelin content as measures of treatment response and remission (Filippi et al. 2012). Although conventional clinical MRI protocols for monitoring MS include qualitative T 1 and T 2 weighted images, these lack specificity to the underlying pathology and are difficult to compare across imaging sites and scanners (Barkhof, Calabresi, Miller, & Reingold, 2009). Quantitative MRI can supplement standard clinical imaging by providing detection of changes within normal appearing tissue, as well as biological characterization of these alterations (MacKay and Laule, 2016 2016).

MRI criteria for the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: MAGNIMS consensus guidelines

Many patients who present with clinical syndromes typical of inflammatory-demyelination in the CNS are found to have subclinical lesions on MRI scans. The detection of subclinical brain or cord lesions with typical morphology predicts a higher risk of subsequent conversion to MS. Indeed, since 2001 the diagnostic criteria of MS have permitted MR imaging to confirm the diagnosis of MS, either at baseline or after an interval in an individual with a typical clinical syndrome. The MR imaging criteria stipulate the conditions in which the requirements for dissemination of demyelination in space and time can be made in those who have experienced a single clinical attack or a progressive course from onset.

This paper describes the most recent refinement of the MR criteria used to define MS, based on the most contemporary imaging data and techniques. The guidelines are based on the findings of an international workshop, held in March 2015 under the auspices of MAGNIMS (a European collaborative research network that studies the use of MRI in MS). Recommendations are based on both expert opinion and literature review.

The main changes to existing MRI criteria relate to the definition of dissemination in space. The new criteria propose that the optic nerve is incorporated as one of five lesion locations (along with periventricular, infratentorial, cortical/juxtacortical and spinal cord) that can be used to define dissemination in space. The presence of lesions in two out of these five areas is deemed sufficient evidence to define dissemination in space. In all except the periventricular region, only one lesion is required to be present. These most recent guidelines suggest that at least three periventricular lesions should be required to establish dissemination in space at this location, in view of the low specificity of a solitary periventricular lesion. No distinction is required between lesions considered to be symptomatic or asymptomatic.

The criteria for dissemination in time remain unchanged: the detection of either one new T2 lesion or one new gadolinium-enhancing lesion after any interval, or the coexistence of enhancing and non-enhancing lesions at any time. In these new recommendations, interval spinal cord imaging is not recommended in asymptomatic individuals for clarification about dissemination in time as clinically silent cord lesions are recognised to be rare.

### Sodium MRI of multiple sclerosis [^e9d50484]. NMR in Biomedicine (2016). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of non-traumatic disability in young adults. The mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration and disease progression are poorly understood, in part as a result of the lack of non-invasive methods to measure and monitor neurodegeneration in vivo. Sodium MRI is a topic of increasing interest in MS research as it allows the metabolic characterization of brain tissue in vivo, and integration with the structural information provided by (1)H MRI, helping in the exploration of pathogenetic mechanisms and possibly offering insights into disease progression and monitoring of treatment outcomes. We present an up-to-date review of the sodium MRI application in MS organized into four main sections: (i) biological and pathogenetic role of sodium; (ii) brief overview of sodium imaging techniques; (iii) results of sodium MRI application in clinical studies; and (iv) future perspectives.

### Contrast-enhanced 3D spin echo T1-weighted sequence outperforms 3D gradient echo T1-weighted sequence for the detection of multiple sclerosis lesions on 3.0 T brain MRI [^f2cc3fb9]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Using reliable contrast-enhanced T1 sequences is crucial to detect enhancing brain lesions for multiple sclerosis (MS) at the time of diagnosis and over follow-up. Contrast-enhanced 3D gradient-recalled echo (GRE) T1-weighted imaging (WI) and 3D turbo spin echo (TSE) T1-WI are both available for clinical practice and have never been compared within the context of this diagnosis.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to compare contrast-enhanced 3D GRE T1-WI and 3D TSE T1-WI for the detection of enhancing lesions in the brains of MS patients.

Methods

This single-center prospective study enrolled patients with MS who underwent a 3.0 T brain MRI from August 2017 to April 2021 for follow-up. Contrast-enhanced 3D GRE T1-WI and 3D TSE T1-WI were acquired in randomized order. Two independent radiologists blinded to all data reported all contrast-enhanced lesions in each sequence. Their readings were compared with a reference standard established by a third expert neuroradiologist. Interobserver agreement, contrast ratio, and contrast-to-noise ratio were calculated for both sequences.

Results

A total of 158 MS patients were included (mean age, 40 ± 11 years; 95 women). Significantly more patients had at least 1 contrast-enhanced lesion on 3D TSE T1-WI than on 3D GRE T1-WI for both readers (61/158 [38.6%] vs 48/158 [30.4%] and 60/158 [38.6%] vs 47/158 [29.7%], P < 0.001). Significantly more contrast-enhanced lesions per patient were detected on 3D TSE T1-WI (mean 2.47 vs 1.56 and 2.56 vs 1.39, respectively, P < 0.001). Interobserver agreement was excellent for both sequences, κ = 0.96 (confidence interval [CI] 0.91–1.00) for 3D TSE T1-WI and 0.92 (CI, 0.86–0.99) for 3D GRE T1-WI. Contrast ratio and contrast-to-noise ratio were significantly higher on 3D TSE T1-WI (0.84 vs 0.53, P < 0.001, and 87.9 vs 57.8, P = 0.03, respectively).

Conclusions

At 3.0 T, contrast-enhanced 3D TSE-T1-WI supports the detection of significantly more enhancing lesions than 3D GRE T1-WI and should therefore be used for MS patients requiring contrast-enhanced examination.

### Advances in multiple sclerosis and its variants: conventional and newer imaging techniques [^de86b8c9]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) and its variants are inflammatory as well as neurodegenerative diseases that diffusely affect the central nervous system (CNS). There is a poor correlation between traditional imaging findings and symptoms in patients with MS. Current research in conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of MS and related diseases includes optimization of hardware and pulse sequences and the development of automated and semiautomated techniques to measure and quantify disease burden. Advanced nonconventional MR techniques such as diffusion tensor and functional MR imaging probe the changes found in the CNS, and correlate these findings with clinical measures of disease.

### Gd contrast administration is dispensable in patients with MS without new T2 lesions on follow-up MRI [^54dab986]. Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Our study shows that in the vast majority of follow-up MRI investigations of patients with MS without new symptoms or new T2 lesions, Gd administration does not increase the diagnostic yield. This does, however, not apply to the time of initial diagnosis or when new MS symptoms are present. Here, Gd enhancement constitutes an important factor for swift therapy induction or escalating therapy. Also, Gd enhancement can help in pharmacovigilance such as monitoring progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. However, it is not clear what the relevance of enhancement in the absence of a new T2 lesion is. We observed that the additionally identified enhancing lesions where T1CE exhibits higher sensitivity than T2/FLAIR were rare (< 2%). Overall, the probability to miss active lesions in patients with low disease activity and without new lesions seems negligible. However, in heavily affected patients with a high lesion load, it seems unlikely that missing small contrast-enhancing lesions truly makes a difference for treatment decisions. Blood-brain barrier disruption without T2 progress is rare (∼1.7%), and even in these rare cases, the therapeutic relevance of isolated CE lesions seems questionable. Also, it is not entirely clear how contrast enhancement without T2 correlate can be explained. Most likely, this might constitute a developing "early lesion" that shows already BBB-D but so far no edema. Reactivation is an interesting pathophysiologic concept that might indicate secondary fueling of a preexisting lesion. Also, it is conceivable that the different lesion types, evident on neuropathologic assessment (active, inactive, and smoldering MS plaques), might have different Gd-uptake properties over time.

### Quantitative MRI for analysis of active multiple sclerosis lesions without gadolinium-based contrast agent [^eb0fb2ea]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Contrast-enhancing MS lesions are important markers of active inflammation in the diagnostic work-up of MS and in disease monitoring with MR imaging. Because intravenous contrast agents involve an expense and a potential risk of adverse events, it would be desirable to identify active lesions without using a contrast agent. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether pre-contrast injection tissue-relaxation rates and proton density of MS lesions, by using a new quantitative MR imaging sequence, can identify active lesions.

Materials and Methods

Forty-four patients with a clinical suspicion of MS were studied. MR imaging with a standard clinical MS protocol and a quantitative MR imaging sequence was performed at inclusion (baseline) and after 1 year. ROIs were placed in MS lesions, classified as nonenhancing or enhancing. Longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates, as well as proton density were obtained from the quantitative MR imaging sequence. Statistical analyses of ROI values were performed by using a mixed linear model, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic analysis.

Results

Enhancing lesions had a significantly (P < .001) higher mean longitudinal relaxation rate (1.22 ± 0.36 versus 0.89 ± 0.24), a higher mean transverse relaxation rate (9.8 ± 2.6 versus 7.4 ± 1.9), and a lower mean proton density (77 ± 11.2 versus 90 ± 8.4) than nonenhancing lesions. An area under the receiver operating characteristic curve value of 0.832 was obtained.

Conclusions

Contrast-enhancing MS lesions often have proton density and relaxation times that differ from those in nonenhancing lesions, with lower proton density and shorter relaxation times in enhancing lesions compared with nonenhancing lesions.

MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING AT 7 T

Advantages of 7-T Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Multiple Sclerosis

Magnetic resonance imaging at a static magnetic field strength of 3 T was clinically introduced in the early 2000s. These scanners are equipped with a platform of multichannel receive coils dedicated for various clinical questions. With this, they are still considered as the criterion standard in clinical MRI. Hence, imaging at 7 T — also termed ultra-high-field (UHF) MRI — competes with advanced clinical 3-T MRI and must thus offer a clear benefit translating into improved diagnostics or therapeutic monitoring.

For MS, UHF imaging offers 2 main advantages: increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) andenhanced susceptibility effects. The SNR, that is, the ratio of the signal to background noise, increases proportionally with the static magnetic field strength. A recent brain imaging study even suggested that SNR might scale supralinearly with static magnetic field strength under certain conditions. Further, the use of phased array coils at 7 T allows for parallel imaging, with reduced SNR penalty due to less intense far-field behavior. This allows the use of higher parallel imaging acceleration factors than at lower fields. Sufficient imaging acceleration is key in the clinical setting due to time constraints and to keep motion artifacts to a minimum. The increase in SNR translates to enhanced tissue resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio, for example, for gray and white matter, which, in turn, enables more sensitive detection of CNS pathology such as cortical lesions. Of note also is that the shift between the water and fat signal also increases with the static magnetic field strength, potentially resulting in more chemical shift artifacts.

Second, increased magnetic field strength emphasizes tissue susceptibility effects, that is, the induction of local variations of the magnetic field by tissues with slightly different magnetic properties. These field distortions are particularly prominent near bones and air, but also in the vicinity of veins, which have high levels of deoxyhemoglobin, and tissue with high iron levels. This concept is harnessed in susceptibility-weighted imaging to sensitively image central veins in MS plaques, paramagnetic rims of MS plaques, and iron deposits.

### MRI contrast uptake in new lesions in relapsing-remitting MS followed at weekly intervals [^13d270f3]. Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

One of the diagnostic imaging hallmarks of MS is the uptake of IV administered contrast material in new lesions in the brain, signaling blood-brain barrier breakdown and active inflammation. Many clinical drug trials are designed based on the assumption that lesion enhancement on MRI remains visible on average for 1 month. For practical reasons, few serial MRI studies of patients with MS have been performed at intervals shorter than 4 weeks.

Methods

The authors performed a year-long longitudinal study in 26 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), which comprised an initial phase of MRI follow-up at weekly intervals for 8 weeks, followed by imaging every other week for another 16 weeks, and monthly thereafter. They present a quantitative analysis (using a supervised interactive thresholding procedure) of new enhancing lesions appearing during the first 6 weeks in this cohort and evaluated from the time of first detection until enhancement was no longer seen.

Results

The average duration of Gd-DTPA enhancement in individual new lesions was 3.07 weeks (median, 2 weeks). Significant correlations were demonstrated between the duration of contrast enhancement or initial growth rates and lesion volumes. Different lesions in the same patient appeared to develop largely independent of each other and demonstrated a large range in the duration of enhancement during the acute phase of their evolution.

Conclusions

The average duration of blood-brain barrier impairment in RRMS is shorter than earlier estimates. Early lesion growth parameters may predict final lesion size. Within-patient heterogeneity of lesion evolution suggests that individual lesions develop independently.

### Unraveling treatment response in multiple sclerosis: a clinical and MRI challenge [^e34007ab]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Over the last few decades, the improved diagnostic criteria, the wide use of MRI, and the growing availability of effective pharmacologic treatments have led to substantial advances in the management of multiple sclerosis (MS). The importance of early diagnosis and treatment is now well-established, but there is still no consensus on how to define and monitor response to MS treatments. In particular, the clinical relevance of the detection of minimal MRI activity is controversial and recommendations on how to define and monitor treatment response are warranted. An expert panel of the Magnetic Resonance Imaging in MS Study Group analyzed and discussed published studies on treatment response in MS. The evolving concept of no evidence of disease activity and its effect on predicting long-term prognosis was examined, including the option of defining a more realistic target for daily clinical practice: minimal evidence of disease activity. Advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of MRI activity alone and quantitative scoring systems combining on-treatment clinical relapses and MRI active lesions to detect treatment response in the real-world setting were also discussed. While most published studies on this topic involved patients treated with interferon-β, special attention was given to more recent studies providing evidence based on treatment with other and more efficacious oral and injectable drugs. Finally, the panel identified future directions to pursue in this research field.

### Use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to measure subtle blood-brain barrier abnormalities [^7b25d111]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is commonly studied using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) in diseases such as brain tumors, and multiple sclerosis, where a relatively large focally abnormal BBB is observed. There is increasing interest in using this imaging technique to identify more subtle BBB abnormalities, such as those which occur with normal ageing, dementia, Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes, cerebral microvascular disease, and in nonenhancing multiple sclerosis lesions. These initial results suggest that DCE-MRI of subtle BBB disorders may provide useful information. However, maximum post-contrast signal differences are small, typically about 5% in gray matter and 1–2% in white matter, with changes over the imaging period being on the order of 1–2%, and differences between patient groups on the order of a few percent at most. These results contrast with conventional DCE-MRI applications where signal enhancement may be on the order of 100% or greater in tumors, and 50% in multiple sclerosis.

### Recommended diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis: guidelines from the international panel on the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis [^5ba97d45]. Annals of Neurology (2001). Low credibility.

The International Panel on MS Diagnosis presents revised diagnostic criteria for multiple sclerosis (MS). The focus remains on the objective demonstration of dissemination of lesions in both time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is integrated with dinical and other paraclinical diagnostic methods. The revised criteria facilitate the diagnosis of MS in patients with a variety of presentations, including "monosymptomatic" disease suggestive of MS, disease with a typical relapsing-remitting course, and disease with insidious progression, without clear attacks and remissions. Previously used terms such as "clinically definite" and "probable MS" are no longer recommended. The outcome of a diagnostic evaluation is either MS, "possible MS" (for those at risk for MS, but for whom diagnostic evaluation is equivocal), or "not MS".

### Pre-contrast T1-weighted imaging of the spinal cord may be unnecessary in patients with multiple sclerosis [^4603d4e2]. European Radiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether pre-contrast T1-w imaging is needed in imaging of the spinal cord of patients with MS. We hypothesize that sparing dedicated pre-contrast T1-w imaging would not lead to significant decreases in diagnostic confidence for the detection of spinal lesions.
