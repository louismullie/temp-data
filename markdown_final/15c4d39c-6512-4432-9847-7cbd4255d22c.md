## Question

Is it typically reassuring that the left ovary was not seen, since concerning findings usually push forward and are visible?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether non-visualization of the left ovary on ultrasound is typically reassuring because concerning findings usually push forward and are visible, and under what clinical contexts that reassurance is valid or not valid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline frequency of ovarian non-visualization in healthy women across menopausal status. Then, I should verify anatomic and technical factors that make the left ovary harder to see. Next, I will review when the "if something is wrong, it pushes forward" heuristic applies versus when it fails, especially in symptomatic or high-risk scenarios. After that, I should check what major guidelines say about how to proceed when an ovary or mass is not visualized and how risk tools depend on visualization. Finally, I will synthesize pragmatic recommendations stratified by risk and symptoms, while ensuring the imaging pathway aligns with RCOG, ESGO, ACOG/SGO, USPSTF, and ACR guidance.

> Let me first confirm the clinical premise behind the question. The heuristic that "concerning pathology pushes forward" has some truth for large or advanced adnexal disease, but I need to be careful not to overgeneralize it to early or small-volume pathology, and I should check how guidelines frame the significance of non-visualization, which typically focus on characterization of visible adnexal masses rather than interpreting a non-seen ovary per se [^114nW5XQ] [^117LqSYJ].

> I should double-check baseline non-visualization rates in healthy postmenopausal women because that directly informs how reassuring "not seen" can be. In a cohort of 515 asymptomatic women ≥ 5 years postmenopause, the right ovary was seen in 86.3% and the left in 78%, meaning the left ovary was not visualized in about 22% of normal exams, and on 12‑month repeat, both ovaries remained harder to visualize on the left (80% right vs 68% left), underscoring that non-visualization is common and often benign in this group [^117VtLsq] [^114ewCxx].

> Wait, let me verify anatomic and technical contributors because laterality matters here. The left ovary is more often obscured by bowel and can lie higher, postmenopausal atrophy reduces ovarian size and conspicuity, and body habitus as well as uterine size can degrade detection; indeed, even under optimized conditions, sonographic visualization reached only about 85% overall and dropped modestly with higher weight, whereas bimanual palpation under anesthesia was far worse, reinforcing that non-visualization can be nonpathologic, particularly on the left and after menopause [^111CDjWQ] [^114ewCxx] [^117VtLsq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check when non-visualization is actually reassuring. In low-risk, asymptomatic postmenopausal women, non-visualization — especially of a small, atrophic left ovary — occurs in roughly 20–25% and is usually benign, which dovetails with recommendations that ultrasound screening is not indicated in average-risk women and that management should be risk-contextual rather than driven by the absence of an imageable ovary alone [^117VtLsq] [^114tkt1y] [^112umqQD].

> But wait, what if the patient is premenopausal or symptomatic; I should confirm how often ovaries are expected to be seen in those settings. In screening cohorts enriched for risk, bilateral ovarian visualization was achieved in 98% of premenopausal and 94% of postmenopausal participants; at first glance I almost assumed near-universal visualization in all women, but that 94% figure reminds me that even in optimized protocols, postmenopausal non-visualization still occurs, whereas in premenopausal patients non-visualization is less common and thus relatively less reassuring [^112yYVAX].

> Next, I should review exceptions where non-visualization is not reassuring despite the heuristic. In suspected adnexal torsion, a torsed ovary may still be missed early or with suboptimal technique, and neither normal Doppler flow nor non-visualization reliably excludes torsion, so ultrasound with grayscale and Doppler is indicated but does not rule out the diagnosis if clinical suspicion remains, particularly in pediatrics where non-visualization with a nondistended bladder has inadequate negative predictive value [^115yUXH5] [^115543zt] [^116Z5RsT].

> I will now examine high‑risk populations because I need to ensure I do not misapply reassurance there. For women with BRCA mutations or strong hereditary risk, routine screening is not recommended, but any suspicious imaging scenario warrants expert assessment; non-visualization in a high‑risk individual should not be equated with absence of disease and should prompt careful clinical correlation and, if concerns persist, escalation to expert imaging or subspecialty referral [^113Ed69M] [^111wiW2A].

> Let me consider how risk stratification systems handle a "not seen" ovary or mass. Tools like ADNEX and O‑RADS depend on morphologic characterization of an identified adnexal lesion, meaning that non-visualization precludes risk scoring and commonly leads to repeat expert ultrasound or MRI as a second‑line problem‑solving modality when indeterminate findings persist or suspicion remains [^114QTBFN] [^111q6RXJ] [^117LqSYJ].

> I should confirm the imaging pathway when the ovary is not visualized and clinical context is ambiguous. Guidance emphasizes high‑quality transvaginal ultrasound as first line, using transabdominal views as supplementary, and reserving MRI for indeterminate or non-diagnostic cases, with the ACR Appropriateness Criteria and O‑RADS frameworks supporting MRI to clarify risk when ultrasound is inconclusive and clinical risk justifies further workup [^116MGL3t] [^115rmLvZ] [^116UhNPw] [^1159dZ9a].

> Synthesis and practical approach: In an asymptomatic, average‑risk postmenopausal woman, non-visualization of the left ovary is common due to atrophy and anatomic factors and is generally reassuring if the examination is technically adequate and there are no additional concerning features; conversely, in premenopausal patients, in those with symptoms such as acute pain or persistent bloating, or in high‑risk individuals, non-visualization is not sufficiently reassuring and should prompt repeat expert ultrasound, short‑interval follow‑up, or MRI problem‑solving per guideline pathways and clinical judgment [^117VtLsq] [^114tkt1y] [^112umqQD] [^111q6RXJ] [^116UhNPw].

> Final check: I need to ensure I have not overlooked the change-over-time nuance. If a previously visualized ovary or known lesion becomes "not seen", that change is not inherently reassuring and warrants reassessment by an expert sonographer and consideration of second‑line imaging, with referral to gynecologic oncology if morphology or clinical features raise concern despite non-visualization [^112umqQD] [^116ueQUM].

Non-visualization of the left ovary on ultrasound is **common and usually benign** [^117VtLsq], especially in postmenopausal women or those with higher BMI, prior surgery, or bowel gas. It is generally **not concerning** unless there are symptoms, risk factors, or abnormal findings [^112umqQD]. If clinical suspicion persists, consider repeat ultrasound; MRI may be used if ultrasound is inconclusive [^111q6RXJ], whereas routine CT or MRI is not recommended [^1162UJtH]. Management should be guided by clinical context, and patients should be reassured when no abnormalities are detected [^116UhNPw].

## Frequency and clinical significance of non-visualization

Non-visualization of one ovary is **common** [^114ewCxx], particularly in postmenopausal women, those with higher BMI, prior pelvic surgery, or bowel gas. Clinically, it is **typically benign** and not concerning unless accompanied by symptoms, risk factors, or abnormal findings [^1121TjsM].

---

## Factors influencing ovarian visualization

Several factors affect **ovarian visualization** on ultrasound [^116UhNPw]:

| **Factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Age and menopausal status | Ovaries shrink with age/menopause, making them harder to see [^117VtLsq] |
| Body mass index (BMI) | Higher BMI can limit visualization due to adipose tissue [^111CDjWQ] |
| Bowel gas | Gas can obscure ovaries |
| Prior pelvic surgery | Adhesions or anatomical changes can limit visualization |
| Operator experience | Experienced sonographers improve visualization rates |

---

## Clinical implications of non-visualization

Non-visualization of the left ovary is **generally reassuring** and not concerning unless any of the following are present; in asymptomatic women without risk factors, it is **typically benign** [^1131bMsk]:

- **Symptoms**: Pelvic pain, bloating, or abnormal bleeding.

- **Risk factors**: Family history of ovarian cancer or genetic predisposition [^113Ed69M].

- **Abnormal findings**: Suspicious masses or elevated tumor markers [^112umqQD].

---

## Recommended follow-up and management

- **Initial evaluation**: Transvaginal ultrasound is first-line for adnexal masses [^112ZqXmf] [^113AraQS].

- **Repeat ultrasound**: If suspicion persists, repeat ultrasound with a full bladder or different patient positioning [^115543zt].

- **MRI**: Consider MRI if ultrasound is inconclusive and suspicion remains [^117LqSYJ].

- **CT**: Not recommended routinely due to radiation exposure and limited added value [^1126ejFB].

- **Clinical context**: Management should be guided by symptoms, risk factors, and findings.

---

## Patient counseling and reassurance

Patients should be reassured that **non-visualization is common and usually benign** [^114ewCxx]. Emphasize that concerning findings are typically visible on ultrasound and that further evaluation is only needed if suspicion persists [^113AraQS].

Ovarian reserve is defined as the number of oocytes remaining in the ovary, or oocyte quantity (oocyte number). Markers of ovarian reserve include hormone levels and sonographically measured features of the ovaries. These markers can be useful as predictors of oocyte yield following controlled ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval; however, they are poor predictors of reproductive potential independently from age.

### Virtual compared with in-clinic transvaginal ultrasonography for ovarian reserve assessment [^111Yp8uo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

To evaluate the noninferiority of virtual transvaginal ultrasonography compared with in-clinic ultrasonography for ovarian reserve assessment, we conducted a single-site, head-to-head crossover trial. Participants performed self-administered virtual transvaginal ultrasonography at home, guided by a remote-certified ultrasound technologist, then underwent transvaginal ultrasonography in-clinic with another ultrasound technologist. Participants were women in the greater Boston area interested in evaluating ovarian reserve and were recruited through social media, healthcare referrals, and professional networks. The uterus and ovaries were captured in sagittal and transverse views. These randomized recordings were reviewed by two or three independent, blinded reproductive endocrinologists. The primary outcome was the noninferiority of the rate of clinical quality imaging produced at home compared with in-clinic. Sample size was selected for greater than 90% power, given the 18% noninferiority margin. Secondary outcomes included antral follicle count equivalency and net promoter score superiority.

Fifty-six women were enrolled from December 2020 to May 2021. Participants varied in age (19–35 years), BMI (19.5–33.9), and occupation. Ninety-six percent of virtual and 98% of in-clinic images met "clinical quality". The difference of -2.4% (97.5% CI lower bound -5.5%) was within the noninferiority margin (18%). Antral follicle counts were equivalent across settings, with a difference in follicles (0.23, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.82) within the equivalence margin (2.65).

### Gynecologic ultrasound in emergency medicine [^116Z5RsT]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The true value of ultrasound in acute abdominal pain lies in its ability to detect gynecologic disorders and effectively rule out other causes of acute abdominal pain that require surgical repair. Although the emergent gynecologic indications discussed in this article are few in number, this does not suggest that the nonpregnant patient presenting to the ED with abdominal pain should not receive an ultrasound examination. On the contrary, the author believes that in a "perfect world", ultrasound should be the initial imaging study in most of these patients. The reality is that it is difficult to convince radiology colleagues to call in a sonologist in the middle of the night for any indication other than ovarian torsion when CT scans can diagnose ovarian cysts and tubo-ovarian abscess. As was pointed out in the section on ovarian torsion, even adequate ovarian blood flow does not rule out this diagnosis. Ideally, an ultrasound of the pelvis could be undertaken at the time of the pelvic examination, adding as little as 5 to 10 minutes. If a gynecologic disorder could be confirmed, other imaging studies might be unnecessary, thereby reducing cost (potential savings on laboratory tests, cervical cultures, or CT scans), length of stay, and adverse complications of CT (contrast material reactions and radiation exposure).

Emergency medicine ultrasound continues to grow at a rapid pace. We are working toward a time when most EPs will be competent and comfortable performing bedside ultrasound examinations in a limited number of applications.

### Development and validation of a deep learning pipeline to diagnose ovarian masses using ultrasound screening: A retrospective multicenter study [^111wNvD3]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Low credibility.

All ultrasound examinations were conducted utilizing 38 types of equipment from 9 vendors, employing transvaginal, transrectal, and transabdominal scanning methods. Preoperative ovarian ultrasonography images and videos were acquired by radiologists with over 5 years of experience in pelvic ultrasonography, following the standard protocol. A grayscale dynamic video of scanning was recorded for the ovarian masses at a uniform velocity for at least 2–5 seconds. The video was routinely recorded from "none" to "the maximum" to "none" during the scan. The region of interest (ROI) was positioned at the center of the image to capture a standardized ultrasound video.

The data stored and used for analysis included a longitudinal maximum cross-sectional ultrasound image and a maximum cross-sectional ultrasound image, as well as at least one typical imaging feature image, such as papillary structures, posterior acoustic shadows, and solid parts. Images of healthy ovarian tissues from patients were also stored and used for analysis, including at least one longitudinal ultrasound image and one transverse ultrasound image.

### Assessment of adult women with ovarian masses and treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^116DnxpZ]. JCO Global Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Limited-resource settings**: Clinicians should perform the recommendations from the basic setting and may add CT if available. CT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis, including the lower lung fields, using oral and intravenous (IV) contrast where available, can help document the extent of disease spread to solid organ structures such as the liver. It also details the severity of peritoneal carcinomatosis, rules out pleural effusion, and aids in surgical treatment planning. In women with respiratory symptoms, CT of the thorax provides a more complete evaluation, although this guideline does not recommend routinely performing it for all patients with suspected ovarian cancer in limited-resource settings. A chest x-ray is more accessible and cost-effective for the evaluation of the thorax.

- **Enhanced-resource settings**: In addition to recommendations from the basic and limited settings, magnetic resonance imaging provides minimal added benefit to the assessment of an ovarian mass suspicious for diagnosis of ovarian cancer. CT imaging of the abdomen, pelvis, and thorax provides a more comprehensive evaluation of disease burden and is beneficial in surgical treatment planning. Specific benign ovarian pathology such as fibroid disease or dermoid cyst(s) are optimally visualized with ultrasound, and thus magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis can be used only if the clinician's decision-making will be altered based on radiologic findings.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^117QiX8m]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

When ovarian pathology is primarily suspected, such as isolated or predominant testosterone excess, transvaginal ultrasonography with color Doppler is readily accessible and should be considered as the first-line imaging technique. Typically, women with ovarian hyperthecosis (OHT) exhibit bilateral increased ovarian volume. Notably, virilizing ovarian tumors (VOTs) are generally small, often with Leydig cell tumors measuring less than 3 cm and appearing isoechoic. Consequently, if ultrasonography is negative in settings of high clinical suspicion for androgen-secreting tumors, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended as the next step. MRI is more sensitive and specific than ultrasound for identifying ovarian tumors, boasting positive and negative predictive values of 78% and 100%, respectively. The use of contrast-enhanced MRI further increases sensitivity to 81% and specificity to 98%.

If MRI is unavailable or contraindicated, computed tomography (CT) serves as an alternative modality. However, CT involves exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation, which should be avoided wherever possible in premenopausal women, and it provides limited value in detecting and characterizing ovarian tumors. In a study by Yan Liu et al, the combined application of ultrasound and CT demonstrated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 89%, 94.7%, and 91.7%, respectively — figures that were higher than when using either ultrasound or CT in isolation to diagnose pelvic masses.

The evidence for using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18 FDG-PET) is limited. Successful identification of androgen-secreting tumors has been reported only sporadically.

### Anatomic nomenclature and 3-dimensional regional model of the human ovary: Call for a new paradigm [^115RGQnA]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

The ovaries are the female gonads that are crucial for reproduction, steroid production, and overall health. Historically, the ovary was broadly divided into regions defined as the cortex, medulla, and hilum. This nomenclature lacks specificity and fails to consider the significant anatomic variations in the ovary. Recent technological advances in imaging modalities and high-resolution omic analyses have brought about the need for revision of the existing definitions, which will facilitate the integration of generated data and enable the characterization of organ subanatomy and function at the cellular level. The creation of these high-resolution multimodal maps of the ovary will enhance collaboration and communication among disciplines and between clinicians and researchers.

Beginning in March 2021, the Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology Program of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development invited subject-matter experts to participate in a series of workshops and meetings to standardize ovarian nomenclature and define the organ's features. The goal was to develop a spatially defined and semantically consistent terminology of the ovary to support collaborative, team science-based endeavors aimed at generating reference atlases of the human ovary. The group recommended a standardized, 3-dimensional description of the ovary and an ontological approach to the subanatomy of the ovary and definition of follicles. This new greater precision in nomenclature and mapping will better reflect the ovary's heterogeneous composition.

### True ovarian volume is underestimated by two-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound measurement [^115deUSR]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

The study aimed to investigate the difference between true ovarian volume and the volume estimated using two-dimensional (2D) transvaginal ultrasound. This prospective clinical and laboratory study was conducted at a university hospital research laboratory. Participants included premenopausal girls and women from three Danish national fertility centers (Center A: n = 42; Center B: n = 6; Center C: n = 18), all of whom had one entire ovary removed for cryopreservation of the ovarian cortex.

The intervention involved measuring ovarian volume via transvaginal 2D ultrasound before oophorectomy. The true ovarian volume was then obtained by weighing the ovary. The main outcome measure was the ovarian volume as estimated by ultrasound compared to the weight of the ovary.

Results indicated that the ovarian tissue density was 1.00 g/mL. Mean ovarian volume via ultrasound versus by weight in the three groups was reported as: Group A: 6.3 mL vs. 7.8 mL; Group B: 5.4 mL vs. 6.8 mL; and Group C: 2.8 mL vs. 6.1 mL. Ovarian volume obtained by ultrasound was at least 27% smaller than the true ovarian volume. The study concluded that ovarian volume is severely underestimated by transvaginal 2D ultrasound measurement.

### Inguinal ovarian hernia on point of care ultrasound: Case reports and review of the literature [^1176FHdR]. Emergency Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

An inguinal mass may be an incidental finding on physical examination. There are few descriptions of pediatric hernia with ovarian content in the pediatric emergency literature and no recommendations for routine point of care ultrasound (POCUS) evaluation of inguinal hernia. We present three cases of ovarian content within an inguinal hernia sac found on POCUS by a pediatric emergency physician and discuss ultrasound technique and implications of these findings. Inguinal masses should routinely be evaluated with POCUS in order to prevent forceful reduction efforts that may damage the ovary and to allow for effective surgical triage and early involvement of surgical subspecialists.

### Corpus luteum across the first trimester: Size and laterality as observed by ultrasound [^1136DQba]. Fertility and Sterility (2008). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to examine the site and size of the corpus luteum (CL) throughout the first trimester of pregnancy. This was carried out through a retrospective observational study involving 1,806 ultrasound scans performed between 5 to 9 weeks (plus 6 days) gestation and a prospective study with 313 participants conducted at 10 to 13 weeks (plus 6 days) gestation.

The setting included four ultrasound practices across Victoria, Australia, with a total of 2,119 pregnant women participating. The intervention used was transvaginal ultrasound, focusing on the main outcome measures: the side and size (diameter) of the CL.

Results showed that at 5 to 9 weeks' gestation, the mean CL diameter was 19.3 mm without significant variation across each week of gestation. However, by 10 to 13 weeks' gestation, the CL size significantly decreased, with a mean diameter of 16.85 mm. Among 237 women where both ovaries were visible at 10 to 13 weeks' gestation, a CL was observed in 82% of cases. There was a statistically significant right-sided bias in both study groups, with 54% at 5–9 weeks' gestation and 56% at 10–13 weeks.

The conclusion of the study indicates that the CL remains consistent in size between 5 to 9 weeks' gestation but begins to decrease or disappear between 10 to 13 weeks. Additionally, there is a novel right-sided ovulation bias noted in humans.

### Virtual compared with in-clinic transvaginal ultrasonography for ovarian reserve assessment [^116HvXEb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

In the United States, compared to other countries, access to high-quality ovarian reserve testing has been suboptimal and contributes to known disparities in access to infertility treatment. Comprehensive at-home fertility assessment with FDA-authorized virtual ultrasonography (currently under FDA review) could be most effective for those who live in underserved regions, underrepresented minorities, and patients with disabilities. Because the trial demonstrated that patients can and are able to perform their own transvaginal ultrasonography, this model could possibly enable earlier identification of fertility-affecting conditions such as diminished ovarian reserve and polycystic ovarian syndrome.

This self-administered technology has the potential to reduce geographic and financial barriers to reproductive health care and provide much-needed, convenient access to fertility testing to guide decisions around family building, fertility preservation, or pursuing further testing or treatment. Promising future applications may also include remote follicular monitoring for ovulation induction and controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilization in tandem with treatment-specific hormonal testing.

In summary, virtual transvaginal ultrasonography can provide an innovative option for comprehensive at-home fertility testing, possibly expanding patient access to fertility care, decreasing costs, and providing women with the means to evaluate their reproductive potential.

### Committee opinion no. 716: The role of the obstetrician-gynecologist in the early detection of epithelial ovarian cancer in women at average risk [^1131bMsk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for ovarian cancer, specifically concerning indications for screening in the general population, ACOG 2017 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend transvaginal ultrasound and tumor markers, such as CA-125, either alone or in combination, for early detection of ovarian cancer in average-risk females.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^112X6DEo]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Appendix 6 summarizes studies and society guidelines for patients with an incidental finding of an ovarian cyst on imaging. Various methods are utilized, including transvaginal ultrasonography, biomarkers, biomarker assays, and multimodal risk assessment, to exclude ovarian cancer. The studies faced several limitations; they were conducted in patients who underwent surgery, which limits understanding of how these strategies perform in expectantly managed patients. Additionally, the study populations often had a higher ovarian cancer incidence than expected, potentially overestimating diagnostic accuracy.

CA 125 is the most frequently measured serum marker for the evaluation and early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, despite variation in its measured sensitivity (61–90%) and specificity (71–93%). Sensitivity and specificity are poorer in premenopausal patients than postmenopausal patients. This is likely because benign conditions that can cause CA 125 elevation occur more frequently in premenopausal patients, and the ovarian cancer incidence is lower in premenopausal patients than in postmenopausal patients.

The International Ovarian Tumour Analysis Phase 5 study was a prospective, multicenter cohort study where patients were selected for surgery or conservative management based on morphology and symptoms. In this study, 1,919 patients with a new diagnosis of a mass assessed as benign on ultrasonography had outcomes examined 24 months after enrollment. Of these, 20.2% experienced spontaneous resolution of their mass during follow-up, and 16.1% underwent surgical intervention.

### ESUR guidelines for MR imaging of the sonographically indeterminate adnexal mass: an algorithmic approach [^111q6RXJ]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

A significant proportion of adnexal masses detected by sonography are indeterminate, either because their organ of origin is uncertain or because it is unclear whether their nature is benign or malignant. MR imaging of the sonographically indeterminate adnexal mass can resolve most of these uncertainties. Most indeterminate masses result from common benign conditions, and women with such masses can avoid unnecessary or inappropriate surgery. For the minority of women whose masses are malignant, the use of MR imaging rather than a 'wait and watch' strategy of repeat ultrasound (US) results in a more timely diagnosis.

- **Algorithmic approach**: There are simple diagnostic steps in the MR imaging assessment, which direct an algorithmic and problem-solving approach based on signal characteristics and morphology. MR imaging should provide a more timely diagnosis and, thereby, guide the management of the patient with reduced costs of investigation and treatment.

### O-RADS MRI to classify adnexal tumors: from clinical problem to daily use [^1159dZ9a]. Insights into Imaging (2024). High credibility.

The unmet clinical need refers to the challenge of accurately identifying malignant (cancerous) adnexal masses during ultrasound (US) examinations. Adnexal masses detected through US examinations can appear indeterminate, making it difficult for clinicians to confidently determine whether they are benign (non-cancerous) or malignant. As a result, there is a risk of false-positive cases, where patients might undergo unnecessary cancer surgeries due to the uncertainty surrounding the diagnosis.

To address this issue, researchers have conducted observational studies, particularly single-center diagnostic test accuracy studies, to assess the performance of different imaging techniques in distinguishing between benign and malignant adnexal masses. MRI is known for its excellent soft tissue contrast and ability to provide detailed images of internal organs, making it a valuable tool in diagnosing adnexal masses. In 2005, Kinkel et al. conducted a Bayesian analysis to evaluate the incremental benefit of using a second imaging test (such as MRI) after an inconclusive US examination. Bayesian analysis is a statistical approach that can be used to combine prior knowledge (prior probability) with new evidence (likelihood) to update the probability of an event (posterior probability). This paper concluded that in women with an indeterminate ovarian mass at US, MR imaging results contributed to a change in the probability of ovarian cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women more than did CT or combined gray-scale and Doppler US results. Based on these elements, the European radiology community is actively working to integrate MRI into clinical practice for more accurate adnexal mass characterization.

### Executive summary of the ovarian cancer evidence review conference [^112umqQD]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

We found several relevant guidelines for the management of incidentally identified masses. According to the ACOG, "transvaginal ultrasonography is the recommended imaging modality for a suspected or incidentally identified pelvic mass. No alternative imaging modality has demonstrated sufficient superiority to transvaginal sonography to justify routine use". The American College of Radiology's Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System ultrasound risk-stratification and management system recommends ultrasound follow-up, referral to an ultrasound specialist, pursuing magnetic resonance imaging, or referral to a gynecologist or gynecologic oncologist on the basis of the risk of malignancy.

Most relevant guidelines, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the European Society for Medical Oncology, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, make no mention of the use of serum biomarker panels. The ACOG states, "Serum biomarker panels may be used as an alternative to CA 125 level alone in determining the need for referral to or consultation with a gynecologic oncologist when an adnexal mass requires surgery. These biomarker panels are not recommended for use in the initial evaluation of an adnexal mass but may be helpful in assessing which women would benefit from referral to a gynecologic oncologist".

### Virtual compared with in-clinic transvaginal ultrasonography for ovarian reserve assessment [^113VCfaj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Given the lack of an existing consensus for transvaginal ultrasound image quality criteria, a 4-point scale was developed based on interviews with expert physicians who regularly assess images. During the scale's development, emphasis was placed on replicating and codifying the thought process from usual clinical practice. It was ensured that all clips could be intuitively categorized by an expert physician. The scales for imaging quality assessment used by Hausleiter et al. served as a guide for quality rating.

- **Quality scale development**: For each folder, the raters were asked to score the visualization of the organ on a defined quality scale from 1 (nondiagnostic) to 4 (excellent image quality). For the purposes of assessing the primary endpoint, a "clinical quality" scan of an organ required two raters to provide a score of either 3 or 4, and that the same raters identified the target organ correctly (i.e. complete visualization of the ovary, cortex, stroma, and antral follicles in perpendicular planes such as sagittal and transverse). If the rater did not accurately identify the target organ, these scans were considered beneath clinical quality, and the folder was rated as less than the threshold for clinical quality (scored as 1).

Each primary rater provided ratings for all 334 such folders. The third rater rated 15 of 334 (4%) folders (eight at-home scans, seven in-clinic scans) whenever there was a disagreement on quality between the primary raters. If the tiebreaker assessed the clips to be of clinical quality, this third rater's responses were used in place of those rating the images as below.

### Society for endocrinology clinical practice guideline for the evaluation of androgen excess in women [^114SFTYs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

The primary objective of imaging in the work-up of patients with severe androgen excess is to identify structural adrenal or ovarian pathology and differentiate between incidental and clinically relevant lesions. The imaging approach can vary depending on the level of suspicion for PCOS versus non-PCOS pathology. When there is a high index of suspicion for PCOS, particularly in premenopausal women with irregular menstrual cycles and insidious onset of hyperandrogenism, transvaginal ultrasound, if acceptable to the patient, is the most accurate first-line radiological investigation. This ultrasound should be conducted by a professional with expertise in ovarian ultrasonography. Its purpose is to screen for polycystic ovarian morphology to support the suspected diagnosis, rather than to identify a suspected neoplasm.

However, this may be unnecessary from a diagnostic perspective in patients with typical features of androgen excess and oligomenorrhea. If clinical indications suggest non-PCOS pathology, such as rapidly progressive severe androgen excess or severe biochemical disturbances (e.g. serum T > 5nmol/L), cross-sectional imaging of the ovaries and/or adrenals should be undertaken accordingly. In patients with severe biochemical androgen excess, both ovarian and adrenal imaging are recommended irrespective of the biochemical pattern.

### Ultrasound follow-up of an adnexal mass has the potential to save lives [^113cwjEm]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer is among the most dreaded cancers since it is often found at a late stage where the opportunity for extended survival is poor. Ultrasound has been utilized in several ovarian cancer screening trials in asymptomatic women to detect ovarian cancer at early stages where survival rates are high. Efforts to improve screening for ovarian cancer are ongoing. While ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic women is not currently recommended for clinical application, the care of women with adnexal masses found by ultrasound in clinical practice can benefit from close evaluation of the evidence obtained from large prospective ovarian cancer screening trials and by relating this evidence to recent advances in the understanding of different types of ovarian cancer.

Post-menopausal women who have an adnexal mass discovered by ultrasound have a much higher risk of developing ovarian cancer than women with normal ultrasound. The preponderance of reported evidence indicates that ultrasound monitoring of an adnexal mass is safe, cost-effective, and can achieve an improved positive predictive value in detecting ovarian cancer when ovarian abnormalities resolve during surveillance. Proposals to arbitrarily discontinue ultrasound monitoring can negatively impact patient care and generate medical-legal actions, especially because there is no evidence to support safe discontinuation. In this review, we outline a rationale for continuing ultrasound surveillance of ovarian abnormalities.

### Virtual compared with in-clinic transvaginal ultrasonography for ovarian reserve assessment [^1134kbBW]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Infertility affects one in eight reproductive-aged couples in the United States. However, diagnostic testing for this disorder is often not pursued due to cost, lack of insurance coverage, and underestimation of age-related fertility decline among women of reproductive age. Recently, with increasing average maternal age and more public discussion of infertility, there is expanding interest in at-home fertility testing as a cost-considerate option that is easy to access. Early fertility-assessment products focused on estimating ovulation, whereas newer tests have attempted to more directly evaluate ovarian reserve.

Ovarian reserve, the quantity and quality of oocytes, declines with advancing age and directly affects reproductive potential. Typically, ovarian reserve is estimated with both ultrasonography to assess antral follicle count and serum antimüllerian hormone. Antral follicle count is the most accurate imaging modality to estimate ovarian reserve and is established as an essential part of a complete fertility assessment. Home-testing products are limited to fingerstick testing measuring reproductive hormones (e.g. antimüllerian hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol), but they do not offer clinically meaningful ovary-specific testing as with antral follicle count.

Virtual ovarian reserve testing with self-administered transvaginal ultrasonography to evaluate antral follicle count and pelvic organs has the potential to improve access to fertility testing, identify diminished ovarian reserve earlier, and guide decisions for family building or elective preservation.

Asymptomatic adnexal masses are commonly encountered in daily radiology practice. Although the vast majority of these masses are benign, a small subset have a risk of malignancy, which requires gynecologic oncology referral for the best treatment outcomes. Ultrasound, using a combination of transabdominal, transvaginal, and duplex Doppler techniques, can accurately characterize the majority of these lesions. MRI with and without contrast is a useful complementary modality that can help characterize indeterminate lesions and assess the risk of malignancy in those that are suspicious.

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer-reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Challenges in diagnosis and understanding of natural history of polycystic ovary syndrome [^1168si7T]. Clinical Endocrinology (2022). Low credibility.

Identification of polycystic ovary morphology (PCOM) on ultrasonography requires an assessment of the number of antral follicles per entire ovary (FNPO) and ovarian volume (OV) to gauge the presence of follicle excess and/or ovarian enlargement. Characteristics of the ovarian stroma (area and brightness) or follicle arrangement may be helpful in corroborating the presence of PCOM but have less diagnostic accuracy for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and are not recommended in the diagnostic evaluation. Transvaginal ultrasonographic (TVUS) imaging is the preferred approach to evaluate PCOM if sexually active and if acceptable to the patient. Using TVUS with a bandwidth including 8 MHz, the PCOS EBG recommend a threshold on either ovary of FNPO ≥ 20 and/or OV ≥ 10 ml, ensuring no corpora lutea or dominant follicles are present.

The threshold for ovarian enlargement is consistent with previously proposed criteria based on expert opinion, diagnostic test studies, and consideration of the upper limits of normal in healthy women with regular cycles and normal androgens. However, the threshold for follicle excess is lower than the 25 follicles proposed by the AEPCOS Society and substantially higher than the definition of PCOM previously supported by the Rotterdam consensus (i.e. FNPO ≥ 12). Similar to the AEPCOS Society's definition of follicle excess, the EBG threshold for FNPO may result in the exclusion of a subset of patients (~20%) that would otherwise have met the Rotterdam criteria for PCOS status. The excluded patients would now be judged to have solely hyperandrogenism (HA) or oligo-anovulation, yet may display greater m…

### Acog technology assessment no. 8: Sonohysterography [^112VFgr4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The primary goal of sonohysterography is to visualize the endometrial cavity in more detail than is possible with routine transvaginal ultrasonography. The procedure consists of the transcervical injection of sterile fluid under real-time ultrasound imaging.

- **Indications for sonohysterography**: The evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding; uterine cavity concerns, especially with regard to uterine leiomyomas, polyps, and synechiae; abnormalities detected on transvaginal ultrasonography, including focal or diffuse endometrial or intracavitary abnormalities; congenital abnormalities of the uterus; infertility; and pregnancy loss.

The procedure should not be performed in a woman who is pregnant, could be pregnant, has an existing pelvic infection, or has unexplained pelvic tenderness.

- **Required skills and training**: Physicians who perform or supervise diagnostic sonohysterography should be skilled in vaginal ultrasonography and transcervical placement of catheters. They should have training, experience, and demonstrated competence in gynecologic ultrasonography and sonohysterography, and should keep careful records.

### Fertility preservation in female cancer patients: Surgical procedures [^113ZpMdT]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). High credibility.

Direct visualization of the ovarian surface differs from the image seen using transvaginal ultrasound where the needle tip can be visualized within the follicle. At laparoscopy, the follicles are identified as relatively thin-walled, rounded protrusions from the ovarian surface, and the use of a depth marker on the needle is essential to gauge the depth of needle penetration into the ovarian follicle. The operator chooses which ovary to start with (usually the one that appears to have responded better to stimulation), stabilizes the ovary if necessary, and then advances the aspiration needle into the follicle at a site on the follicle away from any surface blood vessels. The use of a double lumen needle allowing aspiration and irrigation of the follicles is preferable.

As it is not possible to reliably steer the aspiration needle from one follicle to another within the ovary (as it is during transvaginal ultrasound or with sonography), it is necessary to puncture the ovary on each occasion when entering a new follicle. Minor bleeding from ovarian surface vessels is common. Persistent bleeding can be controlled with light application of bipolar diathermy. At the completion of the procedure, we perform irrigation of the ovarian surfaces and peritoneal cavity with warmed normal saline.

The carbon dioxide is released from the peritoneal cavity, and the port sites are closed in a standard manner (e.g. 2/0 absorbable suture). The patient is reversed from the general anesthetic and transferred to the recovery area and then to the postoperative care unit for further recovery and management.

### Virtual compared with in-clinic transvaginal ultrasonography for ovarian reserve assessment [^115SycRp]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). Low credibility.

Considering the intimate nature of transvaginal ultrasonography, patient feedback was highly favorable overall. Many patients found the virtual experience to be one they would highly recommend to others, with a net promoter score well above the healthcare average, and significantly superior to that of the in-clinic experience. As a point of reference, the net promoter score difference between at-home and in-clinic examinations (58.1 points) is nearly three times greater than the net promoter score difference between total knee replacement and total hip replacement, procedures known to have significant differences in patient tolerability. The net promoter score of recalled in-clinic transvaginal ultrasound experience was, in fact, negative, potentially representing patients who would hesitate to seek care in person. Our findings suggest that this virtual testing option would be highly acceptable to patients and would improve utilization of and access to ovarian reserve testing.

The primary strength of our study was that the population was diverse in physical characteristics (BMI), range of professions, disabilities, and contraceptive use. Hence, our results are likely generalizable to the general population of reproductive-aged women. Notably, the trial population reflected individuals with disabilities, including a participant with visual impairment and another with a history of vaginismus and prior challenges with in-clinic care. The diversity of our trial population demonstrates the broad, proactive interest of reproductive-aged persons to pursue self-evaluation of ovarian health.

- **Diffuse carcinomatosis**: of the small bowel involving such large parts that resection would lead to short bowel syndrome (remaining bowel < 1.5 m).

- **Diffuse involvement/deep infiltration**: of the stomach/duodenum (limited excision is possible) and head or middle part of the pancreas (tail of the pancreas can be resected).

- **Involvement of major arteries**: such as truncus coeliacus, hepatic arteries, and left gastric artery (celiac nodes can be resected).

### Ovarian status in healthy postmenopausal women: Follow-up 12 months after transvaginal ultrasound [^114ewCxx]. Menopause (2009). Low credibility.

We have previously reported on the point prevalence of ovarian lesions detected by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) in 515 asymptomatic women at least 5 years postmenopause. The aims of this study were to report, in the same women, on the repeatability of visualization of the ovaries via TVU, the natural history of ovarian lesions seen at baseline but not treated surgically, and to assess whether any women developed new ovarian abnormalities 12 months later.

The study involved a cohort of 515 postmenopausal women recruited from the community, at least 5 years past their last period. They were assessed at baseline and again after 12 months using TVU and serum levels of inhibin and CA-125.

The right and left ovaries were visualized on both occasions in 80% and 68% of women, respectively. Of the 49 women who had an ovarian lesion at baseline and did not undergo surgery at that time, and who had a follow-up TVU, the lesion was unchanged 12 months later in 30 women. Four women developed a new ovarian lesion within the 12 months. None of the 14 women who underwent surgery on the basis of the ovarian appearance at baseline, nor the 2 who had surgery on the basis of the ovarian appearance at follow-up, had an ovarian malignancy.

Use of TVU in women at least 5 years after menopause is problematic because the ovaries cannot be visualized in all women, and because TVU has the potential to identify many benign lesions that would otherwise remain undetected. These are important considerations in weighing up the risks and benefits of using TVU as a screening tool.

### Practice bulletin no. 174: Evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^114AWfXY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Adnexal masses, meaning masses of the ovary, fallopian tube, or surrounding tissues, are commonly encountered by obstetrician-gynecologists and often present diagnostic and management dilemmas. Most adnexal masses are detected incidentally during physical examination or pelvic imaging. Less commonly, a mass may present with symptoms of acute or intermittent pain. Management decisions are often influenced by the patient's age and family history. Although most adnexal masses are benign, the primary goal of diagnostic evaluation is to exclude malignancy.

The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for the evaluation and management of adnexal masses in adolescents, pregnant women, and nonpregnant women. It outlines criteria for identifying adnexal masses that are likely to be malignant and may warrant referral to or consultation with a gynecologic oncologist.

### Imaging modalities for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis [^115RTd9k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). High credibility.

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis. Endometriosis is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy, the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, no non-invasive tests that can be used to accurately diagnose endometriosis are available in clinical practice. This is the first review of diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests for endometriosis that uses Cochrane methods to provide an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.

- **Objectives**: To provide estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard. Additionally, to describe the performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites. Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 20 April 2015: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDION, DARE, and PubMed. Searches were not restricted to a particular study design or language, nor to specific publication dates.

### Frequency and disposition of ovarian abnormalities followed with serial transvaginal ultrasonography [^1121TjsM]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence, incidence, persistence, and resolution of ovarian abnormalities using serial transvaginal ultrasonography.

A cohort of 39,337 women participating in the University of Kentucky Ovarian Cancer Screening Program was monitored using 221,576 baseline and interval transvaginal ultrasonograms.

The results indicated that transvaginal ultrasonograms were normal for the first and all subsequent visits for 31,834 participants (80.9%). In contrast, 6,807 women (17.3%) had transvaginal ultrasonograms interpreted as abnormal and were monitored over 21,588 ultrasonograms. Ovarian cysts were more prevalent in premenopausal women (prevalence 34.9%, incidence 15.3%) than in postmenopausal women (prevalence 17.0%, incidence 8.2%). For the group with abnormalities, the initial transvaginal ultrasonogram was abnormal in 46.7% of cases, of which 63.2% resolved to normal on subsequent ultrasonograms. Of the 35,314 cases classified as normal on the first examination, 9.9% were abnormal on subsequent annual examinations.

- **Abnormal findings were classified as follows**: unilocular cysts (11.5%), cysts with septations (9.8%), cysts with solid areas (7.1%), and solid masses (1.8%). Many transvaginal ultrasonographic abnormalities were followed to resolution. Surgery was performed on 557 participants for 85 ovarian malignancies and 472 nonmalignancies. Over the duration of the study, the positive predictive value (PPV) increased from 8.1% to 24.7%.

In conclusion, serial ultrasonography has shown that many ovarian abnormalities resolve, even if the initial appearance is complex, solid, or bilateral.

### Non-visualization of the ovaries on pediatric transabdominal ultrasound with a non-distended bladder: Can adnexal torsion be excluded [^115543zt]. Pediatric Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

The pediatric reproductive organs are optimally imaged with a full bladder. However, the filling of the bladder often leads to significant delays in diagnosis and can subject the patient to invasive bladder catheterization. The key imaging feature in ovarian torsion is unilateral ovarian enlargement, leading us to suspect that a torsed ovary is large enough to be visualized even if the bladder is not well-distended.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate whether clinically suspected adnexal torsion can be excluded based on the non-visualization of the ovaries on transabdominal ultrasound (US) with a non-distended bladder in pediatric patients.

- **Materials and methods**: This retrospective study comprised 349 girls (1–19 years old) between January 1, 2013, and July 30, 2018. Three hundred and forty-one of the girls were referred to transabdominal US to assess for adnexal torsion and/or appendicitis, and the ovaries were initially not visualized on US. Their bladders were subsequently filled, and they were rescanned with a distended bladder showing the ovaries. Ovarian volumes and the time between US scans were documented. The ratio of the volume of the larger ovary to the smaller one was calculated. Nine girls had surgically proven adnexal torsion and a preoperative transabdominal US with a non-distended bladder. There was an overlap of one girl between the two groups. The negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV), and sensitivity and specificity for the exclusion of adnexal torsion based on non-visualization of the ovaries on US with a non-distended bladder were analyzed.

### Adnex risk prediction model for diagnosis of ovarian cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis of external validation studies [^114QTBFN]. BMJ Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

ADNEX is intended for use by gynaecologists to help them decide on the most appropriate management of an adnexal mass detected on ultrasound. Our findings support the use of ADNEX in choosing between surgery and conservative follow-up. Conservative follow-up might be appropriate in patients with a low risk of malignancy (e.g. 10%; based on a meta-analysis of patients who underwent surgery).

ADNEX can also be helpful in deciding on the management of a suspected malignancy, such as investigations to find the primary tumour if a metastasis in the ovary is likely, or fertility-sparing surgery if a borderline tumour is likely; this is based on a meta-analysis in patients who underwent surgery. Because the AUC values of ADNEX with and without CA125 were similar, and because adding CA125 mainly helps to distinguish between different types of malignant tumours, we argue that the main use of ADNEX without CA125 is to help decide whether conservative follow-up, surgery in a local centre, or referral to an oncology centre is appropriate. The main use of ADNEX with CA125 is to help decide on the optimal management of a tumour suspected to be malignant, because it differentiates better between malignant subtypes than ADNEX without CA125.

### The role of ultrasound evaluation in the detection of early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer [^112yYVAX]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Epithelial ovarian cancer causes more deaths among women than all other gynecologic malignancies combined, primarily due to the difficulty in detecting early-stage disease. Ultrasonography has shown utility in detecting ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women. However, its effectiveness in identifying early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer in women at increased risk remains uncertain. This study examined the usefulness of sonography for detecting early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer in asymptomatic high-risk women who participated in the National Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Program.

- **Study design**: Only asymptomatic women at increased risk for ovarian cancer, with initial normal gynecologic and ultrasound examinations, were eligible to participate in the institutional review board-approved program. Participants underwent comprehensive gynecologic and ultrasound examinations every 6 months. Criteria for increased risk included at least one affected first-degree relative with ovarian cancer, a personal history of breast, ovarian, or colon cancer, having one or more affected first- and second-degree relatives with breast and/or ovarian cancer, inheritance of a breast cancer mutation from an affected family member, or membership within a recognized cancer syndrome.

- **Results**: The average age of the 4,526 women evaluated was 46 years; 2,610 were premenopausal, and 1,916 were postmenopausal. Since 1990, a total of 12,709 scans have been performed. Visualization of both ovaries was achieved in 98% of premenopausal women and in 94% of postmenopausal women.

### Ultrasound in gynecological cancer: Is it time for re-evaluation of its uses [^114s9e9W]. Current Oncology Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is the primary imaging modality in gynecological oncology. Over the last decade, there has been significant technological development that has led to a substantial improvement in the quality of ultrasound imaging. When performed by an experienced sonographer, ultrasound plays an invaluable role in the primary diagnosis of gynecological cancer, in assessing tumor extent in the pelvis and abdominal cavity, in evaluating the treatment response, and in follow-up. Ultrasound is also a valuable procedure for monitoring patients treated with fertility-sparing surgery. Furthermore, it is an ideal technique to guide tru-cut biopsy for the collection of material for histology. Considering its accuracy and the fact that ultrasound is a commonly available, non-invasive, and inexpensive imaging method, which can be carried out without any risk or discomfort to the patient, it is time to reconsider its role in gynecologic oncology. Additionally, resources should be allocated for the specialized education of future experts in ultrasound imaging in gynecology.

### Screening for ovarian cancer: Updated evidence report and systematic review for the US Preventive Services Task Force [^111e1WBz]. JAMA (2018). Low credibility.

Ovarian cancer, though relatively rare, ranks as the fifth-leading cause of cancer mortality among women in the United States. This systematic review aimed to assess the benefits and harms of ovarian cancer screening in average-risk women, providing insights for the US Preventive Services Task Force.

- **Data sources**: The review included data from MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Collaboration Registry of Controlled Trials. The studies considered were published in English from January 1, 2003, to January 31, 2017, with ongoing surveillance into selected publications up to November 22, 2017.

- **Study selection**: The focus was on randomized clinical trials of ovarian cancer screening for average-risk women, analyzing outcomes related to mortality and quality of life. Screening interventions examined included transvaginal ultrasound, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) testing, or a combination of both. The studies compared these methods to usual care or no screening.

- **Data extraction and synthesis**: Two reviewers independently conducted critical appraisals and data abstraction. Meta-analytic pooling was not carried out due to the limited number of studies and varied interventions.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Key outcomes reviewed were ovarian cancer mortality, false-positive screening results, subsequent surgeries, surgical complications, and psychological impact of screening.

The review incorporated four trials involving a total of 293,587 participants. Among these, three trials with 293,038 participants examined ovarian cancer mortality, while one trial with 549 participants focused solely on psychological outcomes. The screening methods evaluated were transvaginal ultrasound alone, transvaginal ultrasound in combination with CA-125 testing, and CA-125 testing alone. Test positivity for CA-125 was determined by a pre-set serum level cut-off.

### Practice bulletin no. 174 summary: Evaluation and management of adnexal masses [^112jLdEN]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Adnexal masses, which encompass masses of the ovary, fallopian tube, or surrounding tissues, are commonly encountered by obstetrician-gynecologists and often present diagnostic and management challenges. Most adnexal masses are incidentally detected during physical examination or pelvic imaging. Less frequently, a mass may manifest with symptoms of acute or intermittent pain. Management decisions are often influenced by the age and family history of the patient. Although most adnexal masses are benign, the primary objective of the diagnostic evaluation is to exclude malignancy. This document aims to provide guidelines for the evaluation and management of adnexal masses in adolescents, pregnant women, and nonpregnant women. It also outlines the criteria for identifying adnexal masses that are likely malignant and may require referral to or consultation with a gynecologic oncologist.

### Ovarian status in healthy postmenopausal women [^117VtLsq]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

There are currently no programs to assess ovarian health in postmenopausal women. The aim of this study was to describe the ovaries in healthy women at least 5 years after menopause by questionnaire, transvaginal ultrasonography, and blood ovarian cancer markers.

A total of 515 women who were asymptomatic and at the stages of reproductive aging workshop +2 stage of menopause (> 5 years postmenopause) were recruited by advertisement. Clinical history was obtained by questionnaire, and biophysical assessment by a transvaginal ultrasound investigation and biochemical assessment by serum CA-125 and inhibin were performed. Abnormal findings were confirmed and then reviewed.

Both ovaries were identified by transvaginal ultrasonography in 71% of women. The right ovary was visualized in 86.3% of these volunteers, and the left ovary was visualized in 78%. The presence of small unilocular cysts and echogenic foci facilitated identification of the ovary in some women. Ovarian/paraovarian lesions were present in 12.6% of women. Abnormalities of the endometrium and uterus were also common, prompting surgery in 7.2% of the women. Total serum inhibin concentrations were normal for postmenopausal women, whereas serum CA-125 was elevated in two women.

We find that the description and detection of postmenopausal ovaries by transvaginal ultrasonography allows the identification of both ovaries in most postmenopausal women. Ultrasonography-detected abnormalities of the ovary and/or the uterus/endometrium are common in women at this stage of life.

### The accuracy of examination under anesthesia and transvaginal sonography in evaluating ovarian size [^111CDjWQ]. Gynecologic Oncology (2005). Low credibility.

To compare pelvic examination under anesthesia to transvaginal sonography (TVS) as a method for ovarian detection and measurement, 289 ovaries from 151 women were evaluated. After induction of anesthesia, a complete pelvic examination and TVS were performed, and the ovaries were subsequently removed surgically. Ovarian dimensions generated sonographically and estimated during clinical examination were compared to those obtained from the measured surgical specimen.

- **Results**: Forty-four percent of ovaries were palpable clinically, whereas 85% were visualized sonographically (P < 0.001). Ovaries were less often palpable in women aged ≥ 55 years (26%) compared to younger women (67%, P < 0.001), in women weighing ≥ 200 lb (34%) as opposed to those weighing less (51%, P = 0.005), and in women with a uterine weight ≥ 200 g (31%) compared to a uterine weight ≤ 200 g (51%, P = 0.05). Sonographic detection rates were consistent across age, weight, and uterine weight, except for a slightly lower rate in women weighing ≥ 200 lb (80% vs. 89%, P = 0.08).

Thus, TVS is more effective than pelvic examination under anesthesia for identifying and measuring the ovaries, particularly in women aged ≥ 55 years, those weighing ≥ 200 lb, or those with an enlarged uterus (> 200 g). The addition of TVS to annual pelvic examinations may be beneficial in women aged ≥ 55 years who are overweight and therefore at high risk of developing ovarian cancer.

### Testing and interpreting measures of ovarian reserve: A committee opinion [^1124Soxi]. Fertility and Sterility (2015). Low credibility.

Currently, there is no uniformly accepted definition of decreased ovarian reserve (DOR). The term may refer to three related but distinctly different outcomes: oocyte quality, oocyte quantity, or reproductive potential. Available evidence concerning the performance of ovarian reserve tests is limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity among study designs, analyses, and outcomes, and the lack of validated outcome measures.

### An ovary with a twist: A case of interesting sonographic findings of ovarian torsion [^113W5xZX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

An otherwise healthy young woman presented to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain. Multiple diagnoses were considered, as must be in cases of women with lower quadrant abdominal pain. Rapid identification of an abnormally enlarged ovary in close proximity to the opposite ovary on pelvic ultrasonography suggested the diagnosis of ovarian torsion. This was verified on laparoscopy. Of note is the fact that normal Doppler flow to both ovaries was demonstrated on pelvic ultrasound. We present this case, and its associated images, with the intent to highlight a readily identifiable sign of ovarian torsion for emergency physicians and to briefly review ovarian torsion's salient clinico-pathologic features.
