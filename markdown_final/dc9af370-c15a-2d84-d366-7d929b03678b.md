## Question

Giving methotrexate and folinic acid

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about giving methotrexate and folinic acid together, including when to use folinic acid versus folic acid, dosing, timing, and how to adjust based on indication and toxicity risk. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is low-dose methotrexate for inflammatory disease or high-dose methotrexate for oncology. Then, I should verify the pharmacologic rationale for folinic acid rescue and the risk of over-rescue. Next, I will review guideline-backed dosing and timing for low-dose regimens, followed by high-dose protocols and pharmacokinetic rescue. After that, I need to check special scenarios like ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease, and finally consider safety, monitoring, and what to do if toxicity emerges despite prophylaxis.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts because the approach differs fundamentally. For low-dose methotrexate in rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease, folate supplementation reduces toxicity without clear loss of efficacy, whereas for high-dose methotrexate in oncology, folinic acid is used as rescue to prevent severe mucositis, myelosuppression, and nephrotoxicity, and timing and dose must be carefully controlled to avoid under-rescue or over-rescue of malignant cells [^047ea1c1] [^37c7cb95] [^2c4e2d07].

> I need to check the pharmacologic rationale next. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, depleting reduced folates and impairing thymidine and purine synthesis. Folinic acid bypasses DHFR and restores intracellular folate pools in normal tissues, enabling DNA repair and mitigating toxicity, which is why it is the rescue agent after high-dose therapy. However, folinic acid can also rescue malignant cells if given too early or in excess, potentially compromising antitumor efficacy, so timing and dose must balance rescue with oncologic effectiveness [^2c4e2d07] [^6bf83336].

> Now, for low-dose methotrexate in inflammatory disease, I should confirm whether folic acid or folinic acid is preferred and how to dose. Multiple high-quality guidelines recommend folic acid rather than folinic acid for routine prophylaxis because folic acid is effective at reducing gastrointestinal and hepatic adverse effects and is less expensive. Typical dosing is 1 mg daily or about one-third of the methotrexate dose given 24 hours after methotrexate, with some clinicians omitting folate on the day of methotrexate to minimize theoretical interference, though evidence for efficacy loss is limited [^89e304a4] [^aeca2439] [^a37fdec7] [^3e19b9e2] [^37c7cb95].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for efficacy impact. Cochrane and subsequent reviews show significant reductions in GI and hepatic toxicity and fewer discontinuations with folate supplementation, and pooled analyses do not show a statistically significant reduction in methotrexate efficacy, supporting routine folate use in RA and related conditions. Cost-effectiveness also favors folic acid over folinic acid in this setting [^37c7cb95] [^c3c4b3f7] [^0c0824d9].

> For high-dose methotrexate in oncology, I should confirm standard rescue protocols. Typical practice is to start folinic acid rescue about 24 to 42 hours after the methotrexate infusion, commonly at 15 mg/m2 every 6 hours, continuing until the methotrexate level falls below a defined threshold such as 0.1 to 0.2 micromol/L, with adjustments based on serum methotrexate concentrations and renal function. Delayed rescue increases toxicity, whereas overly aggressive rescue may blunt antileukemic effect, so pharmacokinetic-guided dosing is essential [^6bf83336] [^5e70f2cd] [^1d09bf71].

> Hold on, I should verify whether shorter rescue is safe in rapid clearers. Recent pediatric cohorts suggest that in the setting of rapid methotrexate clearance, one or two 15 mg/m2 doses of folinic acid can be sufficient without increased toxicity, shortening hospitalization, but this strategy requires reliable methotrexate level monitoring and should be applied cautiously outside of experienced centers. Under-rescue remains a risk if clearance is slower than expected [^6b3eaa8a] [^593e5501] [^7e69c09e].

> Next, I should review special indications where folinic acid is used differently. In ectopic pregnancy and low-risk gestational trophoblastic disease, multidose methotrexate regimens alternate methotrexate with folinic acid rescue to mitigate toxicity while maintaining efficacy. For example, 1 mg/kg methotrexate on days 1, 3, 5, 7 with 0.1 mg/kg folinic acid on days 2, 4, 6, 8, or fixed 15 mg folinic acid per rescue day, with treatment individualized to hCG response and toxicity, and success rates comparable across commonly used regimens when appropriately selected [^7e1d7382] [^040dc40e] [^a1399c22] [^79e2b064].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring because folinic acid does not eliminate all risks. Even with prophylaxis, methotrexate can cause myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, renal injury, and neurotoxicity, and risk rises with impaired renal function, drug interactions, and delayed rescue. Baseline and periodic CBC, liver enzymes, and creatinine are standard, and in high-dose therapy, serial methotrexate levels guide rescue intensity and duration, with glucarpidase considered for toxic concentrations and delayed clearance due to renal dysfunction [^047ea1c1] [^5dd732f8] [^60bf0f14] [^b9df540f].

> But wait, what if the patient is on interacting medications that raise methotrexate levels. I need to ensure I review concomitant drugs such as NSAIDs, penicillins, PPIs, and antifolates that can increase methotrexate exposure and toxicity, and adjust monitoring and rescue accordingly. In such cases, closer surveillance and earlier or more intensive folinic acid rescue may be warranted to prevent severe complications [^361f4c8e].

> Let me reconsider the practical choice between folic acid and folinic acid for low-dose therapy. Although both reduce toxicity, folic acid is generally preferred for convenience, cost, and guideline endorsement, while folinic acid may be reserved for patients who cannot tolerate folic acid or who experience persistent toxicity despite adequate folic acid dosing. If folinic acid is used, dosing approximating one-third of the methotrexate dose given 24 hours later is reasonable based on pediatric consensus extrapolated to adults, albeit with lower evidence quality [^89e304a4] [^a37fdec7] [^3e33feed].

> In summary, I need to ensure the regimen matches the indication: for low-dose inflammatory disease, use folic acid routinely to reduce adverse effects without clear loss of efficacy. For high-dose oncology therapy, use pharmacokinetically guided folinic acid rescue starting 24 to 42 hours after methotrexate and titrate to clearance. For ectopic pregnancy and low-risk GTN, use standardized multidose methotrexate with folinic acid rescue. And across all settings, monitor closely for toxicity and adjust rescue and supportive care in real time based on labs and clinical status [^047ea1c1] [^37c7cb95] [^6bf83336] [^7e1d7382].

Methotrexate and folinic acid are used together to **reduce methotrexate toxicity** without compromising efficacy in non-neoplastic diseases [^37c7cb95]. Folinic acid is given 24 hours after methotrexate to **bypass DHFR inhibition** and restore folate pathways in normal cells, reducing mucositis, myelosuppression, and hepatotoxicity [^2c4e2d07]. In oncology, folinic acid rescue is timed to methotrexate levels to prevent under- or over-rescue; in non-neoplastic use, low-dose folic acid is preferred for cost and convenience, with folinic acid reserved for intolerance or toxicity [^5e70f2cd] [^37c7cb95]. Dosing is individualized by indication, renal function, and methotrexate levels, with close monitoring for toxicity and drug interactions [^047ea1c1] [^361f4c8e].

---

## Pharmacological rationale for co-administration

Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), depleting reduced folates and causing toxicity in rapidly dividing normal tissues. Folinic acid (leucovorin) is a reduced folate that **bypasses DHFR**, rapidly restoring intracellular folate pools and mitigating toxicity without reversing methotrexate's anti-inflammatory or antineoplastic effects when timed correctly [^2c4e2d07] [^35131c68].

---

## Clinical indications and dosing strategies

### Non-neoplastic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis)

- **Folic acid supplementation**: 1 mg daily or 5 mg once weekly, typically given 24 hours after methotrexate, is recommended to reduce gastrointestinal and hepatic toxicity without impairing efficacy [^89e304a4] [^a37fdec7] [^3e19b9e2].
- **Folinic acid use**: Reserved for patients intolerant to folic acid or experiencing significant toxicity; dosing is individualized, often 5–15 mg weekly, 24 hours after methotrexate [^notfound].
- **Clinical evidence**: Meta-analyses show folate supplementation reduces gastrointestinal side effects by ~26% and hepatotoxicity by ~77%, and lowers methotrexate discontinuation rates without affecting efficacy [^37c7cb95] [^c3c4b3f7].

---

### Neoplastic diseases (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoma, osteosarcoma)

- **High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX)**: Defined as ≥ 500 mg/m², requires folinic acid rescue to prevent severe mucositis, myelosuppression, and nephrotoxicity [^e3e432bf].
- **Standard rescue protocol**: Folinic acid 15 mg/m² IV every 6 hours, starting 24–42 hours after HD-MTX, continued until methotrexate levels drop below 0.1–0.2 µmol/L [^5e70f2cd] [^1d09bf71].
- **Pharmacokinetic-guided rescue**: Levels are monitored at 24, 42, and 48 hours; rescue is intensified if levels are high or clearance is delayed to prevent toxicity [^5e70f2cd] [^b9df540f].

---

## Timing and dosing of folinic acid rescue

| **Clinical scenario** | **Timing of folinic acid** | **Dose and frequency** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-neoplastic diseases | 24 hours after methotrexate | 1 mg folic acid daily or 5 mg weekly |
| High-dose methotrexate (oncology) | 24–42 hours after infusion | 15 mg/m² IV every 6 hours until methotrexate < 0.1–0.2 µmol/L |
| Delayed methotrexate clearance | Immediately upon detection | Escalate dose and frequency based on levels |

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

- **Reduced toxicity**: Significant reductions in mucositis, myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, and neurotoxicity are observed with appropriate folinic acid rescue [^37c7cb95] [^c3c4b3f7].
- **Improved tolerability**: Lower discontinuation rates and improved adherence to methotrexate therapy are reported with folate supplementation [^37c7cb95] [^c3c4b3f7].
- **Preserved efficacy**: Folinic acid does not significantly impair methotrexate's anti-inflammatory or antineoplastic efficacy when administered correctly [^37c7cb95] [^35131c68].

---

## Potential risks and considerations

- **Over-rescue**: Excessive folinic acid can reduce methotrexate efficacy by rescuing malignant or hyperproliferative cells, necessitating careful timing and dose adjustment [^2c4e2d07] [^d2956c99].
- **Under-rescue**: Delayed or inadequate folinic acid increases risk of severe toxicity, particularly in HD-MTX settings [^1d09bf71] [^e3e432bf].
- **Drug interactions**: Concomitant medications (e.g. NSAIDs, PPIs, penicillins) can increase methotrexate levels, requiring closer monitoring and potential folinic acid dose adjustment [^361f4c8e].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment strategies

- **Non-neoplastic use**: Regular CBC, LFTs, and renal function tests are recommended, with folinic acid dose adjusted for significant toxicity [^a37fdec7] [^db0adb58].
- **Oncology use**: Methotrexate levels are monitored at 24, 42, and 48 hours; folinic acid rescue is intensified if levels are elevated or clearance is delayed [^5e70f2cd] [^b9df540f].
- **Renal impairment**: Requires heightened vigilance and dose adjustment due to prolonged methotrexate exposure and increased toxicity risk [^047ea1c1] [^5dd732f8].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Non-neoplastic diseases**: Use folic acid 1 mg daily or 5 mg weekly, 24 hours after methotrexate; reserve folinic acid for intolerance or toxicity [^89e304a4] [^a37fdec7].
- **Neoplastic diseases**: Use folinic acid 15 mg/m² IV every 6 hours, starting 24–42 hours after HD-MTX, until methotrexate levels fall below 0.1–0.2 µmol/L [^5e70f2cd] [^1d09bf71].
- **Individualization**: Adjust folinic acid dosing based on methotrexate levels, renal function, and clinical toxicity [^b9df540f] [^047ea1c1].

---

Methotrexate and folinic acid are used together to **reduce toxicity** while preserving efficacy. Folinic acid restores folate pathways in normal tissues, and its dosing and timing must be tailored to the clinical context, with close monitoring to balance rescue and efficacy.

### How long can folinic acid rescue be delayed after high-dose methotrexate without toxicity? [^1d09bf71]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

To determine the optimal time of folinic acid rescue after methotrexate (MTX) treatment in patients with ALL, we selected and evaluated relevant studies that included doses, rescue delay, and side effects. Rescue at 42–48 hours resulted in considerable toxicity, except when low doses of MTX were used (1 g/m(2)) or serum MTX levels remained consistently low at 24, 30, and 36 hours. Rescue started at 30–36 hours was safe. In the absence of evidence that later rescue improves prognosis, we suggest that folinic acid rescue (105 mg/m(2)) be started no later than 36 hours from the start of MTX (5–6 g/m(2)).

### After 75 Years of methotrexate, can treatment results Be improved with appropriate folinic acid rescue? [^91663053]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

After 75 years of clinical use of folic acid antagonists such as methotrexate, relevant pharmacological data currently important for the effective and safe use of methotrexate were reviewed to see if it is possible to improve outcomes. Specifically, to improve how high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) can be given safely, what doses of MTX (methotrexate) are adequate to achieve therapeutic levels, and what is the appropriate folinic acid (FA) dose for effective rescue. This review is based on 50 years of personal experience with the use of HD-MTX in published literature. Many pharmacologic studies were performed over 50 years ago, but are still relevant and stand up to scrutiny today. What should be considered HD-MTX and how it can be given safely and effectively without late toxicity are presented. The variables responsible for effective folinic acid rescue, especially the doses of MTX and folinic acid and the time to start of rescue, are discussed. Understanding these highlighted aspects of therapy could help to prevent acute toxicity, improve treatment results, and prevent late effects.

### Folic acid and folinic acid for reducing side effects in patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis [^c3c4b3f7]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To perform a systematic review of the benefits and harms of folic acid and folinic acid in reducing the mucosal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and hematologic side effects of methotrexate (MTX); and to assess whether folic or folinic acid supplementation has any effect on MTX benefit.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and US National Institutes of Health clinical trials registry from inception to March 2012. We selected all double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were treated with MTX (dose ≤ 25 mg/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. We included only trials using low-dose folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of ≤ 7 mg weekly) because the high dose is no longer recommended or used. Data were extracted from the trials, and the trials were independently assessed for risk of bias using a predetermined set of criteria.

Results

Six trials with 624 patients were eligible for inclusion. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias for key domains. The quality of the evidence was rated as "moderate" for each outcome as assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) working group, with the exception of hematologic side effects, which were rated as "low". There was no significant heterogeneity between trials, including where folic acid and folinic acid studies were pooled. For patients supplemented with any form of exogenous folate (either folic or folinic acid) while receiving MTX therapy for RA, a 26% relative (9% absolute) risk reduction was seen for the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; p = 0.008). Folic and folinic acid also appear to be protective against abnormal serum transaminase elevation caused by MTX, with a 76.9% relative (16% absolute) risk reduction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34; p < 0.00001), as well as reducing patient withdrawal from MTX for any reason [60.8% relative (15.2% absolute) risk reduction, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; p < 0.00001].

Conclusion

The results support a protective effect of supplementation with either folic or folinic acid for patients with RA during treatment with MTX. There was a clinically important significant reduction shown in the incidence of GI side effects and hepatic dysfunction (as measured by elevated serum transaminase levels), as well as a clinically important significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason.

### Folic acid and folinic acid for reducing side effects in patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis [^37c7cb95]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate (MTX) is a disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) used as a first line agent for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pharmacologically, it is classified as an antimetabolite due to its antagonistic effect on folic acid metabolism. Many patients treated with MTX experience mucosal, gastrointestinal, hepatic or haematologic side effects. Supplementation with folic or folinic acid during treatment with MTX may ameliorate these side effects.

Objectives

To identify trials of supplementation with folic acid or folinic acid during MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis and to assess the benefits and harms of folic acid and folinic acid (a) in reducing the mucosal, gastrointestinal (GI), hepatic and haematologic side effects of MTX, and (b) whether or not folic or folinic acid supplementation has any effect on MTX benefit.

Search Methods

We originally performed MEDLINE searches, from January 1966 to June 1999. During the update of this review, we searched additional databases and used a sensitive search strategy designed to retrieve all trials on folic acid or folinic acid for rheumatoid arthritis from 1999 up to 2 March 2012.

Selection Criteria

We selected all double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in which adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis were treated with MTX (at a dose equal to or less than 25 mg/week) concurrently with folate supplementation. In this update of the review we only included trials using 'low dose' folic or folinic acid (a starting dose of ≤ 7 mg weekly).

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted from the trials, and the trials were independently assessed for risk of bias using a predetermined set of criteria.

Main Results

Six trials with 624 patients were eligible for inclusion. Most studies had low or unclear risk of bias for key domains. The quality of the evidence was rated as 'moderate' for each outcome as assessed by GRADE, with the exception of haematologic side effects which were rated as 'low'. There was no significant heterogeneity between trials, including where folic acid and folinic acid studies were pooled. For patients supplemented with any form of exogenous folate (either folic or folinic acid) whilst on MTX therapy for rheumatoid arthritis, a 26% relative (9% absolute) risk reduction was seen for the incidence of GI side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92; P = 0.008). Folic and folinic acid also appear to be protective against abnormal serum transaminase elevation caused by MTX, with a 76.9% relative (16% absolute) risk reduction (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.34; P < 0.00001), as well as reducing patient withdrawal from MTX for any reason (60.8% relative (15.2% absolute) risk reduction, RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.53; P < 0.00001). We analysed the effect of folic or folinic acid on the incidence of stomatitis / mouth sores, and whilst showing a trend towards reduction in risk, the results were not statistically significant (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.06)It was not possible to draw meaningful conclusions on the effect of folic or folinic acid on haematologic side effects of methotrexate due to small numbers of events and poor reporting of this outcome in included trials. It does not appear that supplementation with either folic or folinic acid has a statistically significant effect on the efficacy of MTX in treating RA (as measured by RA disease activity parameters such as tender and swollen joint counts, or physician's global assessment scores).

Authors' Conclusions

The results support a protective effect of supplementation with either folic or folinic acid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis during treatment with MTX. There was a significant reduction shown in the incidence of GI side effects, hepatic dysfunction (asmeasured by elevated serum transaminase levels) as well as a significant reduction in discontinuation of MTX treatment for any reason. A trend towards a reduction in stomatitis was demonstrated however this did not reach statistical significance. This updated review with its focus on lower doses of folic acid and folinic acid and updated assessment of risk of bias aimed to give a more precise and more clinically relevant estimate of the benefit of folate supplementation for patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving methotrexate.

### Effect of folic or folinic acid supplementation on methotrexate-associated safety and efficacy in inflammatory disease: a systematic review [^b8c0b62d]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist widely used for the treatment of inflammatory disorders for more than 50 years. Methotrexate is a standard systemic therapy for severe psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis. Folic acid supplementation has been advocated to limit the toxicity of methotrexate on blood cells, gastrointestinal tract and liver. However, there is still controversy regarding the usefulness of folic acid supplementation.

Objectives

We sought to assess the evidence for the efficacy of folic acid supplementation in patients treated with methotrexate for inflammatory diseases. We also investigated whether folic acid supplementation may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate.

Methods

Cochrane and MEDLINE databases were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials in patients treated with methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis or psoriasis with or without arthritis were included. Study selection, assessment of methodological quality, data extraction and analysis were carried out by two independent researchers. We selected double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials. Analysis was performed for each subgroup of side-effects: gastrointestinal, mucocutaneous, haematological and hepatic.

Results

Six randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria, with a total sample of 648 patients. There were 257 patients in the placebo group, 198 patients treated with folic acid, and 193 patients treated with folinic acid. The statistical analysis showed a significant reduction of 35.8% of hepatic side-effects induced by methotrexate for patients with supplementation with folic or folinic acid (95% confidence interval -0.467 to -0.248). There was no statistical difference for mucocutaneous and gastrointestinal side-effects although there was a trend in favour of supplementation. The effect of supplementation on haematological side-effects could not be assessed accurately due to a low incidence of these events in the population studied. We were unable to analyse the effect of supplementation on the effectiveness of methotrexate, as markers of activity used in each study were not comparable.

Conclusions

Supplementation with folic acid is an effective measure to reduce hepatic adverse effects associated with methotrexate treatment. There is no difference between folinic acid and folic acid, but the lower cost of the latter promotes its use.

### Methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: advice and recommendations from the MARAJIA expert consensus meeting [^90126bf6]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Administration of folic or folinic acid 24 h apart from the administration of MTX, in a dose of approximately one-third of the MTX dose, has been used to prevent MTX toxicity manifestations.

However, in limited cases, it is reported that at high doses folic acid supplementation seems to be associated with disease flares.

According to available data, it is not possible to make firm recommendations about routine folate supplementation in children receiving MTX treatment. However, data from adult studies and limited pediatric data can provide helpful information. Low-dose (1 mg/day) folic acid supplementation does not affect the anti-inflammatory efficacy of MTX and counteracts the signs of gastrointestinal and mucosal toxicities associated with it. The advisable dose is approximately one-third of the MTX dose, at least 24 h after the weekly dose of MTX, or 1 mg/day skipping the day when MTX is administered (Grade 4C). Folic acid supplementation does not appear to interfere with the therapeutic efficacy of MTX and seems to be associated with a reduced MTX discontinuation rate.

### 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis [^89e304a4]. Arthritis Care & Research (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for rheumatoid arthritis, more specifically with respect to DMARD monotherapy (mode of administration and dosing), ACR 2021 guidelines recommend to consider splitting the dose of oral methotrexate over 24 hours or weekly subcutaneous injections, and/or initiate an increased dose of folic/folinic acid over switching to alternative DMARDs in patients not tolerating oral weekly methotrexate.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^6b3eaa8a]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Low doses of folinic acid (FA) rescue after high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) have been associated with increased toxicity, whereas high doses may be related to a decreased antileukemic effect. The optimal dosage and duration of FA rescue remain controversial. This study was designed to investigate, whether a shorter duration of FA rescue in the setting of rapid HD-MTX clearance is associated with increased toxicity.

Methods

We reviewed the files of 44 children receiving a total of 350 HD-MTX courses during treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia according to the NOPHO ALL-2000 protocol. Following a 5 g/m2 HD-MTX infusion, pharmacokinetically guided FA rescue commenced at hour 42. As per local guidelines, the patients received only one or two 15 mg/m 2 doses of FA in the case of rapid MTX clearance (serum MTX ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at hour 42 or hour 48, respectively). Data on MTX clearance, FA dosing, inpatient time, and toxicities were collected.

Results

Rapid MTX clearance was observed in 181 courses (51.7%). There was no difference in the steady-state MTX concentration, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, neutropenic fever, or neurotoxicity between courses followed by rapid MTX clearance and those without. One or two doses of FA after rapid MTX clearance resulted in a 7.8-h shorter inpatient time than if a minimum of three doses of FA would have been given.

Conclusion

A pharmacokinetically guided FA rescue of one or two 15 mg/m 2 doses of FA following HD-MTX courses with rapid MTX clearance results in a shorter hospitalization without an increase in toxic effects.

### Efficacy of folinic acid rescue following MTX GVHD prophylaxis: results of a double-blind, randomized, controlled study [^70b9267c]. Blood Advances (2020). Medium credibility.

The use of methotrexate (MTX) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is associated with increased rates of organ-specific toxicities. Despite limited data, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation-European LeukemiaNet working group recommend the use of folinic acid (FA) rescue to reduce MTX toxicity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we explored whether FA rescue reduces MTX-induced toxicity. We enrolled patients undergoing allo-HCT with myeloablative conditioning with peripheral blood stem cell grafts, with GVHD prophylaxis consisting of cyclosporine and MTX. Patients were randomized to receive FA or placebo starting 24 hours after each MTX dose and continuing over 24 hours in 3 to 4 divided doses. The primary end point was the rate of grades 3 and 4 oral mucositis. After enrollment of 52 patients (FA, n = 28; placebo, n = 24), preplanned interim analysis revealed similar rates of grade 3 and 4 (46.6% vs 45.8%; P = 0.97) and grades 1 to 4 (83.3% vs 77.8%; P = 0.65) oral mucositis. With a median follow-up of 17 (range, 4.5–50) months, there was no difference in the rates of acute and chronic GVHD, disease relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and overall survival. These interim results did not support continuation of the study. We conclude that FA rescue after MTX GVHD prophylaxis does not decrease regimen-related toxicity or affect transplantation outcomes. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02506231.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^593e5501]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A pharmacokinetically guided FA rescue of one or two 15 mg/m 2 doses of FA following HD-MTX courses with rapid MTX clearance results in a shorter hospitalization duration without an increase in toxic effects.

### Economic evaluation of folate supplementation during methotrexate treatment in rheumatoid arthritis [^0c0824d9]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine cost-effectiveness of folic or folinic acid supplementation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who started methotrexate (MTX) treatment.

Methods

An economic evaluation, performed alongside a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial with followup of 48 weeks. Patients started MTX with placebo (n = 137), folic acid (n = 133), or folinic acid (n = 141). Outcome measures were drug survival and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), measured with the EuroQol questionnaire. Both medical and nonmedical costs were analyzed.

Results

Drug survival after 48 weeks was 60% for placebo, 81% for folic acid, and 87% for folinic acid. QALY during a 48 week period were 0.55 (95% CI 0.52–0.58) in the placebo group, 0.55 (95% CI 0.52–0.58) in the folic acid group, and 0.58 (95% CI 0.56–0.60) in the folinic acid group. Mean medical costs were 1398 US dollars (placebo), 1409 US dollars (folic acid), and 1776 US dollars (folinic acid). Mean total costs were 3339 US dollars, 3632 US dollars, and 3296 US dollars, respectively.

Conclusion

In terms of resource deployment, no statistically significant difference was found between the 3 strategies. The preferred strategy consists of folic acid supplementation because of improved drug survival.

### Addition of either irinotecan or methotrexate to bolus 5-fluorouracil and high-dose folinic acid every 2 weeks in advanced colorectal carcinoma: a randomised study by the Southern Italy cooperative oncology group [^466a2192]. Annals of Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to compare the activity and toxicity of the combination of irinotecan (IRI) plus folinic acid (FA)-modulated 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) i.v. bolus with a regimen of double modulation of 5-FU with methotrexate (MTX) and FA in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma.

Patients and Methods

Two-hundred and thirty-four patients were enrolled: 118 patients received IRI 200 mg/m2 (90-min i.v. infusion) on day 1, followed by levo-FA 250 mg/m2 (2-h i.v. infusion) and 5-FU 850 mg/m2 (i.v. bolus) on day 2 (IRIFAFU), and 116 patients received MTX 750 mg/m2 (2-h i.v. infusion) on day 1, followed by levo-FA 250 mg/m2 (2-h i.v. infusion) and FU 800 mg/m2 (i.v. bolus) on day 2 (MTXFAFU). Both cycles were repeated every 2 weeks until progression or to a maximum of 16 cycles. Response rate (RR) was the main end point of the study; responses were assessed every four cycles and confirmed after 2 additional months of treatment.

Results

RR was significantly greater with IRIFAFU (36%) than with MTXFAFU (20%) (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that IRIFAFU was significantly associated with a greater activity (P = 0.028). Median progression-free survival was longer with IRIFAFU than with MTXFAFU (7.2 months compared with 4.8 months; P = 0.048). Median survival time (MST) did not differ between the two arms (14.7 months compared with 14.8 months, respectively). Patients not receiving second-line chemotherapy, however, lived longer when treated in the first-line with IRIFAFU (MST 11.9 months compared with 6.4 months; P = 0.038). IRIFAFU caused a significantly greater occurrence of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (40% compared with 9%; P = 0.001) and diarrhoea (13% compared with 4%; P = 0.024), but a significantly lower incidence of stomatitis (3% compared with 12%; P = 0.007), than the comparative regimen.

Conclusions

IRIFAFU appeared comparable in terms of activity and toxicity with other weekly or biweekly bolus or infusional combination regimens. IRIFAFU, however, seems easier to administer, because it does not require infusional catheter or pump devices, and it is less expensive. It may represent a new option for treating advanced colorectal carcinoma.

### Folate supplementation during methotrexate therapy for patients with psoriasis [^2fe3e462]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a folate antagonist that is a well-established therapy for autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. In some patients, methotrexate is associated with significant side effects and toxicity. Folate supplementation is often used to ameliorate methotrexate-associated side effects and toxicities. We sought to demonstrate that folate supplementation during methotrexate therapy reduces both toxicity and side effects without compromising efficacy. A MEDLINE search of the search terms "methotrexate", "folic acid", "folinic acid", and "leucovorin" was performed and literature relevant to the use of folates as a supplement to methotrexate was reviewed. According to studies reviewed, the use of folate supplements in patients treated with methotrexate reduces the incidence of hepatotoxicity and gastrointestinal intolerance without impairing the efficacy of methotrexate. Both folic acid and folinic acid are equally effective; however, folic acid is more cost effective. It must be noted that there are relatively few studies that have addressed folate supplementation with the use of methotrexate for the treatment of psoriasis. After examining the available data from the literature and drawing from clinical experience, we advise folate supplementation for every patient who receives methotrexate.

### Methotrexate – how does it really work? [^35131c68]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate remains a cornerstone in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. Folate antagonism is known to contribute to the antiproliferative effects that are important in the action of methotrexate against malignant diseases, but concomitant administration of folic or folinic acid does not diminish the anti-inflammatory potential of this agent, which suggests that other mechanisms of action might be operative. Although no single mechanism is sufficient to account for all the anti-inflammatory activities of methotrexate, the release of adenosine from cells has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Methotrexate might also confer anti-inflammatory properties through the inhibition of polyamines. The biological effects on inflammation associated with adenosine release have provided insight into how methotrexate exerts its effects against inflammatory diseases and at the same time causes some of its well-known adverse effects. These activities contribute to the complex and multifaceted mechanisms that make methotrexate efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.

### Methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: advice and recommendations from the MARAJIA expert consensus meeting [^3e33feed]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Research question 5: Folic acid supplementation for the prevention of methotrexate toxicity in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis

Recommendation 6. Folic or folinic acid supplementation is recommended to prevent MTX side effects (Evidence Grade 1A). The advised dose is approximately one third of the MTX dose, at least 24 h after the weekly dose of MTX for folinic acid; for folic acid 1 mg/day skipping the day when MTX is administered (Evidence Grade 4C).

PICO framework: P: children affected by JIA on treatment with MTX; I: MTX and folic acid supplementation; C: MTX alone; O: frequency (prevalence/incidence) of nausea and dyspepsia.

MTX toxicity, such as hepatotoxicity, hematologic changes, gastrointestinal and mucocutaneous intolerance, has been hypothesized to be a result of an induced state of folate depletion. The addition of folate, therefore, can counteract the signs of toxicity, either as folic or folinic acid (a reduced form of folic acid), since they can function in biosynthetic pathways independent of dihydrofolate reductase.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^f108c094]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Forty-four patients (27 males) were included in the study, with a mean age of 5.7 years (range 1.3 to 15.9 years) at diagnosis. The patients received a total of 352 HD-MTX courses, but a total of 350 courses were analyzed, as information on two courses of HD-MTX administered at a non-participating hospital was missing. The mean (± SD) S-MTX concentrations were 52.2 (± 26.9) μmol/L at 23 h, 1.1 (± 2.6) μmol/L at 36 h, 0.40 (± 0.75) μmol/L at 42 h, and 0.26 (± 0.51) μmol/L at 48 h. A concentration of ≥ 10 μmol/L at 23 h was reached in 347/350 (99.1%) courses. Rapid MTX clearance was observed in 184 (52.6%) of the 350 courses, and S-MTX was ≤ 0.2 μmol/L already at 42 h in 58 (16.6%) of the 350 courses.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^b634479b]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study is the first report of ALL patients receiving only one or two doses of FA after a 5 g/m 2 HD-MTX infusion. The results suggest that in the context of rapid MTX clearance, a shorter FA rescue may be sufficient. Although guidelines related to HD-MTX courses given as a part of NOPHO ALL-2000 therapy generally recommended at least three doses of FA regardless of MTX clearance speed, the local guidelines used in the hospitals participating in the present study provided no recommendation regarding the minimum number of FA doses. This resulted in administering only one or two FA doses in the case of rapid MTX clearance. Following 181 of 350 5 g/m 2 HD-MTX courses, only one or two doses of FA were administered due to rapid MTX clearance. In total, 41 out of 44 patients exhibited rapid MTX clearance following at least one course of HD-MTX. A shorter FA rescue following rapid MTX clearance was associated with a shorter hospital stay without increased toxicity. Severe toxicities were uncommon and did not differ between the courses with or without rapid MTX clearance.

All patients received extended hydration with 3000 mL/m 2 /24 h of fluids including 50 mmol/L NaHCO 3 over 12 h, according to the national practice, with extra NaHCO 3 given if urine pH was < 7. Urine alkalinization has been shown to be the most important factor influencing MTX clearance, and the active alkalinization may partially explain the rapid clearance observed in the present cohort. Extended hydration is deemed important, although a Danish randomized study by Mikkelsen et al. found no difference between 4- and 12-h prehydration with urine alkalinization. However, the study reported markedly higher MTX concentrations after HD-MTX 5 g/m 2 at hours 23, 36, and 42 compared to the present study as well as a remarkably higher incidence of delayed elimination and nephrotoxicity: 47% and 18.5%, compared to 4.3% and 3.3% in the present study, respectively. The results of these two studies including patients treated with the same chemotherapy regimen are drastically different, implying a role of other unrecognized factors beyond extended hydration and urine alkalinization — such factors could include ethnic differences in genetic polymorphisms in the metabolic and cellular transport pathway of methotrexate, concomitant medication, or differences in other local practices. These differences call for a further study on the effect of extended prehydration in a population different than in Mikkelsen et al.

### What is the best protocol of single-agent methotrexate chemotherapy in nonmetastatic or low-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic tumors? A review of the evidence [^55e33fcc]. Gynecologic Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD), a group of rare placenta disorders, have a varying potential for invasion, either local, or remote under the form of metastases, and are definitely cured by chemotherapy in 85 to 99% of cases. Single-agent methotrexate is the usual primary treatment for women with low-risk trophoblastic tumors (TT), yet various regimens are currently used worldwide. We reviewed these regimens and the available evidence for evaluating their respective efficacy and tolerance.

Methods

We performed an exhaustive literature search and applied the French agency for evaluation in healthcare (HAS) methodology for critical appraisal and level of evidence. We summarised the protocols used in the selected studies and their respective results regarding efficacy and toxicity.

Results

We selected 18 original studies on the efficacy and tolerance of methotrexate used alone or in association with folinic acid for the treatment of nonmetastatic or low-risk metastatic trophoblastic tumors. Among these 18 studies, 15 were retrospective series, 3 were prospective series without any control group, and none were controlled clinical trial. We identified four main chemotherapy regimens and two very different strategies for repeating the treatment courses. It was not possible to perform a meta-analysis due to the lack of controlled clinical trials. Because all studies were observational with no control group and methods were heterogeneous for scoring women, setting criteria for starting therapy, defining remission, and collecting information on adverse events, we found no objective element allowing recommending one protocol rather than another.

Conclusion

Objective comparison should be addressed in the scope of comparative trials organised at the national or even international level. However their feasibility is highly problematic for rare diseases such as GTD. International collaborative works should be encouraged to reduce practice variations and allow a better comparability between strategies.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^e3e432bf]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite that functions as a folic acid antagonist. MTX can be administered over a wide dose range, from 20 mg/m 2 orally per week in maintenance chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to a high intravenous dose of 33,000 mg/m 2, when combined with folinic acid (FA) rescue. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) therapy given intravenously, defined as doses of 500 mg/m 2 or higher, can cause significant toxicity. To prevent toxicity, intravenous hydration with urine alkalinization and pharmacokinetically guided FA rescue is used in conjunction with HD-MTX therapy.

Despite supportive care, HD-MTX can induce nephrotoxicity, resulting in the accumulation of toxic concentrations of MTX, delayed elimination, and an increased risk of severe toxic adverse events. Prolonged MTX exposure can cause myelosuppression, mucositis, hepatotoxicity, and, in severe cases, multi-organ failure. MTX can also cause acute, subacute, and long-term neurotoxicity, which has been reported in 3.8 to 15.5% of ALL patients receiving HD-MTX. Increased toxicity after HD-MTX has been attributed to the use of inadequate FA doses and to a delay in commencing FA rescue. However, the minimum duration and dose of FA rescue needed to prevent excess toxicity after HD-MTX remains unclear. Furthermore, the use of higher doses of FA after HD-MTX has been associated with an increased risk of leukemic relapse.

In the present study, we describe a series of 44 patients with pediatric ALL who received a total of 350 courses of 5 g/m 2 HD-MTX followed by a pharmacokinetically guided FA rescue, including only one or two 15 mg/m 2 doses in the case of rapid MTX clearance, with respect to clinical toxicity and length of hospital stay due to the HD-MTX therapy.

2.3 Recommended Dosage for Rheumatoid Arthritis

The recommended starting dosage of JYLAMVO is 7.5 mg orally once weekly with escalation to achieve optimal response. Dosages of more than 20 mg once weekly result in an increased risk of serious adverse reactions, including myelosuppression. When responses are observed, the majority occur between 3 and 6 weeks from initiation of treatment; however, responses have occurred up to 12 weeks after treatment initiation.

High-dose methotrexate treatment and folinic acid rescue

The NOPHO ALL-2000 chemotherapy regimen included a total of eight courses of HD-MTX at 5 g/m 2 with intrathecal MTX and FA rescue; further details of the study protocol have been published elsewhere. According to the protocol, 10% of the HD-MTX dose was given during the first hour and the remaining 90% over the following 23 h. Intrathecal MTX was given just before the MTX infusion according to national practice. Intravenous hydration with 125 mL/m 2 /h, including 50 mmol/L of NaHCO 3, was started at least 12 h before the commencement of the MTX infusion, according to national practice, and it was continued until serum MTX (S-MTX) had decreased to ≤ 0.2 μmol/L. Intravenous hydration was increased to 4500 mL/m 2 /24 h if S-MTX was ≥ 3 μmol/L at 36 h. Urine pH was measured at every voiding, and additional intravenous NaHCO 3 was administered if the pH was < 7. S-MTX was monitored in all patients at 23, 36, 42, and 48 h from the onset of the MTX infusion and at least twice daily thereafter until S-MTX reached ≤ 0.2 μmol/L. S-MTX levels were measured with a fluorescence polarization immunoassay.

FA rescue with leucovorin commenced 42 h from the start of the MTX-infusion with a dose of 15 mg/m 2. The local guidelines recommended 15 mg/m 2 FA 42 h from the onset of the MTX infusion and every 6 h thereafter until the plasma MTX concentration is ≤ 0.2 μmol/L. Although the guidelines related to HD-MTX courses given as a part of NOPHO ALL-2000 therapy generally recommended at least three doses of FA regardless of MTX clearance speed, the local guidelines used in the hospitals participating in the present study gave no recommendation regarding the minimum number of FA doses. This resulted in only one or two FA doses being administered, if S-MTX had decreased to ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at 42 or 48 h. If the MTX concentration was ≥ 1 μmol/L at 42 h or later, the FA doses are adjusted, as shown in Table 1.

Methotrexate in psoriasis therapy — Table III recommendations: Methotrexate is recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in adults. Methotrexate is less effective than adalimumab and infliximab for cutaneous psoriasis. Methotrexate is efficacious for treatment of psoriatic arthritis (peripheral arthritis, but not for axial involvement); in psoriatic arthritis, the efficacy of methotrexate is lower than tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitors. Recommended methotrexate dosage typically ranges from 7.5 to 25 mg weekly, and the dose can be given as a single dose or in 3 doses over 24 hours. Methotrexate can be administered orally or subcutaneously. A test dose should be considered, especially in patients with impaired kidney function. Administration of folic acid or folinic acid is recommended to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) and hepatic adverse effects, and large folic acid and folinic acid doses may reduce the efficacy of methotrexate. Combination therapy with methotrexate and narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy can be considered for adult patients with generalized plaque psoriasis to enhance efficacy and lower cumulative doses of both treatments.

Methotrexate clearance

If the MTX concentration result was available within 6 h of sampling, patients with S-MTX levels ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at 42 h received only one dose of FA, while those with S-MTX levels ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at 48 h received two doses according to the protocol. Rapid MTX clearance resulting in only one or two FA doses being administered followed 181 courses of HD-MTX (51.7%). Only a single dose of FA was given following 55 HD-MTX courses (15.7%). Figure 1a shows the number of courses with rapid MTX clearance per child. An average of 4.1 (± 2.0) courses per patient was followed by rapid MTX clearance. There were only three patients without rapid MTX clearance in any course and no patient with rapid MTX clearance throughout all eight courses. Figure 1b shows the percentage of patients with rapid MTX clearance following each HD-MTX course.

Fig. 1

Data was missing for one course of high-dose methotrexate in two different patients. b Percentage of patients with rapid methotrexate clearance (serum methotrexate ≤ 0.2 μmol/L at hour 42 or hour 48) in different courses. Data was missing for one patient regarding the first course (1) of high-dose methotrexate and for one patient regarding the last course (8)

The overall mean steady-state concentration at 23 h (throughout HD-MTX courses 1 to 8) did not differ significantly between courses with and without rapid MTX clearance (50.5 vs. 54.1 μmol/L, p = 0.213). However, the mean 23-h steady-state concentration differed between courses with rapid and non-rapid MTX clearance in HD-MTX courses 1 (51.7 vs 71.2 μmol/L, p < 0.05), 2 (42.7 vs 62.9 μmol/L, p < 0.01), and 6 (46.7 vs 33.4 μmol/L, p < 0.05). The 23-h steady-state concentration was not affected by age or gender. Delayed elimination was observed in 15 courses (4.3%).

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^14e4572f]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

FA is used to neutralize the effect of MTX on healthy cells after prolonged exposure. It has been reported to be especially effective against mucous membrane and gastrointestinal toxicity, hematological toxicity, and neurotoxicity. Elevated MTX-to-FA ratios at 42 h reportedly increase the risk for leukoencephalopathy. Cohen suggested that neurotoxicity observed after HD-MTX is mainly due to inadequate FA rescue and that FA rescue should commence 24–36 h after MTX exposure. Cohen also stated that higher doses of FA could explain the reduced incidence of neurotoxicity in some protocols. Our study suggests that the pharmacokinetics of MTX following HD-MTX therapy may play a more important role regarding the subsequent toxic effects than the starting time or dosing of FA rescue. The finding of HD-MTX courses with rapid MTX clearance followed by only one or two doses of FA started 42 h from the initiation of HD-MTX infusion being associated with acceptable toxicity might also be explained by spontaneous recovery of folate metabolism, which has been observed by Frickel et al. who reported spontaneously increased levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate 42 h after a 24-h infusion of 5 g/m 2 HD-MTX.

Psoriasis — folate supplementation during methotrexate therapy states that concomitant supplementation with folic acid is recommended to decrease the rate of adverse effects, with folate typically given daily except for the days in which methotrexate is given to avoid influencing efficacy. Folic acid or folinic acid has been reported to decrease hepatic laboratory abnormalities and GI adverse effects in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, whether hematologic adverse effects are reduced is uncertain, there is no difference in efficacy between folinic acid and folic acid but folic acid is less expensive, and pooled studies could not analyze efficacy effects overall though folinic acid may slightly decrease methotrexate efficacy in psoriasis.

5.12	Folic Acid Supplementation

Neoplastic Diseases

Products containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Avoid use of products containing folic acid or folinic acid unless clinically indicated [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Non-neoplastic Diseases

Folate deficiency may increase methotrexate adverse reactions. Administer folic acid or folinic acid to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and psoriasis [see Dosage and Administration (2.10, 2.11, 2.12)].

5.13	Secondary Malignancies

Secondary malignancies can occur at all dose levels of methotrexate. In some cases, lymphoproliferative disease that occurred during therapy with low-dose methotrexate regressed completely following withdrawal of methotrexate. If lymphoproliferative disease occurs, discontinue Methotrexate for Injection and institute appropriate treatment if lymphoma does not regress.

5.14	Tumor Lysis Syndrome

Methotrexate can induce tumor lysis syndrome in patients with rapidly growing tumors. Institute appropriate treatment for prevention and management of tumor lysis syndrome.

5.15	Immunization and Risks Associated with Live Vaccines

Immunization during Methotrexate for Injection treatment may be ineffective. Disseminated infections following administration of live vaccines have been reported.

Update immunizations according to immunization guidelines prior to initiating Methotrexate for Injection. Immunization with live vaccines is not recommended during treatment. The interval between live vaccinations and initiation of Methotrexate for Injection should be in accordance with current vaccination guidelines for patients on immunosuppressive therapies.

5.16	Infertility

Based on published reports, methotrexate can cause impairment of fertility, oligospermia, and menstrual dysfunction. It is not known if the infertility may be reversible in affected patients. Discuss the risk of effects on reproduction with female and male patients of reproductive potential [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].

5.17	Increased Risk of Adverse Reactions Due to Third Space Accumulation

Methotrexate can exit slowly from third space accumulations resulting in prolonged terminal plasma half-life and toxicity. Evacuate significant third-space accumulations prior to Methotrexate for Injection administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.18	Increased Risk of Soft Tissue and Bone Toxicity with Concomitant Radiotherapy

Concomitant radiation therapy increases the risk of soft tissue necrosis and osteonecrosis associated with methotrexate.

5.19	Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions with Medication Errors

Serious adverse reactions, including death, have occurred due to medication errors. Most commonly, these errors occurred in patients who were taking methotrexate daily when a weekly dosing regimen was prescribed. Ensure that patients receive the recommended dosage, because medication errors have led to death.

### Relative risk of and determinants for adverse events of methotrexate prescribed at a low dose: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized placebo-controlled trials [^9d18d6eb]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Low-dose (i.e. ≤ 30 mg per week) methotrexate is widely prescribed by dermatologists. However, there is limited evidence-based information regarding the relative risk of and determinants for adverse events associated with this treatment. The aims of this review were to assess the relative risk of and the determinants for adverse events associated with low-dose methotrexate exposure. A systematic review was undertaken using the MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL databases. Randomized controlled trials comparing low-dose methotrexate with placebo were eligible. Random effect meta-analyses were conducted to assess the risk ratios (RRs) of adverse events associated with methotrexate exposure. Subgroup analyses and random effect meta-regressions were performed to examine the determinants of adverse events. In total, 68 trials (6938 participants) were included. Compared with placebo, low-dose methotrexate slightly increased the risk of adverse events (mean number per individual: 1·78 ± 2·00 in the methotrexate group, 1·53 ± 1·89 in the placebo group; P < 0·001), including nausea/vomiting, elevated transaminase levels, mucosal ulcerations, leucopenia, thrombopenia and infectious events, but not the risk of serious adverse events or death. Low-dose methotrexate also increased the number of withdrawals from studies because of adverse events [RR 1·32 (1·13–1·53)]. The concomitant prescription of folic/folinic acid was associated with a significant lower risk of any adverse events, and methotrexate prescribed orally was associated with a higher risk of abdominal pain than when prescribed subcutaneously or by intramuscular injection. On the other hand, the risk of adverse events did not increase with the weekly dose or with duration of exposure. Similar studies comparing methotrexate with other systemic/biological treatments are needed.

### Folinic acid rescue during methotrexate treatment for low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia-how much is just right? [^a1399c22]. Gynecologic Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcomes of patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) treated with 8-day methotrexate (MTX) with two different regimens of folinic acid (FA).

Methods

Retrospective cohort study of low-risk GTN followed at Rio de Janeiro Federal University, from January/2000-December/2019 with 8-day MTX with FA at 0.1 mg/kg versus 15 mg fixed dose.

Results

Among 667 patients with low-risk GTN, 323 were treated with FA at 0.1 mg/kg and 142 with FA at 15 mg fixed dose. The weight-based and fixed dose groups were comparable in terms of clinical profile but did differ in the hCG pretreatment level (8883 versus 5127 IU/L, p < 0.01) and FIGO risk score 5/6 (3.4% versus 18.3%, p < 0.01), respectively. Despite this, there was no difference in the remission rate in first-line treatment (76.8 versus 81%, p = 0.33), although FA at 0.1 mg/kg had a significantly higher number of chemotherapy cycles to remission (5 versus 4, p < 0.01), need to delay chemotherapy due to toxicity (6.8 versus 2.8%, p < 0.01) and time to remission, (12 versus 8 weeks, p < 0.01), respectively. A logistic regression analysis showed that the different FA rescue regimens appeared comparable in terms of achieving remission in first-line chemotherapy for low-risk GTN (OR:5.16, CI95%:0.84–31.64, p = 0.08).

Conclusion

FA with 15 mg fixed dose as compared to 0.1 mg/kg of FA was associated with similar primary remission rate, relapse or death among low-risk GTN treated with 8-day MTX. This regimen is highly practical, reduces visits to health facilities, appears equally safe and may be preferable with the 8-day MTX regimen in the treatment of low-risk GTN.

### Folate supplementation during methotrexate therapy for rheumatoid arthritis [^42b66338]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX), an antifolate, is an anchor drug for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Both folic acid (FA) and folinic acid (FLN) supplements have been shown to reduce the toxicity of MTX when used in RA therapy. The effect of folate supplementation on MTX efficacy still needs to be studied. FA supplementation has been found to have a beneficial effect on homocysteine (hcy) metabolism and may prevent the formation of the less effective metabolite 7-hydroxy-MTX. The cost of FA supplements is substantially less than the cost of FLN supplements. This article reviews clinical trials related to folate supplementation during MTX therapy for RA.

### Extracorporeal treatment for methotrexate poisoning: systematic review and recommendations from the EXTRIP workgroup [^60bf0f14]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate is used in the treatment of many malignancies, rheumatological diseases, and inflammatory bowel disease. Toxicity from use is associated with severe morbidity and mortality. Rescue treatments include intravenous hydration, folinic acid, and, in some centers, glucarpidase. We conducted systematic reviews of the literature following published EXtracorporeal TReatments In Poisoning (EXTRIP) methods to determine the utility of extracorporeal treatments in the management of methotrexate toxicity. The quality of the evidence and the strength of recommendations (either "strong" or "weak/conditional") were graded according to the GRADE approach. A formal voting process using a modified Delphi method assessed the level of agreement between panelists on the final recommendations. A total of 92 articles met inclusion criteria. Toxicokinetic data were available on 90 patients (89 with impaired kidney function). Methotrexate was considered to be moderately dialyzable by intermittent hemodialysis. Data were available for clinical analysis on 109 patients (high-dose methotrexate [> 0.5 g/m 2]: 91 patients; low-dose [≤ 0.5 g/m 2]: 18). Overall mortality in these publications was 19.5% and 26.7% in those with high-dose and low-dose methotrexate-related toxicity, respectively. Although one observational study reported lower mortality in patients treated with glucarpidase compared with those treated with hemodialysis, there were important limitations in the study. For patients with severe methotrexate toxicity receiving standard care, the EXTRIP workgroup: (1) suggested against extracorporeal treatments when glucarpidase is not administered; (2) recommended against extracorporeal treatments when glucarpidase is administered; and (3) recommended against extracorporeal treatments instead of administering glucarpidase. The quality of evidence for these recommendations was very low. Rationales for these recommendations included: (1) extracorporeal treatments mainly remove drugs in the intravascular compartment, whereas methotrexate rapidly distributes into cells; (2) extracorporeal treatments remove folinic acid; (3) in rare cases where fast removal of methotrexate is required, glucarpidase will outperform any extracorporeal treatment; and (4) extracorporeal treatments do not appear to reduce the incidence and magnitude of methotrexate toxicity.

### Safety and benefits of interventions to increase folate status in malaria-endemic areas [^4f090d70]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Although folic acid is the first choice for supplementation or fortification because of its stability and low cost, several commercially available derivates from natural folates have been proposed as possible alternatives to folic acid for supplementation (Pietrzik et al, 2010). 5‐methyl‐THF is available as its calcium salt, and has comparable bioavailability, physiological activity and ability to improve folate status at equimolar doses as folic acid (Pietrzik et al, 2010). Folinic acid (5‐formyl‐THF; leucovorin), which has similar vitamin activity, is administered in conjunction with methotrexate, an antifolate used in the therapy of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. When used against cancer, methotrexate is administered by infusion in high doses that are life threatening. Folinic acid therapy is started sometime after initiation of methotrexate therapy to terminate the toxic effects of methotrexate ('rescue therapy'). As with folic acid, folinic acid is metabolized in the intestinal mucosa and liver to 5‐methyl‐THF, even at high oral doses (Schalhorn & Kühl, 1992; Stern et al, 2000). Not surprisingly, there are concerns that the use of folic acid or folinic acid can lead to reduced efficacy of methotrexate (e.g. Khanna et al, 2005; Baggott & Morgan, 2008).

Thus, irrespective of the form or dose of the folate derivate administered, 5‐methyl‐THF monoglutamate is by far the predominant circulating form of exogenous folate available for cellular uptake. It passes cellular membranes either through the reduced folate carrier or by an endocytotic process mediated by folate receptors (Kamen et al, 1988) and acts intracellularly as a methyl donor in the methionine cycle that produces tetrahydrofolate and methionine (Fig 1). Intracellular 5‐methyl‐THF and many other folate coenzymes are conjugated to a polyglutamate chain, which accounts for their intracellular retention. In addition, the enzymes involved in folate metabolism have higher affinity for folate polyglutamates.

### Folate metabolism: a re-emerging therapeutic target in haematological cancers [^2c4e2d07]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Approaches to minimise MTX toxicity

Combination treatments of MTX with leucovorin (folinic acid), or lower doses of MTX, are strategies that have been developed to minimise adverse effects. Nevertheless, low-dose MTX has been reported to cause pneumonitis and leukoencephalopathy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, where MTX is a standardised treatment. Leucovorin is a structural analogue of MTX, thus it can compete for membrane transport, polyglutamation and binding to DHFR. However, as it does not require reduction by DHFR, it can restore reduced folate pool even in the presence of MTX. MTX polyglutamates have the tendency to persist in malignant and normal cells even after the removal of extracellular MTX, making the addition of leucovorin essential for the rescue of normal tissues. Nonetheless, in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that high doses of leucovorin associate to higher risk of relapse possibly by rescuing malignant cells from the effect of high-dose MTX. Skärby et al. using the Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology database showed that high doses of leucovorin during a high-dose MTX regime correlated with an increased risk of relapse in ALL patients. Surprisingly, these patients demonstrated high plasma MTX levels and longer elimination time, which normally correlate with a better prognosis.

### Progression of osteosarcoma after high-dose methotrexate: over-rescue by folinic acid [^d2956c99]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2003). Low credibility.

A 16-year-old girl with a distal femur osteosarcoma became pain-free with the first treatment of methotrexate 12.5 g/m(2) and folinic acid 760 mg/m(2). She was inadvertently given 1275 mg folinic acid after the third dose. Four days later, pain and swelling recurred. Appreciating that this was "over rescue" rather than drug resistance led to the successful use of a further 8 doses of high-dose methotrexate when a suboptimal response was achieved with cisplatinum, Adriamycin, and ifosfamide. This is the first time "over rescue" has been documented in humans from high-dose folinic acid after methotrexate.

### What can clinicians learn from therapeutic studies about the treatment of acute oral methotrexate poisoning? [^cc75bef9]. Clinical Toxicology (2017). Low credibility.

Context

Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-folate drug that has been utilized in both malignant and chronic inflammatory conditions. Doctors are often concerned with a potential adverse outcome when managing patients with acute oral MTX poisoning given its potential for serious adverse reactions at therapeutic doses. However, there is surprisingly little data from acute poisoning cases and more data from the therapeutic use of high-dose MTX.

Objectives

To review pharmacokinetic and pharmacological properties of MTX and systematically review series of acute MTX poisonings and therapeutic studies on high-dose MTX that provide pharmacokinetic or clinical data.

Methods

An Embase (1974-October 2016) and Medline (1946-October 2016) search was performed by combining "MTX" and "overdose/poison" or "MTX" and "toxicity" or "MTX" and "high-dose MTX" or "MTX" and "bioavailability" or "pharmacokinetics"; 25, 135, 109 and 365 articles were found, respectively, after duplicates were removed. There were 15 papers that provided clinical data on acute ingestion and toxicity that occurred with low-dose administration. Eighteen papers were on high-dose MTX (> 1g per m 2 body surface area) used as a single chemotherapy agent which provided pharmacokinetic or clinical data on MTX toxicity. Thirty papers were reviewed to determine the toxic dose, pharmacokinetics, risk factors, clinical symptoms and management of acute MTX toxicity. Given the limited acute poisoning data, a retrospective audit was performed through the consultant records of the New South Wales Poisons Information Centre from April 2004 to July 2015 to examine the clinical syndrome and toxicity of acute oral MTX poisoning. Pharmacokinetics: Reduced MTX bioavailability is a result of saturable absorption. Although maximal bioavailable absorption occurs at a dose of ∼15mgm -2, splitting the dose increases bioavailability. MTX clearance is proportional to renal function. Acute toxicity: Oncologists prescribe doses up to 12gm -2 of MTX. Patients treated with an intravenous dose of MTX < 1gm -2 do not require folinic acid rescue. MTX toxicity correlates better with duration and extent of exposure than peak serum concentration. Acute oral poisoning: Acute oral MTX poisoning in 177 patients did not report any severe toxicity. In the New South Wales Poisons Information Centre audit data (2004–2015), 51 cases of acute MTX poisoning were reported, of which 15 were accidental paediatric ingestions. The median reported paediatric ingestion was 50mg (IQR: 10–100; range: 10–150) with a median age of 2 years (IQR: 2–2; range: 1–4). Of the 36 patients with acute deliberate MTX poisoning, median age and dose were 47 years (IQR: 31–62; range: 10–85) and 325mg (IQR: 85–500; range: 40–1000), respectively. Of the 19 patients who had serum MTX concentrations measured, all were significantly below the concentrations used in oncology and the folinic acid rescue nomogram line and no patient reported adverse sequelae. Management of acute oral poisoning: Due to the low bioavailability of MTX, treatment is not necessary for single ingestions. Oral folinic acid may be used to lower the bioavailability further with large ingestions > 1gm -2. Oral followed by intravenous folinic acid may be used in patients with staggered ingestion > 36h or patients with acute overdose and renal impairment (eGFR < 45mL/min/1.73m 2).

Conclusions

As a consequence of saturable absorption MTXs bioavailability is so low that neither accidental paediatric MTX ingestion nor acute deliberate MTX overdose causes toxicity. An acute oral overdose will not provide a bioavailable dose even close to 1gm -2 of parenteral MTX. Hence, no treatment is required in acute ingestion unless the patient has renal failure or staggered ingestion. There is also no need to monitor MTX concentrations in acute oral MTX poisoning.

Methotrexate — folate supplementation: "Although the majority of experts recommend that all patients treated with methotrexate receive folate supplementation (1–5 mg/d given daily except the day of methotrexate), others will add folate only if a patient develops gastrointestinal side effects or early bone-marrow toxicity as manifested by an increased mean corpuscular volume." If toxicity occurs despite folate, "increasing the dose of folate may be helpful." A literature review "suggests that low-dose folate supplementation may reduce the hematologic, gastrointestinal, and hepatic side effects of methotrexate without decreasing the efficacy," though "one small controlled study in patients with psoriasis using folic acid at 5 mg daily suggested that there may be a slight decrease in efficacy." "The optimal dosage of folic acid is still to be determined."

5.8 Renal Toxicity

Methotrexate can cause renal toxicity, including irreversible acute renal failure [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor renal function at baseline, periodically during treatment and as clinically indicated. Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets for severe renal toxicity taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

Administer glucarpidase in patients with toxic plasma methotrexate concentrations (> 1 micromole per liter) and delayed methotrexate clearance due to impaired renal function. Refer to the glucarpidase prescribing information for additional information.

5.9 Risk of Serious Adverse Reactions with Medication Error

Deaths occurred in patients as a result of medication errors. Most commonly, these errors occurred in patients who were taking methotrexate daily when a weekly dosing regimen was prescribed.

For patients prescribed a once weekly dosing regimen, instruct patients and caregivers to take the recommended dosage as directed, because medication errors have led to death.

5.10 Folic Acid Supplementation

Neoplastic Diseases

Products containing folic acid or its derivatives may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Therefore, instruct patients not to take products containing folic acid or folinic acid unless directed to do so by their healthcare provider.

Non-neoplastic Diseases

Folate deficiency may increase methotrexate adverse reactions. Administer folic acid or folinic acid for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, pJIA, and psoriasis [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, 2.5)].

5.11 Serious Infections

Patients treated with methotrexate are at increased risk for developing life-threatening or fatal bacterial, fungal, or viral infections, including opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, invasive fungal infections, hepatitis B reactivation, tuberculosis primary infection or reactivation, and disseminated Herpes zoster and cytomegalovirus infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Monitor patients for infection during and after treatment with methotrexate tablets. Withhold or discontinue methotrexate tablets for serious infections taking into account the importance of methotrexate tablets treatment in the context of the severity of the disease being treated, the severity of the adverse drug reaction, and availability of alternative therapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

### Folinic acid prophylaxis and dose adjustments enable safe treatment with pemetrexed in patients with renal impairment [^107a724f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment

In this study, pemetrexed dose is based on renal function (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration, CKD‐EPI equation), and calculated to reach a target AUC as described above. The pemetrexed dose for each patient was calculated according to Eq. 1 at each cycle (based on a validated population pharmacokinetic model) to reach a target AUC of 164 mg*h/L.

This equation includes total body weight in kilograms and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in mL/min corrected for individual BSA. Doses were rounded to the nearest 5 mg. Dose escalation steps were 10–33–66–100% of the dose for Cohort 1, escalated per cycle. The dose of 100% was defined as the dose that would result in an AUC of 164 mg*h/L.

Patients received standard vitamin supplementation (folic acid and vitamin B12) and dexamethasone according to the pemetrexed drug label. Oral folinic acid prophylaxis was initiated 24 hours after administration of pemetrexed in a dose of 45 mg four times daily on Days 2–15 of each 21‐day cycle. In case of ≥ 2 DLT in the two n = 3 cohorts, use of prophylactic granulocyte‐colony stimulating factor (G‐CSF) per protocol was permitted in an expansion cohort.

The rationale of the folinic acid strategy is based on several considerations. Comparable oral doses of 30‐45 mg four times daily are used in preventing toxicity from methotrexate, a more potent inhibitor of DHFR. The 24 hours' time interval ensures an efficacy window in malignant cells. Our previous validated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis in patients with adequate and impaired renal function using a neutropenia model for pemetrexed showed that 95% of patients in the lowest renal function group (eGFR of 5 mL/min) have pemetrexed concentrations below the established toxicity threshold after 10.6 days. Therefore, we postulate that 14 days of treatment with folinic acid is sufficient to prevent haematotoxicity.

Safety and laboratory measurements

Hematological laboratory measurements were performed according to the drug label and expected nadir in the dose escalation cycles. Treatment delay was allowed in case of grade III/IV toxicity; dose reductions were not permitted. Treatment with pemetrexed was discontinued if a patient experienced a DLT that did not resolve without intervention within 1 week. In case of persistent grade IV hematological toxicity, intravenous administration of 100 mg/m 2 folinic acid every 6 hours until toxicity resolved was permitted. The AUC of pemetrexed was estimated using a validated limited sampling strategy.

### Methotrexate-induced nausea in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis [^fd8a96e3]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Folate supplementation for MTX-induced nausea

Folic acid (vitamin B9) and folinic acid (5-formyl tetrahydrofolate) are forms of folate that can be taken orally to attempt to reduce MTX toxicities. Both are able to function in biosynthetic pathways that are independent of the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme that MTX inhibits as part of its mechanism of action. It is thought that folic acid and folinic acid help to reduce the adverse effects of MTX by replenishing depleted intracellular folate levels that occur in hepatocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients treated with MTX. However, because the exact mechanisms of action of MTX in the treatment of arthritis are unknown, there is some concern that folate supplementation may reduce the efficacy of MTX, especially if the antirheumatic effects are mediated partially through folate antagonism.

Folate supplementation in JIA has been examined in a few published studies. In a randomized double blind placebo controlled crossover trial of 19 children with juvenile arthritis receiving MTX, each subject received either folic acid or placebo for 12 weeks to observe the impact of folic acid supplementation on the efficacy of MTX. It was determined that 1 mg/day of folic acid did not result in increased disease activity. The effects of folic acid on MTX-induced nausea were not assessed. A retrospective chart review of 43 children with juvenile arthritis who initiated folinic acid supplementation following the development of adverse effects of MTX demonstrated that folinic acid significantly reduced GI-associated symptoms from a mean of 1.09 episodes per patient-year to a mean 0.29 episodes per patient-year. When starting MTX for the first time, 67% of respondents in the UK pediatric rheumatology provider survey reported always or often (> 50% of the time) concurrently starting folic acid.

Folate supplementation in adult patients receiving methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis was the subject of a recently published Cochrane Review. A meta-analysis of 6 randomized controlled trials revealed a significant risk reduction for nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (RR 0.74 [95% CI 0.59 to 0.92]) with the use of folate supplementation compared to placebo. Folate supplementation did not appear to have any effect on the efficacy of MTX as measured by tender and swollen joint counts and physician global assessment scores. The results of the review did not show any definite clinical advantage of one form of folate supplementation over the other. However, because folic acid is considerably less expensive than folinic acid, folic acid is probably the more cost-effective therapy.

### Reduced dose folinic acid rescue after rapid high-dose methotrexate clearance is not associated with increased toxicity in a pediatric cohort [^12fb1be8]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Glomerular hyperfiltration was common in the subgroup of patients with the result of glomerular filtration rate measurement available, which is in accordance with earlier reports on children with cancer. However, hyperfiltration was equally common in both clearance groups in the present cohort.

There have been concerns that the carry-over effect of FA could decrease the antileukemic effect of HD-MTX therapy. According to Sterba and colleagues, high pretreatment folate concentrations were associated with lower MTX exposure when measured with homocysteine accumulation. In an earlier Nordic study, higher FA doses were associated with a higher risk of relapse. On the other hand, courses with rapid MTX clearance might confer less antileukemic effect due to shortened exposure to MTX. Indeed, in other protocols, shortening HD-MTX infusion times has been shown to increase the risk of relapse. The importance of lowering and postponing the FA dose is still unclear, but it is tempting to assume that a shorter and lower FA rescue had a positive impact on the overall antileukemic effectiveness of the therapy in the present cohort, considering that the EFS and OS were excellent, although the sample size was small and the three early relapses were excluded from the study. Nevertheless, in light of the present study, a reduced FA rescue appears adequate in the context of rapid MTX clearance after HD-MTX infusion. Determining whether extended prehydration plays a role in the rapid MTX clearance and the low incidence of delayed elimination in the present population requires further study.

### Methotrexate inhibition of bone mineral density increase in growing rabbits: prevention by folinic acid [^dce471fa]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Methotrexate (MTX) action on bone metabolism is as yet not completely understood. The results of clinical studies are controversial, since it is difficult to distinguish the side effects of MTX from those of the primary disease. This study assessed the effect of MTX, with and without folinic acid supplementation, on bone mineral density in growing normal rabbits.

Methods

Three groups of young NZW growing female rabbits were treated with: saline (n = 6) or MTX (0.25 mg/kg/week, n = 5) or MTX (same dose as above) plus folinic acid (0.25 mg/kg/week, n = 6) for a period of 3 months. The dose, duration and frequency of MTX administration were similar to the treatment of RA patients. The animals were submitted to dual-energy absorptiometry densitometry (HologicQDR 2000) before and after treatment; total body and L4-L5 BMD were evaluated. Histomorphometric analysis (L4 vertebrae) was also performed.

Results

Growing control rabbits showed increased total body BMD from a baseline of 0.180 ± 0.006 to 0.198 ± 0.007 gm/cm2 (mean ± S.E.M, p < 0.006). In contrast, no increase in BMD (0.182 ± 0.006 versus a baseline of 0.184 ± 0.004, ns) was observed in the group treated with MTX, while the addition of folinic acid resulted in an increase in BMD values similar to controls, from a baseline of 0.181 ± 0.004 to 0.198 ± 0.003, p < 0.02), thus preventing adverse MTX bone effects. Average percent variations in BMD were +7.7%, -1% and +8.4% respectively. Spine (L4-L5) BMD showed analogous results, in line with the histomorphometric data.

Conclusion

These results strongly support a deleterious action of MTX on bone metabolism, which is prevented by folinic acid supplementation. The potential clinical implications of our data are particularly significant for paediatric therapy.

### The effect of folate supplementation on methotrexate efficacy and toxicity in psoriasis patients and folic acid use by dermatologists in the USA [^5325c54f]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective treatment for psoriasis but its use is limited by its toxicity. Folate supplementation can be used to reduce the adverse effects of MTX, though this may impact efficacy. The frequency of folic acid supplementation is not well characterized.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to review the literature involving the use of folate in patients (in particular those with psoriasis) treated with MTX and analyze trends in folic acid use.

Methods

We searched PubMed from 1 May 1989 through 1 April 2012 using the terms 'folic acid', 'folinic acid', 'folate', 'supplementation', and 'methotrexate'.We also used the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) database to collect data regarding trends in MTX use and folic acid supplementation by physicians in the USA from 1993 through 2009. We assessed data including the number of MTX visits, rate of folic acid use, diagnoses, physician specialty, and demographics of patients. We used linear regression to analyze the change in folic acid use over time.

Results

Twenty-six published trials were included addressing folic acid supplementation with MTX. The majority found a benefit to folic acid supplementation, but there were only seven studies in psoriasis. Dermatologists were among the highest prescribers of MTX, and psoriasis was commonly treated with MTX. Folic acid supplementation significantly increased over this time period (p < 0.0001). However, dermatologists ranked lowest for their folate use, co-prescribing folate to only 9.1% of MTX-treated patients.

Limitations

In contrast to rheumatoid arthritis, there is a scarcity of literature describing the effect of folate on MTX toxicity and efficacy in psoriasis patients. NAMCS data only included outpatient visits to non-federally employed physicians, and there is the possibility of healthcare providers not documenting over-the-counter folic acid usage. Lastly, doses of MTX and folic acid were not recorded in the database.

Conclusion

Dermatologists were the least likely specialists to supplement MTX with folic acid. The evidence for supplementation of folic acid is mixed. The literature confirms a reduction in the adverse effects of MTX but less strongly that there may be a reduction in efficacy too. Keeping in mind the potential for folate to reduce MTX efficacy, folic acid supplementation should be considered in MTX-treated patients.

### MTXPK.org: a clinical decision support tool evaluating high-dose methotrexate pharmacokinetics to inform post-infusion care and use of glucarpidase [^b9df540f]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Currently, there is a lack of clinical tools for the identification of patients likely to experience delayed MTX clearance prior to the initiation of treatment or early after the infusion. As a result, response to patients with delayed MTX clearance tends to be reactive. Once concentrations rise above critical limits, rescue by folinic acid can be inadequate. 7 In such cases, glucarpidase, a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)‐approved exogenous enzyme, is administered as a rescue agent that rapidly hydrolyzes MTX into two inactive metabolites that are eliminated via renal and nonrenal pathways. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 The rapid hydrolysis by glucarpidase reduces plasma MTX concentrations by > 90% within 15 minutes of administration. 4, 14, 15, 16, 17 Glucarpidase is only indicated when MTX concentrations are > 2 SDs above the mean excretion curve specific for the given dose 10 in order to avoid underexposure to MTX and risk of relapse. Appropriate interpretation of the indication and administration of glucarpidase remains a challenge because many clinicians do not know the expected excretion curve and two times SD. As a result, a recent glucarpidase consensus guideline was published in an attempt to clarify the interpretation of the glucarpidase indication by providing a glucarpidase treatment algorithm that detailed MTX concentrations at select time points following a MTX infusion of several common dosing regimens. 11 Although beneficial, the clinical interpretation of MTX concentrations that do not correspond to the algorithm's time points prove to be a limitation of its use.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a web‐based clinical decision support tool that provides an MTX population pharmacokinetic (PK) model‐informed interpretation in tandem with the glucarpidase consensus guideline to facilitate the administration of glucarpidase in all patients receiving HD MTX, regardless of indication or age. Our aim was to develop a novel MTX population PK model using PK data from the Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) and evaluate it as a model for the web‐based clinical decision support tool, MTXPK.org. Although several PK models for HD MTX have been described, they may not describe patients with delayed clearance well because they are constructed from MTX concentrations only up to 44 hours after the start of MTX infusion. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 We hypothesize that our NOPHO PK model will better fit patients with delayed MTX clearance than currently available population PK models due to the dense PK sampling from patients with delayed MTX clearance with concentrations recorded up to 300 hours after the start of infusion.

### First line chemotherapy in low risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia [^bf47abff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) is a rare but curable disease. The incidence in Europe and North America is nearly 1.5 per 1000 live births but much higher rates are reported from Africa and Asia. The majority of the patients respond to evacuation of the uterus plus or minus chemotherapy, however, occasional patients will die. Patients are categorised into low or high risk groups using a variety of scoring systems. A large number of regimens are used worldwide in the management of low risk GTN; there are reports of 14 different regimens in the English literature. The choice of the regimen is usually dependent on geographic location, prior training and current experience with the specific regimen. Regimens have significant differences in the route of administration, hospitalisation and side effects and so have a bearing on healthcare cost. Patients are therefore exposed to different regimens with the potential for different response rates and different side effect profiles.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of first line chemotherapy in the treatment of low risk GTN.

Search Strategy

We electronically searched Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialized Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3 2008), MEDLINE and EMBASE in September 2008. We performed additional searching of online trial registers and conference proceedings. We cross examined article references to identify relevant papers not detected by the electronic search.

Selection Criteria

The review included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs and non-RCTs (cohort and case control studies (CCS)) for the treatment of low risk GTN.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review using a data extraction form. Meta-analysis was performed by pooling the relative risk (RR) of individual trials.

Main Results

Eight studies met the review entry criteria (n = 769). There were four RCTs and four CCS. Six different treatment regimens were identified; weekly methotrexate, 5-day methotrexate, 8-day methotrexate-folinic acid, "pulsed" dactinomycin, 5-day dactinomycin and the combination of methotrexate and dactinomycin. "Pulsed" dactinomycin was superior to weekly methotrexate in achieving primary cure without significantly increasing toxicity (three studies, RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.10 to 8.17, n = 392). Eight-day methotrexate-folinic acid did not show significant advantage over 5-day methotrexate both in reducing toxicity or primary cure rate (two studies, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.25, n = 169). The combination of methotrexate-dactinomycin resulted in significantly increased toxicity without significantly improving primary cure rate.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on the available evidence from the included RCTs, the authors conclude that "pulsed" dactinomycin is superior to weekly parenteral methotrexate at the reported dosages. However, the authors believe that rigorously designed, multicentred, randomised double-blind trials are required to evaluate other combinations of chemotherapy regimens, most importantly "pulsed" dactinomycin with the widely used 8-day methotrexate-folinic acid.

### Pegloticase (Krystexxa) [^91804992]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1	Important Administration Instructions

Precautions Prior to Treatment

It is recommended that before starting KRYSTEXXA patients discontinue oral urate-lowering medications and not institute therapy with oral urate-lowering agents while patients are on KRYSTEXXA therapy.

Monitoring Therapy: The risk of infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis, is higher in patients who have lost therapeutic response. Monitor serum uric acid levels prior to each infusion and discontinue treatment if levels increase to above 6 mg/dL, particularly when 2 consecutive levels above 6 mg/dL are observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

Infusion Reaction Precautions

KRYSTEXXA should be administered in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis. Observe patients for an appropriate period of time after administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].

Patients should receive pre-infusion medications (e.g., antihistamines, corticosteroids), to minimize the risk of infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis.

If an infusion reaction occurs during the administration of KRYSTEXXA, the infusion may be slowed, or stopped and restarted at a slower rate, at the discretion of the physician. Since infusion reactions can occur after completion of infusion, observation of patients for approximately an hour post-infusion should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Administration Precautions

Do not administer KRYSTEXXA as an intravenous push or bolus. KRYSTEXXA should only be administered by intravenous infusion. An infusion pump may be used for the Ready-to-Use vial. Gravity feed, syringe-type pump, or infusion pump may be used for the To-Be-Diluted vial [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

2.2	Recommended Dosage and Administration

The recommended dosage is KRYSTEXXA 8 mg given as an intravenous infusion every two weeks, co-administered with weekly oral methotrexate 15 mg and folic acid or folinic acid supplementation. KRYSTEXXA alone may be used in patients for whom methotrexate is contraindicated or not clinically appropriate.

If co-administering with methotrexate, start weekly methotrexate and folic acid or folinic acid supplementation at least 4 weeks prior to initiating, and throughout treatment with KRYSTEXXA [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for methotrexate.

The optimal treatment duration with KRYSTEXXA has not been established.

### Folate and retinal vascular diseases [^13f74463]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Folate Supplementation

External folate supplementation includes folic acid, L-methylfolate, folinic acid, etc. Mandatory folic acid fortification of grain products has been used in certain countries, such as Canada, and has succeeded in decreasing the rates of neural tube defects by 20%~50%. Folic acid supplementation has been proven to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. It is widely used to treat hyperhomocysteinemia and folate deficiency. It has been shown that daily folic acid supplementation of 0.5–5.0 mg folic acid could reduce plasma homocysteine levels by approximately a quarter to a third, typically in the western population. However, long-term consumption of folic acid supplementation is controversial. Due to the improvement in diet and volunteer intake of fortified food and supplements, some people may ingest excess folate (upper limit: 1 mg). In 2015, the WHO defined high folate status as plasma folate greater than 45.3 nmol/L. The imbalance of high folate status and low vitamin B12 could predispose pregnant women to diabetes and their offspring to insulin resistance. High folic acid intake may increase the risk of certain types of cancer, including colorectal cancer and prostate cancer. Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the controversial effect of folic acid on cancer risk. Some studies conclude that folic acid supplementation will not influence overall and site-specific cancer incidence. This controversy may be relevant to folate status, cancer stage, different baseline information, etc. More studies are still needed to explore the effect of folic acid supplementation on cancer risk. For retinal vascular diseases, a systematic review indicated that folic acid supplements (2.5 mg) could not prevent AMD and increased the risk of development of AMD. Another concern is that a high intake of folic acid may mask the appearance of vitamin B12 anemia and may interact with DHFR inhibitors such as methotrexate, making it less effective. A pilot study showed that a three-month vitamin supplementation containing L-methylfolate could significantly reduce plasma homocysteine levels in patients with diabetes. L-methylfolate is as effective as folic acid in improving folate status and less likely to mask the appearance of vitamin B12-induced anemia and interact with DHFR inhibitors. Although folate supplementation could effectively reduce plasma homocysteine levels, its roles in the reduction of intracellular homocysteine toxicity, the therapeutic effect, and the prevention of retinal vascular diseases remain uncertain. Moreover, it may even increase the risk of development of AMD or certain types of cancer. It can not be recommended unless the clear evidence of benefit is needed.

Methotrexate — folic acid supplementation and toxicity in rheumatoid arthritis — folic acid 5 mg/d or 27.5 mg/wk had no effect on drug efficacy but significantly reduced toxicity, and in a second study (n = 434) methotrexate-related toxicity led to discontinuation in 38% of placebo-treated patients vs 17% of those taking 1 to 2 mg/d folic acid, with no differences in treatment effectiveness; low-dose methotrexate increases plasma homocysteine, and concomitant folic or folinic acid lowered homocysteine vs placebo.

### Management of noninfectious posterior uveitis with intravitreal drug therapy [^d59c9674]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Intravitreal methotrexate appears to be a promising alternative to IVTA in unilateral diseases especially in phakic, steroid responders due to lower risk of increasing IOP and cataract formation. The extended remission effect by methotrexate in some patients should be explored in future studies. Thus far, studies have shown that intravitreal methotrexate alone may not be adequate to achieve remission in various uveitic entities and may be used as an adjunct with other forms of therapy. It is imperative to monitor the development of adverse events such as corneal decompensation, which may require treatment with topical folinic acid. Larger-scale and randomized controlled trials are definitely required for the establishment of efficacy and safety profile of intravitreal methotrexate. Contraindications to systemic methotrexate should also be observed.

### Fatal low-dose methotrexate toxicity: a case report and literature review [^e93ccca9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is a chemotherapeutic agent that acts primarily by inhibiting the folic acid cycle. In addition to its application for treating malignancies, MTX is also used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases including psoriasis. Adverse effects have been reported even at low doses (up to 25mg/week), and there is risk of toxicity in the form of myelosuppression, hepatotoxicity, or pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we report a case of a 67-year-old male with a past medical history of end stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis and moderate-to-severe psoriasis with psoriatic arthritis presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, rash, mucositis, and mucocutaneous ulcers and erosions. The patient was taking methotrexate 10mg weekly without folic acid supplementation and was found to be pancytopenic. Despite treatment, the patient developed multiorgan failure and passed away after 16days of hospitalization. Myelosuppression is considered the most serious side effect with the highest risk of mortality. Risk factors for toxicity include renal insufficiency, advanced age, lack of folate supplementation, drug interactions, and medication errors. Importantly, serum levels of MTX do not correlate with toxicity; therefore, folinic acid rescue therapy should be started as soon as MTX toxicity is suspected. MTX toxicity is rare with low dose, proper dose scheduling, and adherence to the recommended guidelines. It is imperative that physicians considering therapy with low dose MTX for dermatologic indications take into consideration a patient's risk factors for toxicity and monitor appropriately.

### Psoriatic flare after the concomitant administration of L-methylfolate and methotrexate [^5d9e18f6]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Psoriasis is a chronic disease that causes erythematous patches with silver plaques and scales, often drastically affecting the quality of life of those afflicted by this disease. Psoriasis is a hyperproliferative disease, which is thought to be the result of a dysregulated immune system, specifically overactive T lymphocytes, which release excess proinflammatory cytokines and result in hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. Treatment for psoriasis ranges from topical corticosteroids to systemic agents such as biologic immune suppressants. One such systemic agent, methotrexate, has been used to treat moderate to severe psoriasis for more than 40 years. Methotrexate inhibits key steps in the metabolism of folic acid, a vitamin that contributes to numerous metabolic pathways necessary for cell survival.

Folate or folinic acid is a B vitamin that is consumed in leafy greens or dietary supplements. These vitamins are necessary for crucial methylation reactions such as those seen in the synthesis of nitrogenous bases in DNA and RNA and to methylation reactions necessary for the production of amino acids and essential neurotransmitters. Metabolism of folic acid begins with its reduction into dihydrofolate and then tetrahydrofolate by dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Next, serine hydroxymethyltransferase converts tetrahydrofolate into 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate, which is converted to the metabolically active 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate (L-methylfolate) by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). Both the DHFR and the MTHFR genes are subject to numerous genetic differences that contribute to a variable rate of folate metabolism in the general population. Of note, methotrexate, which is used to treat cancers and autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, inhibits the DHRF enzyme, thereby preventing formation of active folate metabolites and inhibiting DNA replication and subsequent cell proliferation. In the case of psoriasis, methotrexate is thought to inhibit the growth of hyperproliferative T cells, preventing inflammatory damage to keratinocytes.

### Standardized supportive care documentation improves safety of high-dose methotrexate treatment [^6bf83336]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High‐dose (HD) methotrexate (MTX; defined as MTX dose > 500 mg/m 2) has been used for several decades as an important backbone in treatment protocols for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, osteosarcoma, and lymphoma [1, 2, 3]. MTX acts as folate antimetabolite and inhibits DNA synthesis by blocking the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. High doses of MTX are feasible by using folinic acid (syn, leucovorin, the reduced form of folic acid) to reduce the toxic effects upon nonmalignant cells as a "leucovorin rescue."

Notable toxicities of HD‐MTX are mucositis, myelosuppression, renal failure, liver injury, and neurotoxicity [4]. The risk of HD‐MTX toxicity is especially increased in the case of therapy‐induced renal failure because impaired renal function leads to reduced MTX renal clearance, which is the major route (90%) of MTX elimination [5]. Prolonged exposure to toxic MTX levels can induce severe myelosuppression and mucositis and is a life‐threatening condition. Avoidance of renal injury and the consecutive risk of impaired MTX clearance is therefore paramount to prevent MTX toxicity.

HD‐MTX administration demands specialized supportive care to prevent adverse events. This includes strict urine alkalinization and hyperhydration to increase MTX elimination and to prevent kidney damage as well as administration of leucovorin to reduce mucositis and myelosuppression [4, 6].

Urine alkalinization has been identified as a crucial aspect of MTX clearance and prevention of renal toxicity. At a urine pH of 5, the solubility of MTX is very low, and it can precipitate within renal tubuli, which induces severe kidney damage with the consequence of acute renal failure. In some cases, this condition will require hemodialysis. By raising the urine pH from 5 to 7.5, solubility of MTX increases about 20‐fold [4, 5, 6, 7]. Therefore, permanent and effective urine alkalinization and hyperhydration are absolutely mandatory for safe HD‐MTX treatment.

### Accidental methotrexate ingestion in a 19-month-old child [^48e04d93]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors present the youngest reported case of a single oral overdose of methotrexate in an otherwise well 19-month-old child who was treated with delayed folinic acid rescue. Initial history revealed possible ingestion of up to 10 tablets, each containing 2.5 mg of methotrexate. The peak methotrexate level was 0.67 µmol/l measured 8 h following ingestion. Depending on the protocol, methotrexate levels that remain greater than 0.05–0.1 µmol/l for 24–48 h are associated with risk of toxicity. No adverse sequelae were noted during hospital admission despite delayed folinic acid rescue and there was no evidence of myelosuppression for up to 3 weeks following the overdose.

### Weekly intravenous methotrexate with folinic acid for nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia [^61a83b3d]. Gynecologic Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to determine the complete response rate to weekly intravenous methotrexate at 100 mg/m(2) with folinic acid for patients with nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

Methods

From 1988 to 1999, 22 women with nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia were treated with weekly intravenous methotrexate with folinic acid at the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre. Complete response was defined as the attainment of a serum beta-hCG level < 5 IU/L for 3 consecutive weeks. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute of Canada-Clinical Trials Group criteria for chemotherapy toxicity.

Results

There were 10 women who achieved complete response with weekly intravenous methotrexate alone (45.5%). Of the 12 who did not achieve complete response with methotrexate, 10 received actinomycin D and 2 received EMA as second-line chemotherapy. Patients successfully treated with methotrexate required a median of 6.5 cycles (including 2 cycles for consolidation) to achieve complete response. The only significant prognostic factor for failure with methotrexate was pretreatment beta-hCG (P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Only a select group of patients with low pretreatment beta-hCG titers would be expected to achieve complete response with this regimen. Large randomized studies are required to determine the optimal treatment for nonmetastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.

### Impact of the methotrexate administration dose on the need for intrathecal treatment in children and adolescents with anaplastic large-cell lymphoma: results of a randomized trial of the EICNHL group [^a35ef70b]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and safety of two methotrexate doses and administration schedules in children with anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL).

Patients and Methods

This randomized trial for children with ALCL was based on the Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma-Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster 90 (NHL-BFM90) study protocol and compared six courses of methotrexate 1 g/m2 over 24 hours and an intrathecal injection (IT) followed by folinic acid rescue at 42 hours (MTX1 arm) with six courses of methotrexate 3 g/m2 over 3 hours followed by folinic acid rescue at 24 hours without IT (MTX3 arm). This trial involved most European pediatric/lymphoma study groups and a Japanese group.

Results

Overall, 352 patients (96% ALK positive) were recruited between 1999 and 2005; 175 were randomly assigned to the MTX1 arm, and 177 were assigned to the MTX3 arm. Ninety-two percent of patients received protocol treatment. Median follow-up time is 3.7 years. Event-free survival (EFS) curves were superimposed with 2-year EFS rates (73.6% and 74.5% in the MTX1 and MTX3 arms, respectively; hazard ratio = 0.98; 91.76% CI, 0.69 to 1.38). Two-year overall survival rates were 90.1% and 94.9% in MTX1 and MTX3, respectively. Only two CNS relapses occurred (both in the MTX1 arm). Toxicity was assessed after 2,050 courses and included grade 4 hematologic toxicity after 79% and 64% of MTX1 and MTX3 courses, respectively (P < .0001); infection after 50% and 32% of courses, respectively (P < .0001); and grade 3 to 4 stomatitis after 21% and 6% of courses, respectively (P < .0001).

Conclusion

The results of the NHL-BFM90 study were reproduced in this large international trial. The methotrexate schedule of the NHL-BFM90 protocol including IT therapy can be safely replaced by a less toxic schedule of methotrexate 3 g/m2 in a 3-hour infusion without IT therapy.

### Low-risk persistent gestational trophoblastic disease treated with low-dose methotrexate: efficacy, acute and long-term effects [^62ac0d39]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

For many years UK centres have used the low-dose intramuscular methotrexate regimen. Initial reports on 487 patients from Charing Cross and 115 from Sheffield confirmed its efficacy, although it was noted that up to 30% of patients needed second-line treatment due to resistance or, less frequently, toxicity. In the recent Charing Cross report of use of this regimen for low-/intermediate-risk patients, 33.2% of 485 patients required a change in treatment; however, overall survival was 100%.

Methotrexate by intravenous infusion has also been evaluated as a treatment option. One protocol administered 100 mg m −2 by intravenous infusion over 30 min followed by 200 mg m −2 over 12 h. After 24 h, 15 mg of folinic acid was given intravenously every 12 h for four doses. In nonmetastatic disease, CR was achieved in 68.7% of patients compared with 90.2% in patients on the 8-day intramuscular regimen. None of the patients given methotrexate by infusion developed significant biochemical toxicity. One patient developed a severe rash. On the 8-day regimen, 24.7% of patients developed side effects including myelosuppression, pleurisy, nausea and vomiting and in particular hepatotoxicity. In a more recent study, the methotrexate infusion was given without folinic acid rescue in patients with or without lung metastases. In all, 91.5% of patients achieved CR on first-line therapy alone. Mild nausea affected five patients and one woman had severe myelosuppression, rash, stomatitis and pharyngitis, although interestingly, she had nontoxic postinfusion methotrexate levels. In both these studies, dactinomycin was added to subsequent infusions in patients with resistant disease. However, both studies involved few patients (32 and 59, respectively); additionally, the amount of drug being delivered by infusion was close to twice that given to patients on a low-dose intramuscular methotrexate and folinic acid protocol.

7.1	Effects of Other Drugs on Methotrexate

Drugs that Increase Methotrexate Exposure

Coadministration of methotrexate with the following products may increase methotrexate plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of methotrexate severe adverse reactions.

Increased organ specific adverse reactions may also occur when methotrexate is coadministered with hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic products. If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor closely for methotrexate adverse reactions when coadministered with:

Penicillin or sulfonamide antibiotics
Highly protein-bound drugs (e.g., oral anticoagulants, phenytoin, salicylates, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, and tetracyclines)
Proton pump inhibitors
Probenecid
Antifolate drugs (e.g., dapsone, pemetrexed, pyrimethamine and sulfonamides)
Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

Unexpectedly severe and fatal gastrointestinal toxicity can occur with concomitant administration of methotrexate (primarily at high dose) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

Mercaptopurine
Hepatotoxic products
Weak acids (e.g., salicylates)
Nephrotoxic products Nitrous Oxide

Coadministration of methotrexate with nitrous oxide anesthesia potentiates the effect of methotrexate on folate-dependent metabolic pathways, which may increase the risk of severe methotrexate adverse reactions. Avoid nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients receiving methotrexate. Consider alternative therapies in patients who have received prior nitrous oxide anesthesia.

Folic Acid

Coadministration of methotrexate with folic acid or its derivatives decreases the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate in patients with neoplastic diseases. Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes. Instruct patients to take folic or folinic acid only as directed by their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].

7.2	Effects of Methotrexate on Other Drugs

Theophylline

Coadministration of methotrexate with theophylline increases theophylline plasma concentrations which may increase the risk of theophylline adverse reactions. Monitor theophylline levels and adjust the theophylline dosage in accordance with approved product labeling.

### High-dose intravenous pulse methotrexate in patients with eosinophilic fasciitis [^44dc388d]. JAMA Dermatology (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a connective tissue disorder in which conventional treatment leads to disappointing results in a proportion of patients. Therefore, we investigated high-dose intravenous (IV) pulse methotrexate (MTX) as a treatment for EF.

Objective

To examine safety and effects of monthly high-dose IV pulse MTX in EF.

Design, Setting, and Participants

For this prospective single-arm study, we recruited 12 patients diagnosed with biopsy specimen-proven EF between 2006 and 2009 from the Department of Dermatology and Rheumatology at the Radboud University Medical Centre.

Interventions

Intravenous MTX (4 mg/kg) monthly for 5 months with folinic acid rescue 24 hours after MTX administration.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was improvement of the modified skin score at month 5 vs baseline. Secondary outcomes were durometry, range of motion, visual analog scale scores for disease activity, and 36-Item Short Form Survey health questionnaires.

Results

Overall, 12 patients (11 women between 37–69 years old) received a median (range) monthly dose of 288 (230–336) mg MTX. Median (range) modified skin score improved from 17.5 (8.0–24.0) at baseline to 8.5 (1.0–20.0) at month 5 (P = 0.001). Secondary outcome measures improved significantly, except for durometer scores and range of motion of the elbows. Adverse events included gastrointestinal symptoms (n = 9), mild stomatitis (n = 5), and alopecia (n = 4).

Conclusions and Relevance

High-dose IV pulse MTX is a safe and effective treatment option in EF.

### Role of kidney-specific organic anion transporters in the urinary excretion of methotrexate [^3db759f9]. Kidney International (2001). Low credibility.

Background

High-dose folinic acid is used to accelerate methotrexate elimination to avoid renal toxicity of the drug. The present study was carried out to examine the role of the renal organic anion transporters OAT-K1 and OAT-K2 in the urinary excretion of methotrexate, especially in the methotrexate-folinic acid rescue therapy.

Methods

Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably expressing OAT-K1 and OAT-K2 were used for the in vitro transport study; 5/6 nephrectomized rats were used to detect changes in mRNA expression levels of OAT-K1 and OAT-K2 and to evaluate methotrexate pharmacokinetics under conditions of renal insufficiency.

Results

Methotrexate efflux mediated by these transporters in stable transfectants was stimulated in the presence of extracellular folic acid and folinic acid, suggesting that they could serve as anion exchangers to enhance the apical efflux of methotrexate. The mRNA expression levels of OAT-K1 and OAT-K2 were markedly diminished after 5/6 nephrectomy, but those of multidrug resistance associated protein 2, which could transport methotrexate, were maintained. Renal clearance of methotrexate was markedly decreased in 5/6 nephrectomized rats compared with that in sham-operated rats. Additional folinic acid treatment resulted in a significant increase in methotrexate renal clearance in sham-operated rats but not in 5/6 nephrectomized rats.

Conclusions

The decreased expressions of OAT-K1 and OAT-K2 may be attributable to the longer exposure to methotrexate and ineffective folinic acid rescue. In terms of contributing to patient safety, renal clearance of methotrexate, especially folinic acid-stimulated tubular secretion of the drug via these transporters, would be a key factor in methotrexate therapy.

### Prednisone plus methotrexate for polymyalgia rheumatica: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^f985cad7]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Steroids are the standard treatment for polymyalgia rheumatica. The efficacy of the candidate drug methotrexate has not yet been demonstrated in controlled studies.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of prednisone plus methotrexate and prednisone alone in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica.

Design

Multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

5 Italian rheumatology clinics.

Patients

72 patients with newly diagnosed polymyalgia rheumatica.

Measurements

The proportion of patients no longer taking prednisone, the number of flare-ups, and the cumulative prednisone dose after 76 weeks.

Intervention

Prednisone dosage (25 mg/d) was tapered to 0 mg/d within 24 weeks and was adjusted if flare-ups occurred. Oral methotrexate (10 mg) or placebo, with folinic acid supplementation (7.5 mg), was given weekly for 48 weeks.

Results

Twenty-eight of 32 patients in the methotrexate group and 16 of 30 patients in the placebo group were no longer taking prednisone at 76 weeks (P = 0.003). The risk difference was 34 percentage points (95% CI, 11 to 53 percentage points). Similar results were obtained after adjustment for C-reactive protein level and duration of symptoms in a multivariate model. Fifteen of 32 patients in the methotrexate group and 22 of 30 patients in the placebo group had at least 1 flare-up by the end of follow-up (P = 0.04). The median prednisone dose was 2.1 g in the methotrexate group and 2.97 g in the placebo group (P = 0.03). The rate and severity of adverse events were similar.

Limitations

Follow-up was short, and a high dose of folinic acid and a relatively high starting dosage of prednisone were used. Ten of 72 patients (14%) discontinued treatment or were lost to follow-up.

Conclusions

Prednisone plus methotrexate is associated with shorter prednisone treatment and steroid sparing. It may be useful in patients at high risk for steroid-related toxicity.

### Low-risk persistent gestational trophoblastic disease treated with low-dose methotrexate: efficacy, acute and long-term effects [^89a967ff]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The gestational trophoblastic diseases are complications of pregnancy and comprise a spectrum of conditions that includes complete and partial hydatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma and placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT). All have the potential to persist and to metastasise to local or distant structures.

The worldwide incidence of trophoblastic diseases ranges between 0.5 and 8.3 cases per 1000 live births, with the incidence in the UK of around 1.5 per 1000 births. In Sheffield, there are around 400 patients registered annually with a molar pregnancy. Most patients have no further problems following evacuation of the mole, but about 5% require chemotherapy for persistent disease.

Low-dose methotrexate with folinic acid rescue, as described by, has been the standard treatment for 'low-risk' disease at the Sheffield Trophoblastic Tumour Centre for many years. In 1987, we modified our approach so that all patients who fell into the Charing Cross scoring system 'low'- and 'medium'-risk groups were given low-dose methotrexate as first-line therapy. This study reports on the efficacy and toxicity of treatment in this group of patients.

### Rescuing effect of folates on methotrexate cytotoxicity in human trophoblast cells [^bee295d9]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Methotrexate (MTX)is a folate antagonist that is administered in several conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Its use may associate with adverse effects presumably originating from folate deficiency. Although MTX side effects could be decreased by folate supplementation, the current guideline on folate administration is not precisely established, which could result in irreversible damage especially in high-risk groups like women in childbearing-age. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the in vitro rescuing effect of different folates including folic acid (FA), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) and folinic acid (5-Formyltetrahydrofolic acid, FTHF) on MTX-treated trophoblast cells.

Methods

HTR-8/SVneo cells were stressed with a minimum effective dose of MTX and simultaneously treated with different concentrations of FA, MTHF or FTHF. The rescuing effect was assessed by MTT viability assay. The evaluation was completed by microscopic monitoring, apoptosis assessment and measuring LINE-1 DNA methylation.

Results

The MTT viability assay showed no MTX-rescuing effect of FA, but a significant effect of FTHF or MTHF. Microscopic observations supported the results of the viability assay. Accordingly, apoptosis was reduced in MTHF or FTHF treatments, while FA has no effect on the apoptosis induced by MTX. The LINE-1 methylation was not affected by MTX treatment, and not significantly modified in folate supplemented cultures.

Conclusions

Despite the general acceptance of administering FA to prevent adverse events of MTX therapy, our findings suggest that FA may not be optimal, and indicate FTHF or MTHF as a better choice. This study on trophoblast cells suggests that FTHF may be the optimal folate, particularly for women in childbearing-age.

### Prediction of methotrexate neurotoxicity using clinical, sociodemographic, and area-based information in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [^b9630362]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

This is the first advanced analytic approach taken to understanding neurotoxicity risk among children diagnosed with ALL. We demonstrate that methotrexate-related neurotoxicity is a reasonably predictable outcome during ALL post-induction/pre-maintenance when considering key clinical, demographic, and area-based information. While the model we developed gave a reasonable predictive performance (test error rate 24%), this study highlighted the potential for machine learning to identify children at risk for neurotoxicity as well as pointed to novel potential risk factors for an insufficiently studied outcome. Additional research is needed to externally validate the performance of our model in other populations, replicate identified associations, and assess whether other sources of variability, including pharmacogenomic information, can improve model performance. The clinical management of methotrexate-related neurotoxicity poses a challenge in children with ALL, with current approaches involving symptom management and rechallenge with methotrexate after neurologic recovery, often with folinic acid rescue. Therefore, a validated neurotoxicity risk prediction model may prospectively inform the delivery of methotrexate therapy and/or supportive care to at-risk children prior to the development of toxicity (eg, individualized methotrexate dosing or administering earlier folinic acid rescue). We anticipate that the results from this study may help guide the development of personalized treatment strategies to reduce the burden of neurotoxicity and improve health outcomes in children undergoing therapy for ALL.

### Low-dose methotrexate and mucocutaneous adverse events: results of a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^5c71c954]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Methotrexate (MTX) increases the risk of alopecia and stomatitis, but the prevalence of these adverse events among rheumatic patients taking MTX is poorly defined. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of alopecia and stomatitis with MTX in rheumatic diseases.

Methods

We searched PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and CINAHL databases for double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an MTX monotherapy arm. Alopecia, stomatitis, and oral/mouth ulcers data were extracted. The quality of trials was assessed by 2 authors. We included trials published since 1990 that used at least 10 mg of MTX weekly, coadministered with folic or folinic acid. We estimated the prevalence using random-effects models because heterogeneity was anticipated. Two estimates of prevalence were included; the lower bound estimate included all trials (assuming no alopecia and stomatitis if not mentioned), and the upper bound estimate included only those that specifically described prevalence estimates of alopecia or stomatitis.

Results

Of 3,954 studies identified, 20 RCTs were included, with a total of 24 MTX monotherapy arms, of which 10 reported the prevalence of alopecia (n = 1,113), and 21 reported stomatitis or mouth/oral ulcers (n = 2,056). The prevalence of alopecia was between 1.0% and 4.9%. The prevalence of stomatitis was between 5.7% and 8.0%.

Conclusion

This meta-analysis gives more precise estimates of mucocutaneous adverse events that occur in rheumatic disease patients taking MTX. These estimates will help inform patient decision-making regarding MTX.

### Flat-dose versus weight or body surface area-based methotrexate dosing in low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia [^ebaae944]. Gynecologic Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Single-agent methotrexate (MTX) is commonly used as first-line treatment for low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (LR-GTN), although no international consensus exists on the optimal treatment regimen to maximise complete hCG response (CR) and minimise relapse rates. Current regimens differ in the route of administration, dose scheduling, and use of flat-dose, body surface area (BSA)- or weight-based dosing. In the UK a methotrexate-folinic acid (MTX-FA) 8-day 50 mg intramuscular flat-dose regimen is used, with 15 mg oral folinic acid rescue. In LR-GTN patients, we aim to determine the effect of MTX dose adjustment by BSA and weight upon chemotherapy response and disease relapse.

Methods

Between January 1973 and August 2020, 935 LR-GTN patients treated with first-line MTX-FA were identified from a single UK specialist trophoblastic centre. Of these, 364 were included, of which 178 (49%) had a CR to first-line MTX-FA. Subgroup analyses were performed upon: (i) patients who changed chemotherapy due to MTX toxicity (n = 33); and (ii) patients with a FIGO score of 5–6 (n = 85). Logistic regression analysis explored the relationship between BSA or weight adjusted MTX dosing and: (i) CR to first-line chemotherapy; (ii) incidence of disease relapse. Linear regression analyses assessed the correlation of BSA and weight with the number of MTX-FA cycles required to achieve CR.

Results

In LR-GTN patients, BSA and weight adjusted MTX-FA dosing did not influence CR to first-line chemotherapy or the incidence of disease relapse. The number of MTX cycles required to achieve CR was not associated with BSA or weight. These findings were maintained in a subgroup analysis of FIGO 5–6 patients. The incidence of MTX toxicity was not influenced by BSA or weight.

Conclusions

In the treatment of LR-GTN, dose individualisation using BSA or weight is not required, and fixed dosing continues to be preferred as the UK standard.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis: section 4. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with traditional systemic agents [^e04fdc7a]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Methotrexate dosing and duration in psoriasis — Indicated for severe, recalcitrant, disabling psoriasis not responsive to other therapy, methotrexate is administered as a weekly single oral dose with gradual increases until optimal response; total dose should not ordinarily exceed 30 mg/wk, doses should be reduced to the lowest possible amount, and a test dose of 2.5–5 mg is recommended. Treatment can be continued as long as necessary with adequate monitoring, and folic acid supplementation 1–5 mg daily by mouth, except for the day of methotrexate dosing, reduces the frequency of side effects.

### Low-risk persistent gestational trophoblastic disease treated with low-dose methotrexate: efficacy, acute and long-term effects [^8f251f91]. British Journal of Cancer (2003). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of low-dose methotrexate with folinic acid rescue in a large series of consecutively treated patients with low-risk persistent gestational trophoblastic disease. Between January 1987 and December 2000, 250 patients were treated with intramuscular methotrexate (50 mg on alternate days 1, 3, 5, 7) with folinic acid (7.5 mg orally on alternate days 2, 4, 6, 8) rescue. The overall complete response rate without recurrence was 72% for first-line treatment and 95% for those who required second-line chemotherapy. Eight women (3.2%) had recurrence following remission and two (0.8%) had new moles. Two women (0.8%) died of their disease giving an overall cure of 99%. Only 10 women (4%) experienced grade III/IV toxicity during the first course of treatment and 13 women (5.2%) subsequently. Toxicity included mucositis and stomatitis, pleuritic chest pain, thrombocytopenia, uterine bleeding, abdominal pain, liver function changes, rash and pericardial effusion. A total of 59 women (23.6%) required second-line chemotherapy; 48 women had methotrexate resistance, eight had methotrexate toxicity and an empirical decision to change therapy was made in three. In all, 11 women (4.4%) had a hysterectomy before, during or after treatment; 141 women (56.4%) became pregnant following treatment: in 128 (90.7%), the outcome was successful. Methotrexate with folinic acid rescue is an effective treatment for low-risk persistent trophoblastic disease. It has minimal severe toxicity, excellent cure rates and does not appear to affect fertility.

### Methotrexate in dermatology [^63adb918]. Dermatologic Therapy (2007). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is a folic acid analog pioneered for use in inflammatory diseases by dermatologists, and used successfully for over 40 years for a wide variety of cutaneous diseases. In addition to its antiproliferative properties, methotrexate has other more recently recognized anti-inflammatory properties related to its effects on adenosine. Further research concerning its mechanism of action and genetic enzymatic variations suggest future possibilities for maximizing therapy and predicting adverse events. In this review the present authors will explore methotrexate's pharmacokinetics, mode of administration, dosing guidelines, side effect profile, and medication interactions. In addition, the present authors hope to offer practical guidelines for dose initiation and adjustment, and to summarize new research on its mechanism of action and implications for future therapy.

### High-dose methotrexate usage without drug-level monitoring in advanced pediatric mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in a resource-limited setting in Malawi [^0ee9740d]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

In the prospective cohort, patients were treated with a risk-adapted standard of care containing 3,000 mg/m 2 /cycle of MTX (Table 1), adapted from the group B arm of FAB/LMB96 backbone with a 60% dose reduction of anthracycline. Rituximab (375 mg/m 2 /once per cycle) and two maintenance cycles were incorporated into the very high-risk (VHR) stratum, defined as patients with any CNS involvement or Burkitt leukemia (BM involvement ≥ 25%). Treatments were administered in 14-day cycles. Patients not in complete remission (CR) after the first consolidation cycle received four cycles of dexamethasone, cisplatin, high-dose cytarabine, and prednisone. A standardized supportive care guideline for folinic acid and hydration with bicarbonate-containing fluid, which recommends adjustments based on serum creatinine levels in lieu of serum MTX monitoring, was established (Appendix Table A 1). Cycles required absolute neutrophils ≥ 1,000/µL and platelets ≥ 100,000/µL; normal baseline serum creatinine for age; total bilirubin < 1.5 times ULN; and alanine/aspartate transferase < 2.5 times ULN. Intravenous (IV) Ringer lactate hydration with 25 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) at 125 mL/m 2 /h was started 12 hours before MTX and continued for 96 hours. Urine dipstick was obtained twice daily, and if urine pH < 7, NaHCO 3 was increased to 50 mEq/L. Folinic acid rescue started 24 hours after MTX, at 15 mg/m 2 every 6 hours for 72 hours. Creatinine was checked daily and if > 25% the pre-MTX level, fluid and folinic acid were increased to 200 mL/m 2 /h and every 3 hours, respectively, and continued until return to pre-MTX levels; if > 50%, folinic acid was increased to 100 mg/m 2 every 3 hours. In the event of decreased urine output, IV fluid was also increased until output improved.

### An international randomized phase III trial of pulse actinomycin-D versus multi-day methotrexate for the treatment of low risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia; NRG / GOG 275 [^dea49338]. Gynecologic Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

The cure rate for low-risk GTN approaches 100%, primarily because of the inherent sensitivity of trophoblastic neoplasms to chemotherapy, the effective use of hCG as a marker of early disease, the identification of predictive factors of treatment response that has permitted individualization of therapy, and the use of combined surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in the rare patients who fail initial chemotherapy. Patients in this low-risk GTN group are those with Stage I disease (nonmetastatic) or Stage II and III disease (metastatic) with a risk score of < 7. There are several different chemotherapy protocols for low-risk GTN that have produced comparable results in nonrandomized, retrospective studies. Taken together, these studies suggest that the 5-day methotrexate or the 8-day methotrexate–folinic acid protocol and the 5-day actinomycin D protocols or the bi-weekly single-dose actinomycin D protocols are significantly more effective than weekly intramuscular (IM) methotrexate. These studies also found that initial chemotherapy resistance is associated with older age, higher hCG, nonmolar antecedent pregnancy, histopathologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma, presence of metastases, and a higher FIGO score. Common side effects of these regimens are stomatitis, mucositis of the gastrointestinal tract, pleuritis, conjunctivitis, and skin rash. Chemotherapy is continued until hCG values have returned to normal, and at least one course is administered after the first normal hCG level is achieved. A recent retrospective study compared relapse rates in women from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands with low-risk disease who were treated with methotrexate alternating with folinic acid. A greater number of patients relapsed with only two consolidation courses than those who received three consolidation courses after reaching the institutional normal hCG value of < 5 mIU/mL. Although there are differences in primary remission rates with each of the chemotherapy protocols, the cure rate remains high and most patients preserve their fertility.

### High-dose methotrexate in childhood all [^d5268b30]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2000). Low credibility.

An event-free survival is currently achieved in 70–80% of children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). A decline in the long-term sequalae from therapy is a challenge at present. Due to the high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapse in ALL patients, cranial irradiation was introduced as a prophylactic measure in the beginning of the 1970s. Cranial irradiation, however, may cause secondary malignancies in the CNS. In recent years neurotoxicities have been demonstrated to follow cranial irradiation in a large proportion of ALL patients. Because of these deleterious effects, most ALL protocols are limited to the combination intrathecal and intravenous methotrexate as the standard for CNS prophylaxis. In the 1970s, an intermediate dose was administered, while from the 1980s a high dose of methotrexate was combined with intrathecal methotrexate. The regular methotrexate dose of later years has been in the range of 5–8 g/m2. The intravenous methotrexate dose has actually varied from 2 to 33.6 g/m2. The highest dose, 33.6 g/m2, has been without intrathecal instillation. In a study from Norway, high-dose methotrexate (6–8 g/m2) was used, and only two (2.2%) of 89 ALL cases showed CNS relapse, both of reversible kind. In the United Kingdom, a randomized controlled study was started in 1990. Results published so far are based on a segment of cases characterized by standard risk and white blood cell count below 50 x 10(9); a 4% reduction in CNS relapse was found for high-dose methotrexate in comparison to those treated only with long-term intrathecal methotrexate. The use of methotrexate unalterably warrants some precautions. Rescue therapy with folinic acid is usually started 36 h after initiating the methotrexate infusion. Steps are also taken to secure adequate intake of fluids and alkalinization of the urine. Provided irradiation is avoided, neurotoxicities rarely occur. For regular high-dose methotrexate adverse effects mostly involve mucositis and myelosuppresion.

### Methotrexate in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: advice and recommendations from the MARAJIA expert consensus meeting [^68cf7ed0]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

These consensus recommendations relating to the efficacy, optimal dosing and route of administration and duration of treatment with MTX in JIA, and to the important issues of folic acid supplementation to prevent MTX side effects, use of MTX in the treatment of chronic JIA-associated uveitis, combination treatment with biologic agents, and the use of vaccinations in patients with JIA provide balanced and evidence-based recommendations designed to have broad value for physicians and healthcare clinicians. We did not at this time find sufficient evidence to justify pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenomic analysis prior to MTX treatment in current clinical practice, as insufficient evidence is available on biomarkers able to predict treatment response.

### A single assessment of methotrexate levels at 42 hours permits safe administration and early discharge in children with lymphoblastic lymphoma and leukemia receiving high-dose methotrexate [^43d512d6]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

High-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is an important component of treatment in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL). Optimal rescue therapy is essential for the safe administration of HDMTX. A cost-effective strategy that does not compromise safety is necessary for low- and middle-income countries. Consecutive admissions for HDMTX in children with ALL and LL over 12months were analyzed. The dose of HDMTX was 3g/m 2 in B-ALL and B-LL and 5g/m 2 in T-ALL and T-LL. A methotrexate level was measured at 42hours of starting HDMTX infusion (T42-MTX). Three doses of folinic acid at T42, T48, and T54 and alkalinized hydration till T54 were administered if T42-MTX < 1µM. A total of 282 cycles of HDMTX that were administered in 71 patients were analyzed. T42-MTX was < 1µM in 266 (94.3%) cycles. T42-MTX was ≥ 1µM in 12% and 3% of cycles of HDMTX administered at a dose of 5g/m2 and 3g/m2, respectively (p = .074). The median duration of hospitalization for HDM was three days and did not differ with the dose of HDMTX administered (p = .427). Mucositis, delayed recovery of blood counts, and hospitalization for reversible toxicity occurred after 21 (7.4%), 28 (9.9%), and 19 (6.7%) cycles of HDMTX, respectively. Mucositis was greater following the administration of 5g/m 2 of HDMTX. A single T42-MTX measurement permits the safe administration of HDMTX and an expedited discharge from the hospital within three days in more than 90% of children with ALL/LL.

### Folinic acid prophylaxis and dose adjustments enable safe treatment with pemetrexed in patients with renal impairment [^fb349654]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Pemetrexed is the chemotherapeutic mainstay in the treatment of advanced non‐squamous non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For this indication, a chemotherapy background regimen consisting of pemetrexed with a platinum drug is a prerequisite for effective immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in patients with low programmed death ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression, accounting for a third to a half of all advanced NSCLC patients. Renal impairment is a common comorbidity in these patients, with an incidence of up to 30%. Due to fatal toxicities in a renal impairment study of pemetrexed during the clinical development of this drug by the license holder, renal impairment (defined as a creatinine clearance < 45 mL/min) is a contraindication. Consequently, patients with renal impairment are withheld both effective chemotherapy and immunotherapy, showing the urgent need to develop a safe dosing regimen for pemetrexed in this vulnerable patient population.

By means of robust translational pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, we previously unraveled the pemetrexed pharmacokinetics‐toxicity mechanismand showed that (1) the toxicity of pemetrexed is driven by a time above a threshold concentration in plasma and (2) that a therapeutic pemetrexed dose cannot be safely administered in patients without toxicity prophylaxis. Folinic acid can antagonize the toxic effects of pemetrexed and is already considered in the label to treat severe pemetrexed toxicity. Folinic acid differs from the standard prophylaxis with folic acid, which is standard care for patients receiving pemetrexed. Folinic acid is the reduced form of folate and is able to bypass the blockage of the downstream enzyme dihydrofolatereductase (DHFR) in the folate cycle by pemetrexed, especially in healthy cells. No study has, thus far, been performed to investigate the potential of folinic acid prophylaxis to prevent pemetrexed‐induced toxicity in patients with renal impairment. The aim of our clinical study was, therefore, to develop a safe treatment strategy to use pemetrexed in patients with renal impairment using folinic acid prophylaxis.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^fed6a442]. Gut (2019). Medium credibility.

Oral methotrexate has reduced and extremely variable bioavailability (not corrected by use of folic acid) compared with parenteral administration, particularly at doses above 15 mg. Because bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are very similar for subcutaneous and intramuscular methotrexate, the subcutaneous route should be preferred to intramuscular as it is easier and less painful.

Induction therapy should be given by the subcutaneous route. If patients prefer, this can be switched to oral during the maintenance phase, with the option to switch back to subcutaneous if effectiveness is lost. Whatever the route of administration, methotrexate should be given with folic acid to reduce gastrointestinal and liver toxicity, 5 mg weekly (traditionally 1–2 days after the methotrexate dose) or 1 mg daily.

4.4.2 Mesalazine

Statement 42. We recommend that mesalazine is not used for induction or maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.7%).

UK data from 1990 to 2010 show over half of patients with Crohn's disease were prescribed 5-ASA, and Swiss data show it is more often given for Crohn's colitis. A Cochrane systematic literature review showed that oral 5-ASA has no efficacy in maintaining clinical remission in Crohn's disease, with similar negative findings in meta-analyses for induction or maintenance. A recent review of colonic Crohn's diseaseshowed that there was no benefit for 5-ASA in colonic Crohn's disease, but two studies have shown possible benefit for sulphasalazine in remission induction. Thus, 5-ASAs are not recommended for induction or maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease.

4.4.3 Biological therapy with anti-TNF drugs, vedolizumab or ustekinumab

Statement 43. We recommend that patients refractory to immunomodulator therapy despite dose optimisation should be considered for biological therapy. Choice between anti-TNF therapy, ustekinumab and vedolizumab should be made on an individual basis, considering patient preference, cost, likely adherence, safety data and speed of response to the drug (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 95.7%).

### Gestational trophoblastic disease: current evaluation and management [^79e2b064]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Management of Low-Risk Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia

Primary remission rates of patients treated for low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia are high using a variety of chemotherapy agents. Essentially all patients with low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia can be cured, usually without the need for hysterectomy if fertility preservation is desired.

The most frequently used single-agent regimens with methotrexate and actinomycin D are listed in Table 4. The Gynecologic Oncology Group trial comparing weekly intramuscular methotrexate 30 mg/m 2 to bolus intravenous actinomycin D 1.25 mg/m 2 is the largest randomized study completed in patients with gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Among 216 women treated in this trial, bolus actinomycin D demonstrated a superior primary remission rate compared with weekly methotrexate (70% vs 53%, P = 0.01). Primary remission rates with actinomycin D regimens range from 69% to 94%. Similar primary remission rates have been reported for multiday methotrexate regimens, ranging from 87 to 94% for 5 days methotrexate and 74–93% for the 8-day methotrexate-folinic acid regimens. The most recent Cochrane Review of randomized trials of treatment regimens for low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia concluded that actinomycin D regimens were more likely to produce primary remission with a higher risk of serious side effects. The current National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend initial multiday methotrexate or methotrexate-folinic acid regimens, with actinomycin D regimens for patients with contraindications for methotrexate therapy. Weekly methotrexate is not recommended by National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines based on the GOG trial. Moderate high-dose methotrexate infusion is not recommended because it had an inferior sustained remission rate of 62% when retrospectively compared with the 84% sustained remission rate for patients treated with 8-day methotrexate–folinic acid regimen (P < .001).

### Methotrexate, erlotinib, and celecoxib for the treatment of… [^d4dff76b]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Methotrexate is in a class of medications called antimetabolites. It is also a type of antifolate. Methotrexate stops cells from using folic acid to make deoxyribonucleic acid and may kill tumor cells. Erlotinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors.

### Folinic acid prophylaxis and dose adjustments enable safe treatment with pemetrexed in patients with renal impairment [^b226e7c9]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that the eGFR in patients included in our study ranged widely from 26 to 41 ml/min. Nonetheless, it may be argued that the validity of our findings is unknown without the studied range of renal functions. On the other hand, the pemetrexed dose is adjusted for each renal function, and the time of oral folinic acid prophylaxis was based on a worst‐case scenario. Although with caution, we argue that in patients with an eGFR below 26 ml/min, our strategy is likely to result in safe treatment. However, patients and physicians should discuss the risk–benefit ratio in case of severe renal impairment.

For implementation in clinical practice of our strategy, we would like to point out that the timing of starting folinic acid prophylaxis (which should not be mistaken for folic acid, that is also routinely administered during pemetrexed treatment) is of the essence. The first dose of folinic acid in our study was started 24 hours after the infusion, based on a previous analysis that in a typical patient with adequate renal function at the approved dose the systemic pemetrexed concentration decreases below the toxicity threshold. Although we did not investigate the optimal timing window for folinic acid, from a mechanistical standpoint, it may be argued that starting earlier or later with oral folinic acid prophylaxis results in worse cytotoxic effects or increased toxicity, respectively.

Altogether, we showed that in patients with moderate renal impairment, pemetrexed dose calculated on renal function to reach a target AUC combined with folinic acid prophylaxis resulted in safe treatment and systemic exposure equivalent to the exposure reached with the approved dose in patients with adequate renal function. Although the data for patients with severe renal impairment are scarce, we postulate that our strategy can be applied for these patients. Real‐world data should be gathered to confirm this. The provided level of evidence complies with regulatory guidelines; thus, our pemetrexed treatment strategy for patients with renal impairment can be implemented in routine care. This strategy unlocks the potential of chemoimmunotherapy in NSCLC patients that were, thus far, withheld from effective treatment.
