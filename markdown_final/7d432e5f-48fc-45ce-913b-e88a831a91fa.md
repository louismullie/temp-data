## Question

do you treat asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis should be treated, and under what circumstances treatment is indicated or discouraged. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the context, especially pregnancy status and risk for preterm birth. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about screening and treating asymptomatic BV. Next, I will review randomized trial evidence on pregnancy outcomes, including conflicting results in high-risk subgroups. After that, I need to consider nonpregnant contexts and special situations like pre-abortion care and procedures. Finally, I will weigh potential benefits versus harms and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions. Asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is common, particularly in pregnancy, and is defined by altered vaginal flora with elevated anaerobes and reduced lactobacilli without discharge, odor, or irritation. Importantly, BV can resolve spontaneously and recurs frequently, which complicates decisions about routine treatment [^112YLQDV] [^111m4ucu]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic standards: Amsel clinical criteria or Gram stain with Nugent scoring are appropriate, and molecular diagnostics are increasingly used in some settings, though test performance varies and does not by itself justify screening asymptomatic populations [^111kJL73] [^111x9NPu].

> Next, I should review authoritative guideline positions. The USPSTF recommends against screening for asymptomatic BV in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery, concluding no net benefit, and issues an I statement for those at increased risk due to conflicting evidence. ACOG similarly advises against screening and treatment to prevent preterm birth in asymptomatic individuals, and CDC does not support routine screening even in high-risk groups, emphasizing treatment only for symptomatic women [^1169cxAp] [^115Wrene] [^114r73rf] [^114W7nMU]. Wait, let me verify SOGC's stance: SOGC advises against routine screening and treatment in asymptomatic pregnant patients without risk factors, but allows consideration of screening in those at increased risk for preterm birth, which aligns with the uncertainty signal from USPSTF's I statement rather than endorsing routine treatment [^11187FjD] [^113N2LYx].

> I will now examine the randomized trial evidence in general obstetric populations. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show that treating asymptomatic BV in average-risk pregnant women does not reduce preterm birth or related adverse outcomes; for example, the USPSTF evidence synthesis found no significant reduction in preterm delivery, spontaneous preterm delivery, low birthweight, or PROM with treatment, and the Cochrane review likewise found eradication of BV without a reduction in preterm birth overall [^116p9qnj] [^116Dgvug]. Hold on, I should double-check the MFMU trial signal: treatment with metronidazole failed to prevent preterm birth in a general obstetric population, reinforcing the lack of benefit in low-risk groups [^117NBSWy].

> But wait, what if the patient is at increased risk for preterm birth, such as a history of prior preterm delivery. The evidence here is mixed and heterogeneous: some trials suggested possible benefit with clindamycin in early second trimester, including a Lancet RCT showing reduced late miscarriage and spontaneous preterm birth, whereas others, including PREMEVA, showed no benefit; USPSTF judged the balance as uncertain, and contemporary population-level screen-and-treat strategies have not reduced preterm birth either [^1128M2AU] [^117NBSWy] [^111yUdGe] [^1169cxAp]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought treating asymptomatic BV in high-risk patients clearly helps, but I should correct that: while some studies hint at benefit, the totality of evidence remains inconsistent, so routine screening and treatment cannot be universally endorsed even in high-risk groups outside of research or carefully selected clinical contexts [^111x9NPu].

> Let me consider nonpregnant, asymptomatic patients. I need to ensure I am not conflating BV with other asymptomatic infections. Unlike asymptomatic bacteriuria, where screening and treatment in pregnancy are beneficial, asymptomatic BV in nonpregnant women lacks an evidence-based indication for routine treatment; treatment is symptom-driven, and there is no proven reduction in long-term complications from treating asymptomatic BV in this group [^114qsbPV] [^114W7nMU]. Hold on, I should verify whether any subgroup benefits exist: outside of pre-procedural settings, no guideline endorses treatment of asymptomatic BV in nonpregnant women, reinforcing an expectant approach unless symptoms arise or a procedure is planned [^112zDhem].

> I should confirm special situations where treatment of asymptomatic BV is reasonable. Prior to gynecologic procedures with transvaginal access, such as hysterectomy or abortion, treating BV reduces infectious complications. CDC and professional society guidance support treatment in these procedural contexts even when patients are asymptomatic, and treatment should not delay time-sensitive care like abortion [^112zDhem] [^116widQW] [^111LNrxx]. Let me reconsider whether partner treatment changes this: current evidence does not support routine treatment of male partners to improve women's outcomes, so the indication remains procedure- or symptom-based rather than partner-mediated [^1114xE4P].

> Next, I should review potential harms and unintended consequences. Treatment of asymptomatic BV increases adverse effects such as candidiasis and gastrointestinal symptoms, and partner treatment can cause adverse events without improving recurrence or cure, which matters when benefit is unproven. Moreover, unnecessary antibiotics contribute to resistance and stewardship concerns, especially given BV's high recurrence rates and biofilm biology [^116Dgvug] [^1114xE4P] [^1166JtZJ]. I need to ensure I emphasize that spontaneous resolution occurs in a meaningful proportion, so overtreatment exposes patients to risks without guaranteed benefit in low-risk settings [^115PWbLC].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach. For pregnant patients not at increased risk for preterm delivery, do not screen or treat asymptomatic BV. For those at increased risk, discuss the uncertain evidence, consider selective screening in shared decision-making, and if treatment is pursued, prefer oral clindamycin 300 mg twice daily for 7 days in early second trimester given the signal from some trials, while acknowledging that other guidelines prioritize no routine screening and that evidence remains mixed. Avoid topical regimens when the intent is prevention of adverse pregnancy outcomes [^1169cxAp] [^114pLHUK] [^1128M2AU]. For nonpregnant, asymptomatic patients, do not treat unless a procedure is planned or symptoms develop. If treatment is indicated for symptoms, use CDC-endorsed regimens such as metronidazole 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days or equivalent topical options, and avoid treating male partners routinely [^116ecoQF] [^1114xE4P].

> Finally, I should confirm follow-up and counseling points. Because BV recurs frequently and can fluctuate, reassess symptoms if they arise and treat accordingly. Educate on the limited role of screening and treatment in asymptomatic states, the potential for spontaneous resolution, and the importance of procedure-specific prophylaxis when relevant. And remain alert to evolving evidence, including ongoing debates about targeted molecular screening and high-risk subgroups, which may refine future recommendations but currently do not overturn the prevailing guidance [^111m4ucu] [^111yUdGe] [^111x9NPu].

Routine treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is **not recommended** for non-pregnant women because there is no proven benefit and treatment may cause adverse effects [^112zDhem] [^113B64BR]. In pregnancy, **do not screen or treat low-risk women** because it does not reduce preterm birth [^1169cxAp] [^116p9qnj]. For high-risk pregnant women (e.g. prior preterm birth), evidence is mixed; consider treatment on a case-by-case basis, but routine screening is not advised [^1162V38g] [^111x9NPu]. Treat only if symptoms occur or before procedures such as abortion or hysterectomy [^114W7nMU] [^112zDhem].

## Evidence for treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in non-pregnant women

- **No symptom benefit**: Treating asymptomatic BV does not improve quality of life or reduce symptoms, as patients lack complaints to alleviate [^113B64BR].

- **Adverse effects**: Treatment can cause candidiasis, gastrointestinal upset, and antibiotic resistance, with no offsetting benefit [^113B64BR].

- **Recurrence**: High recurrence rates mean treatment often does not achieve sustained cure, limiting the value of treating asymptomatic cases [^115kaB7N].

- **Guidelines**: ACOG and CDC do not recommend routine treatment of asymptomatic BV in non-pregnant women [^112zDhem].

---

## Evidence for treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women

- **Low-risk pregnancy**: Screening and treating asymptomatic BV in low-risk pregnant women does not reduce preterm birth or adverse outcomes; USPSTF gives a D recommendation against screening [^1169cxAp] [^115Wrene].

- **High-risk pregnancy**: Evidence is mixed; some studies suggest possible benefit in women with prior preterm birth, but overall data are inconclusive and USPSTF issues an I statement [^111x9NPu] [^1162V38g].

- **Specific interventions**: Early clindamycin reduced late miscarriage/preterm birth in one RCT, but this has not been consistently replicated; use caution and shared decision-making [^1128M2AU] [^117NBSWy].

- **Guidelines**: ACOG and CDC do not recommend routine screening or treatment for asymptomatic pregnant women, even those at high risk [^114r73rf] [^114W7nMU].

---

## Potential risks and harms of treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis

- **Antibiotic resistance**: Unnecessary antibiotics promote resistance, a public health concern [^115kaB7N].

- **Adverse effects**: Candidiasis, gastrointestinal symptoms, and allergic reactions can occur [^111x9NPu].

- **Recurrence**: High recurrence undermines treatment durability and patient satisfaction [^115kaB7N].

- **Cost**: Testing and treatment impose costs without proven benefit in asymptomatic women [^111yUdGe].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Population** | **Screening** | **Treatment** |
|-|-|-|
| Non-pregnant women | Not recommended | Not recommended |
| Pregnant women, low risk | Not recommended (USPSTF D) | Not recommended |
| Pregnant women, high risk | Insufficient evidence (USPSTF I) | Consider case-by-case; evidence mixed |
| Before procedures (abortion, hysterectomy) | Recommended | Recommended |

---

## Situations where treatment may be considered

Treatment may be considered for **high-risk pregnant women** on a case-by-case basis when prior preterm birth or other strong risk factors are present, though evidence remains mixed [^111x9NPu]. It is also reasonable to treat before gynecologic procedures such as abortion or hysterectomy to reduce infectious complications [^112zDhem] [^116widQW]. Additionally, treat when BV is diagnosed in conjunction with other infections or significant symptoms, even if BV itself is asymptomatic.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Routine treatment of asymptomatic BV is **not recommended** for non-pregnant women due to lack of benefit and potential harms [^113B64BR]. In pregnancy, **do not screen or treat low-risk women**; for high-risk women, consider treatment case-by-case, but routine screening is not advised [^1169cxAp]. Treat when symptoms are present or before procedures such as abortion or hysterectomy [^112zDhem].

### Vaginal clindamycin in preventing preterm birth and peripartal infections in asymptomatic women with bacterial vaginosis: a randomized, controlled trial [^115RqWvk]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) in early pregnancy decreases the risk of preterm delivery and peripartum infectious morbidity.

Methods

In this multicenter, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled intervention trial, screening for BV was performed by vaginal Gram stain obtained from 5432 healthy women with singleton pregnancies during the first antenatal clinic visit at 10–17 weeks' gestation. Bacterial vaginosis-positive women with no past history of preterm delivery were randomized to a single course of treatment with either 2% vaginal clindamycin cream or identical placebo cream for 7 days. Repeat Gram stains were taken 1 week after treatment and at 30–36 weeks' gestation. Preterm delivery was defined as spontaneous delivery before 37 gestational weeks. Peripartum infectious morbidity was defined as postpartum endometritis, postpartum sepsis, postcesarean wound infection, or episiotomy wound infection, necessitating antimicrobial therapy. According to the power analysis, 180 patients were needed for both treatment arms to show a three-fold difference in the rates of preterm births.

Results

The overall prevalence of BV was 10.4%. Of all BV-positive women, 375 (66%) were randomized to the treatment arms. The primary cure rate was 66% in the clindamycin group; in the placebo group, 34% spontaneously cleared BV (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 2.8). The rate of preterm deliveries was 5% in the clindamycin group and 4% in the placebo group (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.5, 3.5). The rate of peripartum infectious morbidity was 11% in the clindamycin group and 18% in the placebo group (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.9, 2.8). Bacterial vaginosis recurred in 7% of women. The rate of preterm deliveries was 15% in this subgroup compared with 2% among women who remained BV negative (OR 9.3, 95% CI 1.6, 53.5).

Conclusion

Vaginal clindamycin did not decrease the rate of preterm deliveries or peripartum infections, but recurrent or persistent BV increased the risk for these complications.

### Treatment of asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis in pregnancy to prevent preterm birth: an open-label pilot randomized controlled trial [^11162Apf]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Prevention of spontaneous preterm birth remains one of the most important challenges in modern maternity care. Whilst an association between ascending infection and preterm birth is undisputed, research focussed on finding effective preventive treatments has been disappointing. To date, most treatment trials (e.g. for bacterial vaginosis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, trichomoniasis) have found little effect on the rate of preterm birth. In contrast, in a randomized controlled trial of early antenatal screening (15–19 weeks) and treatment for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and/or trichomoniasis in early pregnancy, Kiss and colleagues reported a 46% reduction in the spontaneous preterm birth rate. Post-hoc subgroup analyses of this trial suggest the benefit was primarily among those women who were treated for asymptomatic candidiasis.

### The effect of introduction of a guideline on the management of vaginal discharge and in particular bacterial vaginosis in primary care [^1161vd78]. Family Practice (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the commonest cause of vaginal discharge, and its association with obstetric and gynaecological complications is being recognized increasingly. It was our impression that BV was poorly understood and underdiagnosed in family practice.

Objective

The aim of this study was to explore the management of patients with vaginal symptoms by family practitioners and to see if the management changed after the assimilation of best practice guidelines.

Method

Family practitioners were invited to complete a baseline questionnaire of their perceived practice, and to record actual practice when consulted about vaginal symptoms, for a minimum of 4 weeks. Consensus best practice guidelines were then provided and practice recorded for a similar period.

Results

Baseline data was received from 34 practitioners and suggested that the symptoms and signs of different vaginal infections were not well known. Most symptomatic patients were only investigated at re-presentation with unresolved symptoms or at recurrence, and 43% of respondents treated with empirical antifungals as a first line approach. Pregnant patients were only occasionally asked about symptoms and only occasionally examined if symptomatic. Pre-guideline practice data from 30 practitioners showed 1.2 patient consultations/week, of which 60% were examined and 55% had a high vaginal swab (HVS) sent. Only 2% had near-patient tests done. Post-guideline data from 23 family practitioners showed a lower recorded consultation rate at 0.7/week, but 90% of these were examined, 77% had an HVS sent and 69% had near-patient tests done. Of the 36 HVS examined by Gram stain, 19 (53%) showed Lactobacillus predominant flora and 10 (28%) suggested BV. Seven (19%) were borderline or ungradable. Only three (8%) showed yeasts, one of which also showed BV.

Conclusions

Baseline data supported our impression that BV was under-recognized. Guidelines appeared to improve the rate of investigation of women consulting with vaginal symptoms.

### Home screening for bacterial vaginosis to prevent sexually transmitted diseases [^116SJv3s]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Longitudinal studies have consistently found a significant association between bacterial vaginosis (BV) and acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases. However, there are limited prospective data to confirm these findings.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label trial of home screening and treatment of young women with asymptomatic BV who were also at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases. These women were screened every 2 months for 12 months and randomized to treatment with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days or observation alone. The primary outcome was the incidence of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia.

Results

A total of 1365 subjects were enrolled in the study across 10 sites. Adherence with mailing specimens obtained at home was excellent in both groups (84%-88%). The incidence of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia was 19.1 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval, 15.1–22.1) for the treatment group and 18.5 per 100 person-years (15.1–22.8) for the observation arm, a difference that was not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Young women were very amenable to home screening for BV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Treatment of asymptomatic BV with 1 week of oral metronidazole did not decrease the incidence of gonorrhea and/or chlamydia.

### Prediction and prevention of spontaneous preterm birth: ACOG practice bulletin, number 234 [^114r73rf]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for preterm labor, more specifically with respect to screening for bacterial vaginosis, ACOG 2021 guidelines recommend to do not offer screening and antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis for the prevention of preterm birth in pregnant individuals without symptoms of vaginitis.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111Jijaa]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others generally do not support screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists notes that intervention studies based on screening tests, including testing for bacterial vaginosis, in asymptomatic women have not demonstrated improved perinatal outcomes and it does not recommend these tests as a screening strategy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that 'Evidence does not support routine screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. Symptomatic women should be evaluated and treated'. The American Academy of Family Physicians endorses the 2008 USPSTF recommendation on screening for bacterial vaginosis.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^117KbQeT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcome and, in particular, preterm birth. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth and its consequences.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (September 2002).

Selection Criteria

Randomized trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers assessed trials and extracted data independently. Study authors were contacted for additional information.

Main Results

Ten trials involving 4249 women were included; all were of good quality. Antibiotic therapy was effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (odds ratio (OR) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.24, eight trials of 3825 women). Treatment did not significantly reduce the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.10, eight trials of 4062 women), 34 weeks (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.07, five trials of 851 women), or 32 weeks (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.68, three trials of 3080 women). However, antibiotic treatment did significantly decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.67, three trials of 562 women). In women with a previous preterm birth, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent preterm birth (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.17, five trials of 622 women) but it did decrease the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.38, two trials of 114 women) and low birthweight (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.75, five trials of 622 women).

Reviewer's Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. However, the current evidence does not support screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth and its consequences. For women with a previous preterm birth, there is little suggestion that detection and treatment of bacterial vaginosis will prevent a further preterm birth, but it may reduce the risk of low birthweight and preterm prelabour rupture of membranes.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: a systematic review [^114Ks3zX]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, reproductive tract infection (ReTI) is a significant public health concern, especially in developing nations. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the incidence of curable ReTI or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among 357 million individuals every year on a global scale. These infections may occur either symptomatically or asymptomatically. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is one of the most frequently occurring genital tract infections among women of reproductive age. BV is a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome, which increases the risk ReTIs transmission and leads to considerable physical and psychosocial discomfort. In the United States, approximately one-third (29%) of women between 14 and 49 years have symptomatic or asymptomatic BV. The typical clinical symptoms are smelly (fish-like) vaginal discharge along with itching, burning, and pain sensation.

### Bacterial vaginosis [^115kaB7N]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a vaginal microbiome disorder that is associated with preterm birth and spontaneous abortion, increased risk of HIV infection and sexually transmitted infections, and has negative effects on quality of life. BV affects one in four women globally, with the highest burden in resource-limited settings. Marked alterations in vaginal microbiome composition, in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and in the proteome and metabolome characterize BV and contribute to adverse sequelae. Despite its prevalence, the exact aetiologic agent of BV is unknown and its pathophysiology is poorly understood. These knowledge gaps impede diagnostic and management approaches, with recommended treatment strategies resulting in recurrence that exceeds 50% over 3–6months. New data on the sexual transmission of BV, including evidence that male-partner treatment improves cure, have improved our understanding of its aetiology and pathogenesis, and provide opportunities for developing optimal diagnostic, treatment and prevention strategies. Other factors probably also contribute to the low efficacy of current treatments, including biofilm and/or antimicrobial resistance, and failure to recolonize a favourable vaginal microbiome after treatment. The complex pathophysiology of BV highlights that individualized and multifaceted management approaches will be required to manage the refractory and adverse sequelae of BV.

### Candidiasis (vulvovaginal) [^1149dSp5]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85% to 90% of cases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of alternative or complementary treatments for symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in non-pregnant women with symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to March 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 61 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments; douching; drug treatments; garlic; intravaginal preparations (boric acid, nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil); oral fluconazole; oral itraconazole; treating a male sexual partner; and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or vaginal).

### Inflammatory cytokine biomarkers to identify women with asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis who are at high risk of HIV infection [^116gmXMc]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and bacterial vaginosis (BV) cause genital inflammation and increase the risk of HIV infection. WHO-recommended syndromic STI and BV management is severely limited as many women with asymptomatic infections go untreated. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate genital cytokine profiles as a biomarker of STIs and BV to identify women with asymptomatic, treatable infections.

Methods

Concentrations of 42 cytokines in cervicovaginal lavages from 227 HIV-uninfected women were measured using Luminex. All women were screened for BV by microscopy and STIs using molecular assays. Multivariate analyses were used to identify cytokine profiles associated with STIs/BV.

Results

A multivariate profile of seven cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1α, IL-1β, tumour necrosis factor-β, IL-4, fractalkine, macrophage-derived chemokine, and interferon-γ) most accurately predicted the presence of a treatable genital condition, with 77% classification accuracy and 75% cross-validation accuracy (sensitivity 72%; specificity 81%, positive predictive value (PPV) 86%, negative predictive value (NPV) 64%). Concomitant increased IL-1β and decreased IP-10 concentrations predicted the presence of a treatable genital condition without a substantial reduction in predictive value (sensitivity 77%, specificity 72%, PPV 82% and NPV 65%), correctly classifying 75% of the women. This approach performed substantially better than clinical signs (sensitivity 19%, specificity 92%, PPV 79% and NPV 40%).

Conclusions

Supplementing syndromic management with an assessment of IL-1β and IP-10 as biomarkers of genital inflammation may improve STI/BV management for women, enabling more effective treatment of asymptomatic infections and potentially reducing their risk of HIV infection.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116jUAqZ]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment clarifies that the recommendation applies to screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis and does not address treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis. A draft was posted for public comment from October 8 to November 4, 2019. The need for studies that evaluate screening test accuracy in pregnant persons was added to Research Needs and Gaps, and although additional subgroup and test information was sought in the systematic evidence review, no additional evidence was identified.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^111tAqdi]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Context

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a strong independent risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. BV is found in 9% to 23% of pregnant women. Symptoms include vaginal discharge, pruritus, or malodor, but often women with BV are asymptomatic.

Objectives

To determine whether screening and treating pregnant women for BV reduces adverse pregnancy outcomes, as part of an assessment for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Randomized clinical trials of BV treatment in pregnancy that measured pregnancy outcomes were identified from multiple searches in MEDLINE from 1966 to 1999, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and Library, and national experts.

Study Selection

All randomized controlled trials of BV treatment in pregnancy that specifically measured pregnancy outcomes.

Data Extraction

The following information was abstracted: study design and blinding, diagnostic methods, antibiotic interventions, timing of antibiotic treatment in pregnancy, criteria for treatment, comorbidities, demographic details, risk factors for preterm delivery such as previous preterm delivery, compliance, rates of spontaneous and total preterm delivery less than 37 weeks and less than 34 weeks, preterm premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight less than 2500 grams, spontaneous abortion, postpartum endometritis, and neonatal sepsis. For each study, we measured the effect of treatment by calculating the difference in the rate of a given pregnancy outcome in the control group minus the treatment group (the absolute risk reduction [ARR]). A stepwise procedure based on the profile likelihood was applied to assess heterogeneity, to pool studies when appropriate, and to calculate the mean and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effect of treatment.

Data Synthesis

Seven randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis. We found no benefit to BV treatment in average-risk women for any pregnancy outcome. Results of studies of high-risk populations, women with previous preterm delivery, were statistically heterogeneous. They clustered into two groups; one showed no benefit (ARR = -0.08, 90% CI = -0.19 to 0.04), whereas the three homogeneous studies showed potential benefit of BV treatment (pooled ARR = 0.22; 90% CI = 0.13 to 0.31) for preterm delivery before 37 weeks. Four high-risk studies reported results for preterm delivery less than 34 weeks. The pooled estimate showed no benefit (ARR = 0.04; 90% CI = -0.02 to 0.09), but variation was noted among individual studies. Two trials of high-risk women found an increase in preterm delivery less than 34 weeks in women who did not have BV but received BV treatment. Comparisons of patient populations, treatment regimens, and study designs did not explain the heterogeneity among studies.

Conclusions

We found no benefit to routine BV screening and treatment. A subgroup of high-risk women may benefit from BV screening and treatment; however, there may be a subgroup for whom BV treatment could increase the occurrence of preterm delivery.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^113yDc2c]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most prevalent vaginal condition, affecting 30% of women globally. BV is associated with an increased risk of a broad range of gynaecological and obstetric sequelae including preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, early pregnancy loss in IVF, and HIV/STI acquisition and transmission. Although up to half of BV-affected women do not experience symptoms, for those that do, it is the symptoms themselves, including malodour and vaginal discharge, that cause significant distress to women and impact on their quality of life and relationships. Current evidence indicates that BV is a polymicrobial syndrome characterised by a shift in the composition of the vaginal microbiota from 'optimal' to 'non-optimal' This non-optimal microbiological state involves a reduction in protective lactobacilli, and an increase in bacterial diversity and facultative and strict anaerobes, including Gardnerella spp. Atopobium vaginae, Prevotella spp. and others, referred to as BV-associated bacteria (BVAB). While the exact pathogen/s responsible for BV are still debated, a recent conceptual model hypothesised that virulent strains of Gardnerella, as well as Prevotella bivia and A. vaginae, play a central role.

### Is bacterial vaginosis a stronger risk factor for preterm birth when it is diagnosed earlier in gestation? [^116arNBN]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

It is stated commonly that the earlier in pregnancy bacterial vaginosis is diagnosed, the greater is the increase in risk of preterm birth compared with women without bacterial vaginosis. However, this contention is based on small numbers of women.

Study Design

In this analysis of 12,937 women who were screened for bacterial vaginosis as part of a previously conducted clinical trial, the odds ratio of preterm birth (< 7 weeks of gestation) for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women was evaluated among women who were screened from 8 to 22 weeks of gestation.

Results

The odds ratio of preterm birth among bacterial vaginosis-positive versus bacterial vaginosis-negative women ranged from 1.1 to 1.6 and did not vary significantly according to the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened. The odds ratio for preterm birth did not vary significantly by gestational age at diagnosis when bacterial vaginosis was subdivided into Gram stain score 7 to 8 or 9 to 10.

Conclusion

Although bacterial vaginosis was associated with an increased risk of preterm birth, the gestational age at which bacterial vaginosis was screened for and diagnosed did not influence the increase.

### Prospective validation of a perinatal bacterial vaginosis screening risk score [^114qTUVq]. Journal of Perinatology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Prospectively validate an antenatal bacterial vaginosis (BV) risk score at two public health department obstetrics clinics.

Study Design

Women (n = 409) entering prenatal care received a BV risk score (range 0 to 16) at their first visit and at 24 to 28 weeks' gestation. BV was measured with Gram-stained vaginal smears. Normal discharge was used as a surrogate for being asymptomatic.

Results

Approximately half of the women scored ≥ 3 at each assessment. In total 29% had true BV at the first assessment (13% at the second assessment). The BV risk score (≥ 3) had 91% sensitivity and 63% specificity, and the BV risk score (≥ 5) had 88% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Among true cases, 42% were asymptomatic, of which 77% had risk scores ≥ 3. All symptomatic BV cases had risk scores ≥ 3.

Conclusion

In practice, the risk score identified both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. Asymptomatic women are of particular interest because they are not screened for BV under current practice guidelines.

### Vaginitis: diagnosis and treatment… [^115wGajQ]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS Treatment of bacterial vaginosis is recommended for resolving symptoms, as well as reducing the risk of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, human immunodeficiency virus, and herpes simplex virus type 2 infections. 37 Shifts in vaginal flora have been associated with increased risk of these infections, leading researchers to conclude that treatment of bacterial vaginosis may decrease susceptibility to these infections. 38, 39. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved a single-dose oral therapy for bacterial vaginosis, secnidazole, which will be available in 2018. Complicated Vulvovaginal Candidiasis. Patients with complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis require more aggressive therapy. To guide treatment, it is helpful to consider whether a patient has recurrent infections and whether the etiology may be a nonalbicans species of Candida.

For patients with severe vulvovaginal candidiasis, a second dose of fluconazole given three days after the first dose has been shown to achieve significant improvement in short-term symptoms as well as prevent recurrence at 35 days. A second dose did not have significant effects for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. 57 For recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis caused by Candida albicans, initial intensive therapy with fluconazole for seven to 14 days followed by weekly treatment with 150-mg fluconazole for six months has been shown to achieve symptomatic relief at one year for most patients.
58. If severe or recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis does not respond to initial treatment, culture may guide therapy when nonalbicans species are identified. Infections with nonalbicans species are less responsive to fluconazole. Topical imidazoles are more effective in eradication. 59 In a small study, topical terconazole was also shown to relieve symptoms and achieve mycologic cure for about 50% of patients. 60 For patients with nonalbicans infections who do not respond to these treatments, a regimen of 600-mg vaginal boric acid capsules daily for 14 days has been shown to be effective. 61.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant adolescents and women to prevent preterm delivery: updated evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^111x9NPu]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Preterm delivery results in adverse outcomes; identifying and treating bacterial vaginosis may reduce its occurrence.

Objective

To update the evidence on screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy for the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through May 29, 2019; bibliographies from retrieved articles, experts, and surveillance of the literature through December 31, 2019.

Study Selection

Fair- or good-quality English-language studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of tests feasible within primary care; randomized clinical trials (RCTs); nonrandomized controlled intervention studies (for harms only); or meta-analyses of metronidazole or clindamycin.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality; when at least 3 similar studies were available, meta-analyses were conducted.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Sensitivity, specificity, preterm delivery, maternal adverse effects, congenital birth defects, childhood cancer.

Results

Forty-four studies (48 publications) were included. No studies evaluated the benefits or harms of screening. Twenty-five studies (n = 15 785) evaluated the accuracy of screening tests; across individual studies and tests, sensitivity ranged from 0.36 to 1.0 and specificity ranged from 0.49 to 1.0. Among trials reporting findings from general obstetric populations (n = 7953), no significant association was observed between treatment and spontaneous delivery before 37 weeks (pooled absolute risk difference [ARD], -1.44% [95% CI, -3.31% to 0.43%]; 8 RCTs, n = 7571) or any delivery before 37 weeks (pooled ARD, 0.20% [95% CI, -1.13% to 1.53%]; 6 RCTs, n = 6307). Among 5 trials reporting findings among women with a prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent; 3 showed a significant beneficial effect, while 2 did not. Maternal adverse events from treatment were infrequent and minor (eg, candidiasis) but were slightly more common with active treatment compared with placebo across 8 RCTs. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported no significant association between metronidazole exposure and congenital malformations (odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.75 to 1.22]; odds ratio, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.29]). One cohort study reported no significantly increased incidence of childhood cancer among metronidazole-exposed children (adjusted relative risk, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.41 to 1.59]). However, studies of in utero exposure had important limitations.

Conclusions and Relevance

Accuracy of screening tests for bacterial vaginosis varies. The evidence suggests no difference in the incidence of preterm delivery and related outcomes from treatment for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in a general obstetric population but was inconclusive for women with a prior preterm delivery. Maternal adverse events from treatment appear to be infrequent and minor, but the evidence about harms from in utero exposure was inconclusive.

### Effectiveness and costs of molecular screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth: the auTop randomized clinical trial [^111yUdGe]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are the medical and economic effects of screen and treat for bacterial vaginosis using point-of-care quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction during pregnancy?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 6671 pregnant women enrolled before 20 weeks' gestation assigned to screen and treat or usual care, the preterm birth rate was 3.8% and 4.6%, respectively, which was not significantly different. Total costs were also not significantly different.

Meaning

Compared with usual care, screen and treat for bacterial vaginosis did not reduce the risk of preterm birth; however, this strategy should be further evaluated in nulliparous and high-risk multiparous women.

### Candidiasis (vulvovaginal) [^114FNcZs]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vulvovaginal candidiasis is estimated to be the second most common cause of vaginitis after bacterial vaginosis. Candida albicans accounts for 85–90% of cases.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for acute vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner to resolve symptoms and prevent recurrence in non-pregnant women with symptomatic acute vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of drug treatments, alternative or complementary treatments for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis in non-pregnant symptomatic women? What are the effects of treating a male sexual partner in non-pregnant women with symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis? What are the effects of treating asymptomatic non-pregnant women with a positive swab for candidiasis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to October 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 58 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: alternative or complementary treatments, douching, drug treatments, garlic, intravaginal preparations (boric acid, nystatin, imidazoles, tea tree oil), oral fluconazole, oral itraconazole, treating a male sexual partner, and yoghurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus (oral or vaginal).

### Vaginitis: beyond the basics [^115foRX3]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Vaginal complaints are one of the most common reasons women seek the advice of a health care provider. Uncomplicated infections such as vulvovaginal candidiasis, bacterial vaginosis, or trichomoniasis are easy to diagnose and treat. However, about 8% of patients will have a more complicated course with failure to respond to treatment or rapid recurrence of symptoms. Understanding the need for a methodical, diagnostic approach to help these women with recurrent or refractory cases of vaginal symptoms will aid the clinician achieve successful patient outcomes.

### Bacterial vaginosis among women at high risk for HIV in Uganda: high rate of recurrent diagnosis despite treatment [^11145Mqq]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2016). Low credibility.

BV prevalence over time and untreated BV

Of the 1027 women enrolled in the study, 69% were retained in follow-up at 24 months with a median of four visits per woman (range 1–7), amounting to a total of 5801 total visits. Of these, 5568 (96%) had an available Nugent score result and were included in the analyses. The per-visit BV prevalence was 57%, and 88% of the entire cohort had at least one positive BV result. Of the women who attended all seven clinical visits, more than half (58%) of the participants had a positive BV result for at least four of the seven visits. Of the 3184 visits with BV diagnosis, 2033 (64%) had no signs or symptoms corresponding to a diagnosis of VDS or PID documented, and therefore, remained untreated in line with current guidelines. However, of these untreated BV cases, about half (46%) reported at least one genital symptom and were not strictly asymptomatic.

Prevalence of BV at enrolment was 56%, and there was a small increase over time (OR trend = 1.10; 95% CI 1.05 to 1.14 per 3-month period) (table 1). However, there was a decrease in prevalence of BV with any genital symptoms and treated BV over time (OR trend = 0.48; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.52, OR trend = 0.77; 95% CI 0.74 to 0.82, respectively). We carried out a sensitivity analysis by restricting the data to the 584 participant samples available at 24 months, but the prevalences and trends remained unchanged (see online supplementary table S1).

### Infection, antibiotics, and preterm delivery [^115tPnnD]. Seminars in Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

The relationship between genital tract infection and preterm delivery has been established on the basis of biochemical, microbiological, and clinical evidence. In theory, pathogenic bacteria may ascend from the lower reproductive tract into the uterus, and the resulting inflammation leads to preterm labor, rupture of the membranes, and birth. A growing body of evidence suggests that preterm labor and/rupture of the membranes are triggered by micro-organisms in the genital tract and by the host response to these organisms, ie, elaboration of cytokines and proteolytic enzymes. Epidemiologic and in vitro studies do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between infection and preterm birth. However, the preponderance of evidence indicates that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and symptomatic lower genital tract infections such as bacterial vaginosis (BV), trichomoniasis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia will lower the risk of preterm delivery. Based on current evidence, pregnant women who note an abnormal vaginal discharge should be tested for BV, trichomonas, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. Those who test positive should be treated appropriately. A 3- to 7-day course of antibiotic treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is clinically indicated to reduce the risk of pyelonephritis and preterm delivery. Routine screening for chlamydia and gonorrhea should be performed for women at high risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. The practice of routine screening for BV in asymptomatic women who are at low risk for preterm delivery cannot be supported based on evidence from the literature. Routine screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy is cost-effective, particularly in high-prevalence populations. The results of antibiotic trials for the treatment of preterm labor have been inconsistent. In the absence of reasonable evidence that antimicrobial therapy leads to significant prolongation of pregnancy in the setting of preterm labor, antibiotics should be used only for protecting the neonate from group B streptococci sepsis. They should not be used for the purpose of prolonging pregnancy. Multiple investigations have shown that, in patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes, prophylactic antibiotics are of value in prolonging the latent period between rupture of the membranes and onset of labor and in reducing the incidence of maternal and neonatal infection. The most extensively tested effective antibiotic regimen for prophylaxis involves erythromycin alone or in combination with ampicilln. Controversy still exists regarding the appropriate length and route of antibiotic prophylaxis.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: a systematic review [^113yhVEz]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The extensive database searches and cross-referencing ensured no duplication of data with previously published systematic reviews. Any potentially overlapping studies were analyzed for relevance and then categorized appropriately based on the scope of this review. The findings of this study may help to strengthen the current practices and offer valuable insights that could potentially reform future guidelines and policies in the field of obstetrics and gynaecology. This comprehensive review serves as a valuable resource for obstetricians and other healthcare providers responsible for the care of pregnant individuals. It emphasizes the necessity of routine screening and treatment of bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy, and underscores the importance of further research to develop effective strategies for the prevention of BV and its associated adverse outcomes in this target population.

Although the present study contributed to some meaningful insights, it had some limitations as well. The study's selection criteria led to the inclusion of a higher number of studies targeting African women which affected the overall pooled data on BV prevalence, risk factors, and pregnancy outcomes. Hence, this has caused potential biases in our research. Furthermore, the inclusion of different study designs led to some degree of data heterogeneity in this systematic review. Since most of the included studies had an observational design, their analysis needs to be interpreted with caution. This study focused on BV prevalence irrespective of the test method used. Most of the studies included in this review have used the Nugent scoring system which is considered the gold standard for BV diagnosis. Other factors that contributed to the heterogeneity of included studies were the differences in patient characteristics (age range, parity, symptomatic or asymptomatic BV, gestational age, presence of mixed infections, and sexual relationship with partner). The scarcity of relevant studies did not allow us to adjust the confounders which resulted in heterogeneity in the study findings. Future reviews on this topic may benefit from incorporating standardized quality assessment frameworks to enhance the methodological transparency.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116p9qnj]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy — benefits of early detection and treatment: No studies were identified that directly evaluated the benefit of screening for bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant persons. Thirteen randomized clinical trials of treatment in asymptomatic pregnant women — using oral metronidazole (3 trials), oral metronidazole plus erythromycin (1 trial), oral clindamycin (2 trials), and intravaginal clindamycin (7 trials) — showed no statistically significant benefit in general obstetric populations for all-cause preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks (pooled RR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.86–1.20]; 6 studies; n = 6307), spontaneous preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks (pooled RR, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.86–1.07]; 8 studies; n = 7571), preterm delivery prior to 32 weeks (pooled RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.54–1.42]; 3 studies; n = 5564), low birth weight less than 2500 g (pooled RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.83–1.29]; 5 studies; n = 5377), birth weight less than 1500 g (pooled RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.50–2.18]; 3 studies; n = 5149), and PROM or preterm PROM (pooled RR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.72–1.72]; 4 studies; n = 3568). Among women with a history of prior preterm delivery, findings were inconsistent: for preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks, RRs ranged from 0.71 to 1.33 (4 trials; n = 451), and for preterm delivery prior to 34 weeks, RRs were 1.02 (95% CI, 0.07–14.05) in 1 study and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.08–2.11) in the other; Ten to 19% of participants in these trials had a history of prior preterm delivery.

Vaginal symptoms are common in the general population and are one of the most frequent reasons for patient visits to obstetrician-gynecologists. Vaginitis may have important consequences in terms of discomfort and pain, days lost from school or work, and sexual functioning and self image. Vaginitis is associated with sexually transmitted diseases and other infections of the female genital tract, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as well as adverse reproductive outcomes in pregnant and nonpregnant women. Treatment usually is directed to the specific cause of vaginal symptoms, which most commonly include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. The purpose of this document is to provide information about the diagnosis and treatment of vaginitis.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^117DFYcd]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal dysbiosis to affect women globally, yet an unacceptably high proportion of women experience BV recurrence within 6 months of recommended antibiotic therapy. The low rate of sustained cure highlights our limited understanding of the pathogenesis of BV recurrence, which has been attributed to possible persistence and re-emergence of BV-associated bacteria (BVAB) or a BV-associated biofilm following antimicrobials and/or reinfection occurring from sexual partners. There is a robust body of evidence to support the exchange of bacteria between partners during sexual activity, and while the hypothesis that women treated for BV are subsequently reinfected with BVAB following sex with an untreated sexual partner is not new, failure of past partner treatment trials has eroded confidence in this concept. If reinfection is a key driver of recurrence, current antimicrobial regimens directed to women alone are unlikely to achieve a high level of sustained cure, and the approach of partner treatment to reduce reinfection is justified. In this manuscript, we present the molecular and epidemiological evidence that underlies the hypothesis that BV is sexually transmitted, and summarise why research that continues to consider sexual partnerships is necessary. We also outline the significant barriers and challenges that we have identified while undertaking partner treatment studies, and we discuss the factors that impact on our ability to determine their effectiveness. Ultimately, the pathogenesis of BV recurrence is likely to be multifaceted and not attributable to a single mechanism in all women. If we are to achieve sustained cure for women, it is likely that combined and individualised approaches to eradicate BVAB, support an optimal vaginal microbiome, and prevent reinfection from partners will be required.

### Suppressive antibacterial therapy with 0.75% metronidazole vaginal gel to prevent recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^114xe75Z]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Efficacy study of suppressive vaginal metronidazole in reducing recurrent symptomatic episodes of bacterial vaginosis.

Study Design

Multicenter prospective study with initial 10-day open-label metronidazole gel in which asymptomatic responders randomly assigned to receive twice weekly metronidazole vaginal gel or placebo for 16 weeks and off therapy for 12 weeks.

Results

Of 157 eligible women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis, 112 of 127 returning evaluable women (88.2%) responded clinically and were randomly assigned. During suppressive therapy, recurrent bacterial vaginosis occurred in 13 women (25.5%) receiving metronidazole and 26 (59.1%) receiving placebo (MITT analysis, relative risk [RR] 0.43, CI = 0.25–0.73, P = 0.001). During the entire 28-week follow-up, recurrence occurred in 26 (51.0%) on treatment compared with 33 (75%) on placebo (RR 0.68, CI = 0.49–0.93, P = 0.02). Probability for remaining cured was 70% for metronidazole compared with 39% on placebo, which declined to 34% and 18%, respectively, by 28 weeks follow-up. Adverse effects were uncommon; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis occurred significantly more often in metronidazole-treated women (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Suppressive therapy with twice-weekly metronidazole gel achieves a significant reduction in the recurrence rate of bacterial vaginosis; however, secondary vaginal candidiasis is common.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: prevention of infection after abortion and pregnancy loss [^116widQW]. Contraception (2025). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion — We recommend against screening for bacterial vaginosis (BV) before abortion (GRADE 1C). Symptomatic patients with BV should be treated, and abortion should not be delayed while awaiting treatment. BV is common, with a prevalence of approximately 30% in reproductive-age, pregnant-capable persons globally, and is associated with increased risk for pelvic inflammatory disease (adjusted hazard ratio 1.53, 95% CI 1.05–2.21). Randomized trials of perioperative metronidazole or clindamycin showed no statistically significant differences in postabortion upper genital tract infection versus placebo when standard prophylactic antibiotics were provided; one study using treatment dosing with metronidazole 500 mg three times daily orally for 10 days starting 7 days before the abortion procedure significantly reduced the risk of developing PID postprocedure, but these patients did not receive universal prophylactic antibiotics before abortion.

USPSTF rationale for screening asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy notes diagnostic capability but limited benefit: There is adequate evidence that currently available tests can accurately identify bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery has no net benefit in preventing preterm delivery. The USPSTF concludes that for pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery, the evidence is insufficient and conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

### Genitourinary pathogens and preterm birth [^115hLLmn]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to describe and quantify the association between genitourinary tract infections and preterm birth.

Recent Findings

Recent studies confirm the importance of identifying and treating both asymptomatic and symptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy, which is reflected in current antenatal screening guidelines. These guidelines do not recommend routine screening for other asymptomatic lower genital infections (bacterial vaginosis, trichomonas and gonorrhoea) reflecting inconsistent study results, which may reflect differences in study design, size, diagnostics and the timing of screening in pregnancy. Screening for group B Streptococcus (GBS) late in pregnancy is recognized to reduce neonatal disease, but there is a striking lack of robust studies, specifically randomized controlled trials (RCTs), considering the effect of GBS screening earlier in pregnancy on adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Summary

The potential for screening and treatment of genitourinary tract infections in pregnancy to reduce preterm birth rates has been demonstrated in some RCTs. Current guidelines do not reflect these data because of inconsistencies across the body of evidence. There is a need for robust RCTs to confirm or refute earlier data, to inform the optimal timing for screening in pregnancy and to better quantify the contribution of individual infections to the burden of preterm birth.

### Asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis: response to therapy [^113B64BR]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

Bacterial vaginosis causes symptomatic vaginal discharge and has been associated with preterm birth and with the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus. Half of all women with bacterial vaginosis are free of symptoms, and treatment of these women is controversial. The objective of this study was to determine the extent of poor symptom recognition in this group of women.

Study Design

Seventy-five women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic who had asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis were entered into a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing metronidazole gel with placebo. Subjects' perceptions about changes in vaginal discharge and odor were determined, and treatment and placebo groups were compared by means of standard statistical analysis.

Results

When subjects were stratified by treatment group, there were no differences in their retrospective assessments of vaginal discharge and odor. A subset of women who had normalization of clinical parameters or of Gram stain scores did admit retrospectively to improvement; however, the difference between this group and the group without normalization was not statistically significant. Twenty-one percent of treated women subsequently had vaginal candidiasis.

Conclusions

A greater percentage of women with resolution of bacterial vaginosis did retrospectively notice improvement in vaginal discharge and odor in comparison with those women without resolution; however, this was not statistically significant. These findings do not support routine treatment of women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis.

This article summarizes recent data in each of these key topic areas as they pertain to bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal discharge. The evidence reviewed primarily focused on updates in the global epidemiology of BV, risk factors for BV, data supportive of sexual transmission of BV-associated bacteria, BV molecular diagnostic tests, and novel treatment regimens. Additionally, recent literature on alcohol abstinence in the setting of 5-nitroimidazole use was reviewed.

### A randomized trial of metronidazole in asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis to prevent the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases [^1168dK89]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV) decreases the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).

Study Design

Women with asymptomatic BV were studied prospectively to determine the effect of treatment of BV for the prevention of STD. Women were assigned randomly to observation or treatment and prophylaxis with intravaginal metronidazole gel. Women were screened monthly for STDs.

Results

Women who were assigned randomly to receive metronidazole gel had a significantly longer time to the development of STDs compared with women in the observation group (P = 0.02). The 6-month STD rate was 1.58 per person-year (95% CI, 1.29, 1.87) for women in the metronidazole gel group vs 2.29 per person-year (95% CI, 1.95, 2.63) for women in the observational group. The difference in STD rates was driven by a significant difference in the number of chlamydial infections (P = 0.013).

Conclusion

Treatment and twice-weekly prophylactic use of intravaginal metronidazole gel resulted in significantly fewer cases of chlamydia.

Infection and preterm birth

Microbiological studies suggest that intrauterine infections account for 25–40% of preterm births; but this is likely to be an under-estimate because intrauterine infection is difficult to detect with conventional culture techniques. The mechanisms by which intrauterine infections lead to preterm labour relate to activation of the innate immune system. Microorganisms are recognised by pattern-recognition receptors which in turn elicit the release of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines. Microbial endotoxins and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the production of prostaglandins, other inflammatory mediators, and matrix-degrading enzymes. Prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractility and initiate labour, while degradation of extracellular matrix in the fetal membranes leads to preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes.

Recognition that it is ascending infection that leads to preterm birth has led to a number of studies that have evaluated the treatment of vaginal infection in pregnancy to reduce preterm birth. To date, most of the intervention trials have found little effect on the rate of preterm birth. Antibiotics prior to pregnancy do not reduce preterm birth. A Cochrane systematic review of the effectiveness of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis to prevent prematurity concludes that there is "little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis will prevent preterm birth and its consequences". Similarly, antibiotic treatment of vaginal Ureaplasma urealyticum and Chlamydia trachomatis have not significantly reduced preterm birth rates. Finally, there is a possibility that the use of metronidazole to treat trichomoniasis in pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of prematurity.

In contrast to these negative results, a recent randomised controlled trial of antenatal screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis, candidiasis and/or trichomoniasis in early pregnancy (15–19 weeks gestation) among over 4 000 asymptomatic pregnant women reduced the spontaneous preterm birth rate by 46%. The benefit appeared to be limited to those women who were treated for asymptomatic candidiasis, however this interpretation is based on post-hoc subgroup analysis of this trial. On the other hand, two observational studies that included Candida in pregnancy, conducted in low socioeconomic populations in the USA in the 1980 s, found no association with preterm birth although one found a significantly increased risk of intra-uterine growth retardation among women with candidiasis (aOR 1.94, 95%CI 1.2–3.1). Importantly, in the latter, studies screening was performed later in pregnancy (22–30 weeks gestation) and did not include women with low-level Candida colonisation. Such conflicting results emphasise the need to evaluate interventions with appropriately designed randomised clinical trials.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1169cxAp]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Bacterial vaginosis is common and is caused by a disruption of the microbiological environment in the lower genital tract. In the US, reported prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women ranges from 5.8% to 19.3% and is higher in some races/ethnicities. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes including preterm delivery, early miscarriage, postpartum endometritis, and low birth weight.

Objective

To update its 2008 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a review of the evidence on the accuracy of screening and the benefits and harms of screening for and treatment of bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery.

Population

This recommendation applies to pregnant persons without symptoms of bacterial vaginosis.

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery has no net benefit in preventing preterm delivery. The USPSTF concludes that for pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery, the evidence is conflicting and insufficient, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot be determined.

Conclusions and Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends against screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons not at increased risk for preterm delivery. (D recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery.

### Effect of population-based antenatal screening and treatment of genitourinary tract infections on birth outcomes in sylhet, Bangladesh (MIST): a cluster-randomised clinical trial [^114uWAun]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis, the most prevalent reproductive tract infection in pregnancy globally, is consistently associated with preterm birth. It is a polymicrobial syndrome triggered by imbalance in concentrations of endogenous vaginal microflora and overgrowth of anaerobic species. The term abnormal vaginal flora includes bacterial vaginosis and an earlier transitional state towards bacterial vaginosis, which is known as intermediate flora. Screening and treatment of bacterial vaginosis has no effect on preterm delivery in low-risk pregnancies, and the US Preventive Services Task Force advises against routine screening in asymptomatic pregnant women. However, two randomised placebo-controlled trials, in the UK in women with abnormal vaginal flora showed that treatment in early pregnancy (ie, < 24 weeks), before the sealing of the amniotic membranes, reduced the incidence of preterm birth. These trials separately examined oraland intravaginaltreatment with clindamycin, demonstrating substantive (> 50%) reductions in risk of preterm birth.

Urinary tract infections affect an estimated one in four pregnant women in LMICs. In the USA in the 1960s, before routine screening was introduced, 40% of pregnant women with untreated bacteriuria developed pyelonephritis, and 30–50% of women with pyelonephritis delivered preterm. In a meta-analysis, pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria had a two-times higher risk of preterm delivery (relative risk 2.00 [95% CI 1.43–2.77]) compared with those without bacteriuria. Although evidence for the effect of treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria on preterm birth risk is weak, treatment significantly reduces maternal pyelonephritisand risk of low birthweight, and screening and treatment are recommended in pregnancy by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, Canadian Task Force on Preventive Care, and the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. In 2016, WHO made context-specific antenatal care recommendations for screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in LMICs.

We hypothesised that abnormal vaginal flora and urinary tract infections were prevalent and not adequately addressed in the rural district of Sylhet in Bangladesh. In view of strong observational data, promising preliminary intervention studies of treatment of abnormal vaginal flora, and an absence of effective primary prevention measures in low-income and middle-income settings, we aimed to assess the effect of a community-based antenatal screening and treatment programme for abnormal vaginal flora and urinary tract infections in early pregnancy (13–19 weeks) on population-level rates of preterm birth in Sylhet.

### Time course of the regression of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy with and without treatment [^115PWbLC]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of treatment over time for bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and the probability of spontaneous resolution with placebo.

Study Design

Women with asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis on Gram stain were assigned randomly at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation to receive two 2-g doses of metronidazole or placebo 48 hours apart and were re-evaluated for changes in Gram stain score on one occasion ≥ 2 weeks later.

Results

Of 658 women who underwent metronidazole therapy, treatment was successful (score, < 7) in 78% of those women who were seen at 2 to 3.9 weeks of gestation, which was similar to women seen ≥ 10 weeks after treatment. In 683 women who underwent placebo therapy, spontaneous resolution increased significantly from 13% at 2 to 3.9 weeks of gestation to 36% at ≥ 10 weeks of gestation. Spontaneous resolution was more common with lower vaginal pH or lactobacilli on Gram stain at the time of random assignment.

Conclusion

The effectiveness of metronidazole therapy of bacterial vaginosis persists for ≥ 10 weeks. Women who underwent placebo therapy had significant remission of bacterial vaginosis over ≥ 10 weeks. Remission was more common when the initial vaginal microbiologic disturbances were less severe.

The use of biochemical profiles and new molecular microbiologic methodologies is transforming our understanding of BV. Most important is the recognition of different subgroups of women who have BV who are at variable risk of certain obstetric and gynecologic complications. New diagnostic tests may soon be available that will allow women to test self-obtained specimens. Treatment of BV has lagged, although innovative methods appear to be helpful in managing recurrent diseases.

### Assessment and treatment of vaginitis [^1166aRMr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Vaginitis is the presenting symptom at millions of office visits each year in the United States. Although treatment of sporadic cases is often straightforward, recurrent cases present both diagnostic and treatment challenges. Molecular diagnostic tests are likely superior to in-office microscopy for most clinicians and most cases. In both recurrent bacterial vaginosis and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis, national treatment guidelines recommend an extended treatment duration with one of the first-line agents. In cases in which such treatment is not successful, vaginal boric acid is likely the cheapest and easiest alternative option. New antifungal medications offer additional but limited treatment options. Probiotics are not recommended for prevention of vulvovaginal candidiasis; however, vaginal products containing Lactobacillus crispatus may have promise for recurrent bacterial vaginosis. Trichomoniasis should be treated with a 1-week course of metronidazole; this is the only sexually transmitted infection for which treatment recommendations vary by sex. In cases in which patients do not respond to initial treatment, the diagnosis should be reconsidered, and other potential causes such as desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, or vulvodynia should be considered.

### Antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis [^1114xE4P]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is an infection that has a prevalence between 10% to 50% worlwide. BV results in an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora. Microorganisms associated with BV have been isolated from the normal flora of the male genital tract, and their presence could be related to the recurrence of BV after antibiotic treatment. Therefore, the treatment of sexual partners could decrease the recurrence of infection and possibly the burden of the disease.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness in women and the safety in men of concurrent antibiotic treatment for the sexual partners of women treated for BV.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialized Register (23 July 2016), CENTRAL (1991 to 23 July 2016), MEDLINE (1946 to 23 July 2016), Embase (1974 to 23 July 2016), LILACS (1982 to 23 July 2016), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (23 July 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (23 July 2016) and the Web of Science™ (2001 to 23 July 2016). We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the concurrent use of any antibiotic treatment with placebo, no intervention or any other intervention by the sexual partners of women treated for BV.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies. We resolved any disagreements through consensus. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Seven RCTs (1026 participants) met our inclusion criteria, and pharmaceutical industry funded four of these trials. Five trials (854 patients) compared any antibiotic treatment of sexual partners with placebo. Based on high quality evidence, antibiotic treatment does not increase the rate of clinical or symptomatic improvement in women during the first week (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.03; 712 participants, four studies; RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.12; 577 patients, three studies, respectively), between the first and fourth week (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.11; 590 participants, three studies; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.03; 444 participants, two studies; respectively) or after the fourth week (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; 572 participants, four studies; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.17; 296 participants, two studies; respectively). Antibiotic treatment does not led to a lower recurrence during the first and fourth week (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.43; 218 participants, one study; low quality evidence) or after the fourth week of treatment (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.52; 372 participants, three studies; low quality evidence) in women, but increases the frequency of adverse events (most frequently gastrointestinal symptoms) reported by sexual partners (RR 2.55, 95% CI 1.55 to 4.18; 477 participants, three studies; low quality evidence). Two trials (172 participants) compared any antibiotic treatment for sexual partners with no intervention. When we compared it with no intervention, the effects of antibiotic treatment on recurrence rate after the fourth week (RR 1.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 4.55; 51 participants, one study), clinical improvement between the first and fourth week (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.25; 152 participants, two studies) and symptomatic improvement after the fourth week (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.11; 70 participants, one study) were imprecise and there were no differences between groups. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low or very low.

Authors' Conclusions

High quality evidence shows that antibiotic treatment for sexual partners of women with BV, compared with placebo, does not increase the rate of clinical or symptomatic improvement during the first, between the first and fourth or after the fourth week into the women. Low quality evidence suggests that antibiotic treatment does not led to a lower recurrence rate during the first and fourth or after the fourth week of treatment into the women, but increases the frequency of adverse events reported by sexual partners. Finally, compared with no intervention, antibiotic treatment does not decrease the recurrence rate after the fourth week and does not increase the frequency of clinical or symptomatic improvement between the first and fourth or after the fourth week into the women, respectively.

### Male partner treatment and the potential sexual transmission of bacterial vaginosis: considerations for patient counseling and clinical application in the United States [^116XfxEA]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common cause of vaginal complaints among reproductive-aged women, is highly recurrent and often challenging to treat. Whether BV is sexually transmissible has long been questioned by patients, providers, and researchers. Multiple prior studies evaluating male partner treatment (MPT) have failed to show an improvement in outcomes. However, for the first time, an open-label, randomized controlled trial in Australia showed a decrease in BV recurrences in women whose male partners were treated with a combination of oral metronidazole and topical clindamycin cream over 12 weeks. Many unanswered questions remain; more research is needed to investigate whether the results of this trial are applicable to broader populations. Nonetheless, these results have garnered substantial public attention. This has resulted in increasing questions from patients regarding both MPT and the sexual transmissibility of BV. Here, we review evidence regarding the sexual transmission of BV, discuss complexities with potential implementation of MPT, and provide a framework from which to counsel patients.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1129qYSZ]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy — prevalence and risk factors for preterm delivery: Bacterial vaginosis occurs in as many as 29% of women in the US and in 5.8% to 19.3% of pregnant women, and history of a prior preterm delivery is associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds for preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancies while bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy is associated with a 2-fold higher odds for preterm delivery; additional risk factors include low maternal body mass index (< 20, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Preterm birth rates vary by race/ethnicity in the US, with reported rates of 8.6% among Asian women, 11.8% among Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander women, 9.7% among Hispanic women, 11.5% among American Indian/Alaska Native women, 14.1% among black women, and 9.6% among white women, and among women with a prior preterm delivery the rate of recurrent preterm delivery in African American women is 4 times higher than in white women. Even when these risk factors are present, it is unclear whether screening and treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at increased risk for preterm delivery prevents preterm delivery.

Bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth — epidemiology and clinical importance: In the US, reported prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women ranges from 5.8% to 19.3% and is higher in some races/ethnicities. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes including preterm delivery, early miscarriage, postpartum endometritis, and low birth weight. Bacterial vaginosis is often asymptomatic, can resolve spontaneously, and recurs often, with or without treatment. In the US, approximately 10% of live births are preterm (born prior to 37 weeks' gestation). Preterm birth is associated with serious complications, including major intraventricular hemorrhage, acute respiratory illnesses, and sepsis.

### Effectiveness and costs of molecular screening and treatment for bacterial vaginosis to prevent preterm birth: the auTop randomized clinical trial [^115Zrt7c]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Preterm birth affects approximately 5% to 11% of births worldwide, with variation by country, ethnicity, or other factors. This figure has remained constant despite different preventive strategies or treatments. Among the risk factors, bacterial vaginosis (BV) is well known.BV is a common vaginal dysbiosis, with a predominance of anaerobic bacteria associated with a lack of lactobacillus, detected with various diagnosis methods. Often asymptomatic, BV increases the risk of preterm birth from 2-fold to 7-fold according to the gestational age at diagnosis; the earlier the age, the higher the risk. The conventional diagnosis of BV can be clinical according to Amsel criteria or based on Nugent criteria, vaginal pH, or molecular diagnosis.

Debate remains regarding the effectiveness of screening and treating BV during pregnancy. Three meta-analyses evaluated the impact on pregnancy outcome of screen and treat interventions for pregnant women using conventional diagnosis methods for BV. Lamont et al(5 studies and 2346 patients) reported a benefit of screen and treat using clindamycin. The Cochrane Database update (21 studies and 7847 patients) does not recommend screening for BVbut highlights that 2 studies that included intermediate flora as part of their criteria showed a 50% reduction in preterm delivery and an 80% reduction in miscarriages. More recently and after the implementation of the present study, the updated systematic review for US Preventive Services Task Force(n = 48 studies), including the results from the large PREMEVA study, still showed that conventional screening tests for BV varied in accuracy, suggested no efficacy of treatment for asymptomatic BV in a general obstetric population, and was inconclusive for women with a history of prior preterm delivery. Based on this literature, international and French recommendations advise against screening with conventional diagnosis tools in low-risk populations, even though 65% of preterm births occur in patients with no obstetrical history or identified risk factors.

### Prevalence of reproductive tract and sexually transmitted infections among symptomatic and asymptomatic women, validity of syndromic management, in urban and periurban low to mid socioeconomic neighbourhoods of north delhi: an observational study [^1161QKtT]. BMJ Public Health (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Reproductive tract infections and sexually transmitted infections (RTIs/STIs) represent a significant global public health threat, impacting sexual and reproductive health worldwide. They contribute to substantial morbidity, including infertility, chronic pelvic pain, cancers and pregnancy complications. Notably, the WHO estimates that over 1 million STIs occur daily, with the majority remaining asymptomatic. These 'hidden epidemics', as termed by the Institute of Medicine, present a major challenge.

India faces a substantial burden of RTIs/STIs, with an estimated 30–35 million episodes occurring annually (6%). However, the true scale of these infections remains elusive due to a lack of widespread screening strategies. The concern is about undetected asymptomatic STIs as they fuel transmission, distort disease burden data and can indirectly lead to overtreatment. Asymptomatic individuals unknowingly spread infections, sustaining community transmission. For example, many chlamydia and gonorrhoea cases are asymptomatic yet infectious.

Underdiagnosis underestimates prevalence, hindering public health planning and missed opportunities for treatment. Paradoxically, it can also cause overtreatment, as clinicians may empirically treat, based on symptoms or risk, leading to unnecessary antibiotic use and resistance. Addressing this requires better screening and point of care diagnostics for effective control and rational treatment.

Furthermore, recent research unveils a potentially crucial link between vaginal dysbiosis (a condition characterised by imbalances in the vaginal microbiome), increasing susceptibility to bacterial STIs such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV), as well as viral ones like HIV and HPV. Bacterial vaginosis (BV), the most common form of vaginal dysbiosis, has been implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including second-trimester miscarriage, preterm birth and postcaesarean section endometritis. Especially, multiple sexual partners and inconsistent condom use are closely associated with an increased risk of BV.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: a systematic review [^1142qKYq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Symptomatic BV can be treated with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. Topical alternatives include vaginal metronidazole gel and clindamycin cream. In multiple recurrent cases of BV, longer therapeutic courses are often recommended. Since BV treatment is based on the presence of abnormal vaginal discharge and the standard syndromic management of STIs, asymptomatic pregnant women may tend to remain untreated due to this therapeutic approach.

In the past, several risk factors have been associated with BV, including race and ethnicity, low socio-economic status, antibiotic therapy, multiple sex partners, smoking, and young or teenage age. However, the risk factors for BV during pregnancy are inconsistent, underreported, and often overlooked. Hence, BV risk factors are typically more prevalent among pregnant women and require further exploration. Clinicians need to understand the risk factors, symptoms, and potential sequelae of BV to monitor and treat women of reproductive age effectively.

The existence of BV among pregnant women has momentously attracted the attention of both clinicians and the scientific community due to its potential link with adverse clinical outcomes during pregnancy. BV has been associated with a higher risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including preterm delivery, miscarriage, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometritis, and transmission or acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and STIs. Increasing evidence indicates that vaginal microbiota (VMB) dysbiosis may be the causative reason behind premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and preterm birth (PTB). The mechanisms involved in pregnancy complications induced by BV are not fully understood, but it has been suggested that bacterial ascension from the vagina to the membranes and amniotic fluid results in preterm birth. The practical implications of BV during pregnancy are not yet well defined. Further research is needed to formulate the necessary guidelines for prevention and address the associated adverse (maternal/fetal) outcomes. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no previous study to date has explored the current body of literature to collectively synthesize and report the prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among the pregnant population. Therefore, this is the first systematic review that: (i) delineates the global prevalence of BV among pregnant women receiving antenatal care; (ii) identifies the risk factors associated with BV and; (iii) explores the adverse outcomes during pregnancy due to BV.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^111fm2df]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Partner treatment trials targeting female partners

Despite BV being common among WSW, no partner treatment trials enrolling female couples have been conducted. As mentioned above, the majority (74–95%) of female couples have been shown to be concordant for the presence or absence of BV. If a female index case is enrolled in a partner treatment trial, it is highly likely that her female partner will be concordant for the presence of BV. Enrolling female couples would therefore provide an opportunity to determine the effectiveness of partner treatment in both members of the partnership. However, female-partner treatment brings a unique set of additional challenges. Enrolling BV-concordant couples in a blinded randomised partner treatment trial would mean that only half of the female partners would be treated for BV at enrolment, as the rest would be randomised to placebo. The concept of a placebo arm for women may not be accepted by participants or clinicians. Apprehension surrounding the ethics of non-treatment could be mitigated by considering firstly, that it has not been shown that treating BV prevents adverse outcomes, only symptoms, and if one of the partners has asymptomatic-BV at enrolment, treatment would not currently be recommended. FDA guidance around BV treatment trials also states that a placebo can be used as a comparator for the control arm, and recent BV treatment trials have done so. Even if partner-treatment was accepted, in order to measure clinically meaningful cure, follow-up to 3–4 months is required, and it is quite likely that concerns around possible placebo therapy would lead to treatment seeking behaviour prior to endpoint. To address this, a rescue arm may need to be incorporated for partners who develop vaginal symptoms at any time during the trial so they can request evaluation and treatment of symptomatic BV and/or other vaginal infections, as is included in FDA guidance.

### What have we learned about vaginal infections and preterm birth? [^1123uzGo]. Seminars in Perinatology (2003). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic maternal genital tract infection during pregnancy, particularly bacterial vaginosis, has been consistently associated with preterm birth. In response to this evidence, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network (MFMU) designed and conducted 2 large randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of metronidazole treatment of asymptomatic pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or trichomoniasis in a general obstetrical population. These studies showed that treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis failed to prevent preterm birth, regardless of their history of prior preterm birth. Metronidazole treatment of women with trichomoniasis significantly increased the risk of preterm birth compared to placebo. These results formed the basis of the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that screening for bacterial vaginosis not be undertaken in low-risk pregnant women, and show that MFMU network studies can have a direct and immediate impact on obstetrical practice.

### Effect of early oral clindamycin on late miscarriage and preterm delivery in asymptomatic women with abnormal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis: a randomised controlled trial [^1128M2AU]. Lancet (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Abnormal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis are associated with amplified risks of late miscarriage and spontaneous preterm delivery. We aimed to establish whether antibiotic treatment early in the second trimester might reduce these risks in a general obstetric population.

Methods

We screened 6120 pregnant women attending hospital for their first antenatal visit — who were at 12–22 weeks' gestation (mean 15.6 weeks) — for bacterial vaginosis or abnormal vaginal flora. We used gram-stained slides of vaginal smears to diagnose abnormal vaginal flora or bacterial vaginosis, in accordance with Nugent's criteria. We randomly allocated 494 women with one of these signs to receive either clindamycin 300 mg or placebo orally twice daily for 5 days. Primary endpoints were spontaneous preterm delivery (birth ≥ 24 but < 37 weeks) and late miscarriage (pregnancy loss ≥ 13 but < 24 weeks). Analysis was intention to treat.

Findings

Nine women were lost to follow-up or had elective termination. Thus, we analysed 485 women with complete outcome data. Women receiving clindamycin had significantly fewer miscarriages or preterm deliveries (13/244) than did those in the placebo group (38/241; percentage difference 10.4%, 95% CI 5.0–15.8, p = 0.0003). Clindamycin also reduced adverse outcomes across the range of abnormal Nugent scores, with maximum effect in women with the highest Nugent score of 10.

Interpretation

Treatment of asymptomatic abnormal vaginal flora and bacterial vaginosis with oral clindamycin early in the second trimester significantly reduces the rate of late miscarriage and spontaneous preterm birth in a general obstetric population.

### Bacterial vaginosis: drivers of recurrence and challenges and opportunities in partner treatment [^117VSfPt]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

It is clear that current therapies that are solely directed to women have failed to achieve a high rate of sustained cure. By continuing to ignore the potential risk of sexual transmission and reinfection when evaluating the efficacy of treatments, the effectiveness of these strategies is likely to be consistently underestimated. When managing a patient with BV, incorporating the regular partner who may be a source of reinfection provides an opportunity to make an impact on treatment outcomes. We need to continue to assess how antimicrobials change the genital microbiomes of both women with BV and their partner to ensure the most effective regimens are utilised. Furthermore, in order to overcome the short-comings of past partner treatment RCTs, we need innovative ways to engage women with BV and their partners to ensure recruitment of monogamous couples and promote adherence to treatment. Continued research into the pathogenicity of bacteria that are shared between couples may assist us in developing new treatment strategies, as well as providing evidence to support partner treatment as an adjunctive therapy to improve health outcomes for women.

Bacterial Vaginosis, Trichomoniasis, and Genital Herpes

Evidence does not support routine screening for BV among asymptomatic pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery. Symptomatic women should be evaluated and treated (see Bacterial Vaginosis). Evidence does not support routine screening for Trichomonas vaginalis among asymptomatic pregnant women. Women who report symptoms should be evaluated and treated (see Trichomoniasis). In addition, evidence does not support routine HSV-2 serologic screening among asymptomatic pregnant women. However, type-specific serologic tests might be useful for identifying pregnant women at risk for HSV-2 infection and for guiding counseling regarding the risk for acquiring genital herpes during pregnancy. Routine serial cultures for HSV are not indicated for women in the third trimester who have a history of recurrent genital herpes.

Bacterial vaginosis — definition and symptomatology: Healthy vaginal flora is comprised of more than 90% lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis occurs when there is a shift in this flora to include a greater proportion of mixed anaerobic bacteria, such as the Gardnerella, Prevotella, and Atopobium species; most often, bacterial vaginosis is asymptomatic.

### The implication of Chlamydia and bacterial vaginosis among low-risk pregnant women with preterm birth: a prospective multicentric cohort study [^1145eSNp]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Preterm labor (PTB) is defined as spontaneous labor occurring before the completion of 37 weeks of pregnancy. Although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, bacterial vaginal infection was strongly associated with up to 40%, with an increased risk of PTB. Some suggested that the infection itself may initiate PTB; others postulated that continuous infection would weaken humoral immunity, while others attribute it to the infection's direct effect, which causes the release of inflammation markers.

Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is one of the most prevalent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) worldwide, caused by gram-negative obligatory intracellular bacteria. While the infection can be asymptomatic, CT can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including genitourinary, ocular, and neonatal symptoms.

CT infection has been strongly associated with adverse reproductive and obstetrical outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Infections were linked with increased risk of PTB, pregnancy loss, and other complications that contribute to feto-maternal morbidity and mortality. While earlier studies in the field discussed that earlier diagnosis may help identify women at risk, the recent evidence suggests that treatment alone, especially among asymptomatic BV cases, does not necessarily reduce PTB risk. This highlights a critical gap in the current knowledge that warrants further investigation.

Summary

These guidelines for the treatment of persons who have or are at risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were updated by CDC after consultation with professionals knowledgeable in the field of STIs who met in Atlanta, Georgia, June 11–14, 2019. The information in this report updates the 2015 guidelines. These guidelines discuss 1) updated recommendations for treatment of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis; 2) addition of metronidazole to the recommended treatment regimen for pelvic inflammatory disease; 3) alternative treatment options for bacterial vaginosis; 4) management of Mycoplasma genitalium; 5) human papillomavirus vaccine recommendations and counseling messages; 6) expanded risk factors for syphilis testing among pregnant women; 7) one-time testing for hepatitis C infection; 8) evaluation of men who have sex with men after sexual assault; and 9) two-step testing for serologic diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus. Physicians and other health care providers can use these guidelines to assist in prevention and treatment of STIs.

### Should asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis Be treated? [^112zDhem]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

to the editor: The Information from Your Family Doctor handout regarding bacterial vaginosis 1 in the May 1 issue states: "Some women have bacterial vaginosis without any symptoms. " It then poses the question, "Do I have to be treated. ", which is answered with an unqualified "Yes". Certainly there are indications to treat asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis: treatment is recommended in pregnant women at high risk for preterm delivery and women undergoing surgical procedures such as abortion and hysterectomy, 2 for example; and, by extension, there are instances in which treatment is reasonable, such as prior to transvaginal procedures. However, except in the above circumstances, I am aware of no solid evidence-based recommendation for the treatment of asymptomatic women with bacterial vaginosis; treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis even in low-risk pregnant women remains controversial.

2 Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that the "established benefits of therapy for in non-pregnant women are to relieve vaginal symptoms and signs of infection and reduce the risk for infectious complications after abortion or hysterectomy. " 2 Additionally, the natural history of bacterial vaginosis is such that it may resolve spontaneously.
3. It is hard to make an asymptomatic patient feel better; we should demand evidence before assuming that the benefits of diagnosis and therapy outweigh their burdens. in reply: We would like to thank Dr. Fox for calling our attention to this patient education handout. We agree that no evidence has shown that treating. asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis improves patient outcomes. Accordingly, the handout did not advocate testing and treatment of asymptomatic women.

Rather, its unqualified recommendation to treat was directed to women who present with symptoms that may be relieved by treatment. This patient education handout has been updated on our Website.

### Antibiotics for treating bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy [^116Dgvug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and a lack of the normal lactobacillary flora. Women may have symptoms of a characteristic vaginal discharge but are often asymptomatic. Bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy has been associated with poor perinatal outcomes and, in particular, preterm birth (PTB). Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of PTB and its consequences.

Objectives

To assess the effects of antibiotic treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2012), searched cited references from retrieved articles and reviewed abstracts, letters to the editor and editorials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing antibiotic treatment with placebo or no treatment, or comparing two or more antibiotic regimens in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora whether symptomatic or asymptomatic and detected through screening.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information.

Main Results

We included 21 trials of good quality, involving 7847 women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis or intermediate vaginal flora. Antibiotic therapy was shown to be effective at eradicating bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy (average risk ratio (RR) 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.56; 10 trials, 4403 women; random-effects, T² = 0.19, I² = 91%). Antibiotic treatment also reduced the risk of late miscarriage (RR 0.20; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.76; two trials, 1270 women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%). Treatment did not reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (average RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.09; 13 trials, 6491 women; random-effects, T² = 0.06, I² = 48%), or the risk of preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.84; two trials, 493 women). It did increase the risk of side-effects sufficient to stop or change treatment (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.02 to 2.68; four trials, 2323 women, fixed-effect, I² = 0%). In this updated review, treatment before 20 weeks' gestation did not reduce the risk of PTB less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.62 to 1.17; five trials, 4088 women; random-effects, T² = 0.06, I² = 49%). In women with a previous PTB, treatment did not affect the risk of subsequent PTB (average RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.48; three trials, 421 women; random-effects, T² = 0.19, I² = 72%). In women with abnormal vaginal flora (intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis), treatment may reduce the risk of PTB before 37 weeks (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.84; two trials, 894 women). One small trial of 156 women compared metronidazole and clindamycin, both oral and vaginal, with no significant differences seen for any of the pre-specified primary outcomes. Statistically significant differences were seen for the outcomes of prolongation of gestational age (days) (mean difference (MD) 1.00; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.74) and birthweight (grams) (MD 75.18; 95% CI 25.37 to 124.99) however these represent relatively small differences in the clinical setting. Oral antibiotics versus vaginal antibiotics did not reduce the risk of PTB (RR 1.09; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.52; two trials, 264 women). Oral antibiotics had some advantage over vaginal antibiotics (whether metronidazole or clindamycin) with respect to admission to neonatal unit (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.92, one trial, 156 women), prolongation of gestational age (days) (MD 9.00; 95% CI 8.20 to 9.80; one trial, 156 women) and birthweight (grams) (MD 342.13; 95% CI 293.04 to 391.22; one trial, 156 women). Different frequency of dosing of antibiotics was assessed in one small trial and showed no significant difference for any outcome assessed.

Authors' Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment can eradicate bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. The overall risk of PTB was not significantly reduced. This review provides little evidence that screening and treating all pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis will prevent PTB and its consequences. When screening criteria were broadened to include women with abnormal flora there was a 47% reduction in preterm birth, however this is limited to two included studies.

### Effect of population-based antenatal screening and treatment of genitourinary tract infections on birth outcomes in sylhet, Bangladesh (MIST): a cluster-randomised clinical trial [^117NBSWy]. The Lancet: Global Health (2019). High credibility.

In our trial, treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and urinary tract infections had no effect on preterm birth or low birthweight. We did not provide continuous antibiotics as per the previous trials, but provided a short antibiotic course and repeat treatment for persistent infections based on antibiotic sensitivity. The rate of antibiotic resistance was high among uropathogens in our study, which necessitated a change in the antibiotic regimen mid-study (these results will be reported elsewhere). The WHO Global Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance reported high rates of resistance in Escherichia coli (16–68% resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and 32–64% resistance to fluoroquinolones) in national data from five countries in southeast Asia. Safety of antibiotic regimens is a consideration in pregnancy and limits the choice of therapeutic, bactericidal antimicrobials. Antibiotic stewardship and development of effective antimicrobials are crucial priorities to improve the efficacy of treatment of urinary tract infections during pregnancy in LMICs.

A Cochrane reviewof data from 13 trials of bacterial vaginosis (combined n = 6491) concluded that treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in the general obstetric population did not reduce the risk of preterm birth (pooled RR 0.88 [95% CI 0.71–1.09]). One of the largest studies, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Maternal Fetal Medicine Unit trial, showed that treatment of bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole did not affect preterm delivery in low-risk obstetric populations. Furthermore, mothers with asymptomatic trichomonas who received metronidazole had increased rates of preterm birth compared with those who received placebo. Results from the PREMEVA1 trialpublished in 2018 showed that treatment of bacterial vaginosis in early pregnancy with oral clindamycin did not reduce rates of late abortion or spontaneous preterm birth.

Bacterial Vaginosis

BV is a vaginal dysbiosis resulting from replacement of normal hydrogen peroxide and lactic-acid–producing Lactobacillus species in the vagina with high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria, including G. vaginalis, Prevotella species, Mobiluncus species, A. vaginae, and other BV-associated bacteria. A notable feature is the appearance of a polymicrobial biofilm on vaginal epithelial cells. Certain women experience transient vaginal microbial changes, whereas others experience them for longer intervals. BV is a highly prevalent condition and the most common cause of vaginal discharge worldwide. However, in a nationally representative survey, the majority of women with BV were asymptomatic.

BV is associated with having multiple male sex partners, female partners, sexual relationships with more than one person, a new sex partner, lack of condom use, douching, and HSV-2 seropositivity. Male circumcision reduces the risk for BV among women. In addition, BV prevalence increases during menses. Women who have never been sexually active are rarely affected. The cause of the microbial alteration that precipitates BV is not fully understood, and whether BV results from acquisition of a single sexually transmitted pathogen is unknown. BV prevalence has been reported to increase among women with copper-containing IUDs. Hormonal contraception does not increase risk for BV and might protect against BV development. Vitamin D deficiency has not been reported to be a risk factor for BV.

Women with BV are at increased risk for STI acquisition, such as HIV, N. gonorrhoeae, C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis, M. genitalium, HPV, and HSV-2; complications after gynecologic surgery; complications of pregnancy; and recurrence of BV (,–). BV also increases HIV infection acquisition because specific BV-associated bacteria can increase susceptibility to HIV and the risk for HIV transmission to male sex partners. Evaluation of short-term valacyclovir suppression among women with HSV-2 did not decrease the risk for BV, despite effective suppression of HSV-2.

Although BV-associated bacteria can be identified on male genitalia, treatment of male sex partners has not been beneficial in preventing the recurrence of BV. Among WSW, a high level of BV concordance occurs between sex partners; however, no studies have evaluated treatment of female sex partners of WSW to prevent BV recurrence.

### Bacterial vaginosis modifies the association between hormonal contraception and HIV acquisition [^112r6ru3]. AIDS (2018). Low credibility.

The present study has several notable limitations. Our biggest limitation is the small number of women using contraception who seroconverted with bacterial vaginosis detected. Although even with this reduced power, we find a significant association; the stability of this finding weighs heavily on a small number of observations. Even during the years when we conducted routine examinations every 3 months, we may be missing episodes of bacterial vaginosis, because of the possible shifts between flora considered normal and flora considered intermediate or abnormal demonstrated in some studies. This misclassification bias would primarily impact the association between contraception and HIV during the interval assessment without bacterial vaginosis detected. Additionally, we use several criteria in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis, which may increase our sensitivity while reducing the specificity of our bacterial vaginosis diagnoses. This could lead to misclassification. The generalizability of these results may be limited as this cohort consists of jointly tested and counseled HIV discordant couples who often adopt condom use following counseling with a corresponding reduction in transmission and seroconversion rates. Although we aimed to control for the impact of condom nonuse as a potential confounder, both sperm on wet-prep and self-reported unprotected sex have limitations in their ability to detect unprotected coital events, thus some degree of unmeasured confounding is possible. Given these limitations, our results should be interpreted with caution and we encourage future studies to systematically evaluate bacterial vaginosis as a modifier in future studies.

Although this evaluation begins to elucidate some of the diversity noted in epidemiologic studies, many unanswered questions remain. It is unclear if the changes attributed to bacterial vaginosis that lead to increased acquisition risk and modification of the hormone contraception–HIV association are consistent among bacterial vaginosis-symptomatic compared with asymptomatic women. It is also unknown if treatment of bacterial vaginosis will alter these associations. For example, treatment of asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy does reduce the risk of preterm delivery associated with bacterial vaginosis. As bacterial vaginosis is often recurrent, exploration of the role of suppressive or periodic presumptive treatment for bacterial vaginosis on biologic and clinical outcomes is warranted. We must leverage newer sequencing approaches to effectively explore the role of individual taxa or microbial communities of these relationships utilizing rigorous epidemiologic methodology. And lastly, we must explore alternative explanations for the findings we report. For example, is there something else about individuals who get bacterial vaginosis that predisposes them to having increased risk with hormonal contraceptive use, such as biologic or behavioral factors?

### A randomized trial of the duration of therapy with metronidazole plus or minus azithromycin for treatment of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis [^116XWrAk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common cause of vaginitis worldwide. Currently recommended treatments have poor efficacy and are associated with high rates of BV recurrence. We examined whether a longer duration of treatment with metronidazole or combination therapy with metronidazole and azithromycin would enhance the cure rates for BV. In addition, we examined factors other than drug therapy associated with cure.

Methods

Women with symptomatic BV (defined by a modified Amsel criteria) were enrolled in a 4-arm study that compared metronidazole for 7 days versus 14 days, plus or minus azithromycin on days 1 and 3. Data regarding interim behaviors were also obtained, as were vaginal specimens for Gram staining.

Results

At the first follow-up visit (7 days after the completion of therapy), there was a significant difference in cure rates among patients who received 7 days of metronidazole therapy, compared with those who received 14 days of therapy, combined across azithromycin therapy (P = 0.0003). There was no effect associated with azithromycin therapy. There were no differences in cure rates between any of the treatment groups at 21 days after completion of therapy. Abstinence or protected sex, refraining from douching, and a lower baseline Nugent score for the vaginal Gram stain were all significantly associated with cure.

Conclusions

Cure rates for BV were significantly improved by 14 days of metronidazole treatment (compared with 7 days of treatment), but the effects were not sustained, suggesting that relapse or reinfection occurred. Combination therapy with the addition of azithromycin had no benefit. Lower baseline Nugent scores — presumably reflecting less complex vaginal flora — were significantly associated with cure, as was refraining from unprotected sex and from douching.

### Evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and treating pregnant women who are asymptomatic for bacterial vaginosis: an update review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [^1122fQNN]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial vaginosis is the most common lower genital tract syndrome among women of reproductive age. There has been continued debate about the value of screening and treating asymptomatic pregnant women for bacterial vaginosis.

Purpose

To examine new evidence on the benefits and harms of screening and treating bacterial vaginosis in asymptomatic pregnant women.

Data Sources

English-language studies on Ovid MEDLINE (2000 to September 2007) and Cochrane Library databases (through September 2007), reference lists, and expert suggestions.

Study Selection

Screening, treatment, or adverse effect studies with pregnancy outcome data in women who are asymptomatic for bacterial vaginosis.

Data Extraction

Study and patient characteristics, treatment variables, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and internal validity quality criteria from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and Jadad scale were abstracted.

Data Synthesis

7 new randomized, controlled treatment trials and 2001 report data were combined in a series of meta-analyses to estimate the pooled effect of treatment on preterm delivery (< 37, < 34, and < 32 weeks); low birthweight; and preterm, premature rupture of membranes.

Limitations

No screening studies that compared a screened population with a nonscreened population were found. Significant heterogeneity was found among the high-risk treatment trials (P < 0.001). It is not clear from the detailed description of the studies which factors explain the differences in preterm delivery rates and potentially the association of treatment effect; however, both raise concern for the unintended potential for harm.

Conclusion

No benefit was found in treating women with low- or average-risk pregnancies for asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis. More research is needed to better understand these groups and the conditions under which treatment can be harmful or helpful, and to explore the relevance of bacterial vaginosis to other adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as delivery before 34 weeks.

### Prevalence, risk factors, and adverse outcomes of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women: a systematic review [^1162LjVZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Worldwide, the high prevalence of BV imposes a concomitant increase in economic burden. Consistent prevention and sustainable treatment strategies are urgently needed to address this burden. Holistic screening programs should be administered in all clinics as part of routine antenatal care or services to identify potential symptomatic or asymptomatic BV-positive cases. The majority of the BV-positive women in this review were educated and employed, which suggests that a higher literacy and working status among pregnant women may motivate them towards obtaining better healthcare services. Hence educational programs might be an effective strategy to increase BV awareness among unemployed women from rural areas with low socioeconomic and educational backgrounds. Simultaneously, educational interventions may also help to control the modifiable or behavioural risk factors such as lack of hygiene, douching, and risky sexual behaviours during pregnancy. Since the study noted some marked disparities in the BV prevalence based on race, multiparity, and gestational age (second trimester), it is advisable that multiparous females, women from an African origin, and women who are 14–26 weeks pregnant, should be actively screened for BV as an at-risk population. Due to the presence of an increasing number of asymptomatic cases, it is highly recommended to run diagnostic tests for BV during the early stages of pregnancy and prevent any possibility of preterm delivery and miscarriage. Accordingly, an immediate treatment plan should be executed by the healthcare providers to mitigate any other adverse events and/or the acquisition of severe STIs. Future studies should focus on identifying causal linkages between BV and adverse health outcomes during pregnancy.

### Women presenting to emergency departments with vaginitis should be offered single-dose empirical treatment [^1173pBYj]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV), Candida, and Trichomonas vaginalis (TV) are the most common causes of vaginitis. These infections are associated with various untoward consequences including increased risk of acquisition of the others, transmission of HIV, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and herpes simplex virus‐2 as well as adverse reproductive and mental health outcomes, and cervical cancer risk. Vaginitis disproportionately affects ethnic minorities and those with lower formal educational attainment and/or experiencing poverty, the very groups most likely to seek episodic care in emergency departments (EDs). Current U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) treatment guidelines for vaginitis do not provide an effective approach for many of these women, resulting in missed and delayed diagnoses and treatment. We propose an empirical, single‐dose, point‐of‐care treatment strategy, novel to the U.S. but evidence‐based and consistent with international guidelines, to address existing deficiencies in availability of inexpensive and accurate point‐of‐care diagnosis, and substantial barriers to medication adherence and follow‐up commonly faced by women from disadvantaged groups who frequently seek help in EDs.

BV is a prevalent sexually associated infection linked to several gynecologic complications and acquisition of STDs and acquisition and transmission of HIV. It seems that normalization of the vaginal flora may be effective for preventing short-term complications. The implications of screening and treating BV to prevent long-term complications are less clear and may depend on the availability of more effective treatment regimens.

### Managing recurrent bacterial vaginosis [^116i6EAk]. Sexually Transmitted Infections (2004). Low credibility.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most frequently found condition of the female genital tract. It increases a woman's risk of acquiring HIV, is associated with increased complications in pregnancy, and may be involved in the pathogenesis of pelvic inflammatory disease. Yet there are many unanswered questions about its aetiology, making management of recurrent infection difficult and often idiosyncratic. This paper discusses the current knowledge and possible management of recurrent BV.

### Screening for bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons to prevent preterm delivery: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^1143eLHP]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Biological understanding and epidemiology note that risk for preterm delivery may be higher when asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is present, with a pooled odds ratio of 2.16 (95% CI, 1.56–3.00) across 32 studies and 30 518 participants. However, the causal pathway of how bacterial vaginosis may lead to preterm delivery is unclear. Although treating asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis in pregnant persons at not increased risk for preterm delivery does not prevent preterm delivery, it remains unclear whether treatment in those at increased risk may help prevent preterm delivery.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for bacterial vaginosis, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ACOG 2020 guidelines recommend to discourage self-diagnosis of common vaginitis because of its limited accuracy and the nonspecific nature of vulvovaginal symptoms.

### Current treatment of bacterial vaginosis-limitations and need for innovation [^1166JtZJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Practitioners and patients alike widely recognize the limitations of current therapeutic approaches to the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (BV). Options remain extremely limited, and our inability to prevent the frequently, often relentless symptomatic recurrences of BV and to reduce serious sequelae such as preterm delivery, remains an acknowledged but unresolved shortcoming. Our incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of this unique form of vaginal dysbiosis has been a significant impediment to developing optimal treatment and prevention approaches. New drugs have not been forthcoming and are not likely to be available in the immediate future; hence, reliance on the optimal use of available agents has become essential as improvised often unproven regimens are implemented. In this review, we will explore the limitations of currently recommended therapies, with a particular focus on the contribution of reinfection and pathogen persistence to BV recurrence, and the development of interventions that target these mechanisms. Ultimately, to achieve sustained cure and effectiveness against BV-associated sequelae, it is possible that we will need approaches that combine antimicrobials with biofilm-disrupting agents and partner treatments in those at risk of reinfection.
