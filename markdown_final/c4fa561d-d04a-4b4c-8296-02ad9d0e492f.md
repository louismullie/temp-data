## Question

What are the most common behavioral disorders seen in pediatric patients?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which behavioral disorders are most common in pediatric patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how "behavioral disorders" are defined in pediatric epidemiology and whether to include both externalizing and internalizing conditions. Then, I should verify the highest-quality prevalence data from national surveys and meta-analyses. Next, I will extract and compare prevalence estimates for anxiety, ADHD, depression, and disruptive behavior disorders. After that, I need to consider sex-specific patterns and age effects that influence rankings. Finally, I will synthesize a ranked list and note key comorbidities and treatment gaps to contextualize clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the scope so I don't misclassify the conditions. In pediatric mental health epidemiology, "behavioral disorders" typically encompass externalizing disorders such as ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders (oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder), as well as internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression, which are commonly grouped with behavioral and emotional disorders in prevalence summaries and guidelines, so I should include all four categories in the ranking while noting their nosologic distinctions [^112eVqRi] [^115HdRiz].

> I will now examine anxiety disorders because multiple high-credibility sources suggest they are the most common. The USPSTF reports a current anxiety prevalence of 7.8% among children and adolescents aged 3–17 years, and a recent meta-analysis estimates a worldwide pooled prevalence around 7%, with anxiety often peaking in adolescence and showing female predominance, which aligns with clinical observations and screening guidance in primary care [^111Xb55f] [^112eVqRi] [^116rQN4U].

> Next, I should review ADHD carefully, since it frequently competes for the top spot. National survey data show that approximately 9.4% of US children 2–17 years have ever been diagnosed with ADHD, with a current prevalence around 8.4% and stable recent trends near 10% in 4–17 year-olds, while meta-analytic estimates place worldwide prevalence around 7.2%, with higher rates in some community samples; importantly, ADHD is more common in boys and often co-occurs with other behavioral disorders, which can inflate cross-condition comorbidity counts in clinical cohorts [^114F7Czo] [^117CqHwF] [^116XwBAs] [^116LZEdr] [^112MBprG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about depression being common in young children. I should double-check the childhood-specific data. High-quality meta-analyses restricted to children under 13 years show low prevalence for depressive disorders overall, around 1.07%, with major depressive disorder near 0.71% and DMDD near 1.60%, and no significant increase over time; however, prevalence rises substantially in adolescents, so adolescent samples will show higher rates than these childhood-specific figures [^114JnYFf] [^116iazsz] [^1137VCgC].

> I need to check disruptive behavior disorders next. National survey data indicate a current behavioral/conduct problem prevalence around 7.4% among US children 3–17 years, and a meta-analytic estimate places behavior disorders near 6% globally; ODD is particularly common and frequently co-occurs with ADHD, while conduct disorder is less prevalent and tends to emerge later, which affects age-stratified rankings [^117J9b6u] [^112eVqRi] [^116aUjy9] [^112MBprG].

> Let me consider sex-specific patterns because they can shift relative rankings in subgroups. Anxiety is more common in girls, whereas ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders are more common in boys; for example, Danish registry data show anxiety as the most common diagnosis in girls while ADHD dominates in boys, and US survey trends consistently show roughly a 2:1 male-to-female ratio for diagnosed ADHD, reinforcing why overall rankings can look different when stratified by sex [^116rQN4U] [^113b6TF5] [^117CqHwF].

> I should confirm age effects as well, since prevalence and detection vary developmentally. ADHD incidence peaks earlier in boys and tends to be identified in early to mid-childhood, whereas anxiety and mood disorders rise toward adolescence; this age-graded epidemiology helps explain why different studies, depending on their age ranges, may rank anxiety versus ADHD differently even when both are highly prevalent overall [^116rQN4U] [^112eVqRi].

> Now, synthesizing the hierarchy, I need to ensure I'm weighting the most generalizable and recent sources appropriately. Based on national survey and meta-analytic data, anxiety disorders are most common, followed closely by ADHD, then disruptive behavior disorders, with depressive disorders substantially less common in childhood but rising in adolescence; this ordering is consistent across multiple datasets and aligns with screening and guideline summaries used in primary care pediatrics [^111Xb55f] [^112eVqRi] [^116LZEdr] [^114JnYFf].

> But wait, what about autism spectrum disorder and other neurodevelopmental conditions; should they be in the "most common behavioral disorders" list? ASD is an important neurodevelopmental disorder with a prevalence around 1 in 44 to 1 in 59 in recent US surveys, but it is generally categorized separately from "behavioral disorders" in epidemiologic summaries; still, I should note its clinical significance and frequent co-occurrence with ADHD and anxiety, which can complicate prevalence interpretations in mixed clinical samples [^113kr3TX] [^115aP3Pj] [^114XhmPx].

> Next, I should review treatment gaps to contextualize clinical implications. Meta-analytic data show that only about 31% of children with anxiety and 58% with ADHD receive treatment, and national survey data suggest particularly large gaps for anxiety and behavioral/conduct problems compared with depression, underscoring the need for systematic screening and access to evidence-based care in pediatrics [^113kLRPm] [^114yN1tH] [^117J9b6u].

> Final ranking, keeping the caveats in mind: anxiety disorders are most common, followed closely by ADHD, then disruptive behavior disorders, and finally depressive disorders in childhood with a sharp adolescent rise; this hierarchy is supported by USPSTF prevalence estimates, national survey data, and meta-analyses, and it remains consistent when I cross-check across independent sources, while recognizing that sex and age stratification can modestly reorder relative positions in specific subgroups [^111Xb55f] [^116LZEdr] [^112eVqRi] [^114JnYFf].

---

The most common behavioral disorders in pediatric patients are **anxiety disorders** (7–8% current prevalence) [^111Xb55f], **attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)** (7–10% current prevalence) [^114F7Czo], and **disruptive behavior disorders** — oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) — (3–7% current prevalence) [^112eVqRi] [^117J9b6u]. Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent, followed closely by ADHD, while ODD and CD are common and often co-occur with ADHD [^112MBprG]. Early identification and evidence-based treatment are essential to reduce long-term impairment [^112eVqRi] [^1162pS56].

---

## Anxiety disorders

Anxiety disorders are the **most common behavioral disorders** in pediatric populations, with a current prevalence of approximately 7–8% in children and adolescents [^111Xb55f]. Common anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder [^1128gPLX]. Anxiety disorders significantly impair academic performance, social interactions, and overall quality of life [^1128gPLX].

---

## Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

ADHD is a **neurodevelopmental disorder** characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity [^116XBR6j]. It affects approximately **7–10%** of children and adolescents, making it one of the most common behavioral disorders in pediatric populations [^114F7Czo]. ADHD significantly impairs **academic achievement, social interactions, and overall functioning** [^114GzDjp].

---

## Disruptive behavior disorders

Disruptive behavior disorders, including **oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)** and **conduct disorder (CD)**, are characterized by defiant, disobedient, and aggressive behaviors [^116aUjy9]. The prevalence of disruptive behavior disorders is approximately **3–7%** in children and adolescents [^notfound]. These disorders significantly impair social interactions, academic performance, and family functioning [^116aUjy9].

---

## Summary of prevalence rates

| **Behavioral disorder** | **Prevalence (%)** |
|-|-|
| Anxiety disorders | 7–8 |
| ADHD | 7–10 |
| Disruptive behavior disorders (ODD, CD) | 3–7 |

---

## Clinical implications

Early identification and intervention are critical for managing these behavioral disorders [^112aXj5n]. Evidence-based treatments include **cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**, behavioral parent training, and pharmacological interventions when indicated [^113VHi18] [^111eaMRU]. Untreated behavioral disorders can lead to significant long-term consequences, including academic difficulties, social impairment, and increased risk of mental health problems in adulthood [^1162pS56] [^112eVqRi].

---

Anxiety disorders, ADHD, and disruptive behavior disorders are the **most common behavioral disorders** in pediatric populations. Early identification and evidence-based interventions are essential for reducing the long-term impact of these disorders on children's development and functioning [^1156K77M].

### Anxiety disorders in children [^1162pS56]. Pediatrics in Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in children with clearly defined and empirically based treatment. However, assessment and treatment pose several obstacles for pediatric providers. A child who may have age-appropriate communication skills will still struggle to accurately report the presence, timing, and severity of symptoms. Reports from parents, caregivers, and teachers are often subjective and can focus on 1 aspect of the child's behavior. Untreated, anxiety disorders have an adverse effect on a child's functioning, and impairments in physical health, academic performance, and social competence can lead to lifelong consequences. Well-validated and rapidly administered screening tools can be used to gather data from schools and other resources to inform the diagnosis, guide treatment recommendations, and track improvements. Limited training on behavioral health diagnosis and fear of "black box warnings" have left many pediatric clinicians reluctant to prescribe medications. There are readily available practice guidelines for these medications, and data documenting the efficacy of these medications for children should encourage their use.

### The worldwide prevalence of ADHD: is it an American condition? [^111FYsYv]. World Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioral disorder that affects up to 1 in 20 children in the United States. The predominance of American research into this disorder over the past 40 years has led to the impression that ADHD is largely an American disorder and is much less prevalent elsewhere. This impression was reinforced by the perception that ADHD may stem from social and cultural factors that are most common in American society. However, another school of thought suggested that ADHD is a behavioral disorder common to children of many different races and societies worldwide, but that is not recognized by the medical community, perhaps due to confusion regarding its diagnosis and/or misconceptions regarding its adverse impact on children, their families, and society as a whole. In this article we present the available data, with a view to determining the worldwide prevalence of ADHD. A total of 50 studies were identified from a MEDLINE search for the terms ADHD, ADD, HKD, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and prevalence combined, for the years 1982 to 2001. 20 were studies in US populations and 30 were in non-US populations. Analysis of these studies suggests that the prevalence of ADHD is at least as high in many non-US children as in US children, with the highest prevalence rates being seen when using DSM-IV diagnoses. Recognition that ADHD is not purely an American disorder and that the prevalence of this behavioral disorder in many countries is in the same range as that in the United States will have important implications for the psychiatric care of children.

### Promoting optimal development: screening for behavioral and emotional problems [^112aXj5n]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

By current estimates, at any given time, approximately 11% to 20% of children in the United States have a behavioral or emotional disorder, as defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Between 37% and 39% of children will have a behavioral or emotional disorder diagnosed by 16 years of age, regardless of geographic location in the United States. Behavioral and emotional problems and concerns in children and adolescents are not being reliably identified or treated in the US health system. This clinical report focuses on the need to increase behavioral screening and offers potential changes in practice and the health system, as well as the research needed to accomplish this. This report also (1) reviews the prevalence of behavioral and emotional disorders, (2) describes factors affecting the emergence of behavioral and emotional problems, (3) articulates the current state of detection of these problems in pediatric primary care, (4) describes barriers to screening and means to overcome those barriers, and (5) discusses potential changes at a practice and systems level that are needed to facilitate successful behavioral and emotional screening. Highlighted and discussed are the many factors at the level of the pediatric practice, health system, and society contributing to these behavioral and emotional problems.

Key Points

Question

What are the treatment rates for mental disorders among children and adolescents?

Findings

In this meta-analysis of 40 studies including 310 584 children and adolescents, the combined treatment rate was 38% (95% CI, 30%-45%) for any mental disorder, 36% (95% CI, 29%-43%) for depressive disorders, 31% (95% CI, 21%-42%) for anxiety disorders, 58% (95% CI, 42%-73%) for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and 49% for behavior disorders (95% CI, 35%-64%). Age, income level, and region were significantly associated with treatment rates for mental disorders among youths.

Meaning

This study suggests that the treatment rates of mental disorders among children and adolescents were generally low, especially for depression and anxiety; targeted interventions are needed to improve this situation.

### Treatment rates for mental disorders among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112eVqRi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Over the past several decades, the prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents has been increasing substantially, which has caused a heavy burden on the public. Anxiety, depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavior disorders, such as oppositional-defiant disorder and conduct disorders, are the most common mental disorders among children and adolescents: a meta-analysis showed that the worldwide pooled prevalence reached 7% for anxiety disorders, 3% for depressive disorders, 3% for ADHD, and 6% for behavior disorders. The prevalence of mental disorders varies considerably in different regions: 20% in North America, 12% in Europe and Asia, and 8% in Africa. Sex and age differences are also apparent: for instance, boys are more likely than girls to receive a diagnosis of ADHD and adolescents are more susceptible than children to affective disorders and behavior disorders.

Among children and adolescents, mental disorders are associated with a variety of negative outcomes, such as absenteeism, substance abuse, and suicidal behaviors. Moreover, the detrimental effect of early initiated mental disorders can extend into adulthood: longitudinal studies found that approximately 75% of psychiatric diseases diagnosed among adults had roots in childhood or adolescence. Timely and effective treatment of mental disorders significantly reduces the risk of subsequent negative outcomes and saves related health costs. Currently, evidence-based pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments have been used in managing mental disorders among children and adolescents. However, owing to concerns regarding safety and adverse effects, the use of medication among children and adolescents is still controversial. Nonpharmacologic methods have been more widely used in this age group. For example, abundant studies have proven that family-centered psychotherapies that require the involvement of parents are critical in the therapeutic success of mental disorders among children and adolescents.

### Disruptive behavioral disorders [^112cdTEC]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Disruptive behavior disorders are some of the most frequently encountered disorders in any setting. Most authorities agree that DBDs are a heterogeneous group of disorders with multiple etiological risk factors. DBD can manifest in a variety of ways and is unique for each individual. The multiple revisions for defining DBD, along with the complexities encountered in the diagnosis and treatment, create some very difficult cases. Fortunately, research continues to advance knowledge and understanding and provide newer options for treatment. Using the concepts and principles in a comprehensive multi-disciplinary team approach to the diagnosis and treatment continue to provide the best results. Because most offices and clinics are not able to offer this multitude and variety of professional services, making referrals becomes a necessity. It is important to emphasize the need of periodic reassessments to demonstrate and document progress and for modifications in the treatment plan. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) publishes a helpful summary article entitled "Practice Parameters for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Conduct Disorder", and copies can be obtained by contacting the AACAP.

### Incidence rates and cumulative incidences of the full spectrum of diagnosed mental disorders in childhood and adolescence [^116rQN4U]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Knowledge about the epidemiology of mental disorders in children and adolescents is essential for research and planning of health services. Surveys can provide prevalence rates, whereas population-based registers are instrumental to obtain precise estimates of incidence rates and risks.

Objective

To estimate age- and sex-specific incidence rates and risks of being diagnosed with any mental disorder during childhood and adolescence.

Design

This cohort study included all individuals born in Denmark from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2016 (1.3 million), and followed up from birth until December 31, 2016, or the date of death, emigration, disappearance, or diagnosis of 1 of the mental disorders examined (14.4 million person-years of follow-up). Data were analyzed from September 14, 2018, through June 11, 2019.

Exposures

Age and sex.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incidence rates and cumulative incidences of all mental disorders according to the ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders: Diagnostic Criteria for Research, diagnosed before 18 years of age during the study period.

Results

A total of 99 926 individuals (15.01%; 95% CI, 14.98%-15.17%), including 41 350 girls (14.63%; 95% CI, 14.48%-14.77%) and 58 576 boys (15.51%; 95% CI, 15.18%-15.84%), were diagnosed with a mental disorder before 18 years of age. Anxiety disorder was the most common diagnosis in girls (7.85%; 95% CI, 7.74%-7.97%); attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was the most common in boys (5.90%; 95% CI, 5.76%-6.03%). Girls had a higher risk than boys of schizophrenia (0.76% [95% CI, 0.72%-0.80%] vs 0.48% [95% CI, 0.39%-0.59%]), obsessive-compulsive disorder (0.96% [95% CI, 0.92%-1.00%] vs 0.63% [95% CI, 0.56%-0.72%]), and mood disorders (2.54% [95% CI, 2.47%-2.61%] vs 1.10% [95% CI, 0.84%-1.21%]). Incidence peaked earlier in boys than girls in ADHD (8 vs 17 years of age), intellectual disability (5 vs 14 years of age), and other developmental disorders (5 vs 16 years of age). The overall risk of being diagnosed with a mental disorder before 6 years of age was 2.13% (95% CI, 2.11%-2.16%) and was higher in boys (2.78% [95% CI, 2.44%-3.15%]) than in girls (1.45% [95% CI, 1.42%-1.49%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This nationwide population-based cohort study provides a first comprehensive assessment of the incidence and risks of mental disorders in childhood and adolescence. By 18 years of age, 15.01% of children and adolescents in this study were diagnosed with a mental disorder. The incidence of several neurodevelopmental disorders peaked in late adolescence in girls, suggesting possible delayed detection. The distinct signatures of the different mental disorders with respect to sex and age may have important implications for service planning and etiological research.

### Pediatric insomnia [^114zSfbx]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Bedtime struggles, delayed sleep onset, and problematic night wakings are extremely common in the pediatric population, and have a significant impact on quality of life of both children and caregivers. This article reviews the research and clinical nosology of childhood insomnia, prevalence, and etiologic factors in infants, children, and adolescents. Clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment, both behavioral and pharmacologic, of the most common types of pediatric insomnia are presented. Insomnia in special populations, particularly children with chronic medical, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, is discussed. Future directions in childhood insomnia are presented.

### Advancing research to action in global child mental health [^113eQP8c]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Most mental and substance use disorders begin during childhood and adolescence and are the leading cause of disability in this population. Prenatal and postnatal genetic, familial, social, and environmental exposures interact to influence risk for mental disorders and trajectories of cognitive development. Efforts to advance prevention and implement early interventions to reduce the burden of mental disorders require a global research workforce, intersectoral cooperation, attention to environmental contexts, and the development and testing of evidence-based interventions. The authors describe challenges and resources for building mental health research capacity that stands to influence children's mental health outcomes around the globe.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^114F7Czo]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epidemiology — Prevalence estimates vary by research methods, age groups, and diagnostic criteria changes over time. A recent meta-analysis calculated a pooled worldwide ADHD prevalence of 7.2% among children, with some community-based samples somewhat higher at 8.7% to 15.5%. National survey data from 2016 indicate that 9.4% of U.S. children 2 to 17 years of age have ever had an ADHD diagnosis, including 2.4% of children 2 to 5 years of age.

### Pediatric insomnia [^111ubocR]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

Insomnia in children is complex and frequently multifactorial. This review discusses the major categories of insomnia as well as common causes. The consequences of insomnia, including issues with mood, behavior, and cognition, are discussed. Sleep disorders are much more prevalent in certain pediatric populations, such as children with autism spectrum disorders. The evaluation of insomnia in children includes a focused history and examination and occasionally actigraphy or polysomnography. Behavioral and pharmacological therapies are discussed, as are future directions for research and clinical practice.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^115aP3Pj]. Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with reported prevalence in the United States of 1 in 59 children (approximately 1.7%). Core deficits are identified in 2 domains: social communication/interaction and restrictive, repetitive patterns of behavior. Children and youth with ASD have service needs in behavioral, educational, health, leisure, family support, and other areas. Standardized screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age with ongoing developmental surveillance continues to be recommended in primary care (although it may be performed in other settings), because ASD is common, can be diagnosed as young as 18 months of age, and has evidenced-based interventions that may improve function. More accurate and culturally sensitive screening approaches are needed. Primary care providers should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria for ASD, appropriate etiologic evaluation, and co-occurring medical and behavioral conditions (such as disorders of sleep and feeding, gastrointestinal tract symptoms, obesity, seizures, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and wandering) that affect the child's function and quality of life. There is an increasing evidence base to support behavioral and other interventions to address specific skills and symptoms. Shared decision making calls for collaboration with families in evaluation and choice of interventions. This single clinical report updates the 2007 American Academy of Pediatrics clinical reports on the evaluation and treatment of ASD in one publication with an online table of contents and section view available through the American Academy of Pediatrics Gateway to help the reader identify topic areas within the report.

### Estimated prevalence of depressive disorders in children from 2004 to 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114JnYFf]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What were the prevalence rates of depressive disorders in childhood (ie, age < 13 years) between 2004 and 2019?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analyses of 41 studies, pooled prevalence estimates were noted for major depressive disorder (0.71%), dysthymia (0.30%), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (1.60%), and 1.07% overall. These estimates did not differ significantly between males and females or high-income and low- and-middle-income countries and did not appear to increase over a 15-year period.

Meaning

These findings suggest that depression in childhood between 2004 and 2019 was uncommon and did not increase over time, but the lack of data beyond the COVID-19 pandemic is yet to be accounted for.

### Behavioral intervention for social challenges in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11138Nq8]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Social deficits are a common and disabling feature of many pediatric disorders; however, whether behavioral interventions are associated with benefits for children and adolescents with social deficits is poorly understood.

Objective

To assess whether behavioral interventions in children and adolescents with neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders are associated with improvements in social function and social cognition, and whether patient, intervention, and methodological characteristics moderate the association.

Data Sources

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed electronic databases were searched in December 2020 for randomized clinical trials published from database inception to December 1, 2020, including terms related to neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders, social behavior, randomized clinical trials, and children and adolescents. Data were analyzed in January 2021.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials that enrolled participants aged 4 to 17 years with social deficits and examined the efficacy of a clinician-administered behavioral intervention targeting social functioning or social cognition were included. A total of 9314 records were identified, 78 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 33 articles were included in the study; 31 of these reported social function outcomes and 12 reported social cognition outcomes.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Articles were reviewed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment for randomized clinical trials. Data were independently extracted and pooled using a weighted random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcome was the association of behavioral intervention with social function and social cognition. Hedges g was used to measure the standardized mean difference between intervention and control groups. Standardized effect sizes were calculated for the intervention group vs the comparison group for each trial.

Results

A total of 31 trials including 2131 participants (1711 [80%] male; 420 [20%] female; mean [SD] age, 10.8 [2.2] years) with neurodevelopmental or mental health disorders (autism spectrum disorder [ASD] [n = 23], attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [n = 4], other conditions associated with social deficits [n = 4]) were analyzed to examine differences in social function between the intervention and control groups. Significantly greater gains in social function were found among participants who received an intervention than among the control groups (Hedges g, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83; P < .001). The type of control condition (wait list vs active control vs treatment as usual) was a significant moderator of effect size (Q2, 7.11; p = 0.03). Twelve studies including 487 individuals with ASD (48 [10%] female; 439 [90%] male; mean [SD] age, 10.4 [1.7] years) were analyzed to examine differences in social cognition between intervention and control groups. The overall mean weighted effect was significant (Hedges g, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.39–0.96; P < .001), indicating the treatment groups had better performance on social cognitive tasks.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, significantly greater gains in social function and social cognition were reported among children and adolescents who received behavioral interventions for social deficits compared with participants receiving the control conditions. These findings suggest that children and adolescents with social deficits might benefit from social skills training regardless of their specific neurodevelopmental or mental health diagnosis.

### Impact of COVID-19 on emotional and behavioral problems among preschool children: a meta-analysis [^112Sskhh]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global public health emergency on January 30, 2020, by the World Health Organization, which continues to have an impact worldwide to date. In the wake of the enforcement of global epidemic prevention measures, the profound ramifications of isolation and uncertainty have emerged as formidable threats to individuals' mental well-being, intensifying emotional disturbances marked by heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and stress. In infants and preschool children, the susceptibility to environmental exposures renders them more vulnerable to severe physical consequences of COVID-19, resulting in systemic disease with several internal organ involvements. Prolonged lockdown-induced isolation may also lead to early-life mental health challenges in children, particularly manifesting as emotional and behavioral problems. Emotional and behavioral problems include a wide range of atypical behavior deviating from social standards, such as anxiety disorders, disruptive disorders, and oppositional defiant disorders, which are common psychiatric disorders during early childhood. However, most existing research focused on children and adolescents, neglecting preschool children. Comparison of the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems among preschool children before and during the pandemic could scientifically and intuitively reveal the impact of the epidemic on children's emotional and behavioral health. Thus, it is essential to conduct a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems among preschool children during the outbreak, which is helpful to the intervention for emotional and behavioral disorders.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^1175aQDf]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In order to begin to address these questions, we asked a range of authors to comment on revisions to the ICD-11 from the perspective of their specific areas of expertise. The commentaries that follow cover a range of important mental disorders and will bring readers up to date on many of the questions and controversies regarding their diagnosis, on how the ICD-11 has addressed these, and the implications for clinical practice and research.

The focus of the commentaries in this article is the Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines (CDDG) for ICD-11 Mental, Behavioual and Neurodevelopmental Disorders developed by the WHO Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. The version of the ICD-11 intended as a basis for statistical reporting does not provide sufficient information for reliable clinical application, The CDDG is a more comprehensive version that provides clinicians with detailed clinical guidance for diagnosing mental disorders in clinical settings. A draft review version of the CDDG for most disorder groupings is available for review and comment by members of the Global Clinical Practice Network. The statistical version is available at.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^114GzDjp]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics clinical practice guideline on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) outlines that ADHD is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood affecting academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions, and situates this update within prior AAP guidance, which first provided evaluation and diagnosis recommendations in 2000 with treatment recommendations in 2001, and a 2011 revision that included a process of care algorithm (PoCA). Since the release of the 2011 guideline and the revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to the fifth edition, the current revision makes only incremental updates, adds a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD, and updates the PoCA to assist in implementing the recommendations. The guideline also notes identification of numerous systemic barriers to adoption and a companion article in the Supplemental Information addressing systemic barriers and presenting recommendations to address those barriers, with this article supporting the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and PoCA.

### Measurement-based care in the treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder and disruptive behavior disorders [^1178fSwD]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common childhood psychiatric diagnoses. The core symptoms of ADHD include inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. ADHD entails impairments that have extensive and profound detrimental effects on many critical developmental areas. As a valid neurobiologic condition that causes significant impairments in those affected, it is one of the best-researched disorders in medicine. Measurement-based care in treatment of ADHD is critical in establishing a diagnosis, determining a treatment target, and assessing treatment response. This article highlights the rationale for measurement-based care in ADHD, how to implement measurement-based care in clinical practice, and common challenges encountered.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^111diJKh]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In sum, several of the changes in the ICD-11, both at the level of classification and at the level of disorder descriptions, result in greater agreement with the DSM-5 and with empirical evidence on comorbidity. Furthermore, the addition of impairment and duration criteria provides more guidance to distinguish disorder from normality; these changes, along with the updates to disorder descriptions, are likely to align the ICD-11 more closely with clinical practice.

### MHealth applications for childhood anxiety disorders: current landscape, challenges, and future directions [^1128gPLX]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are among the most common childhood mental health problems. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2025 report, anxiety disorders continue to be the most commonly diagnosed mental health condition in U.S. children ages 3 to 17. Alarmingly, their prevalence has been steadily increasing, particularly in adolescents and young adults, and this trend appears to have accelerated with the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and separation anxiety disorder are common in the pediatric population. Anxiety disorders, particularly in adolescents, are associated with adverse outcomes such as poor quality of life, social and academic problems, and increased financial burden.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), one of the evidence-based approaches to treating anxiety, is widely used, and young adults, in particular, prefer psychotherapy to psychiatric medication. However, families and adolescents may experience problems in terms of access to treatment, continuity, and effectiveness for young children. These difficulties include lengthy treatment protocols, lack of time and resources, limited numbers of CBT-trained therapists, and high costs. In addition, children find it challenging to complete therapy tasks at home, which can have a negative impact on treatment effectiveness.

Recent advances in technology-based applications offer significant opportunities to overcome barriers in the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. These applications are reviewed under the headings of mHealth and eHealth. eHealth' includes interventions such as the Internet, digital games, virtual reality, and robotics. At the same time, 'mHealth' refers to mobile and wireless applications, including text messaging, apps, wearable devices, and social media platforms. With the proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and other personal electronic devices, interest in mHealth has grown exponentially over the past two decades.

Some of the advantages of mHealth applications in the treatment of children and adolescents include the elimination of time and space constraints, cost-effectiveness, and the potential to reduce the risk of stigmatization. In addition, mHealth applications in pediatric anxiety disorders are noteworthy because they allow for individual customization and are attractive to a young population receptive to technological developments.

### Anxiety in medically ill children / adolescents [^1132cppX]. Depression and Anxiety (2011). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are thought to be one of the most common psychiatric diagnoses in children/adolescents. Chronic medical illness is a significant risk factor for the development of an anxiety disorder, and the prevalence rate of anxiety disorders among youths with chronic medical illnesses is higher compared to their healthy counterparts. Anxiety disorders may develop secondary to predisposing biological mechanisms related to a child's specific medical illness, as a response to being ill or in the hospital, a threatening environment, as a result of other genetic and psychological factors, or as a combination of all these factors. Additionally, exposure to physical pain early in one's life and/or frequent painful medical procedures are correlated with fear and anxiety during subsequent procedures and treatments, and may lead to medical nonadherence and other comorbidities. Anxiety disorders can have serious consequences in children/adolescents with chronic and/or life-limiting medical illnesses. Therefore, proper identification and treatment of anxiety disorders is necessary and may improve not only psychiatric symptoms but also physical symptoms. Behavioral and cognitive methods as well as psychotropic medications are used to treat anxiety disorders in pediatric patients. We will review current treatments for anxiety in children/adolescents with medical illnesses and propose future research directions.

### Update in pediatric sleep medicine [^117M1rBU]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the most important recent scientific developments in the field of clinical pediatric sleep medicine, specifically as relates to sleep disorders and sleep in special pediatric populations.

Recent Findings

The major themes covered in this review include sleep-disordered breathing; narcolepsy; restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder; insomnia; sleep in children with medical conditions; and sleep in children with neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

Summary

An expanded understanding of the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical evaluation methods, sequelae, and empirically supported treatment options of common pediatric sleep disorders, especially in high-risk populations, is key to a rational approach to diagnosis and management of these children in clinical settings.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^1128sjvx]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

ADHD guideline — Action statement 1 (evaluation in children and adolescents) states that the primary care clinician should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for any child 4 through 18 years of age who presents with academic or behavioral problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity (quality of evidence B/strong recommendation). Aggregate evidence quality is B, with benefits noting that systematic identification by primary care clinicians will likely decrease undiagnosed and untreated ADHD in children, and harms/risks/costs including potential inappropriate labeling, missed alternative conditions, and treatments that will not benefit them. The benefits-harms assessment states that the high prevalence and limited mental health resources require primary care pediatricians to play a significant role; treatments have good evidence of efficacy and lack of treatment risks impaired outcomes; exclusions are none; role of patient preferences is that success depends on patient and family preference; intentional vagueness delineates limits between primary care and subspecialty management; and strength is a strong recommendation. The basis notes ADHD occurs in approximately 8% of children and youth and that appropriate diagnosis can be provided for preschool-aged children (4–5 years of age) and adolescents.

### Obsessive-compulsive and spectrum disorders in children and adolescents [^111ahoFf]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

The available literature indicates that OCD affecting children and adolescents is highly prevalent. Pediatric-onset OCD seems to share important similarities with the adult disorder but also shows important differences. For example, the clinical phenotype of OCD is remarkably consistent at all ages with some allowances for developmental expression. Pediatric patients frequently demonstrate poor insight into the nature of their obsessions, which in association with their limited verbal expression may make the diagnosis more difficult. Obsessions involving fear of harm and separation, compulsions without obsessions, and rituals involving family members are more common in younger patients. Treatment response, including serotonergic specificity and the need for robust dosing, is another feature shared by early- and adult-onset OCD. Imporfant differences across the life span can also be identified. Perhaps the clearest difference pertains to age of onset. Age-at-onset data have shown a bimodal distribution of age of onset of OCD, with one peak in preadolescent childhood and another peak in adulthood. Another distinction between child and adult OCD is gender representation. Whereas adult studies report equal gender representation or a slight female preponderance, pediatric clinical samples are clearly male predominant. Patterns of psychiatric comorbidity in pediatric OCD show high rates of tic and mood and anxiety disorders, similar to the patterns in adults, but also show a distinct association with disruptive behavior disorders (ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder) and other specific and pervasive developmental disorders. Family studies indicate that the disorder is highly familial and that a childhood onset of the disorder seems to be associated with a markedly increased risk for familial transmission of OCD, tic disorders, and ADHD. Both scientifically and clinically, the recognition of developmentally specific OCD phenotypes may be valuable. For example, research efforts aimed at identifying OCD-associated genes are likely to be more successful if developmentally homogeneous samples are studied instead of combining data from children, adolescents, and adults, as has been common in OCD studies. Clinical management is also informed by an appreciation of the unique cor-relates of OCD affecting youth, especially comorbidity with chronic tic dis-orders and ADHD and their impact on treatment. The so-called "spectrum disorders" related to OCD are less prominent in children and adolescents than in adults. Although sharing some features with typical OCD, these symptoms are less clearly ego-dystonic and less anxiety producing, frequently provide a measure of gratification, and are less responsive in general to SSRIs. Often cognitive antecedents to these behaviors are less well developed than in more typical OCD, and behavioral interventions are the mainstay of treatment but with more variable success.

### Prevalence of developmental and behavioral disorders in a pediatric hospital [^111HzQXq]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of developmental and behavioral disorders in a convenience sample of children in an acute care pediatric hospital setting. We hypothesized that hospitalized children would have a higher prevalence of developmental and behavioral disorders than the general population.

Methods

Data for this cross-sectional study were collected during interviews with primary caregivers of 325 children from infancy throughout childhood who were admitted to a general pediatric service. Screening tests included the Child Development Inventory (3 months to 6 years), Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (0–8 years), Pediatric Symptom Checklist (4–18 years), and Vanderbilt Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Parent Rating Scale (6–18 years). Children were classified as having a known developmental and behavioral disorder, a suspected developmental and behavioral disorder, or no developmental and behavioral disorder.

Results

The prevalence of developmental and behavioral disorders among the hospitalized children 6 months to 17 years of age was 33.5%. A total of 72 children (22.1%) had known developmental and behavioral disorders and 37 (11.4%) had suspected developmental and behavioral disorders. This high prevalence of developmental and behavioral disorders included high rates of cerebral palsy (6.1%) and mental retardation or developmental delay (8.6%).

Conclusion

Hospitalization for treatment of acute conditions provides another opportunity for developmental surveillance. This higher prevalence of developmental and behavioral disorders in hospitalized children emphasizes the need to screen for developmental disabilities at every opportunity. Strategies to implement systematic screening of hospitalized children should be examined.

### Prevalence of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LZEdr]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are widely debated, fueled by variations in prevalence estimates across countries, time, and broadening diagnostic criteria. We conducted a meta-analysis to: establish a benchmark pooled prevalence for ADHD; examine whether estimates have increased with publication of different editions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM); and explore the effect of study features on prevalence.

Methods

Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies with point prevalence estimates of ADHD. We included studies of children that used the diagnostic criteria from DSM-III, DSM-III-R and DSM-IV in any language. Data were extracted on sampling procedure, sample characteristics, assessors, measures, and whether full or partial criteria were met.

Results

The 175 eligible studies included 179 ADHD prevalence estimates with an overall pooled estimate of 7.2% (95% confidence interval: 6.7 to 7.8), and no statistically significant difference between DSM editions. In multivariable analyses, prevalence estimates for ADHD were lower when using the revised third edition of the DSM compared with the fourth edition (P = 0.03) and when studies were conducted in Europe compared with North America (P = 0.04). Few studies used population sampling with random selection. Most were from single towns or regions, thus limiting generalizability.

Conclusions

Our review provides a benchmark prevalence estimate for ADHD. If population estimates of ADHD diagnoses exceed our estimate, then overdiagnosis may have occurred for some children. If fewer, then underdiagnosis may have occurred.

### Treatment rates for mental disorders among children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114yN1tH]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Mental disorders among children and adolescents are global health concerns. Published studies have provided discordant results regarding treatment rates for mental disorders among youths.

Objective

To estimate combined treatment rates for several common psychiatric disorders among children and adolescents.

Data Sources

PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Embase were searched from database inception until September 23, 2022, and supplemented with hand-searching of reference lists.

Study Selection

Included studies were those that used validated methods to report treatment rates for any mental disorder, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and behavior disorders among children and adolescents.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline. Two reviewers independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data, and scored quality. Studies with a Joanna Briggs Institute score of 5 or more were included in the meta-analysis. Treatment rates were pooled using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate the association with treatment rates of factors, such as year of data collection, World Health Organization region, age, income level, timeframe of diagnosis, informant source, service type, sample origin, and internalizing or externalizing disorder.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatment rates for mental disorders among children and adolescents were the main outcomes, measured as percentage estimates.

Results

Forty studies were included in the analysis, comprising 310 584 children and adolescents, with boys accounting for 39% of participants (sex was not reported in 10 studies). The pooled treatment rate was 38% (95% CI, 30%-45%) for any mental disorder, 36% (95% CI, 29%-43%) for depressive disorders, 31% (95% CI, 21%-42%) for anxiety disorders, 58% (95% CI, 42%-73%) for ADHD, and 49% (95% CI, 35%-64%) for behavior disorders. Age, income level, and region were significantly associated with the combined treatment rates of mental disorders in children and adolescents. The treatment rate for depressive disorders was higher among adolescents than children (36% [95% CI, 25%-46%] vs 11% [95% CI, 0%-25%]), whereas the treatment rate for anxiety disorders was higher among children than adolescents (64% [95% CI, 52%-75%] vs 20% [95% CI, 9%-30%]). The treatment rate for any mental disorder in lower-middle income countries was 6% (95% CI, 2%-14%), in upper-middle income countries was 24% (95% CI, 2%-47%), and in high-income countries was 43% (95% CI, 35%-52%). For depressive disorders, treatment rates were higher in the Americas (40% [95% CI, 30%-51%]) than in Europe (28% [95% CI, 13%-43%]) and the Western Pacific region (6% [95% CI, 1%-16%]).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that, in general, the treatment rates for mental disorders among children and adolescents were low, especially for depression and anxiety. Targeted intervention policies and effective measures should be designed and implemented to improve treatment rates of psychiatric disorders among youths.

### Estimated prevalence of depressive disorders in children from 2004 to 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1137VCgC]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of our meta-analyses suggest that depressive disorders in children younger than 13 years are uncommon, perhaps even more uncommon than previous estimates. Despite the increased risk posed by lifestyle factors in modern times, depressive disorders do not appear to be increasing for children younger than 13 years. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and diagnostic prevalence is yet to be determined, but data from studies identifying depressive symptoms using questionnaires suggest that this has increased. Therefore, depression prevalence studies in childhood using standardized interviews are a research priority, as are more nuanced investigations of moderators of these outcomes.

### Screening for anxiety in children and adolescents: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^111Xb55f]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Population and prevalence for this recommendation encompass children and adolescents 18 years or younger who do not have a diagnosed anxiety disorder or are not showing recognized signs or symptoms of anxiety, and the 2018–2019 National Survey of Children's Health found that 7.8% of children and adolescents aged 3 to 17 years had a current anxiety disorder; anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence are associated with an increased likelihood of a future anxiety disorder or depression.

### Prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and comorbid psychiatric problems in children 12 years and younger: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116GaA6h]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize current available evidence in the prevalence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its comorbid psychiatric problems in children 12 years and younger.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Science Network, Embase, PsycINFO, and Scopus for original studies published in English from database inception to September 23, 2022. Based on strict quality assessment, studies of moderate to high quality were finally included. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled prevalence. Heterogeneity was evaluated by using a series of subgroup analysis stratified by key factors, together with meta-regressions. The study protocol is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023398958).

Results

24 studies were finally included and synthesized, with an overall pooled prevalence of 0.03 (95% CI [0.02–0.05]) for ADHD in children 12 years and younger, the pooled prevalence for psychiatric comorbidities in ADHD children varied between 0.02 and 0.53. Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) was the most common psychiatric comorbidity in children with inattentive subtype (ADHD-I, pooled prevalence of 0.27 [95% CI 0.19–0.41]) and combined subtype (ADHD-C, pooled prevalence of 0.42 [95% CI 0.30–0.59]). Subgroup analysis revealed that different diagnostic criteria and regions introduced prominent heterogeneity to pooled prevalence of ADHD and its psychiatric comorbidities.

Conclusion

Variation in prevalence of ADHD and its comorbid mental disorders was seen in children 12 years and younger of different characteristics. Tailored intervention measures need to be developed for ADHD children with co-occurring mental illnesses, who are of higher risk in negative outcomes.

### Pediatric sleep pharmacology: you want to give my kid sleeping pills? [^1172goeF]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

There is a need for greater information about the pharmacologic management of sleep disorders in children. Pharmacologic guidelines must be developed specifically for sleep disorders in children. Ideally, these guidelines should be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for a specific sleep disorder or for the pediatric age range. This approval prevents physicians from being forced to prescribe medications as an "off label" indication. Development of easy-to-swallow, chewable, or liquid forms of these medications would be well received by parents everywhere. When these are not available, instructions for compounding these medications into a suspension by pharmacists are needed. Integration of behavioral and pharmacologic treatments may yield better patient outcomes. This approach requires pediatricians to have a comprehensive understanding of clinical sleep disorders in children. Training programs should play the lead role in enhancing pediatricians' knowledge of the pharmacologic treatment of sleep disorders in children.

### Pharmacologic treatment of pediatric insomnia [^113eAwF5]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Pediatric insomnia is common in children and adolescents, particularly in children who have comorbid medical, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental disorders, and may be associated with cognitive, emotional, and psychosocial impairments that often result in significant caregiver burden. Although several behavioral interventions for pediatric insomnia are effective, there is a relative paucity of empiric evidence supporting the use of pharmacologic treatment. Sedative/hypnotic drugs are frequently used in clinical practice to treat pediatric insomnia, and guidelines for the use of these medications in general as well as for specific medications have been developed. This review presents expert consensus guidelines for the use of these medications in clinical practice, with a focus on the different classes of pharmacologic agents that are most commonly prescribed.

### Prevalence and treatment of depression, anxiety, and conduct problems in US children [^117J9b6u]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To use the latest data to estimate the prevalence and correlates of currently diagnosed depression, anxiety problems, and behavioral or conduct problems among children, and the receipt of related mental health treatment.

Study Design

We analyzed data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) to report nationally representative prevalence estimates of each condition among children aged 3–17 years and receipt of treatment by a mental health professional. Parents/caregivers reported whether their children had ever been diagnosed with each of the 3 conditions and whether they currently have the condition. Bivariate analyses were used to examine the prevalence of conditions and treatment according to sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. The independent associations of these characteristics with both the current disorder and utilization of treatment were assessed using multivariable logistic regression.

Results

Among children aged 3–17 years, 7.1% had current anxiety problems, 7.4% had a current behavioral/conduct problem, and 3.2% had current depression. The prevalence of each disorder was higher with older age and poorer child health or parent/caregiver mental/emotional health; condition-specific variations were observed in the association between other characteristics and the likelihood of disorder. Nearly 80% of those with depression received treatment in the previous year, compared with 59.3% of those with anxiety problems and 53.5% of those with behavioral/conduct problems. Model-adjusted effects indicated that condition severity and presence of a comorbid mental disorder were associated with treatment receipt.

Conclusions

The latest nationally representative data from the NSCH show that depression, anxiety, and behavioral/conduct problems are prevalent among US children and adolescents. Treatment gaps remain, particularly for anxiety and behavioral/conduct problems.

### Prevalence of mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders among children and adolescents with diabetes, United States (2016–2019) [^1119jDTJ]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the association of diabetes and mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders in youth, we examined the magnitude of overlap between these disorders in children and adolescents.

Study Design

In this cross-sectional study, we calculated prevalence estimates using the 2016–2019 National Survey of Children's Health. Parents reported whether their child was currently diagnosed with diabetes or with any of the following mental, behavioral, or developmental disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, learning disability, intellectual disability, developmental delay, anxiety, depression, behavioral problems, Tourette syndrome, or speech/language disorder. We present crude prevalence estimates weighted to be representative of the US child population and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) adjusted for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

Results

Among children and adolescents (aged 2–17 years; n = 121312), prevalence of mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders varied by diabetes status (diabetes: 39.9% [30.2–50.4]; no diabetes: 20.3% [19.8–20.8]). Compared with children and adolescents without diabetes, those with diabetes had a nearly 2-fold higher prevalence of mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders (aPR: 1.72 [1.31–2.27]); mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders (aPR: 1.90 [1.38–2.61]) and developmental, learning, and language disorders (aPR: 1.89 [1.35–2.66]).

Conclusions

These results suggest that approximately 2 in 5 children and adolescents with diabetes have a mental, behavioral, or developmental disorder. Understanding potential causal pathways may ultimately lead to future preventative strategies for mental, behavioral, and developmental disorders and diabetes in children and adolescents.

### Estimated prevalence of depressive disorders in children from 2004 to 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116iazsz]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Depression during childhood (ie, age < 13 years) poses a major health burden. Recent changes in environmental and lifestyle factors may increase children's risk of mental health problems. This has been reported for anxiety disorders, but it is unclear whether this occurs for depressive disorders.

Objective

To provide prevalence estimates for the depressive disorders (ie, major depressive disorder [MDD], dysthymia, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [DMDD], and overall) in children, and whether they have changed over time.

Data Sources

The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched using terms related to depressive disorders, children, and prevalence. This was supplemented by a systematic gray literature search.

Study Selection

Studies were required to provide population prevalence estimates of depressive disorder diagnoses (according to an established taxonomy and standardized interviews) for children younger than 13 years, information about participants' year of birth, and be published in English.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data extraction was compliant with the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. A total of 12 985 nonduplicate records were retrieved, and 154 full texts were reviewed. Data were analyzed from 2004 (the upper limit of a previous review) to May 27, 2023. Multiple proportional random-effects meta-analytic and mixed-effects meta-regression models were fit.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pooled prevalence rates of depressive disorders, prevalence rate differences between males vs females and high-income countries (HICs) vs low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), and moderating effects of time or birth cohort.

Results

A total of 41 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Pooled prevalence estimates were obtained for 1.07% (95% CI, 0.62%-1.63%) for depressive disorders overall, 0.71% (95% CI, 0.48%-0.99%) for MDD, 0.30% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.62%) for dysthymia, and 1.60% (95% CI, 0.28%-3.90%) for DMDD. The meta-regressions found no significant evidence of an association with birth cohort, and prevalence rates did not differ significantly between males and females or between HICs and LMICs. There was a low risk of bias overall, except for DMDD, which was hindered by a lack of studies.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, depression in children was uncommon and did not increase substantially between 2004 and 2019. Future epidemiologic studies using standardized interviews will be necessary to determine whether this trend will continue into and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115fgAZ5]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is 1 of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of childhood and can profoundly affect children's academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions. The American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for evaluation and diagnosis of pediatric ADHD in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001. The guidelines were revised in 2011 and published with an accompanying process of care algorithm (PoCA) providing discrete and manageable steps by which clinicians could fulfill the clinical guideline's recommendations. Since the release of the 2011 guideline, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has been revised to the fifth edition, and new ADHD-related research has been published. These publications do not support dramatic changes to the previous recommendations. Therefore, only incremental updates have been made in this guideline revision, including the addition of a key action statement related to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. The accompanying process of care algorithm has also been updated to assist in implementing the guideline recommendations. Throughout the process of revising the guideline and algorithm, numerous systemic barriers were identified that restrict and/or hamper pediatric clinicians' ability to adopt their recommendations. Therefore, the subcommittee created a companion article (available in the Supplemental Information) on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD, which identifies the major systemic-level barriers and presents recommendations to address those barriers; in this article, we support the recommendations of the clinical practice guideline and accompanying process of care algorithm.

### Classification and epidemiology of sleep disorders in children and adolescents [^116Z2zUy]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Sleep disturbances are common in children and adolescents but still remain unrecognized and undertreated. Several classification systems of sleep disorders are available, which include recent attempts to develop more specific nosologic categories that reflect developmental aspects of sleep. The prevalence of sleep disorders has been studied across various samples of healthy, typically developing children and those with special medical, psychiatric, and neurodevelopmental needs. Sleep disorders are highly prevalent in children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders, making it important for mental health professionals to be aware of sleep problems and to address them in the context of psychiatric comorbidities.

### Epidemiologic considerations in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a review and update [^116AxF1Z]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Epidemiologic data on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are essential for planning health services and implementing strategies of detection and early intervention, with possible substantial benefits on public health. This article addresses methodological aspects of prevalence studies, recent findings on the prevalence of ADHD in childhood and adolescence based on a systematic review, current findings on the persistence of the disorder over time and prevalence in adulthood, and factors associated with ADHD. Evidence from the reviewed literature indicates the importance of methodological aspects in the understanding of epidemiologic findings and the necessity of large-scale cross-national studies. Moreover, governments clearly must direct attention to childhood mental disorders to guarantee a healthy future for their countries.

### Update on environmental risk factors for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^111bQxXr]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurobehavioral disorder affecting 5% to 10% of children. Although considered to be a highly familial disorder, ADHD heritability estimates of 60% to 80% highlight the considerable role that environmental factors may still play in disorder susceptibility. Proposed ADHD environmental risk factors include prenatal substance exposures, heavy metal and chemical exposures, nutritional factors, and lifestyle/psychosocial factors. This paper reviews the literature published in 2010 investigating the association between environmental risk factors and ADHD or related symptomatology. Sources of risk factor exposure and the proposed mechanism by which each exposure is linked to ADHD-related neurobehavioral changes are also reported. Methodologic limitations of the current literature are discussed, and guidelines for future study are proposed. An improved understanding of the role that environmental factors play in ADHD etiology is critical to future ADHD prevention efforts.

### Is there an association between psychiatric disorders and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? A large-database study [^116CikYD]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Prevalence of Psychiatric Disorders

The median (range) prevalence of psychiatric disorders among children with AIS was 7%, (6% to 7%) over 5 years. The median number of children with AIS who had psychiatric disorders was 518 (435 to 526) (Table 1). In all 5 years, anxiety disorders accounted for the greatest prevalence (Fig. 1). The median prevalence of anxiety disorders, behavioral disorders, and mood disorders were 4% (4% to 5%), 3% (2% to 3%), and 2% (2% to 3%), respectively (see Table 1; Supplemental Digital Content 1).

Are Psychiatric Disorders More Common with AIS Than in Age-matched Controls?

Compared with children who did not have AIS, and after controlling for gender, age, insurance type, and residential district, children with AIS were more likely to have psychiatric disorders in all 5 years (Table 2). Compared with children who did not have AIS, the adjusted ORs of psychiatric disorders in children with AIS ranged from 1.47 to 1.74 (2012: OR 1.60 [95% CI 1.46 to 1.75]; p < 0.001; 2013: OR 1.73 [95% CI 1.58 to 1.89]; p < 0.001; 2014: OR 1.74 [95% CI 1.59 to 1.91]; p < 0.001; 2015: OR 1.71 [95% CI 1.56 to 1.88]; p < 0.001; 2016: OR 1.47 [95% CI 1.33 to 1.62]; p < 0.001). As an example, in year 2016, the adjusted OR of psychiatric disorders in children with AIS was 1.47 (95% CI 1.33 to 1.62) after controlling for the above variables (Table 3).

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^111CkmEo]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood and can profoundly affect the academic achievement, well-being, and social interactions of children; the American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical recommendations for the diagnosis and evaluation of ADHD in children in 2000; recommendations for treatment followed in 2001.

### ADHD: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^115pr2YH]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) — coexisting conditions assessment and referral: A variety of other behavioral, developmental, and physical conditions can coexist in children who are evaluated for ADHD, including learning problems, language disorder, disruptive behavior, anxiety, mood disorders, tic disorders, seizures, developmental coordination disorder, or sleep disorders. Given this likelihood, primary care clinicians should conduct assessments that determine or at least identify the risk of coexisting conditions, and the primary care clinician might benefit from additional support and guidance or might need to refer a child with ADHD and coexisting conditions to subspecialists for assessment and management; the subspecialists could include child psychiatrists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, neurodevelopmental disability physicians, child neurologists, or child or school psychologists. The AAP has developed algorithms and a toolkit for assessing and treating (or comanaging) common developmental disorders and mental health concerns in children. Aggregate evidence quality is B with strength stated as strong recommendation; benefits note that identifying coexisting conditions is important for developing the most appropriate treatment plan, harms/risks/costs note that the major risk is misdiagnosing the conditions and providing inappropriate care, and the benefits-harms assessment states there is a preponderance of benefit over harm.

### Prevalence and treatment patterns of autism spectrum disorder in the United States, 2016 [^113kr3TX]. JAMA Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Importance

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Previous surveys have reported a steady increase in ASD prevalence in US children over the past decades. Several behavioral therapies and medications have been developed to treat the symptoms of ASD; however, little is known about the current status of treatment usage for children diagnosed as having ASD.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence and treatment patterns of ASD among US children using nationally representative data.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This study used data from the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health, a nationwide, population-based, cross-sectional survey. We included 43 032 children aged 3 to 17 years. Data were collected through questionnaires completed by a parent or guardian. Data were analyzed from February 2018 to March 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Outcome variables included ASD diagnosed by a physician or health professional and the use of behavioral treatment or medication treatment among children with ASD.

Results

Of the 43 032 included participants, 22 072 (51.3%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 10.7 (4.4) years. The weighted prevalence of ever-diagnosed ASD and current ASD were 2.79% (95% CI, 2.46–3.12) and 2.50% (95% CI, 2.21–2.79), respectively. The state-level prevalence of ever-diagnosed ASD varied from 1.54% (95% CI, 0.60–2.48) in Texas to 4.88% (95% CI, 2.72–7.05) in Florida. Nationally, about 70% of children with current ASD (70.5%; 95% CI, 65.1–75.8) were treated; 43.3% (95% CI, 37.4–49.2) received behavioral treatment only, 6.9% (95% CI, 3.7–10.1) received medication treatment only, and 20.3% (95% CI, 16.5–24.1) received both behavioral and medication treatments. The remaining 29.5% (95% CI, 24.2–34.9) of children with current ASD did not receive either behavioral or medication treatment.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study showed that the prevalence of ASD in the United States was relatively high, and it varied substantially across US states. Almost 30% of US children with ASD did not receive behavioral or medication treatment, which calls for a critical need to understand and address the barriers for those children to receive appropriate treatments.

### Diagnosis and treatment of behavioral health disorders in pediatric practice [^111f72jQ]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

There has been a strong push toward the recognition and treatment of children with behavioral health problems by primary care pediatricians. This study was designed to assess the extent to which a sample of primary care pediatricians diagnose and treat behavioral health problems and to identify factors that may contribute to their behavioral health practice.

Methods

A standard interview was conducted with 47 pediatricians who work in primary care settings in a predominantly urban setting in North Carolina. Pediatricians' responses to questions about the estimated percentage of children in their practice with a behavioral health disorder, tools used to make diagnoses, frequent and infrequent diagnoses made, comfort level with making a diagnosis, reasons for not making a diagnosis, use of psychotropic medications, types of nonmedication interventions provided, educational background, and needs involving behavioral health issues were evaluated.

Results

Pediatricians estimated that the average percentage of children in their practices with a behavioral health disorder was 15%. The study did not find significant differences in perceptions related to time in practice or gender of the pediatric provider. The most frequent behavioral health diagnosis was attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and the majority incorporated behavioral questionnaires, expressed a high level of comfort with the diagnosis, and frequently or occasionally prescribed stimulants. Variability was noted in both practice and comfort for other behavioral health disorders. Slightly fewer than half of the pediatricians frequently diagnosed anxiety and depression. Those who make these diagnoses commonly incorporated questionnaires and reported frequent or occasional use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Comfort in making the diagnosis of anxiety was highly associated with use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The vast majority (96%) of pediatricians provided nonmedication interventions, including supportive counseling, education for coping with ADHD, behavior modification, and/or stress management. Diagnosis and treatment of severe behavioral health disorders were infrequent throughout the pediatric practices. Areas of greatest educational interest included psychopharmacology, diagnosis and treatment of depression and anxiety, and updates on ADHD. The majority of pediatric providers did not identify a need for education about several high-prevalence disorders that they do not frequently diagnose or treat, including conduct disorder and substance abuse.

Conclusions

Pediatricians in this sample frequently diagnosed and treated ADHD. For all other behavioral health disorders, pediatricians reported variability in both comfort and practice. They frequently provided both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments for children and adolescents with mild to moderate behavioral health disorders but not for severe disorders. Although they identified needs for additional education for anxiety and depression, the majority did not identify educational needs for several high-prevalence behavioral health disorders, including conduct disorder and substance abuse.

### Prevalence of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents during COVID-19 pandemic: a meta-analysis and systematic review of epidemiological surveys [^111qwDZD]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Although many studies focused on sleep disturbances in children and adolescents, the findings varied greatly between studies with very few meta-analyses published. One meta-analysis reported that the prevalence of sleep problems was 35.7% (95% CI: 29.4–42.4%) in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In a recent meta-analysis of major sub-populations, the prevalence of sleep disturbances was 45.96% [36.90–55.30%] (N = 10) among children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another meta-analysis found that the pooled prevalence of sleep disorders alone was 44% (95% CI: 21%- 68%) in children and adolescents during the pandemic, but when more broadly defined, those with sleep disturbances were not included. In another meta-analysis examining sleep disturbances in children and adolescents with and without neurobehavioral disorders, the pooled prevalence of any sleep disturbance was 54% during the COVID-19 pandemic (95% CI: 50–57%). However, the inclusion of neurobehavioral disorders and only a small number of studies (N = 3) might have biased the findings. This gave us the impetus to conduct a meta-analysis on the worldwide prevalence and associated factors of sleep disturbances in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Intergenerational transmission of psychiatric conditions and psychiatric, behavioral, and psychosocial outcomes in offspring [^111t5kDi]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the intergenerational transmission of psychiatric conditions attributable to broader psychopathology comorbidity or to specific conditions?

Findings

In this cohort study including 2 947 703 participants, children whose parents scored 1 SD above the mean on the general psychopathology factor had a statistically significant 8% to 40% higher odds of 31 different outcomes. The specific psychopathology factors were primarily associated with within-spectrum and related offspring outcomes.

Meaning

Because the intergenerational transmission of psychiatric conditions appeared largely attributable to a parental general psychopathology factor, mental health care professionals might benefit from taking the total number of parental psychiatric conditions into account when estimating patient prognosis.

### Prevalence and Co-occurrence of developmental and emotional-behavioral problems in young children [^1177CJXr]. Academic Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

A limited number of studies have estimated the prevalence of emotional-behavioral disorders among young children. None have assessed their co-occurrence with developmental delays using standardized assessment tools. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence of emotional-behavioral disorders and their co-occurrence with developmental delays among young children (2–5.5 years).

Methods

Parents of young children (N = 987) enrolled from pediatric waiting rooms completed developmental-behavioral screening questionnaires. Based on results, 585 families were invited to and 439 completed evaluations that included structured diagnostic interviews with parents to assess child psychopathology (Preschool Age Psychiatric Assessment (PAPA)), developmental testing with children (including the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third Edition for children ≤ 42 months; Differential Ability Scales, second Edition for older children), and videotaped observation to establish whether autism risk was sufficient to warrant further evaluation.

Results

According to PAPA algorithms, 23.0% of children met criteria for a DSM-IV disorder, while 9% qualified for a developmental delay. Presence of delay doubled the odds of having a DSM-IV disorder (OR = 2.1; CI: 1.02–4.3), and presence of disorder doubled the odds of having a moderate-to-severe developmental delay (OR = 2.0; CI: 1.10–3.50). Prevalence of DSM-IV disorders (48.8% (95% CI: 33.5–64.5%)) and developmental delays (57.5% (95% CI: 41.7–71.9%)) were both higher among children at risk for autism. While developmental delay did not vary by race/ethnicity, prevalence of DSM-IV disorders was lower among African-American/Black (10.6%; CI: 2.9–18.3) and Hispanic/Latino children (11.1%; CI: 4.3–17.9).

Conclusions

Developmental delays and emotional-behavioral disorders among young children seen in pediatric settings are characterized by high prevalence and substantial co-occurrence.

### Mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders in the ICD-11: an international perspective on key changes and controversies [^111d9c6J]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, our view of psychiatric classification in general, and of the ICD-11 in particular, is one that avoids the overly optimistic view that nosology can or should resolve all the key debates in the field, and one that steers clear of the overly pessimistic view that the classification of mental disorders is inherently deeply and necessarily flawed. Global mental health is intimately linked with the sustainable goals for development, and the ICD-11 provides an important tool for these endeavors. In particular, its focus on global applicability and clinical utility in non-specialized primary care settings will maximize the likelihood that it will be adopted by mental health professionals and administrators as well as enhance its application in non-specialist settings and its usefulness for scaling up evidence-based interventions. The new mental disorders classification in ICD-11 and its accompanying diagnostic guidelines therefore represent an important, albeit iterative, advance for the field.

### Classification and epidemiology of sleep disorders [^114FRSiE]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are common in children and adolescents but still remain underrecognized and undertreated. Several classification systems of sleep disorders are available, including some newer attempts to develop more specific nosologic categories that reflect developmental aspects of sleep. The prevalence of sleep disorders has been studied across various samples of healthy, normal children and in children with special medical and neurodevelopmental needs. Sleep disorders are more frequently seen in children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders, making it very important for mental health professionals to be aware of sleep problems and to address them in the context of psychiatric comorbidities.

### Nonpharmacologic treatments for pediatric sleeplessness [^117MxqTh]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Because of the high prevalence of sleep problems in children and adolescents, as well as the profound negative impact that pediatric sleeplessness has on daytime functioning, pediatric practitioners must be aware not only of the causes of sleeplessness but also how to treat sleep problems effectively with nonpharmacologic interventions. This article provided an overview of common pediatric disorders that present as pediatric sleeplessness and are effectively treated by behavioral interventions. Although more studies on behavioral interventions for pediatric sleeplessness are needed, behavioral approaches have been shown to be effective in addressing concerns related to bedtime problems, night wakings, insufficient sleep, insomnia, and DSPS. Behavioral interventions are effectively used for children with special needs, including developmental disabilities, ADHD, and mood disorders.

### Estimated prevalence of depressive disorders in children from 2004 to 2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112e42wS]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Like Costello et al, we found no evidence that depression has increased over time. Indeed, the results of the meta-regressions suggested that a child's birth year, which for our models largely consisted of children born in the 1990s and 2000s, had no association with prevalence rates. The conjecture made by Costello and colleagues about historical rectification of underdiagnosis could well be applicable here too. In any case, our meta-regressions suggest that the prevalence increases observed in anxiety before the COVID-19 pandemicdid not also translate to increases in depression. There could be a few reasons for this. First, given the low prevalence rates of depression, greater uncertainty around the precision of depression estimates could make it harder to detect true increases. Alternatively, increases in depression prevalence may be more easily detected when following up children over multiple sessions. Finally, although anxiety and depressive disorders share several core features (ie, negative affect and avoidant behaviors), it is possible that the causal factors leading to the increase in anxiety disorders may be unique to the nonoverlapping components of anxiety (eg, physiologic hyperarousal).

### Behavioral outcomes after inpatient rehabilitation in pediatric and adolescent trauma patients [^113Ygn62]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic injury is the leading cause of pediatric mortality and morbidity in the United States. While behavioral impairments of children after traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been described, outcomes following traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) and multi-trauma (MT) are less known. We aimed to address the prevalence of behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders in pediatric and adolescent trauma patients.

Methods

We performed a single-center retrospective review of patients ≤ 18 years of age admitted to inpatient rehabilitation after traumatic injury from January 2018-December 2020. Patients were classified as having behavioral issues if they had a new psychiatric or behavioral diagnosis, or if their previously diagnosed condition was categorized as worsened after traumatic injury.

Results

Ninety-seven patients were included. 61 patients had TBI, 18 SCI, and 18 MT. Rates of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (MT 33.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (SCI 21.5%, MT 22.2%), neurocognitive disorder (TBI 40%, MT 50%), and school issues (TBI 59%, MT 43.8%) were increased (p < 0.05). Flat affect (61.7% TBI, 63.2% SCI, 77.8% MT), depression (TBI 18.3%, SCI 36.8%, MT 33.3%), aggression (TBI 27%, SCI 10.5%, MT 27.8%), and anxiety (TBI 21.7%, SCI 31.6%, MT 50%) were seen at high rates across all injury types. School disruption problems arose most commonly at 5.6 months (range 0–19 months) after discharge. 43% of parents reported lack of access to resources as a barrier to follow up.

Conclusion

Many behavioral and psychiatric sequelae are prevalent regardless of injury mechanism. Patients should be followed long term for these sequalae to ensure they receive appropriate therapies.

Type Of Study

Retrospective cohort study.

### Is there an association between psychiatric disorders and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis? A large-database study [^11154ucg]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Prevalence of Psychiatric Disorders

We found that about 7% of children with AIS had psychiatric disorders. In all 5 years from 2012 to 2016, anxiety disorders accounted for the most cases. There were several studies reporting on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children. In a Turkish study of 417 children, 14.1% of the population met one or more psychiatric disorder criteria based on questionnaires and interview methods. The most prevalent disorders included anxiety disorders, which was consistent with our study. The median (range) prevalence of all anxiety disorders in a recent review was 8% (2% to 24%). Beesdo et al. indicated that the lifetime prevalence of "any anxiety disorder" in studies with children or adolescents is about 15% to 20%, despite notable variation due to variance of methods. The prevalence of behavioral or conduct problems was 7.4%, according to the analysis study of the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. Farias et al. indicated that the prevalence of depressive disorder in children ranged from 0.5% to 2.5%. A study of depressive disorder in Brazil reported the prevalence as 3.3% to 12.4% in adolescents using the questionnaires method. Overall, we found that the prevalence of any psychiatric disorders or a specific psychiatric disorder can change depending on methodological, regional, economic, and personal factors. In this study, we only included mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and behavioral disorders, as these three categories were most likely to be related to mental stress, and therefore, expected to be related to AIS. Several other pediatric psychiatric disorders, such as organic mental disorders, substance use disorders, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and developmental disorders, were not included in this study. Therefore, caution is needed in interpreting our prevalence results in comparison with other studies. Since our results were based on diagnostic codes entered in medical registry, we believe our results closely reflect the real prevalence of psychiatric disorders in children with AIS. Our results would be useful for surgeons as well as pediatricians and psychiatrists when instructing children with AIS and their parents.

### Research priorities on physical-mental comorbidity in children and adolescents: an international consensus [^115EvmGy]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Childhood and adolescence are critical periods that lay the foundation for lifelong health, development, and wellbeing. These formative years are marked by rapid physical, psychological, and social changes, creating unique opportunities for growth but also heightened vulnerability to adversity. In recent decades, the global burden of physical health conditions among children has steadily increased. Concurrently, mental disorders have emerged as a pressing global concern in this age group. According to World Health Organization (WHO), one in seven individuals aged 10–19 years is affected by a mental disorder. Importantly, the co-occurrence of physical and mental health conditions, commonly termed physical-mental comorbidity, is both prevalent and consequential. Approximately 38.2% of children with chronic physical illnesses also meet diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder, while those with primary mental disorders face an elevated risk of developing health problems. This bidirectional relationship can reinforce a circle of worsening health, impairing educational achievement, social engagement, and long-term wellbeing. The complexity and cumulative burden of physical-mental comorbidity underscore the urgent need for integrated, cross-sectoral approaches to prevention, care delivery, and policy reform.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^113VHi18]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

AACAP clinical practice guideline for children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD) aims to enhance quality of care by summarizing empirically based guidance on psychosocial and psychopharmacologic treatment and expert-based guidance on assessment and implementation in clinical practice. Meta-analyses published since the AHRQ/RTI-UNC review are included, and guidance on assessment and implementation is informed by expert opinion and consensus sources including the DSM-5-TR. Psychotherapy (specifically, cognitive–behavioral and interpersonal therapies) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication have some rigorous empirical support as treatment options, and comprehensive, evidence-based assessment may enhance evidence-based treatment outcomes. The guideline notes significant limitations in rigorous empirical support and a protracted severe shortage of child and adolescent–trained behavioral health specialists, and highlights research priorities including delivery mechanisms, comparative effectiveness and sequencing of treatments, mediators and moderators, approaches for nonresponders and disorder relapse/ recurrence, long-term effects and degree of suicide risk with SSRI use, and discovery of novel pharmacologic or interventional treatments. Epidemiology cited includes that nearly 30% of youth worldwide are reported to have a depressive disorder and that estimated lifetime and past-year prevalence of MDD among U.S. adolescents was reported to be 11% and 7.5%.

### Do the diagnostic criteria for ADHD need to change? Comments on the preliminary proposals of the DSM-5 ADHD and disruptive behavior disorders committee [^1166pWuR]. European Child & Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD in children (hyperactive-impulsive subtype)" for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) diagnostic criteria for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of this specific subtype of ADHD. The target patient population includes children who exhibit symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity.

The primary components of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, include nine specific behaviors related to hyperactivity and impulsivity. These behaviors include fidgeting or squirming, leaving the seat when expected to remain seated, running or climbing inappropriately, inability to engage in quiet leisure activities, excessive talking, blurting out answers prematurely, difficulty waiting turns, and interrupting or intruding on others. Each of these behaviors contributes to the overall score, which is used to determine the presence of ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype.

In addition to these behaviors, the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria also consider the course of the disease. The presence of these symptoms for at least six months, to a degree that is disruptive and inappropriate for the child's developmental level, significantly contributes to the overall score.

The DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype, is used to determine whether a child meets the diagnostic criteria for this subtype of ADHD. A score of 106 or higher indicates that the child meets the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive subtype. If the score is less than 106, the diagnostic criteria are not met.

This tool assesses whether a child meets the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for the hyperactive-impulsive subtype of ADHD. It integrates a series of ten questions about the child's behaviors and symptoms. The approach is straightforward, assigning points for the presence of specific behaviors and characteristics, and a significant number of points for the duration and impact of these symptoms.

Here's how it works:

- Each behavioral attribute, such as fidgeting, excessive talking, and trouble waiting in line, contributes 1 point if observed.
- The key condition, presence of symptoms for at least six months to a disruptive and inappropriate extent for the child's developmental level, crucially adds 100 points.

The process includes:

- **Often fidgets with or taps hands or feet, or squirms in seat**: 1 point
- **Often leaves seat in situations when remaining seated is expected**: 1 point
- Often runs or climbs inappropriately, or feels restless in adolescents/adults: 1 point
- **Often unable to play quietly**: 1 point
- **Is often "on the go" or acts as if "driven by a motor"*: 1 point
- **Often talks excessively**: 1 point
- **Often blurts out an answer before a question is completed**: 1 point
- **Often has trouble waiting their turn**: 1 point
- **Often interrupts or intrudes on others**: 1 point
- **Presence of symptoms for at least 6 months with significant disruption**: 100 points

To analyze the results, sum up the points:

- If the total score reaches 106 points or more, the criteria for ADHD (hyperactive-impulsive subtype) are met, suggesting the presence of ADHD as per DSM-5 standards.
- Scores below 106 indicate that the criteria for ADHD are not fulfilled. This outcome implies that symptoms either do not appear with enough frequency or intensity, or they have not persisted for a sufficiently long duration to meet the diagnostic threshold.

This methodology provides a straightforward evaluation that correlates the child's behaviors with the established diagnostic standards, offering a clear interpretation based on the computed score.

### The use of pharmacotherapy in the treatment of pediatric insomnia in primary care: rational approaches. A consensus meeting summary [^116DJasT]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To formulate a rational approach to the pharmacologic treatment of pediatric insomnia, and to develop clinical guidelines regarding indications, target populations, and parameters for the use of these medications, especially by community-based pediatricians.

Participants

A multidisciplinary task force developed under the auspices of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, which included experts in pediatric sleep medicine, psychiatry, pharmacology, neurology, and general pediatrics.

Evidence

Review of existing data regarding current use of over-the-counter and prescription medications for pediatric insomnia in the primary care practice setting, and of empirical data on the pharmacology, safety, efficacy, and tolerability of medications commonly used for the treatment of pediatric insomnia.

Consensus Process

Group consensus definition of pediatric insomnia and clinical guidelines; working group recommendations regarding special populations and future directions.

Conclusions

Use of medications for pediatric insomnia should be diagnostically driven, and should be implemented in conjunction with empirically-based behavioral treatment strategies and adequate sleep hygiene. Specific target populations include children with neurodevelopmental disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, chronic medical conditions, and psychiatric disorders. Additional research, including clinical trials, is critically needed to provide an evidence-based approach to the use of these medications in clinical practice.

US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) — burden and scope of ASD screening evidence: In 2010, the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the United States was estimated at 14.7 cases per 1000 children, or 1 in 68 children, and this represents a 23% increase from 2008. The USPSTF commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on the accuracy, benefits, and potential harms of brief, formal screening instruments for ASD administered during routine primary care visits and the benefits and potential harms of early behavioral treatment for children identified with ASD through screening, and the review focused on studies of screening in children younger than 3 years who were unselected.

P for trend was calculated using a weighted logistic regression model, which included survey year as a continuous variable and was adjusted for age (4–17 years: P = 0.31; 6–11 years: P = 0.79; 12–17 years: P = 0.07), sex (female: P = 0.04; male: P = 0.95), race and ethnicity (Hispanic: P = 0.52; non-Hispanic Black: P = 0.08; non-Hispanic White: P = 0.55; other: P = 0.46), family income-to-poverty ratio (< 1.00: P = 0.61; 1.00–1.99: P = 0.30; 2.00–3.99: P = 0.35; ≥ 4.00: P = 0.11), and highest educational level of family members (< high school: P = 0.74; high school: P = 0.50; ≥ college: P = 0.33). Other races and ethnicities included non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native (individual only), non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaska Native and any other group, non-Hispanic Asian (individual only), and other single and multiple races or declined to respond, no response, or unknown. The family income-to-poverty ratio is the total family income divided by the poverty threshold.

### Biopsychosocial issues and risk factors in the family when the child has a chronic illness [^1136F9Mc]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment. There has been a recent interest in the psychological aspects — emotional and behavioral — of chronic illness in children and adolescents. Major new areas of science, such as behavioral medicine, have emerged to address the research and clinical demands of this field. Several studies already have demonstrated the increased risk for psychiatric problems in children with chronic health conditions to be three to four times greater than their healthy peers. The proposed perspective shifts from a traditional sole reliance on medical diagnosis to a focus more on the dimensions of adjustment, socioeconomic status, visibility of condition, social support, and family functioning.

### Guidance for identification and treatment of individuals with attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder based upon expert consensus [^116XBR6j]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

hyperactivity disorder/hyperactivity disorder

ADHD is a childhood onset, neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic and environmental origins characterised by pervasive behavioural symptoms of hyperactivity, inattentiveness and impulsivity that have been present for at least 6 months and adversely impact on daily functioning and development. ADHD is highly prevalent. Research combining data from multiple sources and analysed using meta-regression reported a worldwide-pooled estimate of 5.29–7.2% in children, 2.5% in adults and between 2.8% in older adulthood. Symptoms must persist across the lifespan, although the relative balance and the specific manifestations of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive characteristics vary across individuals, and may change over the course of development, e.g. in particular hyperactive-impulsive symptoms commonly reduce with age.

The diagnostic criteria for ADHD are presented in DSM-5 and the World Health Organization's International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 11th edition beta, (ICD-11). Whilst the basic symptom criteria did not change from the revision of DSM-IV, DSM-5 increased the typical age of onset to age 12 (previously age 7). The definition of ADHD was expanded to more accurately characterise the experience of adults, and the number of symptoms was relaxed for adults (> 17 years) who are now required to have five or more symptoms that have persisted for at least 6 months in the inattention and/or hyperactive-impulsive domains. For a diagnosis made in childhood, the number of symptoms remained as 6, respectively. Symptoms must be pervasive and interfere with or reduce the quality of social, academic and occupational functioning. They must not be better explained by other conditions, such as intellectual disability. The change in nomenclature from 'subtypes' in DSM-IV to 'presentations' in DSM-5 reflects increasing evidence that symptoms are often fluid within individuals across their lifespan rather than stable traits. The 'presentation' represents the person's current symptomatology which may change over time: For example, in ADHD, inattentiveness may be relatively stable across development, but hyperactivity and impulsiveness often wane with age. Also, importantly, ASD is no longer an exclusion criterion, which is a fundamental change from DSM-IV and this, together with other comorbid conditions, should be noted. The advance preview of ICD-11 was published in June 2018, and this no longer refers to ADHD as hyperkinetic disorder. Other than that, it appears to be essentially similar to DSM-5.

### Is the right research being done to guide the development of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry's practice parameters? [^111s1Tkh]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) developed Practice Parameters (PPs) to provide recommendations regarding the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with mental health disorders. Each recommendation comes with a rating, based on the level of evidence. In descending order, recommendations are rated as a clinical standard (CS), clinical guideline, or clinical option (CO), as well as recommendations that are "not endorsed" due to ineffectiveness or contraindication. According to the PPs, a recommendation is rated as a CS if it is supported by "rigorous empirical evidence and/or overwhelming clinical consensus", whereas, the lower quality recommendations, rated as COs, are founded on "emerging empirical evidence (e.g. uncontrolled trials or case series/reports) or clinical opinion, but lack strong evidence and/or strong clinical consensus". Based on the current definition, clinicians may be perpetuating practices that are based on as little as expert opinion. We are aware that AACAP is in the process of transitioning from PPs to Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), which will embody a systematic approach to reconcile recommendations with national guidelines. In accordance with these higher standards, we believe that our evaluation of the research gaps will elucidate the need to encourage resource allocation in deficient areas.

### Diagnostic challenges in children and adolescents with psychotic disorders [^117QzxEH]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of psychotic disorders in children and adolescents is often complex and challenging. The symptomatic overlap between different psychotic conditions and other emotional, behavioral, and developmental disorders has led to high rates of misdiagnosis, especially at time of onset. The clinical expression and progression of diagnosable disorders are affected by maturational processes. Thus, psychotic illnesses in pediatric patients may vary from adult presentations because of developmental factors. Establishing a specific diagnosis is difficult when the differential diagnosis comprises disorders that share common symptoms and are frequently comorbid. The clinical assessment depends as much on input from parents and teachers as from the patients themselves, and there may be conflict between these different perceptions. This article reviews recent research and current concepts relating to diagnostic challenges in pediatric psychiatry.

### Autism spectrum disorder: primary care principles [^116E6WTF]. American Family Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by difficulty with social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interest, or activities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., created an umbrella diagnosis that includes several previously separate conditions: autistic disorder, Asperger syndrome, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening for autism spectrum disorder in children 18 to 30 months of age in whom the disorder is not suspected; however, there is a growing body of evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention based on applied behavior analysis improves cognitive ability, language, and adaptive skills. Therefore, early identification of autism spectrum disorder is important, and experts recommend the use of a validated screening tool at 18- and 24-month well-child visits. Medications can be used as adjunctive treatment for maladaptive behaviors and comorbid psychiatric conditions, but there is no single medical therapy that is effective for all symptoms of autism spectrum disorder. Prognosis is heavily affected by the severity of diagnosis and the presence of intellectual disability. Children with optimal outcomes receive earlier, more intensive behavioral interventions and less pharmacologic treatment.

### Overdiagnosis of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: a systematic scoping review [^111VX6MZ]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Evidence of expanding reservoirs attributed to the medicalization of behavior was found in 3 studies. Four of 5 phenotype change studies reported stable or declining ADHD symptoms in the population, making it unlikely that the expansion was associated with an actual increase in ADHD symptoms over time.,

Sixteen studies that investigated diagnostic inaccuracies as a reason for variation reported potential underdiagnosis because of false-negative diagnosis, and potential overdiagnosis because of false-positive diagnosis, often occurring simultaneously.,

Consistent Increases in ADHD Diagnosis Between 1989 and 2017

Of the 45 studies included to answer question 2, 30 studies estimated change in diagnostic prevalence of ADHD over time, with 27 documenting increased trends, and 3 observing a plateau in the early 2000s. Similar evidence came from studies that measured trends in annual diagnostic incidence, or lifetime diagnostic prevalence, with nearly all of these studies (96.0%) confirming continuously increasing ADHD diagnoses.

Many Additional Cases On the Milder End of the ADHD Spectrum

Twenty-five studies were included to answer question 3. Five studies reported that only a small proportion of all diagnosed youths displayed severe ADHD behaviors.,

Eleven studies used changes in impairment as a proxy for severity. Eight of these studies confirmed that impairment levels, adverse outcomes, and benefits of medication substantially decreased with the expansion of the group of diagnosed youths. Six studies that confirmed stable or declining ADHD behaviors in youths over several decades supported this finding. Correspondingly, 2 studies, on the relative age effect on ADHD diagnosis reported that the proportion of youngest children in class who received a diagnosis compared with older children had increased in more recent birth cohorts. In contrast, 3 studies, that reported time trends of parent- or clinician-perceived severity of the disorder showed larger relative increases in more severe cases (which could be associated with a growing tendency to report the same behaviors as more severe).

Evaluation and diagnostic criteria — Clinically significant anxiety must be distinguished from everyday worries and fears that are common and normative in specific developmental stages, and in DSM-5 mental disorders are defined as "a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning". By DSM convention, a mental disorder is diagnosed if all or a threshold of diagnostic criteria for the given disorder are met, and included in most diagnostic criteria sets is the requirement for a specific frequency and duration of symptoms as well as clinically significant distress and functional impairment, along with the caveat that alternative mental, medical, and substance-related explanations for the symptom presentation must have been ruled out before the diagnosis is applied.

Principle 4 — General medical conditions and/or their treatments should be considered in the etiology of a child's psychological and behavioral symptoms, and mental health clinicians should be aware that emotional and behavioral symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, aggression) may be direct manifestations of a physical illness and/or its treatment. It is not uncommon for psychiatric symptoms to be attributed to the "stress" associated with a chronic physical illness, particularly when there are other notable psychosocial issues, and generally, each child has both indirect and direct physical illness effects, with the clinician facing the challenge of determining the relative importance of each to the child's current symptomatology.

### Improving the efficacy and effectiveness of evidence-based psychosocial interventions for attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents [^111eaMRU]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Evidence-based treatments for ADHD - an Overview

Multiple groups, committees, and professional organizations have provided the field with recommendations for evidence-based treatment approaches for ADHD. There is clear consensus across these recommendations that pharmacological treatments, notably stimulant medication, psychosocial treatments, and a combination of these two approaches have the strongest evidence base. Table 1 provides a brief overview of the major conclusions of each guideline for the treatment of ADHD in children. It is clearly recommended that families should receive psychoeducation regarding ADHD, and that the evidence-based psychosocial treatments are behavioral parent training (BPT), behavioral interventions in classroom and peer settings, and organizational skills training.

Table 1
Review of practice parameters and treatment guidelines for ADHD.

There are inconsistencies among the guidelines that make broad statements of consensus difficult. For instance, there are differences in precision in recommendations for psychosocial treatments, with some very broad in scope compared to others with more precise recommendations regarding particular treatment types (e.g. BPT) and particular populations (e.g. children under six;). Broad suggestions of seeking "psychological" or "educational" treatment is unhelpful in some guidelines and practice parameters, as there are many approaches that fall under this category and some are clearly efficacious whereas other approaches commonly deployed do not have evidence of efficacy for ADHD. There are also differences in the strength of recommendations, with more contemporary guidelines emphasizing multimodal treatments more so than older guidelines. However, perhaps most notably, there is not clear consensus among the recommendations on the best sequence or combination of treatments for ADHD, even though this is a key question for most families pursuing treatment for ADHD. It is also important to note that most guidelines focus on proximal ADHD treatment – as ADHD is now conceptualized as a life-course persistent disorder, treatment efforts will need to be protracted across time and appropriate for evolving developmental levels.

### ADHD diagnosis and timing of medication initiation among children aged 3 to 5 years [^11528ddS]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, estimated to affect 10% of US children. ADHD is increasingly being diagnosed in children before they enter school. A national survey in 2022 found that 2.4% of children aged 3 to 5 years had a diagnosis of ADHD. Preschool-age children with symptoms of ADHD are at risk for social and emotional problems and academic failure. Recognizing the early onset of ADHD, the American Academy of Pediatrics subcommittee published updated evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for primary care management of ADHD in 2011and reaffirmed in 2019. These guidelines include a separate set of recommendations for management of ADHD and ADHD symptoms in preschool-age children (aged 4–5 years). The guidelines recommend that primary care pediatricians (PCPs) start with parent training in behavior management and then consider medication treatment with methylphenidate as a second-line treatment, given stronger evidence for behavioral intervention than for medications in this age group.

Most US children with ADHD first receive a diagnosis from and are treated by their PCP. However, to date, very few studies have assessed primary care management of ADHD in this young age group. Survey-based studies, have found variation across patient subgroups in parent-reported ADHD diagnosis and treatment rates in preschool-age children. Prior claims-based and electronic health record (EHR)–based studies, have assessed trends in prescription rates of stimulants in preschool-age children but did not assess the timing of treatment in relation to the initial diagnosis. Furthermore, information on variation in ADHD diagnosis and treatment across US health systems is limited, and evidence of sociodemographic disparities in diagnosis and treatment is mixed. To our knowledge, there are no large multisite studies that leveraged clinical data from EHRs to assess rates of PCP diagnosis and treatment of ADHD in preschool-age children, including adherence to practice guidelines, in the timing of medication treatment, and differences in clinical care across sociodemographic groups.

In this study, we assessed rates of ADHD identification and medication prescription and timing of medication treatment in children aged 3 to 5 years in primary care settings across 8 large US pediatric health systems. We also evaluated patient factors associated with the time from first diagnosis to prescription.

### Taurine supplementation in children with autism spectrum disorders: a study protocol for an exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^114XhmPx]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are the most common disabling neuro-developmental disorder. The main clinical features of ASD are social disorders, rigid behaviors, restrictive patterns of behaviors and interests. In recent years, the prevalence of ASD has been increasing year by year. According to the latest epidemiology survey in the United States, the prevalence of ASD is 1/44. Our previous multi-center epidemiological surveys reveal the prevalence of ASD in children aged 6–12 years in China is about 0.7%. And the lifetime medical and non-medical expenses of patients with ASD ranged from $1.4 million to $2.4 million. ASDs have become a major public health problem due to their high prevalence rate, disability rate and heavy disease burden, bringing huge economic and social burden to families and society.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^117CqHwF]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) epidemiology and comorbidity in children and adolescents — In a national survey, 8.4% of children 2 to 17 years of age currently had ADHD, representing 5.4 million children; among those with current ADHD, almost two-thirds were taking medication, approximately half had received behavioral treatment in the past year, and nearly one quarter had received neither type of treatment of ADHD. The median age of diagnosis was 7 years, with approximately one-third diagnosed before 6 years of age, and more than half were first diagnosed by a PCC, often a pediatrician. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive a diagnosis; as individuals with ADHD enter adolescence, their overt hyperactive and impulsive symptoms tend to decline, whereas their inattentive symptoms tend to persist. Learning and language problems are common comorbid conditions, the majority of both boys and girls meet diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder, boys are more likely to exhibit externalizing conditions like oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and girls with ADHD are more likely than boys to have a comorbid internalizing condition like anxiety or depression. Although there is a greater risk of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD for children who are the youngest in their class, for most children, retention is not beneficial.

### Twenty-year trends in diagnosed attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder among US children and adolescents, 1997–2016 [^113b6TF5]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common in US children and adolescents. It is important to understand the most recent prevalence of ADHD and its long-term trends over the past decades.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of diagnosed ADHD and 20-year trends from 1997 to 2016 among US children and adolescents using nationally representative data.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this population-based, cross-sectional survey study (National Health Interview Survey), surveys were conducted annually from 1997 to 2016. A total of 186 457 children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years from 1997 to 2016 were included in this analysis. Data were collected through in-person household interviews with a parent or guardian. The data analysis was performed in January 2018.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosed by a physician or other health care professional.

Results

Among the included 186 457 children and adolescents (96 017 boys [51.5%], 51 350 Hispanic [27.5%], 91 374 non-Hispanic white [49.0%], 28 808 non-Hispanic black [15.5%], 14 925 non-Hispanic other race [8.0%]), 14 704 children and adolescents (7.9%; 10 536 boys [71.7%], 2497 Hispanic [17.0%], 9010 non-Hispanic white [61.3%], 2328 non-Hispanic black [15.8%], and 869 non-Hispanic other race [5.9%]) were reported to have ever been diagnosed with ADHD. The weighted prevalence of diagnosed ADHD was 10.2% (95% CI, 9.6%-10.8%) in 2015–2016. There were significant sex and racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of diagnosed ADHD. The prevalence was 14.0% (95% CI, 13.1%-15.0%) in boys and 6.3% (95% CI, 5.6%-7.0%) in girls, 6.1% (95% CI, 5.2%-7.0%) in Hispanic individuals, 12.0% (95% CI, 11.1%-12.9%) in non-Hispanic white individuals, and 12.8% (95% CI, 11.0%-14.5%) in non-Hispanic black individuals. Over the 20-year period, the estimated prevalence of diagnosed ADHD in US children and adolescents increased from 6.1% in 1997–1998 to 10.2% in 2015–2016 (P for trend < .001). All subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income, and geographic regions showed a significant increase in the prevalence from 1997–1998 to 2015–2016.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study's findings suggest that among US children and adolescents, the estimated prevalence of diagnosed ADHD increased significantly between 1997–1998 and 2015–2016. This study suggests that additional research is needed to better understand the cause of this apparent rise in prevalence.

### Associations between multiple neurodevelopmental disorders and mental health in children [^117QbcLW]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2026). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study investigated the association between multiple NDDs and the prevalence and severity of current depression and anxiety among children aged 3–17 years.

Methods

We analyzed caregiver-reported data from 2016 to 2023 US National Survey of Children's Health. Children aged 3–17 years were included. We considered a broader spectrum of NDDs by including behavioral problems and grouped children based on the number of NDDs (out of ten): no multiple NDDs (none or one NDD), two NDDs, three NDDs, four NDDs, and five or more NDDs. Four mental health outcomes were measured: depression (yes/no), anxiety (yes/no), depression severity (mild/moderate/severe), and anxiety severity (mild/moderate/severe). Multinomial logistic regression models were used.

Results

Among 267,044 children (mean age = 10.2 years; male = 51.8%), 10.6% had multiple NDDs. The increasing number of co-occurring NDDs was associated with higher odds of prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety. Children with multiple NDDs were 4.7–5.3 times more likely to have depression and 5.8–12.9 times more likely to have anxiety compared with those without multiple NDDs. These positive associations remained consistent for mild or moderate depression (adjusted odds ratios [ORs]: 5.0–5.6) and for mild or moderate anxiety (adjusted ORs: 5.6–8.9). The associations were more pronounced for severe mental health conditions, with children being 7.8–16.9 times more likely to experience severe depression and 8.1–34.9 times more likely to experience severe anxiety.

Conclusions

The cumulative mental health burden associated with multiple NDDs emphasizes the need for integrated screening and tailored interventions to support this population.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents [^113SMVrN]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) guideline scope and updates — the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guideline addresses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in children from age 4 years to their 18th birthday. For this document, preschool-aged refers to children from age 4 years to the sixth birthday. Pediatricians and other primary care clinicians may continue to provide care after 18 years of age, but care beyond this age was not studied for this guideline. Since 2011 the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), was released; the new research and DSM-5 do not support dramatic changes, so this guideline includes only incremental updates and adds a key action statement about the diagnosis and treatment of coexisting or comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD.

### Psychosocial interventions in attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder: update [^114P8jXZ]. Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common reason for referral to child and adolescent psychiatry clinics. Although stimulant medications represent an evidence-based approach to managing ADHD, psychosocial interventions for child/adolescent ADHD target functional impairments as the intervention goal, and rely heavily on behavioral therapy techniques and operant conditioning principles. Evidence-based psychosocial interventions for managing pediatric ADHD include behavioral parent training, school-based interventions relying on behavioral modification, teaching skills, and operant conditioning principles, and intensive summer treatment programs. The use of conjoint psychosocial treatments with ADHD medications may enable lower doses of each form of treatment.

### Risk of developmental disorders in children born at 32 to 38 weeks' gestation: a meta-analysis [^112ugsAY]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 10
Bar chart showing pooled prevalence per 1000 children of developmental disorder by gestational group with 95% confidence intervals.

Visual or hearing impairment were slightly more prevalent in some of the groups born before full term. The relative risk of visual or hearing impairment compared with children born at term was increased in all gestational subgroups, although this only reached statistical significance in the 37 to 38 week gestation group (Supplemental Figs 15–18). There was a small increased risk and prevalence of sleep apnea but its prevalence is low compared with other disorders (Fig 10).

There is an association with reduced gestational age and increased risk and prevalence of all forms of social, emotional, and behavioral problems, except externalizing disorders. The most prevalent problem of this type is social problems (eg, showing empathy and playing with other children). There was a small increased risk and prevalence of ASD in the 34 to 36 week group. The only disorder found with neither an increased relative risk nor prevalence among the 32 to 36 week children was externalizing behaviors; this was based on 1 study, as shown in Table 3. There was no increased relative risk of executive function disorders (there is no prevalence estimation since it was reported as a continuous outcome).

TABLE 3
Summary Describing the Relative Risk and the Number of Studies and Participants Per Gestational Age Subgroup Per Outcome. Binary Outcomes Unless Specified

Among early term children, prevalence and relative risk of developmental disorder was increased for several disorders: CP, DCD, visual impairment, ADHD, global developmental delay, cognitive impairment, not school ready, low educational achievement, and special education needs (Table 2). There was no data for early term children for: sleep apnea, internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors, social problems, motor developmental delay, or cognitive developmental delay.

Sensitivity Analysis

When only the papers with a full term (39–40/41 weeks) comparison group were included, only 1 paper remained in each gestational subgroup for CP and global developmental delay. The overall interpretation was unchanged in all cases (Supplemental Figs 70–73).

### Underlying medical conditions associated with severe COVID-19 illness among children [^116pzFzn]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Among children with a COVID-19 diagnosis, what conditions are common, and which are associated with severe COVID-19 illness?

Findings

In this cross-sectional study of 43 465 patients aged 18 years or younger with COVID-19, more than one-quarter had 1 or more underlying condition; asthma, obesity, neurodevelopmental disorders, and certain mental health conditions were most common. Certain conditions as well as medical complexity were associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness.

Meaning

These findings expand the knowledge available regarding children with COVID-19 and could inform pediatric clinical practice and public health priorities, such as prevention and mitigation of COVID-19.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of depression across three age cohorts [^115SLbz2]. The American Psychologist (2022). High credibility.

APA guideline — child/adolescent depression and co-morbidity: A large proportion of children and adolescents with depression also meet criteria for comorbid psychiatric disorders, with the most common disorders including anxiety and behavioral (conduct and oppositional defiant) disorders, and youth with primary depression, compared with youth with primary anxiety, are more likely to have other comorbidities. Research over the past 10 years suggests that almost half of community youth with primary depression also meet criteria for anxiety disorders, while just under 20% of community youth with primary anxiety also meet criteria for a depressive disorder; additional comorbidities include substance use and abuse, sleep problems, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Reports note some sex differences in comorbidity patterns, but recent research points to fewer sex differences with greater depressive illness severity associated with likelihood of co-morbidity equally between boys and girls, and physical health conditions such as smoking, obesity, and drug use are also associated with depression and differ across races/ethnicities.

### Disordered eating in pediatric obesity [^1147ZZ5P]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Children and youth with overweight and obesity are at an increased risk for the development of an eating disorder. Previous research has shown that disordered eating behaviors are prevalent in this population. Screening for disordered eating behaviors in children and youth with overweight and obesity is necessary to determine the course of the treatment. In children and youth with obesity and comorbid disordered eating behaviors, treatment should be multidisciplinary and include psychological, medical, nutrition, and physical activity care.

### Beyond discrete classifications: a computational approach to the continuum of cognition and behavior in children [^112WTW4j]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric disorders are known to be much more complex than originating from a single cause or defective mechanism, urging clinicians to include environmental, lifestyle, and biological factors within the diagnosis process. However, the influence of environmental factors on psychopathology (e.g. psychiatric disorders) is not fully understood primarily due to the inability to capture the complexity of the symptoms' presentation. A plethora of studies have shown relationships between environmental factors, such as supportive social relations, the experience of discrimination, and general exposure to adversity, with global mental health/psychopathology. This is particularly important in the late childhood and early adolescence periods, which represent a critical developmental window for profiling later psychiatric risk. Those periods are characterized by major neurodevelopmental reorganizations, the emergence of higher-order cognitive abilities, and an increasing incidence of internalizing and externalizing symptomatology –. Therefore, it is not surprising that childhood and adolescence represent the onset of most psychiatric disorders. Those developmental trajectories are vulnerable to environmental factors, which can shape early patterns of risk, making them a crucial focus for advancing personalized approaches in pediatric psychiatry. Previous studies have supported these effects on developmental trajectories. Leveraging the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort, researchers found that familial and community factors, such as family income, marital status, and school environment, significantly predicted cognitive outcomes in preadolescents. In the same study, behavioral problems in pre-adolescents were mainly predicted by family conflict, severe financial difficulty, sleep problems, and maternal medical conditions. Additional studies in the same population highlighted an intrinsic relationship between the structure of cognitive abilities and behavioral manifestations, suggesting that worse cognitive abilities are associated with higher behavioral symptoms. However, those studies were performed in a single cohort, therefore not extending the generalizability of those results to different populations. As in many fields, generalizable results are hard to achieve and require collecting data from multiple independent populations. Modeling cognition and behavior while retaining the ability to compare and generalize results between populations is still an active open question in modern psychiatry, particularly considering the transition toward personalized medicine. This article tackles this challenge head-on and proposes to model cognition and behavior using fuzzy profiling, thereby embracing the continuum of cognition and behavior found in the general population.

### Twenty-year trends in diagnosed attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder among US children and adolescents, 1997–2016 [^113bMffR]. JAMA Network Open (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Among US children and adolescents aged 4 to 17 years, the estimated prevalence of diagnosed ADHD was 10.2% in 2015–2016, representing a significant increase in prevalence from 1997–1998. This continued upward trend in diagnosed ADHD among children and adolescents points to the need to better understand potentially modifiable environmental risk factors, as well as provide adequate resources for the diagnosis and treatment of affected individuals in the future.

### Behavior or conduct problems in children… [^116aUjy9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- It is not uncommon for children to sometimes argue, be aggressive, or act angry or defiant around adults and peers.
- A behavior disorder may be diagnosed when these disruptive behaviors are uncommon for the child's age at the time, persist over time, or are severe.
- Starting treatment early for behavior problems is important and is most effective if it fits the needs of the specific child and family. Overview Children sometimes argue, are aggressive, or act angry or defiant around adults and peers. A behavior disorder may be diagnosed when these disruptive behaviors are uncommon for the child's age at the time, persist over time, or are severe. Because disruptive behavior disorders involve acting out and showing unwanted behavior toward others, they are sometimes called externalizing disorders. There are two types of disruptive behavior disorders: Oppositional Defiant Disorder and Conduct Disorder.

Signs and symptoms Oppositional Defiant Disorder When children act out persistently, causing serious problems at home, in school, or with peers, they may be diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder.
- Children with ODD show these behaviors more often than other children their age, and their behavior has a negative impact with their daily functioning or relationships with adults or peers. Examples of ODD behaviors include:

- Often being angry or losing one's temper
- Often arguing with adults or refusing to comply with adults' rules or requests
- Often being resentful or spiteful
- Often deliberately annoying others or becoming annoyed with others
- Often blaming other people for one's own mistakes or misbehavior. Conduct Disorder Conduct Disorder is diagnosed when children show an ongoing pattern of aggression toward others and serious violations of rules and social norms at home, in school, and with peers.

These rule violations may involve breaking the law and result in arrest. Children with CD are more likely to get injured and may have difficulties getting along with peers. Although it can be diagnosed earlier, CD commonly develops in adolescence and can persist into late adolescence. Some children with ODD develop CD. Examples of CD behaviors include:

- Breaking serious rules, such as running away, staying out at night when told not to, or skipping school
- Aggression toward people and animals in a way that causes harm, such as bullying, fighting, or being cruel to animals
- Damaging other people's property on purpose or setting fires on purpose
- Stealing, lying, or breaking into houses or businesses.

### Other concerns and… [^112MBprG]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

At a glance
- ADHD often occurs with other disorders.
- Many children with ADHD have other disorders as well as ADHD, such as behavior or conduct problems, learning disorders, anxiety, and depression. Behavior or conduct problems Children occasionally act angry or defiant around adults or respond aggressively when they are upset. When these behaviors persist over time, or are severe, they can become a behavior disorder. Children with ADHD are more likely than other children to be diagnosed with a behavior disorder such as oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder When children act out persistently so that it causes serious problems at home, in school, or with peers, they may be diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. ODD is one of the most common disorders occurring with ADHD. ODD usually starts before 8 years of age but can also occur in adolescents.

Children with ODD may be most likely to act oppositional or defiant around people they know well, such as family members or a regular care provider. Children with ODD show these behaviors more often than other children their age. Examples of ODD behaviors include
- Often losing their temper
- Arguing with adults or refusing to comply with adults' rules or requests
- Often getting angry, being resentful, or wanting to hurt someone who they feel has hurt them or caused problems for them
- Deliberately annoying others; easily becoming annoyed with others
- Often blaming other people for their own mistakes or misbehavior. Anxiety and depression Anxiety Many children have fears and worries. However, when a child experiences so many fears and worries that they interfere with school, home, or play activities, it is an anxiety disorder. Children with ADHD are more likely than those without to develop an anxiety disorder.

Examples of anxiety disorders include Separation anxiety– being very afraid when they are away from family Social anxiety– being very afraid of school and other places where they may meet people General anxiety– being very worried about the future and about bad things happening to them. Examples of behaviors often seen when children are depressed include
- Feeling sad or hopeless a lot of the time
- Not wanting to do things that are fun
- Having a hard time focusing
- Feeling worthless or useless. Oral health Children with ADHD have increased risk of injury to the mouth and teeth, as well as cavities. Keep Reading: Oral Health Tips for Children.
