## Question

A hardware store sold 10 graphics cards, 14 hard drives, 8 CPUs, and 4 pairs of RAM in one week. The graphics cards cost $600 each, hard drives cost $80 each, CPUs cost $200 each, and RAM cost $60 for each pair. How much money did the store earn this week?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much money a hardware store earned in one week from selling graphics cards, hard drives, CPUs, and RAM, given the quantities sold and the unit prices. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the revenue contribution from each product category. Then, I should verify the arithmetic for each line item. Next, I will sum the subtotals to get the total revenue. Finally, I will double-check the final figure to ensure there are no calculation errors.

> Let me first confirm the revenue for graphics cards: 10 units at $600 each equals $6,000. Wait, let me verify that multiplication: 10 × 600 is indeed 6,000, so the graphics card revenue is $6,000 [^notfound].

> Next, I should review hard drives: 14 units at $80 each. I need to ensure I multiply correctly: 14 × 80 equals 1,120, so the hard drive revenue is $1,120 [^notfound].

> Now, CPUs: 8 units at $200 each. Hold on, I should verify: 8 × 200 is 1,600, so the CPU revenue is $1,600 [^notfound].

> For RAM, I initially thought "4 pairs at $60 per pair", which would be 4 × 60 = 240. Wait, let me verify the wording again; yes, it says $60 for each pair, so 4 pairs is 4 × 60 = 240, and the RAM revenue is $240 [^notfound].

> I will now examine the total revenue by summing the subtotals: $6,000 + $1,120 + $1,600 + $240. Let me double-check the addition: 6,000 + 1,120 is 7,120; 7,120 + 1,600 is 8,720; 8,720 + 240 is 8,960. So the total revenue for the week is $8,960 [^notfound].

---

The store earned **$8,960** this week. Here's the breakdown: graphics cards brought in $6,000 (10 × $600), hard drives $1,120 (14 × $80), CPUs $1,600 (8 × $200), and RAM $240 (4 × $60). Total revenue is $6,000 + $1,120 + $1,600 + $240 = **$8,960**.

---

## Calculation breakdown

| **Item** | **Quantity sold** | **Unit price** | **Total revenue** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Graphics cards | 10 | $600 | $6,000 |
| Hard drives | 14 | $80 | $1,120 |
| CPUs | 8 | $200 | $1,600 |
| RAM (pairs) | 4 | $60 | $240 |
| **Total** | ∅ | ∅ | **$8,960** |

---

The store's total earnings for the week are **$8,960**.

### The snm procedure guideline for general imaging 6.0 [^32c9988d]. SNMMI (2010). Medium credibility.

General imaging processing and display components—The processing system is a computer comprised of one or more central processing units (CPUs), computer memory (Random Access Memory-RAM), backup storage such as hard disk drives, and peripherals such as removable disk drives. The display is an important component of a medical imaging system and may be specifically designed for this purpose. Monitors typically display color, are large enough to display several images simultaneously, and important parameters include the display matrix size, number of display levels, number of overlays, number of lookup, and display tables. Hardcopy devices are becoming less common; important parameters include print size, print resolution (number of points per unit of surface, number of gray levels or colors per point), and print time. Labeling guidance states that the monitor or hardcopy display should include patient name, a patient identifier such as a medical record number, date, and type of study so that the displayed data can be uniquely identified, and that other information such as the phase of the study, view and institution may facilitate interpretation, particularly when viewed out of the nuclear medicine department or at another institution. An archive is described as a storage device for saving old studies that is normally provided. Networking is common; computers involved in processing nuclear medicine data may be linked in the form of a network called a Local Area Network (LAN).

### Sustainable IT budgeting: a method to determine not to exceed values for annual infrastructure purchases [^4a88103f]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2009). Low credibility.

Picture-archiving and communication systems are complex entities, but at core they consist of compute processors that are networked together to store and retrieve objects. Therein lay fundamental aspects of both performance benchmarking and predicting future costs, provided one can accurately predict trends in both exam volumes and sizes. Hence, determining the correct amount of capital to reserve annually for the information technology infrastructure can be a difficult process for the administrator of a medical center. Both exam volumes and sizes tend to increase over time. In addition, users demand more compute-intensive applications and expect exam delivery to the desktop to be ever timelier despite the increase in size. Against this, storage, compute, and networking costs tend to decrease over time for the same performance level. At the end of the day, the question of whether to budget more or less capital for next year's infrastructure is not trivial. This paper develops a methodology that uses current baseline data to predict the "ampleness" of a budget to meet future needs.

### Tracking PACS usage with open source tools [^5b408189]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

A typical choice faced by Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) administrators is deciding how many PACS workstations are needed and where they should be sited. Oftentimes, the social consequences of having too few are severe enough to encourage oversupply and underutilization. This is costly, at best in terms of hardware and electricity, and at worst (depending on the PACS licensing and support model) in capital costs and maintenance fees. The PACS administrator needs tools to asses accurately the use to which her fleet is being subjected, and thus make informed choices before buying more workstations. Lacking a vended solution for this challenge, we developed our own.

### Swarm learning for decentralized and confidential clinical machine learning [^db097d54]. Nature (2021). Excellent credibility.

Hardware architecture used for simulations

For all simulations provided in this project we used two HPE Apollo 6500 Gen 10 servers, each with four Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 v4 @ 2.20 GHz, a 3.2-terabyte hard disk drive, 256 GB RAM, eight Tesla P100 GPUs, a 1-GB network interface card for LAN access and an InfiniBand FDR for high speed interconnection and networked storage access. The Swarm network is created with a minimum of 3 up to a maximum of 32 training nodes, and each node is a docker container with access to GPU resources. Multiple experiments were run in parallel using this configuration.

Overall, we performed 16,694 analyses including 26 scenarios for AML, four scenarios for ALL, 13 scenarios for TB, one scenario for detection of atelectasis, effusion, and/or infiltration in chest X-rays, and 18 scenarios for COVID-19 (Supplementary Information). We performed 5–100 permutations per scenario and each permutation took approximately 30 min, which resulted in a total of 8,347 computer hours.

### Moving event detection from LiDAR point streams [^75d5c5c8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Time consumption and detection latency

We evaluated the computation efficiency of M-detector in terms of the time consumed by processing each frame (or point), including event detection, clustering and region growth, and depth image construction (Fig. 4 a). The evaluation was conducted on a desktop with a central processing unit (CPU) of Intel i7-10700 (2.90 GHz, 8 cores) and 48 GB random access memory (RAM). We further compared the computation time to LMNet on the same computation platform. Since LMNet involves neural networks which are best performed on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), we also ran it on a desktop with an Intel Xeon(R) Gold 6130 CPU (2.10 GHz, 16 cores), a RAM of 64 GB, and a single GeForce RTX 2080 Ti graphics card.

### The case for open computer programs [^0f6e8786]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Scientific communication relies on evidence that cannot be entirely included in publications, but the rise of computational science has added a new layer of inaccessibility. Although it is now accepted that data should be made available on request, the current regulations regarding the availability of software are inconsistent. We argue that, with some exceptions, anything less than the release of source programs is intolerable for results that depend on computation. The vagaries of hardware, software and natural language will always ensure that exact reproducibility remains uncertain, but withholding code increases the chances that efforts to reproduce results will fail.

### Estimating digital product trade through corporate revenue data [^bbcd2d47]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Optimal transport

We use optimal transport to match the corporate revenues to the estimated consumption patterns. We do this by assuming that a country’s consumption of a digital product is always assigned to the subsidiary (or parent) company that is nearest geographically and whose revenues are lower than the consumption. If the consumption is larger than the revenues of the subsidiary, then the excess volume is assigned to second geographically closest subsidiary that has revenues that are not assigned yet to another country.

Formally, letbe the revenue (in USD) of firm-digital sector pair p that originates from country o. Also, letbe the estimated consumption (in USD) of the same firm-digital sector p in destination country d. Using optimal transport, we can find the matrix, describing the revenue of p that is a result of consumption in d and is distributed to the revenues of o can be found as the solution that maximizes the following linear cost problemsubject to,and,for all o and d. In the cost function,are cost weights that are inversely proportional to the geographical distancebetween o and d, i.e. The constraints ensure normalization of the marginal distributions to the respective country revenue and consumption volumes.

Under this setup, we provide conservative estimates about the international trade of digital products that prioritize allocating revenues to domestic consumption.

Confidence intervals

For each estimated non-zero revenueof a firm-digital sector pair p that originates from country o and comes from destination, we create 95% confidence intervals for the upper and lower bounds for our estimates. We do this by estimating a linear regression model for each year separately, where the dependent variable is the log of the revenue (in USD) of the firm-digital sector pair in the destination country. We keep the model simple, and as explanatory variables we use only the total revenues of the firm-digital sector pair during the same year, and country origin and destination fixed effects. We estimate the model in two steps. In the first step, we use origin fixed effects for each potential origin country. Then, to reduce the standard error, we group each origin country with a statistically insignificant coefficient into a single category, and estimate the new model. We calculate the 95% confidence interval for the predicted values and normalize them so that the mean estimate matches the estimated revenue (in USD) of the firm-digital sector pair in the destination country.

### Comparison of voice-automated transcription and human transcription in generating pathology reports [^859c17d8]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Context

Software that can convert spoken words into written text has been available since the early 1980s. Early continuous speech systems were developed in 1994, with the latest commercially available editions having a claimed accuracy of up to 98% of speech recognition at natural speech rates.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of one commercially available voice-recognition software system with pathology vocabulary in generating pathology reports and to compare this with human transcription. To draw cost analysis conclusions regarding human versus computer-based transcription.

Design

Two hundred six routine pathology reports from the surgical pathology material handled at St Joseph's Healthcare, Hamilton, Ontario, were generated simultaneously using computer-based transcription and human transcription. The following hardware and software were used: a desktop 450-MHz Intel Pentium III processor with 192 MB of RAM, a speech-quality sound card (Sound Blaster), noise-canceling headset microphone, and IBM ViaVoice Pro version 8 with pathology vocabulary support (Voice Automated, Huntington Beach, Calif). The cost of the hardware and software used was approximately Can 2250 dollars.

Results

A total of 23 458 words were transcribed using both methods with a mean of 114 words per report. The mean accuracy rate was 93.6% (range, 87.4%-96%) using the computer software, compared to a mean accuracy of 99.6% (range, 99.4%-99.8%) for human transcription (P <.001). Time needed to edit documents by the primary evaluator (M.A.) using the computer was on average twice that needed for editing the documents produced by human transcriptionists (range, 1.4-3.5 times). The extra time needed to edit documents was 67 minutes per week (13 minutes per day).

Conclusions

Computer-based continuous speech-recognition systems in pathology can be successfully used in pathology practice even during the handling of gross pathology specimens. The relatively low accuracy rate of this voice-recognition software with resultant increased editing burden on pathologists may not encourage its application on a wide scale in pathology departments with sufficient human transcription services, despite significant potential financial savings. However, computer-based transcription represents an attractive and relatively inexpensive alternative to human transcription in departments where there is a shortage of transcription services, and will no doubt become more commonly used in pathology departments in the future.

### Digital pathology in tau research: a comparison of quPath and HALO [^f0912624]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Case selection

MFG and HPC slides stained for AT8 (Thermo Scientific #MN1020, 1:2000) were requested from 35 archival cases (total: 70 slides). They were selected to capture the full range of Braak stages and CERAD-NP scores; however, no cases with Braak stage V or a CERAD moderate score were available (Table 1). To fully encompass the spectrum of neuronal tau immunoreactivity, the final sample set was not limited to cases with “pure” AD and included samples across various tauopathies such as Pick disease, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, and primary age-related tauopathy (PART). Within this cohort, 11 cases had co-existing Lewy body pathology; 11 demonstrated co-existing pTDP43 pathology; and 19 showed co-existing vascular pathologies. Argyrophilic grains disease (AGD) and age-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) were reported in 1 and 4 cases, respectively. Six of the 7 cases presenting with glial tauopathies (the cases with frontotemporal lobe degeneration and the AGDs) were excluded to create the limited dataset. The seventh case was an AD with a limited area of ARTAG. Ultimately, the performances of these software were tested on the full dataset (n = 35 cases with a total of 70 slides) and a limited dataset (n = 29 cases with a total of 58 slides) that excluded all non-AD tauopathies except for PART. All WSIs were extracted using the “Extract Region” tool in Aperio ImageScope and saved to a local drive as.SVS files.

Demographics of case set.

Software and hardware specifications

QuPath v0.5.0 and HALO (trial version including HALO base software and AI) were installed on a computer powered by the Dell Precision 7865 Tower Workstation with 64 GB of RAM and a NVIDIA RTX A5500 graphics card with 24 GB of memory and 921 CUDA Cores. At the start of this study, the workstation housed a PM9A1 NVMe Samsung hard drive with 512 GB of storage space, but this was later upgraded to 2 WD_BLACK SN850X NVMe solid state drives with 2 TB of storage each.

Materials and methods

Participants

The study was conducted at the skills laboratory of the Department of Surgery of the University Medical Hospital Utrecht, The Netherlands. The 46 study participants were interns (mean age 24 years) of the department of surgery and schoolchildren (mean age 12.5 years) of the first year of a secondary school in Utrecht. The schoolchildren were at a secondary school preparing for A-levels of education in the Netherlands. This level of education is sufficient to apply for medical School. Participants were divided into four groups: 10 interns with videogame experience and 10 without videogame experience, 13 schoolchildren with videogame experience and 13 without. Videogame experience was defined as an average playing time of at least 10 h per week. All schoolchildren attended a 1-hour lecture on the meaning, usage, usefulness, and pitfalls of minimally invasive surgery.

None of the participants has had any previous experience with the virtual reality simulator. All the participants filled out a questionnaire on their nonsurgical dexterity skills and microsurgery experience.

Apparatus and tasks

The LapSim ® virtual reality simulator uses the Virtual Laparoscopic Interface (VLI) hardware (Immersion Inc. San Jose, CA), which includes a jig with two endoscopic handles. The VLI has an interface with a 2600 MHz hyperthreading processor Pentium IV computer running Windows XP and is equipped with 256 RAM, a GeForce graphics card, and an 18-inch TFT monitor.

The system features LapSim ® Basic Skills 2.5 software (Surgical Science Ltd, Göteburg, Sweden), from the LapSim ® Basic Skills package, consisting of eight tasks. All of the participants performed four of these basic endoscopic skill tasks. The instrument navigation task, the grasping task, the lifting and grasping task, and the clipping and cutting task, as described by van Dongen et al. were used for this study. They performed these four tasks twice and therefore a total of eight exercises were performed on the VR simulator. Assessment of skills was based on a total score of 16 parameters and was categorized to score efficiency, precision, and speed.

### Pragmatic considerations for fostering reproducible research in artificial intelligence [^63039cfb]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Is reproducibility as simple as just running the code?

Ideally, with the raw data and programming code, reproducing a study’s reported summaries should be as simple as “push the button”. For statistical models such as least-squares regression, results can be routinely reproduced. AI, however, is a careful balance of a rapidly evolving set of hardware and software. The data utilized often require significant pre-processing to move it from the raw data state to an analysis-ready state. Even with the data and algorithms available, specialized workstations utilizing the exact software and hardware (e.g. graphics processing units) may be required to reproduce the results. This is not a trivial expectation given the cost and availability of specialized high performance computing infrastructure. More troubling, however, is that having the analytical data, programming code, and the entire necessary computing environment may not be sufficient to exactly reproduce the estimation process. There is knowledge within the development community that small computational variances occur over a wide range of software and versions when using a graphics processing unit for high-performance computing. These variances are not eliminated by setting a starting number for random number generation as they are when software is not massively parallelized (i.e. run on a central processing unit). Simply put, it may not be possible to identically regenerate the model as it is with models that have closed-form solutions (i.e. “equations”). This realization is such that the raw data and programming code are not enough to overcome the reproducibility crisis facing AI research.It should be noted, however, that once the model has been estimated, deterministic and reproducible results are obtained from the final fitted model.

### Heart rythm society expert consensus statement on electrophysiology laboratory standards: process, protocols, equipment, personnel, and safety [^17084d6f]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Electrophysiology (EP) systems—hardware and software for EP procedures should at a minimum contain 12-lead surface ECG and 24 intracardiac electrogram channels, which is sufficient for the basic EP laboratory, whereas advanced laboratories performing complex ablation procedures require EP systems with 64–128–channel capabilities to simultaneously record signals and display hemodynamic data from arterial and/or left atrial pressure transducers. Useful features include a triggered sweep, template matching, and capability to save fluoroscopic images, with data displayed on color monitors that include both real-time and review screens. Storage capabilities with various hard disk capacities and digital media are often included; ideally, data should be stored in a central repository and be available to any workstation over the network. Integration and interfacing with RF-generating devices, fluoroscopy, mapping, and ablation systems are important, and systems should be capable of communicating with institutional information systems and electronic medical records.

### Limits on fundamental limits to computation [^98c96d2d]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

An indispensable part of our personal and working lives, computing has also become essential to industries and governments. Steady improvements in computer hardware have been supported by periodic doubling of transistor densities in integrated circuits over the past fifty years. Such Moore scaling now requires ever-increasing efforts, stimulating research in alternative hardware and stirring controversy. To help evaluate emerging technologies and increase our understanding of integrated-circuit scaling, here I review fundamental limits to computation in the areas of manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and algorithms. To outline what is achievable in principle and in practice, I recapitulate how some limits were circumvented, and compare loose and tight limits. Engineering difficulties encountered by emerging technologies may indicate yet unknown limits.

### The road to commercial success for neuromorphic technologies [^a8f23284]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Box 

Current approaches to commercial NM hardware. Current Neuromorphic hardware offerings span a wide range of approaches in terms of hardware architecture, training approach and application focus. Here we provide a survey of the main options for commercialisation of Neuromorphic compute hardware in early 2025. These divide roughly in two families—on one side are elements which we believe can be commercialised quickly and successfully. On the other side are elements we believe can eventually show a significant commercial advantage, but which still require some research lead time before they reach commercial production.

State architecture. These describe design choices for maintaining the internal state of the computational units. Architectures using digital binary state maintenance can leverage standard memory cell designs,,,, on advanced fabrication nodes, with the drawback of potentially low-resolution state, and additional energy expenditure in switching state. Analog state architectures attain high energy efficiency and storage density by storing state as continuous analog values on individual circuit nodes,, but with costs in terms of circuit complexity, device mismatch and reliance on older fabrication nodes.

Routing architecture. Choosing how computational units communicate within a Neuromorphic processor provides key constraints for IC design. Digital routing architectures can make highly efficient use of network resources, by power-cycling portions of parameter and state storage which are not needed for a given network,,,,. Crossbar routing architectures open the possibility of compute-in-memory implementations, but can be an inefficient use of resources unless precisely matched to network architecture size,.

Learning approach. The essential choice for application building is where and how to train an SNN application. Off-chip learning brings the benefit of simpler IC design, by avoiding silicon expenditure on learning circuits, which can double the silicon requirements for inference alone, in the case of gradient-based training methods,,. Off-chip learning also enables full flexibility on learning methods and compute devices used for learning. On-chip learning devices require no additional resources for training and fine-tuning an application on-device,. But learning circuits impose significant increases in silicon area—and therefore increased cost, energy use and complexity. At the same time, end-to-end training of a NM application on a consumer device hugely complicates the application building process, since the developer has much less control over the data used in training.

### Guidelines for the practice of telepsychology [^4fa5b56a]. The American Psychologist (2013). Medium credibility.

Guideline 4—data disposal—psychologists who provide telepsychology services are encouraged to make reasonable efforts to dispose of personally identifiable information (PII), including protected health information (PHI) data, and related technologies used to create, store, and transmit these data in an appropriate manner. Properly disposing of records in a manner that preserves patient/client/service recipient confidentiality and privacy requires awareness of appropriate methods for clearing, purging, or destroying PII and the technologies that interact with it, and psychologists are therefore encouraged to conduct an analysis of the potential risks for their specific practice requirements and formulate a plan for proper disposal of PII and the technologies that create, store, and transmit it. Psychologists are responsible for the maintenance and, when appropriate, disposal of all paper-based and electronic PII, including PHI, and, for example, the NIST Guidelines (NIST SP 800-88, 2014) offer guidance for effectively clearing, purging, and destroying data stored on electronic media devices; psychologists are encouraged to seek consultation from technology experts when needed. To foster proper digital disposal techniques, psychologists recognize the limitations of deleting information from a system, which can allow for recovery of such information later, and psychologists strive to securely dispose of software and hardware used in the provision of telepsychology services as well as the generation, storage, and transmission of PII in a manner that ensures the confidentiality and security of patient/client/service recipient information. Toward this end, psychologists seek to ensure that all PII data is removed from hardware (e.g., computer, mobile device, tablets, remote monitoring devices, fax machines, printers, peripheral storage devices such as external memory drives) before disposal of the hardware, and psychologists endeavor to remove all PII data and images stored in software.

### GOplan: an R package for animal breeding program design via integrating gene flow and Bayesian optimization methods [^728c9838]. G3 (2025). Medium credibility.

When using the Gene Flow method, genetic progress from 1 selection group is the cumulative sum of genetic merits from all selection seasons, rather than just 1 breeding season, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of breeding outcomes. Theoretically, the mean phenotype of the final crossbred population is the sum of the initial phenotype values and the accumulated genetic progress from all selection groups, assuming that the residual error mean is zero and no systematic effects are simulated:

where,;is the accumulated genetic progress of the i th trait; k is the total number of pathways; l is the total number of breeding seasons;is the pathway j 's genetic progress of the i th trait in season z ;is the vector of realization of trait i 's genetic progress;is the vector of gene frequencies in the age groups of all tiers and sex groups originating from the pathway j in season t ;is the aging matrix;is the replacement matrix of the j th pathway;is the gene transmission matrix; andis the vector that demonstrates the age of breeding stock in season t.

Calculation of economic profits

The economic profit was calculated using the predicted phenotypes, the number of animals, and the provided economic parameters. To ensure flexibility and adaptability to market fluctuations, costs were categorized into 6 areas: basic rearing cost per individual, maintenance costs for dams and sires, additional costs per breeding season, and phenotyping or genotyping costs per animal. Revenue was divided into 4 categories: income from production animals, revenue from culling breeding stock, and income from selling female and male breeding candidates.

For accurate profit predictions, users are required to input values for each cost and revenue component, along with the economic impact of a 1-unit trait improvement. There is no need to account for discounts, as profits are calculated separately for each season.

### The craniofacial anomalies archive at St. Louis children's hospital: 20 years of craniofacial imaging experience [^45dd38d5]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

This article describes how the Craniofacial Imaging Laboratory at the Cleft Palate and Craniofacial Deformities Institute, St. Louis Children's Hospital, Washington University Medical Center, has developed an electronic archive for the storage of computed tomography image digital data that is independent of scanner hardware and independent of units of storage media (i.e., floppy disks and optical disks). The archive represents one of the largest repositories of high-quality computed tomography data of children with craniofacial deformities in the world. Archiving reconstructed image data is essential for comparative imaging, surgical simulation, quantitative analysis, and use with solid model fabrication (e.g., stereolithography). One tertiary craniofacial center's experience in the establishment and maintenance of such an archive through three generations of storage technology is reported. The current archive is housed on an external 35-GB hard drive attached to a Windows-based desktop server. Data in the archive were categorized by specific demographics into groups of patients, number of scans, and diagnoses. The Craniofacial Imaging Laboratory archive currently contains computed tomography image digital data for 1827 individual scans. The earliest scan was done in 1980; the most recently stored scan for the purposes of this report occurred in May of 2000. The average number of scans archived per complete year was 94, with a range of 59 to 138. Of the 1827 total scans, 74 percent could be classified into specific diagnostic categories. The majority of the archive (55 percent) is composed of the following five diagnoses: sagittal synostosis (17 percent), unilateral coronal synostosis (11 percent), hemifacial microsomia (10 percent), plagiocephaly without synostosis (10 percent), and metopic synostosis (7 percent). Storage of computed tomography image data in a digital archive currently allows for continuous upgrading of image display and analysis and facilitates longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, both intramural and extramural. Internet access for clinical and research purposes is feasible, but contingent on protection of patient confidentiality. The future of digital imaging regarding craniofacial computed tomography scan storage and processing is also discussed.

### Building back better: applying lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic to expand critical information access [^920ac972]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic generated an unprecedented volume of evolving clinical guidelines that strained existing clinical information systems and necessitated rapid innovation in emergency departments (EDs).

Objectives

Our team aimed to harness new COVID-19-related reliance on digital clinical support tools to re-envision how all clinical guidelines are stored and accessed in our ED.

Methods

We used a design-thinking approach including empathizing, defining the problem, ideating, prototyping, and testing to develop a low-cost, homegrown clinical information hub: E*Drive. To measure impact, we compared web traffic on E*Drive to our legacy cloud-based folder system and conducted a survey of end-users using a validated health technology utilization instrument.

Results

Our final product, E*Drive, is a centralized clinical information hub storing everything from clinical guidelines to discharge resources. Clinical guidelines are standardized and housed within the high-traffic E*Drive platform to increase accessibility. Since launch, E*Drive has averaged 84 unique weekly users, compared with less than one weekly user on the legacy system. We surveyed 52 clinicians for a total response rate of 47%. Prior to the E*Drive rollout, 12.5% of ED clinicians felt confident accessing clinical information on the legacy system, whereas 76.6% of ED clinicians felt they could more easily access clinical information using E*Drive.

Conclusion

The COVID pandemic revealed vulnerabilities within our information dissemination system and presented an opportunity to improve clinical information delivery. Centralized web-based clinical information hubs designed around the clinician end-user experience can increase clinical guideline access in the ED.

### A stepped-wedge randomised controlled trial assessing the implementation, effectiveness and cost-consequences of the EDDIE + hospital avoidance program in 12 residential aged care homes: study protocol [^42982289]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Process evaluation

Process evaluation data will be collected using a series of templates based on i-PARIHS to guide the assessment of contextual barriers and enablers, conduct qualitative interviews with key stakeholders and undertake systematic implementation planning and record keeping.

Interview questions will focus on how the EDDIE+ program was introduced, any adaptations that were made, how staff responded, what changes in practice were implemented, and contextual factors that influenced implementation. Individuals from the following two stakeholder groups will be invited to voluntarily participate in a 30-min group or individual interview based on the i-PARIHS constructs: RAC home nursing staff and personal care workers; and, other RAC home stakeholders such as RAC home managers, EDDIE+ facilitators, Bolton Clarke executive management and health professionals who provide care to residents.

For each group, the participants will be purposively sampled to cover a representative cross section of stakeholder positions based on roles or interactions within the sites. Interviews will be conducted until thematic saturation has been reached, up to a maximum of 30 interviews for each stakeholder group across the 12 sites. Interviews will be conducted in the later stages of the implementation exposure phase up to 4 weeks post-trial.

Data management

All research data will be stored on computer hard disk drives. These computers are networked to a password protected file storage server. The server has an automated daily batch back up procedure of the entire hard disk drive of each computer. Data will be shared via a password protected file storage server at the university leading the research that only members of the university-based project and investigator team can access. Data will be retained for a minimum of 15 years. At the end of the study, final non-identifiable data sets will be deposited in a university Research Data Storage System. In line with publication embargoes and requirements, we will generate a document object identifier (DOI) for each non-identifiable data set and make these records publicly accessible.

Sample size calculation

A simulation-based statistical power calculation was performed for the primary outcome of total hospital bed days. The simulations used a stepped-wedge design of 12 sites of 100 residents per site with 1 site switched from baseline phase to intervention exposure phase each month as shown in Fig. 1. The study design was estimated to have a 91% power to detect a 41% reduction in total bed days from a baseline period total hospital bed days of 346 bed days per 100 residents per year. The power calculation was based on a 5% statistical significance level.

### Complementary feeding: a global network cluster randomized controlled trial [^a4c013b4]. BMC Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Data management

Data forms are completed using pen and paper. Completed data forms are collected and reviewed weekly by the field supervisor at each research site. Reviewed forms are keyed into a data management system developed by the DCC (RTI). Research sites store data in a stable and secure server, with redundant power supplies, dual network cards, redundant hard drives, and a semi-automated backup procedure to backup server data on a daily basis. Data are transferred from the field sites to the DCC at least once a week using an automated file transfer system. All database files are password protected, compressed, encrypted and signed with a unique digital certificate using public key cryptography before transmission, providing strong protection during transmission.

The DMS includes a variety of data validation, including range checks, data type checks and customized skip patterns. Multiple languages (e.g. English, Spanish, and French) are supported, allowing local data entry personnel to view and enter data in their native language. Data validation is performed both as data are entered and when each form is saved. Validation errors are recorded in a data table for later analysis. A running journal of all data entry is kept, allowing the system to be rolled-back to any given point in time.

The DMS includes reports to assist with project management that can be generated by the research sites. These include reports on complete and incomplete forms, missing forms, scheduled appointments, and errors. Like other parts of the system, all reports are available in the native language.

The DCC converts the databases from Microsoft Access into SAS for analysis. For each database, a SAS program is written which converts the Access database to SAS files, creates date and time variables, and assigns labels and formats to each variable. The SAS files are then stored on the project share in the appropriate protocol directory. These programs are run automatically each time RTI receives a data transmission.

### A multi-million mammography image dataset and population-based screening cohort for the training and evaluation of deep neural networks-the cohort of screen-aged women (CSAW) [^b6b0bb15]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Image Annotation

Once the images and data had been stored, we selected women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and retrieved their images from the time of diagnosis, if available, and from prior screening. For mammographically visible tumors, we used an in-house tool to free-hand annotate regions of interest (ROI) on a pixel level. We also annotated any tumor signs that we could identify in the prior, supposedly negative, screening mammogram. If there were no tumor signs in the prior mammogram, we identified the pixel coordinates of the corresponding location of where the tumor subsequently arose by comparing with the mammogram from time of diagnosis. Some of the mammograms had no visible tumor sign, and no annotation was made in those images. Images were assessed on a high-resolution diagnostic grade display. The in-house annotation tool was developed using the MATLAB software (MathWorks). Image annotation was limited to women diagnosed at the Karolinska University Hospital.

CSAW Case-Control Subset

Based on women attending screening at the Karolinska University Hospital, we have defined a separate case-control subset containing all data for all breast cancer cases and 10,000 randomly selected healthy controls. The purpose of the case-control subset is to make evaluation more efficient by not having to process an unnecessary amount of healthy controls while preserving the representability of the CSAW screening cohort in which it is nested. All images were acquired on Hologic mammography equipment. The subset includes the breast cancer cases for which the pixel-level annotations were made. Subset data were transferred and stored on local SSD hard drives on a separate evaluation workstation equipped with Ubuntu operating system, 20 cores, 32 GB RAM, Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1080 Ti graphics card, 256 GB SSD drive for operating system, and application use as well as an additional 10 TB external hard drive. Installed software includes TeamViewer, Docker, and Virtual Box. When external parties remotely access the evaluation workstation, the SSD image drives are temporarily detached to protect patient integrity and data safety. The system set-up is intended for evaluation purposes and would not be recommended for efficient training of deep neural networks.

### Philadelphia beverage tax and association with prices, purchasing, and individual-level substitution in a national pharmacy chain [^d575ccd3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Primary Analytic Models

We used generalized linear mixed models to analyze the association between tax implementation and change in mean weighted price per ounce of beverages. Our primary models included terms for store identification as a fixed effect, city, tax period, and the interaction of city by tax period (the DID estimate). Data were clustered at the SKU level and weighted by the pretax volume sold by SKU and store identification.

To analyze the association between the tax and subsequent change in mean volume of beverages purchased per card per transaction, we used cross-classified mixed models to account for imperfect nesting of loyalty cardholders and stores. Our primary models included terms for the city, tax period, the interaction of the city by tax period (DID estimate), and random intercepts for the store identification and loyalty card identification. To model relative percentage changes in volume purchased, we used generalized linear mixed models with a log link, and a negative binomial family as our outcomes were right skewed. We report percentage changes to allow for easier comparison between cities and to generate the price elasticity.

We used the Holm-Bonferroni method to adjust P values within families of outcomes (total taxed beverages [1 test], taxed beverage subcategories [8 tests], total nontaxed beverages [1 test], and nontaxed beverage subcategories [5 tests]). We ran 2 series of sensitivity analyses using Providence as the reference city, and including covariates for yearly quarters and percentage below the poverty line in a store’s zip code (as determined by the 2019 American Community Survey).In Providence, there were 2 440 806 week-by-store-by-SKU observations for the price-per-ounce analysis and 5 584 843 transactions from 275 335 unique card holders for the volume purchased analysis. Data were managed with Stata, version 17 (StataCorp LLC), and RStudio, version 4.2.3 (Posit PBC) was used for analysis. Two-sided P <.05 indicated statistical significance.

### Upcycling compact discs for flexible and stretchable bioelectronic applications [^6f60011c]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The disposal of electronic waste (e-waste) has become a concerning and growing waste stream driven by the short life cycle of electronics. In 2015, the United Nations established a blueprint for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The 12th SDG, “Responsible Consumption and Production”, seeks to address e-waste challenges by ensuring countries adopt a more responsible approach to the proliferating e-waste stream. Inefficient recycling processes are a global concern for e-waste management as they contribute to an increase in landfill waste and produce toxic pollution. Additionally, Stephan Sicars (Director of the Department of Environment UN Industrial Development Organization) described e-waste as “a serious threat to the environment and human health worldwide”. In 2019, the United Nations documented 1.7 kg per capita of e-waste recycled out of 7.3 kg per capita generated. To ensure the recycling of all e-waste by 2030 the recycling rate will need to be roughly ten times greater. To reduce landfill and pollution accumulation, a more sustainable method is required to manage the flow of e-waste. Currently, only ~15–20% of e-waste is recycled despite its valuable materials—iron, steel, copper, silver, and gold –. Whereas the remaining 80% of e-waste is not collected for recycling due to expense and lack of a global infrastructure –. Meanwhile, the toxic and hazardous components of e-waste—mercury, lead, and synthetic resins—threaten the environment and are left to degrade in landfills or incinerated –. Today, e-waste primarily consists of dated technologies which accounts for the ever-growing trail. Products from years past such as compact disks (CDs), old televisions, and computer monitors are the biggest contributors to e-waste. Since 1999, 9.02 billion CDs have shipped in the United States. In 2021, CD sales increased from the previous year by 1.1% to 40.6 million. However, these statistics do not consider global shipments and only account for music CDs excluding other types such as DVDs, software disks, and video games. Furthermore, the biomedical field utilizes CDs as a primary medium for medical images between both patients and providers. Thus, the global number of CDs produced and circulating globally are expected to be much larger and the end of the CD waste stream remains unclear. As societal dematerialization increases and we shift further towards electronic platforms, where will all these CDs be deposited? The life cycle and disposal of CDs is particularly concerning as they can depolymerize from polycarbonate into their toxic monomer, Bisphenol A (BPA). Over time, the steady release of BPAs, a possible xenoestrogen, may have negative health and environmental consequences,. As such, the exploration of e-waste source recycling and upcycling is imperative.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### Rapid crowdsourced innovation for COVID-19 response and economic growth [^98ced160]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) COVID-19 Challenge was launched in mid-March 2020 as a series of virtual hackathon events focused on addressing immediate needs with an eye towards rapid innovation from ideation to implementation and impact. These events built on an established methodology to achieve a number of goals: (1) contextualize an impactful problem to a specific real-life scenario, (2) convene cognitively, geographically, and socially diverse teams to tackle the problem, and (3) assemble an equally diverse set of domain and process expert mentors to provide accelerated customer discovery and subject matter expertize, and (4) optimize the design for accelerated development and implementation.

The MIT COVID-19 Challenge utilized the healthcare hackathon in a virtual, rather than in-person, event. The virtual platform multiplied the scale and reach beyond what would have been possible with traditional in-person events, by removing financial, time, and travel barriers. The largest in-person healthcare hackathons (such as MIT Hacking Medicine’s yearly Grand Hack) typically include approximately 400 participants and 100 mentors. By comparison, the “Beat the Pandemic” (BTP) hackathons (Round 1, April 3–5, 2020; Round 2, May 29–31 2020) and “Africa Takes on COVID-19” challenge (May 1–3, 2020) combined over 9000 applicants from 142 countries and 49 states (Fig. 1a, b, Table 1) for <1500 participant slots per event, and 1000+ mentor applications for ~250 mentor slots per event even in recruitment periods of less than 2 weeks. Applicants represented health, science, engineering, policy, design, business, finance, and regulatory disciplines (Table 2). Approximately 35.9% of applicants were from low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Each event facilitated the organic formation of approximately 200 teams spread across 10 tracks, each with challenges identified in conjunction with partners and stakeholders. An average of 70 partners were recruited for each event ranging from universities, hospitals, and health systems to incubators, accelerators, venture capital, technology companies, biotech, and pharmaceutical companies. Additional relevant stakeholders to the African continent included NGOs (e.g. Clinton Foundation, ONE Campaign, United National Development Program) and public health agencies (e.g. Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (CDC)).

Graphs are a standard tool for succinctly describing data, and play a crucial role supporting statistical analyses of that data. However, all too often, graphical display of data in submitted manuscripts is either inappropriate for the task at hand or poorly executed, requiring revision prior to publication. To assist authors, in this paper, we present several forms of graph, for data typically seen in Heart, including dot charts, violin plots, histograms and boxplots for quantitative data, and mosaic plots and bar charts for categorical data. Justification for using these specific plots is drawn from the literature on visual perception; we also provide software instruction and examples, using various popular packages.

### Demonstration of quantum-digital payments [^94c89a77]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Digital payments have replaced physical banknotes in many aspects of our daily lives. Similarly to banknotes, they should be easy to use, unique, tamper-resistant and untraceable, but additionally withstand digital attackers and data breaches. Current technology substitutes customers' sensitive data by randomized tokens, and secures the payment's uniqueness with a cryptographic function, called a cryptogram. However, computationally powerful attacks violate the security of these functions. Quantum technology comes with the potential to protect even against infinite computational power. Here, we show how quantum light can secure daily digital payments by generating inherently unforgeable quantum cryptograms. We implement the scheme over an urban optical fiber link, and show its robustness to noise and loss-dependent attacks. Unlike previously proposed protocols, our solution does not depend on long-term quantum storage or trusted agents and authenticated channels. It is practical with near-term technology and may herald an era of quantum-enabled security.

When holding the ratio of total preview strands to total full file strands constant at 100 (black line, current configuration), 10 (gray dashed line), or 5 copies (light-gray dashed-dot line), the physical density exponentially decreases as more of the file is stored in the Preview strands. b File Preview can cost-effectively find a file in a library. Cost to find a file is defined as the normalized cost to fully sequence an entire file within a library, e.g. sequencing a 15-file database costs 15 on the y axis. File preview can be used to quickly and cheaply find a file by sequencing a fewer total number of strands than is needed in a normally encoded library. Decreasing the percentage of each file stored in Preview strands further decreases the cost of finding a file. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.

### Physical and virtual carbon metabolism of global cities [^65eb0a6d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

The carbon stored in households as durable products (such as wooden furniture, textile, plastics, rubber, papers, and paperboard, but excluding fuels for cooking and driving) amounts to between 3 and 13% (or 0.2–0.8 t C/capita) of cities’ total carbon. Much of the difference in this household carbon results from the contribution of services reflecting the diverse demand levels and lifestyles between cities. Residents in cities like Moscow, Los Angeles, and Toronto store more carbon than people living in Delhi and Sao Paulo. This proportion of carbon is accumulated in durable goods purchased by urban households rather than immediately discarded or treated as waste. The difference is mainly in the speed of carbon released to the atmosphere depending on how long carbon is stored in households. In addition to household storage, a considerable part of physical carbon goes into industrial sectors and becomes part of the stock, which is between 5 and 12% of the total carbon balance (or 0.3–0.9 t C/capita). The construction sector makes a large contribution to stocks, and can be a huge component in rapidly expanding cities such as Beijing, Delhi, and Sao Paulo. Adding household storage and other urban stocks together, we find 8–24% (or 0.6–1.5 t C/capita) of the total carbon appropriated by cities is stored within the year of investigation, which is comparable to the carbon already emitted to the atmosphere for energy use in many cities investigated here. The carbon stored in the form of durable products, infrastructure, buildings, or production facilities can be emitted after a time delay, depending on the nature of the stock. This stored carbon in cities is found to be over two times of the global average per capita physical carbon stock (in wooden and petroleum products) estimated by Peters et al. Albeit with a different system boundary and research scale from their study, these results may indicate that lives and production in cities accumulate much more carbon than the rest of the global economy on a per capita level. Similar findings can also be found in energy and material flows concentrated in cities (e.g.).

### Nudging customers towards healthier food and beverage purchases in a real-life online supermarket: a multi-arm randomized controlled trial [^23d1a49e]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Table 1 
Total number of nudged and non-nudged products available in the online supermarket

The implementation feasibility was discussed with the supermarket chain, resulting in that 62% of all healthy products received the information nudges. For the position nudges, the supermarket chain indicated that a limited amount of food groups could be targeted as supermarket staff needed to manually enter the unhealthy-to-healthy swaps to the system. We decided to target the breads, bread substitutes, pasta and rice, nuts, and fats, for which comparable within-food group swaps were available (e.g. sugary peanuts to unsalted peanuts). Consequently, position nudges were implemented on 6% of all unhealthy products. Regarding the healthy check-out suggestions, four standardized products were selected, consisting of two buckets of snack-sized vegetables and two boxes of dried fruits.

Outcomes

The primary outcome on which study conclusions were based was the total percentage of healthy grams purchased, calculated based on the sum of healthy grams purchased relative to all grams purchased. We pre-determined a minimum of a 1% significant difference in the primary outcome as relevant difference, for two reasons. First, a small increase in overall healthier purchasing behaviors within individuals can have a substantial impact on healthier dietary behaviors when translated to population levels. Second, based on results seen in previous studies (e.g.) it is realistic to expect that environmental changes in a supermarket setting to yield modest shifts in purchasing behaviors. As a secondary outcome, we conducted exploratory analyses to examine which food groups drove the overall differences and whether nudging strategies had differential effects across food groups. Therefore, we provide insight in the total percentage of healthy purchases within food groups calculated by the sum of healthy grams purchased within a specific food group, relative to all grams purchased within that food group. Last, in exploratory analyses with the tertiary outcome, we investigate the total retailer revenue (Euros) as relevant business-related outcome.

### Rworkflows: automating reproducible practices for the R community [^b6e8397e]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Despite calls to improve reproducibility in research, achieving this goal remains elusive even within computational fields. Currently, >50% of R packages are distributed exclusively through GitHub. While the trend towards sharing open-source software has been revolutionary, GitHub does not have any default built-in checks for minimal coding standards or software usability. This makes it difficult to assess the current quality R packages, or to consistently use them over time and across platforms. While GitHub-native solutions are technically possible, they require considerable time and expertise for each developer to write, implement, and maintain. To address this, we develop rworkflows; a suite of tools to make robust continuous integration and deployment ( https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows ). rworkflows can be implemented by developers of all skill levels using a one-time R function call which has both sensible defaults and extensive options for customisation. Once implemented, any updates to the GitHub repository automatically trigger parallel workflows that install all software dependencies, run code checks, generate a dedicated documentation website, and deploy a publicly accessible containerised environment. By making the rworkflows suite free, automated, and simple to use, we aim to promote widespread adoption of reproducible practices across a continually growing R community.

### Graphics and statistics for cardiology: designing effective tables for presentation and publication [^69ab87cd]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Research is of little use if its results are not effectively communicated. Data visualised in tables (and graphs) are key components in any scientific report, but their design leaves much to be desired. This article focuses on table design, following two general principles: clear vision and clear understanding. Clear vision is achieved by maximising the signal to noise ratio. In a table, the signal is the data in the form of numbers, and the noise is the support structure necessary to interpret the numbers. Clear understanding is achieved when the story in the data is told effectively, through organisation of the data and use of text. These principles are illustrated by original and improved tables from recent publications. Two special cases are discussed separately: tables produced by the pharmaceutical industry (in clinical study reports and reports to data safety monitoring boards), and study flow diagrams as proposed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses initiatives.

### Exploiting redundancy in large materials datasets for efficient machine learning with less data [^85e41421]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In addition, examining and eliminating redundancy in existing datasets can improve training efficiency of ML models. Indeed, the large volume of data already presents significant challenges in developing ML models due to the increasingly strong demand for compute power and long training time. For example, over 16,000 GPU days were recently used for analyzing and developing models on the Open Catalyst datasets. Such training budgets are not available to most researchers, hence often limiting model development to smaller datasets or a portion of the available data. On the other hand, recent work on image classification has shown that a small subset of data can be sufficient to train a model with performance comparable to that obtained using the entire dataset,. It has been reported that aggressively filtering training data can even lead to modest performance improvements on natural language tasks, in contrast to the prevailing wisdom of “bigger is better” in this field. To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no investigation of the presence and degree of data redundancy in materials science. Revealing data redundancy can inform and motivate the community to create smaller benchmark datasets, hence significantly scaling down the training costs and facilitating model development and selection. This may be important in the future if data volume grows much faster than the available training budget, which is a likely scenario, as data volume is proportional to resources available to the entire community, while training budgets are confined to individual research groups.

### Graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications: the good, the bad, and how not to be the latter [^a3a1cb03]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Graphs, figures, and tables can save readers time and energy, aid their understanding of an article, and reduce the word count of the main text. However, many graphics submitted to and published in scientific journals fail to meet their potential and include mistakes that jeopardize their clarity. Many formats are available for presenting data, as well as a variety of techniques for enhancing interpretability. When the appropriate format is used to depict data, it conveys the greatest amount of information in the clearest fashion, complements the text, and deepens readers' understanding. The aims of this article are to draw attention to the necessity of well-constructed graphs, tables, and figures in scientific publications, and to show how to create them.

NumPy’s API and array protocols expose new arrays to the ecosystem.

In this example, NumPy’s ‘mean’ function is called on a Dask array. The call succeeds by dispatching to the appropriate library implementation (in this case, Dask) and results in a new Dask array. Compare this code to the example code in Fig. 1g.

These array protocols are now a key feature of NumPy, and are expected to only increase in importance. The NumPy developers—many of whom are authors of this Review—iteratively refine and add protocol designs to improve utility and simplify adoption.

### Effect of a prize-linked savings intervention on savings and healthy behaviors among men in Kenya: a randomized clinical trial [^b6d9d8c7]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Bank Account Registration

Participants were given a flyer containing key information about the bank accounts. Staff from the study and banking partner helped participants register with the Kenya Revenue Authority and open bank accounts. Once their accounts were open, participants’ accounts were endowed with 1000 Kenyan shillings (US $10). The endowment amount was determined by local investigators and study staff to be locally appropriate while also providing sufficient motivation to open a bank account and not unduly influencing study participation. Research assistants distributed information about how to make deposits and check account balances, and they ensured that there was at least 1 mobile agent in each study area affiliated with the partner bank to enable participants to make deposits without traveling to the main bank branch. Participants with accounts at other banks were eligible to enroll and open accounts with the study.

Intervention

Participants in the intervention group were eligible to receive rewards on a weekly basis if they saved any money in their account during that week. Weekly savings were defined as the increase in account balance from the previous week, net of any winnings or interest payments. Participants who saved any money (ie, >US $0) had a 20% chance of winning a small prize equivalent to 20% of their savings during that week. They also had a 2% chance of winning a large prize equivalent to 100% of their savings during that week. Prize levels were determined by local study staff and investigators. Lottery winners were selected at random by assigning a random number to eligible participants and allocating the large prize to the 2% smallest random numbers and allocating the small prize to the next 20%. The selection of prize winners was done by an investigator at the University of Pennsylvania (E.M.) each week using the runiform package in Stata (version 15; StataCorp LP). Prizes were deposited into participants’ accounts, and winners were notified by text message.

### Failure mode and effects analysis of the universal anaesthesia machine in two tertiary care hospitals in Sierra Leone [^6a6b64ff]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Data collection and analysis

Sessions were audio recorded, and the session facilitator mapped the group discussion graphically for analysis and commentary. Study team members annotated the commentary with word processing software and stored the information on the hard drive of a laptop computer used during the FMEA sessions. Photographs were taken of all visual artifacts and stored on the same laptop computer. These data sources were combined to summarize the common ideas that emerged across the FMEA sessions. This process consisted of grouping similar ideas across sessions to reduce redundancy in the presentation of results. In general, there was a high degree of consistency in barriers identified and in solutions generated. We note in the results when a specific barrier or solution surfaced in only one group.

### Digital medicine and the curse of dimensionality [^6dd6bdd5]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Considerations for mitigating the effects of the curse of dimensionality during model development

High-dimensional, complex application settings, combined with small sample sizes, create a perfect storm for blind spots. The gold standard for evaluating model performance is a prospective validation study that matches the model’s context of use after deployment. We posit that most of the published models trained in the high-dimensional, small data scenario are unlikely to fare well during validation.

While the problem is challenging, certain strategies can improve the likelihood of building a robust model. For the various blocks in the diagram in Fig. 1, we provide considerations for researchers during model development and deployment for successfully working with complex, high-dimensional models.
