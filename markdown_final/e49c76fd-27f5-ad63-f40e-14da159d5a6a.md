## Question

Decadron in Covid patients

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of Decadron (dexamethasone) in COVID-19 patients, including when to use it, how to dose it, when to avoid it, and how to integrate it with other therapies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical severity framework that dictates steroid use. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence for dexamethasone, especially RECOVERY and related trials. Next, I will review guideline positions from IDSA, WHO, and SCCM. After that, I need to check dosing, alternatives, and duration. I will then examine special populations and contraindications. Finally, I should integrate combination therapies and close with a practical, severity-based recommendation, making sure I double-check any conflicting data points along the way.

> Let me first confirm the severity framework because everything hinges on it. Severe COVID-19 is typically defined by hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen, while critical illness implies mechanical ventilation, ECMO, or multi-organ failure; mild-to-moderate disease lacks hypoxemia and does not warrant steroids, and this categorization is consistently used across IDSA, WHO, and SCCM guidance, so I should anchor to that schema to avoid misapplication of therapy [^7b4fcbf6] [^8d3554a2] [^5c0096aa].

> I will now examine the pivotal evidence. The RECOVERY trial randomized 6,425 hospitalized patients to dexamethasone 6 mg daily versus usual care and showed a mortality reduction that was greatest in those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and also present in those on oxygen, with no benefit in patients not requiring oxygen; this is the backbone of current recommendations, so I should confirm those subgroup effects before proceeding [^e4292a6a] [^054146f8]. Wait, let me verify the magnitude: yes, mortality was lower with dexamethasone overall, with the clearest signal in ventilated patients and a smaller but meaningful signal in those on oxygen, reinforcing a severity-dependent benefit [^054146f8].

> Next, I should review corroborating trials and meta-analyses. The CoDEX RCT in moderate-to-severe ARDS showed more ventilator-free days with dexamethasone, supporting an anti-inflammatory benefit in the critical phenotype, and a prospective meta-analysis of seven RCTs confirmed reduced short-term mortality with systemic glucocorticoids in severe and critical COVID-19, which strengthens the external validity of RECOVERY's findings [^b56353ed] [^054146f8]. Hold on, I should verify that these analyses align with guideline synthesis; IDSA's meta-analytic summary reports a 28-day mortality reduction with glucocorticoids in critical illness, consistent with this body of evidence [^9e930efc].

> Now, I need to translate evidence into guidelines. IDSA gives a strong recommendation for dexamethasone in critical illness and a conditional recommendation in severe, non-critical illness, reflecting moderate certainty of evidence and the need to individualize in the latter group; WHO issues a strong recommendation for systemic corticosteroids in severe and critical COVID-19; and SCCM similarly recommends systemic corticosteroids in severe or critical disease, with dexamethasone as the preferred agent, which aligns with the mortality data and practical considerations [^84bec8ba] [^00b3277b] [^8d3554a2] [^5c0096aa]. I should double-check that these are concordant across updates; yes, these positions are stable in living guidelines and society updates [^8d3554a2] [^5c0096aa].

> Let me think about dosing and duration, and I should confirm equivalence. The standard regimen is dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO daily for up to 10 days or until discharge; if dexamethasone is unavailable, methylprednisolone 32 mg daily or prednisone 40 mg daily are acceptable alternatives, with total treatment duration typically 10 days or shorter if the patient improves and is discharged earlier, which balances efficacy and safety [^0f51d34a] [^ab9da5f9]. Wait, I initially thought higher doses might be better in critical illness; hold on, I should verify that. The COVID STEROID 2 trial tested 12 mg versus 6 mg and did not show superiority of the higher dose, so 6 mg daily remains standard unless there is a compelling individualized rationale, and I should correct that assumption accordingly [^8f63f7be].

> I need to ensure I address when not to use steroids. For non-severe COVID-19, guidelines recommend against systemic corticosteroids due to lack of benefit and potential harms, including delayed viral clearance and adverse effects; RECOVERY actually suggested a trend toward worse outcomes in non-hypoxemic patients, so I should avoid steroids in mild-to-moderate disease absent another indication [^bc4b6f9b] [^85b2bf1d]. But wait, what if the patient is deteriorating? If a patient with initially mild disease progresses to hypoxemia, then the indication changes and steroids should be started at that point, which is consistent with the severity-based framework [^7b4fcbf6].

> Next, I should review special populations and contraindications. Children were not well represented in RCTs, yet pediatric guidance extrapolates adult recommendations and supports dexamethasone in hospitalized children with severe or critical illness, with attention to growth and infection risks; in pregnancy, benefits generally outweigh risks in severe disease, and standard dosing is used; in immunocompromised hosts, steroids remain indicated for severe/critical COVID-19, though vigilance for secondary infections is essential; and in patients with diabetes or other steroid-sensitive comorbidities, I should monitor closely and optimize glycemic control while recognizing that the mortality benefit still applies in severe disease [^28c87e1e] [^0f51d34a]. I should confirm that no major society deviates from this approach; IDSA and WHO endorse steroids in severe/critical disease across these subgroups with appropriate monitoring, which supports proceeding when indicated [^7b4fcbf6] [^8d3554a2].

> I will now examine integration with other therapies, and I need to be careful not to overstate combinations. In severe and critical illness, steroids are foundational; add-on immunomodulators such as tocilizumab or sarilumab are conditionally recommended when inflammatory markers are elevated and progression is evident, and baricitinib is suggested in severe disease, with particular benefit seen in patients on high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation; remdesivir is reasonable in severe, non-critical disease but is not recommended once mechanical ventilation is required, and I should avoid stacking multiple immunomodulators without a clear indication [^5335878b] [^392777aa] [^d70deb9c] [^3cd5fe0b]. Hold on, I should verify that these combinations are supported by RCTs; yes, RECOVERY and other trials informed IL-6 blockade, and ACTT-2 informed baricitinib, while remdesivir's benefit wanes in critical illness, which is why it is generally omitted in ventilated patients [^92023014] [^4ccc7585].

> Let me reconsider any lingering uncertainties. Timing matters: observational data suggest early initiation of dexamethasone after admission or oxygen escalation associates with improved outcomes, but I should not jump to conclusions from observational designs; nonetheless, this complements the biological rationale that steroids are most beneficial when hyperinflammation predominates, reinforcing prompt initiation once hypoxemia develops [^c32912d7]. I should also confirm that routine continuation of dexamethasone after discharge is not beneficial; indeed, a cohort study showed no reduction in 14-day readmission or mortality with post-discharge steroids, so I should avoid extending steroids beyond the inpatient course unless there is a separate indication [^993a9e18].

> Putting this together, my practical, severity-based approach is as follows: for severe COVID-19 with hypoxemia requiring oxygen, I should start dexamethasone 6 mg daily IV or PO for up to 10 days or until discharge, and consider adding remdesivir if within the window and not mechanically ventilated; for critical illness with mechanical ventilation or ECMO, I should give dexamethasone and add tocilizumab or baricitinib if inflammatory markers are elevated and progression is ongoing; for mild-to-moderate disease without hypoxemia, I should avoid systemic steroids and focus on supportive care and guideline-directed outpatient therapies; throughout, I will monitor for hyperglycemia, infections, and other steroid adverse effects and adjust as needed [^0f51d34a] [^d70deb9c] [^85b2bf1d]. I should double-check that this aligns with current living guidance; yes, IDSA and WHO endorse this severity-stratified, steroid-centered approach with selective add-on immunomodulation, which is the most evidence-consistent strategy to date [^7b4fcbf6] [^8d3554a2].

---

Dexamethasone is indicated for **severe and critical COVID-19** (requiring supplemental oxygen, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO) [^8d3554a2] because it reduces mortality and accelerates recovery [^054146f8] [^39f62032]. It is **not recommended for mild or moderate COVID-19** without hypoxemia, as it does not improve outcomes and may cause harm [^85b2bf1d] [^bc4b6f9b]. The standard dose is 6 mg IV or PO daily for up to 10 days or until discharge; higher doses (12 mg) are not superior and are not recommended [^8f63f7be]. Use with caution in patients with diabetes, immunosuppression, or active infections, and monitor for hyperglycemia, secondary infections, and psychiatric effects.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dexamethasone use

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrate **significant benefits** of dexamethasone in severe and critical COVID-19:

- **RECOVERY trial**: Reduced 28-day mortality in patients requiring oxygen or mechanical ventilation; no benefit in those not requiring oxygen [^054146f8].
- **CoDEX trial**: Increased ventilator-free days and reduced mortality in moderate-to-severe ARDS [^b56353ed].
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistent mortality reduction in severe and critical COVID-19 [^054146f8] [^9e930efc].

---

## Recommended indications and dosing

Current guidelines from IDSA, WHO, and SCCM provide clear recommendations on **dexamethasone use**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** | **Dose and duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Severe COVID-19 (supplemental oxygen, high-flow oxygen, or non-invasive ventilation) | Strong recommendation | Dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO daily for up to 10 days or until discharge [^0f51d34a] [^8d3554a2] |
| Critical COVID-19 (mechanical ventilation or ECMO) | Strong recommendation | Dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO daily for up to 10 days or until discharge [^0f51d34a] [^8d3554a2] |
| Mild or moderate COVID-19 without hypoxemia | Not recommended | Avoid dexamethasone [^85b2bf1d] [^bc4b6f9b] |

---

Higher doses (e.g. 12 mg daily) have been studied but **do not show superiority** over 6 mg daily and are not recommended [^8f63f7be].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

Dexamethasone use in severe and critical COVID-19 is associated with:

- **Reduced mortality**: Approximately 20–30% relative risk reduction [^054146f8] [^39f62032].
- **Shorter duration of mechanical ventilation**: Increased ventilator-free days [^b56353ed].
- **Faster clinical recovery**: Reduced time to clinical improvement [^39f62032].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

While dexamethasone is generally well tolerated, **clinicians should be aware of the following risks**:

- **Hyperglycemia**: Common, especially in patients with diabetes.
- **Secondary infections**: Increased risk of bacterial and fungal infections.
- **Psychiatric effects**: Anxiety, insomnia, and mood disturbances.
- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Peptic ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding.

---

## Special populations and considerations

Certain populations require **careful consideration** when using dexamethasone:

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Close monitoring of blood glucose is essential.
- **Immunosuppressed patients**: Increased risk of infections; weigh risks and benefits.
- **Pregnancy**: Generally considered safe, but discuss risks and benefits with the patient.
- **Pediatric patients**: Limited data; use cautiously and monitor closely [^28c87e1e].

---

## Comparison with other corticosteroids

Dexamethasone is the **preferred corticosteroid** due to its long half-life, minimal mineralocorticoid activity, and strong evidence base. Alternatives such as methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone have been studied, but dexamethasone remains first-line [^0f51d34a] [^8d3554a2].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines consistently **recommend dexamethasone** for severe and critical COVID-19, while advising against its use in mild or moderate cases without hypoxemia [^7b4fcbf6] [^85b2bf1d]. The evidence base is robust, and dexamethasone has become a cornerstone of COVID-19 management in hospitalized patients requiring oxygen support [^054146f8].

---

Dexamethasone is **effective in reducing mortality and improving outcomes** in severe and critical COVID-19 but is not recommended for mild or moderate cases without hypoxemia. Clinicians should adhere to guideline-recommended dosing and monitor for adverse effects, especially in vulnerable populations.

Widespread vaccination, hybrid immunity, and reduced pathogenicity with circulating Omicron variants have decreased the rate of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes in the general population. Certain patients with COVID-19 remain at high risk for severe outcomes. Clinicians must individualize treatments based on expected benefits and relative harms for patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19. Guideline-directed therapy for severe and critical COVID-19 has remained static over the last couple of years. Data on immunomodulatory agents have improved our understanding of the management of severe and critical COVID-19, yet uncertainty remains on the role and timing of these agents in the Omicron era.

There are many pharmacologic therapies that are being used or considered for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with rapidly changing efficacy and safety evidence from trials. The objective was to develop evidence-based, rapid, living guidelines intended to support patients, clinicians, and other healthcare professionals in their decisions about treatment and management of patients with COVID-19. In March 2020, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel of infectious disease clinicians, pharmacists, and methodologists with varied areas of expertise to regularly review the evidence and make recommendations about the treatment and management of persons with COVID-19. The process used a living guideline approach and followed a rapid recommendation development checklist. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes. A systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature was conducted at regular intervals. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make recommendations. Based on the most recent search conducted on 31 May 2022, the IDSA guideline panel has made 32 recommendations for the treatment and management of the following groups/populations: pre- and postexposure prophylaxis, ambulatory with mild-to-moderate disease, and hospitalized with mild-to-moderate, severe but not critical, and critical disease. As these are living guidelines, the most recent recommendations can be found online at: https://idsociety.org/COVID19guidelines. At the inception of its work, the panel has expressed the overarching goal that patients be recruited into ongoing trials. Since then, many trials were conducted that provided much-needed evidence for COVID-19 therapies. There still remain many unanswered questions as the pandemic evolved, which we hope future trials can answer.

As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, the intensive care unit (ICU) community must prepare for the challenges associated with this pandemic. Streamlining of workflows for rapid diagnosis and isolation, clinical management, and infection prevention will matter not only to patients with COVID-19, but also to health-care workers and other patients who are at risk from nosocomial transmission. Management of acute respiratory failure and haemodynamics is key. ICU practitioners, hospital administrators, governments, and policy makers must prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity, with a focus not just on infrastructure and supplies, but also on staff management. Critical care triage to allow the rationing of scarce ICU resources might be needed. Researchers must address unanswered questions, including the role of repurposed and experimental therapies. Collaboration at the local, regional, national, and international level offers the best chance of survival for the critically ill.

### National Institutes of Health COVID-19 treatment guidelines panel: perspectives and lessons learned [^3c3d7281]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Description

In March 2020, the White House Coronavirus Task Force determined that clinicians in the United States needed expert treatment guidelines to optimally manage patients with COVID-19, a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a new pathogen for which no specific treatments were known to be effective.

Methods

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services requested that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) take the lead in expeditiously convening a panel of experts to create "living" guidelines that would be widely accessible and capable of frequent updating as important new information became available.

Recommendations

The purpose of this article is to expand on the experiences of the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) over the past 4 years, summarize the Panel's final recommendations for COVID-19, highlight some challenges and unanswered questions about COVID-19 management, and inform future responses to public health emergencies. The Panel was formed in March 2020, and the first iteration of the guidelines was released in April 2020. Now that the public health emergency has ended, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines have sunsetted. This role will now fall to professional societies and organizations, such as the American College of Physicians, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the World Health Organization, all of which have been active in this area.

### Pharmacologic treatment and management of coronavirus disease 2019 [^8c21006d]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Over the last 2 years, there has been gradual and sustained progress toward our understanding of pharmacotherapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a result of large- and small-scale randomized controlled trials. Numerous new and repurposed treatments have been evaluated; some have demonstrated benefit in clinically important outcomes like mortality and hospitalization, and optimism for oral antiviral treatments is growing. Given the rapidly evolving landscape of COVID-19 treatments, frontline clinicians should use treatment and management guidelines to guide their approach to each patient, with the individual's severity and location of illness in mind to appreciate the nuances in clinical evidence.

Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) COVID-19 guideline—Inhaled corticosteroids in ambulatory mild-to-moderate disease: Among ambulatory patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, the panel suggests against inhaled corticosteroids (Conditional recommendation††, Moderate certainty of evidence). The remark specifies that patients who are on inhaled corticosteroids for other indications may continue them. The panel explains that the undesirable effects outweigh the desirable effects, though uncertainty still exists. Background context notes that systemic corticosteroids have become a mainstay of therapy for severe COVID-19 and that some corticosteroids, including ciclesonide, have shown in vitro coronavirus replication inhibition.

### Effect of dexamethasone on days alive and ventilator-free in patients with moderate or severe acute (...) [^b56353ed]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04327401 Three months after the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 1 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic. 2 Estimates have suggested that up to 12% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 have required invasive mechanical ventilation, 3, 4 with the majority developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. 5 Diffuse alveolar damage with hyaline membranes, 6 hallmarks of ARDS, have been found on pulmonary histological examination of patients with COVID-19. The COVID-19 Dexamethasone randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous dexamethasone in patients with moderate to severe ARDS due to COVID-19. The hypothesis was that dexamethasone would increase the number of days alive and free from mechanical ventilation during the first 28 days.

On June 25, 2020, the DSMC discussed the implications of the results of the dexamethasone group in the RECOVERY trial, 15 stating that given the study results, 15 it was no longer ethical to continue the trial, which led to the recommendation to stop the trial. This recommendation was accepted by the CoDEX Steering Committee on June 25, 2020. The main results remained statistically significant among patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the dexamethasone group, which had a mean number of ventilator-free days of
6. 8 among 144 patients vs 3. 9 among 142 patients in the standard care group for a difference of 2.
7.

In this randomized clinical trial involving 299 adults with moderate or severe ARDS due to COVID-19, dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone significantly increased the number of days alive and free of mechanical ventilation during the first 28 days. Dexamethasone was not associated with increased risk of adverse events in this population of critically ill COVID-19 patients. 15.

Corticosteroids rationale and ARDS evidence—early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, recommendations cautioned against systemic corticosteroids due to risk of worsening clinical status, delayed viral clearance, and adverse events, yet given the hyper-inflammatory state in COVID-19, immunomodulatory approaches including steroids continue to be evaluated to address ARDS and systemic inflammation; notably, a recent multicenter RCT in moderate to severe ARDS demonstrated a reduced number of ventilatory days and reduction in mortality with use of a 10-day regimen of dexamethasone.

### The role of antirheumatics in patients with COVID-19 [^f9e44f11]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 2 million deaths globally. Two interconnected stages of disease are generally recognised; an initial viral stage and a subsequent immune response phase with the clinical characteristics of hyperinflammation associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Therefore, many immune modulators and immunosuppressive drugs, which are widely used in rheumatological practice, have been proposed as treatments for patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. In this Review, we provide an overview of what is currently known about the efficacy and safety of antirheumatic therapies for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Dexamethasone has been shown to reduce COVID-19 related mortality, interleukin-6 inhibitors to reduce risk of cardiovascular or respiratory organ support, and baricitinib to reduce time to recovery in hospitalised patients requiring oxygen support. Further studies are needed to identify whether there is any role for glucocorticoids in patients with less severe COVID-19. Although evidence on the use of other antirheumatic drugs has suggested some benefits, results from adequately powered clinical trials are urgently needed. The heterogeneity in dosing and the absence of uniform inclusion criteria and defined stage of disease studied in many clinical trials have affected the conclusions and comparability of trial results. However, after the success of dexamethasone in proving the anti-inflammatory hypothesis, the next 12 months will undoubtedly bring further clarity about the clinical utility and optimal dose and timing of other anti-rheumatic drugs in the management of COVID-19.

### Role of corticosteroid in the management of COVID-19: a systemic review and a clinician's perspective [^220c6193]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Interest in corticosteroid therapy in COVID-19 has been rekindled after the results from Randomized Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY (RECOVERY) Trial. However, the World health Organization has not recommended corticosteroid in the treatment of COVID-19. We sought to conduct a systematic review on the role of corticosteroid in the management of patients of COVID-19.

Methods

A systematic electronic search of PubMed, Cochrane and MedRxiv database using specific keywords was made up till June 17, 2020. Full text of all the original articles with supplementary appendix that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were retrieved and a detailed analysis of results were represented.

Results

Of the 5 studies (4 retrospective studies and 1 quasi-prospective study) conducted for evaluating the role of corticosteroids, 3 studies have shown benefit, while 2 studies shown no benefit and there was a suggestion of significant harm in critical cases in one sub-study. RECOVERY trial is the only randomized controlled trial that has shown a significant reduction of death by 35% in ventilated patients and by 20% amongst patients on supplemental oxygen therapy with the dexamethasone, although no benefit was observed in mild cases.

Conclusions

While the results from retrospective studies are heterogenous and difficult to infer of a definitive protective benefit with corticosteroids, RECOVERY trial found a significantly better outcome with dexamethasone, mostly in severe cases. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to replicate the outcome shown in RECOVERY trial for a substantial conclusion.

Scenario 1—mild features of COVID-19: For an outpatient or telehealth presentation with mild respiratory features, any pretest probability, and no significant critical resource constraints, initial management when testing is unavailable is pretest-probability–based, and imaging use is conditional. “Patients with moderate-to-high pretest probability should be initially managed as if COVID-19 testing is positive,” while “patients with low pretest probability should be initially managed as if COVID-19 testing is negative.” Imaging “is advised for patients with risk factors for COVID-19 progression and either positive COVID-19 testing or moderate-to-high pretest probability in the absence of testing,” and “is not advised … for patients with mild features who are COVID-19 positive” without such risk factors or “for patients with mild features who are COVID-19 negative.” Imaging “is advised for patients with mild features who subsequently develop clinical worsening.”

COVID-19 ivermectin efficacy—treatment with ivermectin failed to demonstrate a beneficial or detrimental effect on hospitalization or viral clearance at day seven, and the evidence regarding time to recovery among ambulatory persons is very uncertain while one trial did not show a reduction. Treatment with ivermectin failed to demonstrate a beneficial or detrimental effect on hospitalization or viral clearance at day seven (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.71, 1.11, moderate CoE, and RR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.31; very low CoE, respectively). The evidence is very uncertain due to the inclusion of one study without appropriate randomization, but ivermectin may reduce the time to recovery among ambulatory persons with COVID-19 (mean difference: 2.99 days fewer; 95% CI: 4.76 to 1.22 days fewer; very low CoE). However, the ACTIV-6 trial did not show a reduction in time to recovery with a hazard ratio: 1.09 (0.98, 1.22).

Dexamethasone Treatment for Patients With ARDS Caused by COVID-19; REMAP-CAP, Randomized, Embedded, Multifactorial Adaptive Platform Trial for Community-Acquired Pneumonia; Steroids-SARI, Glucocorticoid Therapy for COVID-19 Critically Ill Patients With Severe Acute Respiratory Failure. The Steroids-SARI trial recorded adverse events but did not categorize them as serious or nonserious. Importance Effective therapies for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 are needed, and clinical trial data have demonstrated that low-dose dexamethasone reduced mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who required respiratory support. Objective To estimate the association between administration of corticosteroids compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality.

While this initiative was in development, the UK-based Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy trial reported its findings from 6425 patients randomized to 6 mg/d of dexamethasone or usual care. Overall, dexamethasone resulted in an absolute reduction in mortality of 2. 8%. The corticosteroid groups included dexamethasone at low and high doses, low-dose hydrocortisone, and high-dose methylprednisolone. The Efficacy of Dexamethasone Treatment for Patients With ARDS Caused by COVID-19 trial and the COVID-19 Dexamethasone trial21 only enrolled patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. There were minimal missing outcome data. Follow-up was complete for both mortality and serious adverse events for 4 of the 7 trials.

In the RECOVERY trial, 1 patient who received invasive mechanical ventilation in the corticosteroid group withdrew consent. In the CAPE COVID trial, 1 patient in the corticosteroid group withdrew consent. In the REMAP-CAP trial, 5 patients withdrew consent in the corticosteroid group and 6 patients withdrew consent in the usual care group.

### The role of chest imaging in patient management during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multinational consensus statement from the Fleischner society [^7d272e7e]. Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Fleischner Society multinational consensus—conclusion: This statement is intended to offer guidance to physicians on the use of thoracic imaging across a breadth of health care environments and represents the collective opinions and perspectives of thoracic radiology, pulmonology, intensive care, emergency medicine, laboratory medicine, and infection control experts practicing in 10 countries, representative of the highest burden of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. It notes that this is opinion within a highly dynamic environment where regional epidemics and the availability of critical resources vary daily, and that the evidence base supporting imaging across the presented scenarios is scant, with advice that may undergo refinement through rigorous scientific investigation and nuances of image interpretation that may lead to prognostic information and guide management decisions. At the time of this writing, no therapy has been confirmed to alter the course of COVID-19, there is no known cure, and there is no vaccine for prevention, and as effective treatments are developed, thoracic imaging may find new roles by establishing treatment response or characterizing patients as likely responders to novel therapies.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline—laboratory markers and antibiotic stewardship: the use of procalcitonin in a group of hospitals was not effective as a tool to encourage antibiotic discontinuation compared to clinical judgment. Mason and colleagues compared hospitalized cohorts of 619 patients with COVID-19 and 106 with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and found marked differences in white blood cell counts (6.78 COVID-19 vs. 12.48 CABP) and that CRP declined in 48-72 hours with antibiotic therapy in the CABP cohort but not the COVID-19 group, suggesting these findings can guide discontinuation when antibiotics are initiated empirically in COVID-19. Initiating and continuing empiric antibiotics at admission may lead to resistant superinfections; one study found antibiotic use in the first two days of admission for COVID-19 to be a risk factor for superinfection. Immunomodulatory therapies are recommended for many patients with severe and critical illness from COVID-19, including corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists, and JAK inhibitors.

### Outcomes of dexamethasone treatment after hospital discharge for patients with COVID-19 (...) [^993a9e18]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In a cohort of 1164 patients with COVID-19 who received less than 10 days of dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, during hospitalization, the rate of readmission or mortality within 14 days of discharge was 9. 1% among patients who continued dexamethasone treatment compared with
11. 4% among patients who did not. The difference was not statistically significant. A total of 1164 patients with a median age of 55 years were identified. Most patients were of Hispanic ethnicity and male and required oxygen support during hospitalization. Corticosteroids were the first medication class to demonstrate mortality benefit among patients with COVID-19 and are now a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. 1-3 In the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy trial, the use of dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, up to 10 days or until discharge resulted in lower mortality.

1 However, with no standardized discharge practices, corticosteroid prescription practices at discharge have varied. Race and ethnicity groups represented were Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Most patients required some form of oxygen support during hospitalization. The median duration of inpatient dexamethasone treatment was 4 days across the entire cohort. In a diverse cohort of patients with COVID-19 who received less than 10 days of treatment with dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, during COVID-19 hospitalization, we found that continuing dexamethasone therapy at discharge was not associated with a reduction in 14-day readmission or mortality postdischarge.

In this cohort study of patients with COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals, continuing dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, at discharge for patients who received less than 10 days of dexamethasone, 6 mg/d, during hospitalization was not associated with a reduction in 14-day readmissions or mortality. Our findings suggest that dexamethasone, short of other indications, should not be routinely prescribed beyond discharge for treatment in patients with COVID-19.

Pharmacologic treatment of critically ill COVID-19 requiring non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula—We strongly recommend systemic corticosteroids in critically ill patients with COVID-19 with a mortality benefit (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.54; 0.82). In critically ill patients, dexamethasone 6mg/day is preferred, but doses up to 20 mg/day can be used if indicated; hydrocortisone 50 mg IV Q6 hours is an alternative, and methylprednisolone or prednisone are reasonable alternatives at equipotent doses. In addition to corticosteroids, we recommend using either IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab preferred over sarilumab) or JAK inhibitors (baricitinib preferred over tofacitinib) in patients with elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP). Trials have not identified specific sub-populations of critically ill patients already receiving corticosteroids who would benefit with additional IL-6 or JAK inhibitors, and we do not recommend remdesivir since it has not shown a benefit in this sub-population.

### Laboratory biomarkers in the management of patients with COVID-19 [^efca02d3]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Laboratory testing and the measurement of appropriate biomarkers play a critical role in managing patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), allowing for disease diagnosis, monitoring progression, prognostication, prediction of treatment response, and risk stratification. We sought to characterize these effects on a more detailed, mechanistic level.

Methods

We reviewed the literature and identified a multitude of reports that describe the unique effects of this virus and its devastating consequences to multiple organ systems in COVID-19 patients.

Results

There are specific alterations in biomarkers related to coagulation, depopulation of T-cell subtypes, the cytokine storm and inflammation, and kidney and cardiac dysfunction.

Conclusions

Laboratory measurement of specific parameters and the use of appropriate prognostic, predictive, and monitoring biomarkers afford clinicians the ability to make informed medical decisions and guide therapy for patients afflicted with this dreaded disease.

(Conditional recommendation†, Very low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of sarilumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline sarilumab.

Introduction

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the largest outbreak involving humanity from about a century ago to today. Globally, on 15 June 2020, 7,553,182 cases have occurred worldwide, with 423,349 deaths.The pandemic started in China and Southeast Asia (439,343 cases with 12,126 deaths), but subsequently spread to Europe and America with a higher number of cases and deaths (3,638,525 with 196,440 deaths in America and 2,378,958 cases with 187,468 deaths in Europe).Although COVID-19 mainly causes respiratory symptoms, it is now well known that it is also characterized by less common symptoms such as: diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal discomfort. Since SARS-CoV-2 may colonize the gastrointestinal tract,among gastroenterologists there is concern that patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), may be at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or poorer COVID-19 course, due to the chronic nature of the disease and the medications used for their treatment.In fact, the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of IBD includes both steroids and immunosuppressants, which may predispose not only to opportunistic infections, but also to viral infections.In the last few months, several reassuring data have been accumulating on the prevalence rate of COVID-19 and its outcomes in patients with IBD.Interestingly, the impact of the different IBD-related therapies on the clinical course of COVID-19 is also better understood.

Scenario 1: mild features of COVID-19—this scenario “addresses a patient presenting for evaluation at an outpatient clinic or via telehealth with mild respiratory features consistent with COVID-19 infection, any pretest probability of COVID-19 infection, and no significant critical resource constraints.” When test results are unavailable, “patients with moderate-to-high pretest probability should be initially managed as if COVID-19 testing is positive, whereas patients with low pretest probability should be initially managed as if COVID-19 testing is negative.” For imaging, “imaging is advised for patients with risk factors for COVID-19 progression and either positive COVID-19 testing or moderate-to-high pretest probability in the absence of COVID-19 testing,” and “imaging is not advised for patients with mild features who are COVID-19 positive without accompanying risk factors for disease progression or for patients with mild features who are COVID-19 negative.” If status changes, “regardless of COVID-19 test results and risk factors, imaging is advised for patients with mild clinical features who subsequently develop clinical worsening.” Imaging rationale is that it “provides a baseline for future comparison … and may influence the intensity of monitoring for clinical worsening,” and in the absence of worsening, “management involves support and isolation of patients with positive COVID-19 testing or patients with moderate-to-high pretest probability without COVID-19 test results available.”

COVID-19 hospitalized severe or critical—systemic glucocorticoids with infliximab versus no infliximab: The GRADE evidence profile evaluates whether infliximab should be added to standard care in this population. In the SAEs (assessed with: death, life-threatening AE, new/prolonged hospitalization, persistent/significant incapacity/substantial disruption of normal life functions, congenital anomaly/birth defect) outcome, events were 131/552 (23.7%) with infliximab versus 134/550 (24.5%); RR 0.97 (0.79 to 1.19), with an absolute effect of 7 fewer per 1,000 (from 54 fewer to 47 more). Trial context includes a blinded, placebo-controlled trial (N=1049) with a single infusion of infliximab plus standard of care versus standard of care alone, and standard of care included remdesivir (93-94%), corticosteroids (89-93%), tocilizumab (3%), baricitinib (1-3%); reported concomitant agents included remdesivir (29%) and tocilizumab (6%) [Fisher 2022], while the comparison arm received standard of care alone: dexamethasone (100%), corticosteroids (85%), remdesivir (62%), tocilizumab (3%). The trials reported outcomes of mortality at 28 days, recovery at 28 days (assessed by the first day a hospitalized participant did not require oxygen or on-going care, or patient was not hospitalized with or without limitations on activities, i.e. WHO categories 6, 7 or 8), length of hospitalization, and serious adverse events.

### Effect of 12 mg vs 6 mg of dexamethasone on days alive without life support in adults with COVID-19 and hypoxemia (...) [^8f63f7be]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Objective To assess the effects of 12 mg/d vs 6 mg/d of dexamethasone in patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia. Design, Setting, and Participants A multicenter, randomized clinical trial was conducted between August 2020 and May 2021 at 26 hospitals in Europe and India and included 1000 adults with confirmed COVID-19 requiring at least 10 L/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation. End of 90-day follow-up was on August 19, 2021. The primary outcome was the number of days alive without life support at 28 days and was adjusted for stratification variables. Of the 8 prespecified secondary outcomes, 5 are included in this analysis. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov Identifier: NCT04509973 and ctri. nic.

in Identifier: CTRI/2020/10/028731 Patients with critical COVID-19 are characterized by severe pulmonary inflammation and hypoxemia, which often leads to use of high-flow oxygen, mechanical ventilation and, in case of further disease progression, circulatory support and kidney replacement therapy.
1. Dexamethasone is recommended by the World Health Organization2 for patients with severe and critical COVID-19 based on a prospective meta-analysis3 of 7 randomized trials reporting reduced short-term mortality with the use of systemic glucocorticoids. The largest of these trials, the Randomized Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy trial, 4 demonstrated a mortality benefit with 6 mg/d of dexamethasone for up to 10 days. The COVID STEROID 2 trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a higher dose of dexamethasone in hospitalized adults with COVID-19 and severe hypoxemia.

The hypothesis was that a higher daily dose of dexamethasone compared with the currently recommended daily dose would increase the number of days alive without life support at 28 days in these patients. For the other secondary outcomes, P <. 01 was considered statistically significant and adjusted 99% CIs were used because of multiple comparisons.

Pharmacologic treatment of critically ill COVID-19 needing invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO—Patients with COVID-19 pulmonary disease needing invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO have the highest risk of mortality, and pharmacologically, we recommend treating them similarly to those on non-invasive ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula. Corticosteroids are strongly recommended as trials have demonstrated a mortality benefit. In addition to steroids, the panel recommends using either IL-6 inhibitors (tocilizumab is preferred over sarilumab) in critically ill patients who have elevated inflammatory markers like CRP; where IL-6 inhibitors are not available, baricitinib can be used in mechanically ventilated patients as a small trial showed a mortality benefit. Most other COVID-19 therapies studied in other severities have either not demonstrated benefit or not been studied in this population.

### COVID-19: a primer for the rheumatologist: management of patients and care settings [^5415bc07]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

There are currently many unanswered questions surrounding the management of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic and several 'rapid' guidelines have been released, although are subject to be updated and changed in the near future. The purpose of this review is to discuss the approach to management of patients with immune-mediated diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent Findings

At present, there is little evidence to suggest an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications in patients with immune-mediated diseases or associated with conventional or biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs; however, glucocorticoid use does appear to have negative associations.

Summary

Currently, conventional and biologic disease modifying antirheumatic drugs can be continued in the absence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In the case of exposure, with the exception of hydroxyhcloroquine and sulfasalazine, immunosuppression should be held for 2 weeks. Our recommendations and the guidelines we discuss here are based on C-level recommendations but help provide a framework for how to counsel our patients during this pandemic.

Where COVID-19 is causing severe illness or sepsis, the WHO recommends empirical antimicrobial treatment, with other sources suggesting this be considered in any severe infection.In addition, consideration may be given to a neuraminidase inhibitor in the event of coinfection with influenza. Coinfection of COVID-19 patients with other pathogens including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, and adenovirus may be common, occurring in 22% of cases in some reports.However, this depends on region and season. Coinfection with other respiratory pathogens may increase COVID-19 severity. As such, severe disease warrants testing and treatment for these coinfections.

Disease-modifying treatments for COVID-19 remain under investigation. Of note in this category, preliminary results from the Recovery trial indicate that low-dose dexamethasone reduces mortality among COVID-19 patients requiring respiratory support, by up to one-third in those requiring ventilation.As such, and with no significant harms associated with the medication in this trial, dexamethasone is now being recommended for consideration in severe disease.In addition, there is ongoing interest in remdesivir, an antiviral previously trialed in Ebola virus disease. Whereas early trials were equivocal regarding possible benefit,recent preliminary results from a randomized controlled trial suggest remdesivir may improve recovery time and rate from COVID-19.There are numerous other drugs under ongoing investigation because of their potential to modify some aspect of the COVID-19 disease course ; these have been reviewed elsewhere and remain an area of active research. Meanwhile, there is extensive ongoing research into potential candidate vaccines, with 13 in clinical evaluation and hundreds more being studied. Candidates include RNA, DNA, protein subunit, nonreplicating viral vector, and inactivated platforms. These additions will continue to be of great significance as control efforts continue.Seefor drugs andfor vaccines and immunotherapies in development for COVID-19.

### Tailored modulation of the inflammatory balance in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU?-a viewpoint [^b305c91a]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

A growing consensus seems to be emerging that dexamethasone is a crucial component in the treatment of COVID-19-associated oxygen-dependent respiratory failure. Although dexamethasone has an undeniably beneficial effect on the inflammatory response in a subgroup of patients, the potential negative effects of corticosteroids must also be considered. In view of these negative effects, we argue that a one-size-fits-all dexamethasone approach may be potentially harmful in specific subsets of patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. We propose a different individually tailored treatment strategy based on the patient's inflammatory response.

### Therapeutic strategies for severe COVID-19: a position paper from the Italian society of infectious and tropical diseases (SIMIT) [^9fecf4f4]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2021). Medium credibility.

Scope

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has become pandemic, reaching almost one million death worldwide. At present standard treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not well defined because the evidence, either from randomized or observational studies, with conflicting results, has led to rapid changes in treatment guidelines. Our aim was to narratively summarize the available literature on the management of COVID-19 in order to combine current evidence and interpretation of the data by experts who are treating patients in the frontline setting.

Methods

The panel conducted a detailed review of the literature and eventual press releases from randomized clinical trials for each possible available treatment. Inductive PubMed search waws performed for publications relevant to the topic, including all clinical trials conducted. The result was a flowchart with treatment indications for patients with COVID-19.

Implications

After 6 months of a pandemic situation and before a possible second coronavirus wave descends on Europe, it is important to evaluate which drugs proved to be effective while also considering that results from many randomized clinical trials are still awaited. Indeed, among treatments for COVID-19, only glucocorticoids have resulted in an association with a significant decrease in mortality in published randomized controlled trials. New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed.

The panel agreed the overall certainty of evidence for treatment with glucocorticoids for patients with severe COVID-19 as moderate due to concerns with indirectness since the evidence was from dexamethasone, and the panel agreed that the overall certainty of evidence for patients without hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen as low due to concerns with risk of bias (post hoc analysis) and imprecision. Additional research is needed to inform the generalizability of treatment with different glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19.

### Dexamethasone for inpatients with COVID-19 in a national cohort (...) [^c32912d7]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that early dexamethasone use is associated with improved mortality or discharge to hospice among patients requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Importance Limited effective therapeutics are available to hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials and observational studies have shown varying effects of systemic corticosteroids, including dexamethasone, in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, with limited descriptions of important patient subgroups. In contrast, all-cause inpatient mortality or discharge to hospice was not lower for patients who received dexamethasone in the no supplemental oxygen group and in the NIPPV group. Importantly, patients with more comorbidities had greater benefit from dexamethasone use.

In this large propensity score–adjusted cohort analysis of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 respiratory illness who received dexamethasone within 48 hours of either admission or escalation in oxygen support, we identified 3 key observations. First, the administration of dexamethasone on or within 2 days of hospital admission or escalation in oxygen support improved all-cause inpatient mortality or discharge to hospice among patients receiving supplemental oxygen or MV and/or ECMO. Second, the results were directionally consistent regardless of oxygen support; however, there was no benefit or harm observed with dexamethasone use in hospitalized patients not receiving supplemental oxygen or NIPPV. Third, in a large US cohort, with overall lower mortality than seen in the RECOVERY trial, 2 dexamethasone still proved beneficial in hospitalized patients requiring respiratory support.

This analysis provides additional insight into the use of dexamethasone in specific patient subpopulations; notably, its use was associated with improved outcomes in older patients and in those with more comorbidities. Preexisting comorbidities are common in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and those with preexisting comorbidities are more likely to have severe COVID-19, as well as worse outcomes from their illness. 17-21 In our cohort, the distribution of preexisting comorbidities was consistent with previously published trends, 19-21 and patients with higher CCI score in the supplemental oxygen and NIPPV groups had the greatest benefit from dexamethasone.

Fleischner Society COVID-19 imaging—main recommendations: Imaging is not routinely indicated as a screening test for COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals. Imaging is not indicated for patients with mild features of COVID-19 unless they are at risk for disease progression (scenario 1). Imaging is indicated for patients with moderate to severe features of COVID-19 regardless of COVID-19 test results (scenarios 2 and 3). Imaging is indicated for patients with COVID-19 and evidence of worsening respiratory status (scenarios 1, 2, and 3). In a resource-constrained environment where access to computed tomography (CT) is limited, chest radiography may be preferred for patients with COVID-19 unless features of respiratory worsening warrant the use of CT (scenarios 2 and 3).

### Coronavirus disease 2019 management [^7842d47b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute multisystem disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Investigations are ongoing in the search for effective therapeutics, with clinical approaches evolving based upon such evidence.

Recent Findings

The antiviral agent, remdesivir, and the immunomodulator, dexamethasone, are the first therapeutics for which there is evidence of efficacy from randomized trials. Subgroup analyses suggest remdesivir is beneficial in hospitalized patients whose severity of illness falls at the lower end of the spectrum, while dexamethasone is more beneficial in hospitalized patients whose severity of illness falls at the higher end of the spectrum. We recommend that inpatients who require supplemental oxygen but are not mechanically ventilated receive both remdesivir and dexamethasone, and inpatients who require mechanical ventilation receive dexamethasone monotherapy. Additional evidence regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, convalescent plasma, and a variety of antiinterleukin therapies is forthcoming.

Summary

The body of evidence related to COVID-19 therapeutics continues to evolve and, as a result, management is likely to change with time. As new evidence is generated and published, the optimal approach to managing patients with COVID-19 should be reconsidered.

Baricitinib plus remdesivir should be reserved for patients who cannot take corticosteroids because dexamethasone has been proven to reduce mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation and, for this reason, dexamethasone is recommended by the panel for this group, and it is uncertain whether baricitinib plus remdesivir will have the same benefit as dexamethasone. Evidence gaps remain, as of the time of this narrative, with no head-to-head trials evaluating either the combination of baricitinib plus tocilizumab or evaluating baricitinib compared to tocilizumab, and a post hoc subgroup analysis in the RECOVERY trial showed no difference in measured outcomes with concomitant baricitinib and tocilizumab, but further well-done studies are needed.

Other considerations for baricitinib in hospitalized COVID-19 include that the panel agreed on the overall certainty of evidence as moderate due to concerns with imprecision, as some outcomes have concerns with fragility, and recognized resource implications based on dosing of 4 mg daily up to 14 days; additional data in critical illness suggest consistent benefits but with concerns with imprecision based on a small sample. For baricitinib without corticosteroids, the panel agreed the overall certainty of evidence was low due to concerns with risk of bias from post hoc analyses and imprecision with limited events and fragility in the group likely benefiting most, and the guideline panel noted the importance of suggesting baricitinib plus remdesivir as an option for persons unable to receive corticosteroids.
