## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which statement best explains why the 1H NMR spectrum of 12CHCl3 appears as a singlet. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the basic NMR coupling rules and what would normally be expected for a proton coupled to chlorine nuclei. Then, I should verify the nuclear spin quantum numbers of 35Cl and 37Cl and whether they are zero or non-zero. Next, I will consider the implications of electric quadrupole moments for relaxation and line broadening. After that, I should review whether molecular rigidity or rotation meaningfully affects coupling observability. Finally, I will evaluate each answer choice against these principles and select the best explanation, making sure I double-check any tempting but incorrect options along the way.

> Let me first confirm the fundamentals: in 1H NMR, splitting arises when a proton couples to adjacent nuclei with non-zero spin, producing a multiplet according to the n+1 rule. If the adjacent nuclei have spin I = 0, there is no coupling and the proton appears as a singlet, so I need to check the spin of the chlorine isotopes in CHCl3 [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the chlorine isotopes. I initially thought both 35Cl and 37Cl might have I = 0, but that would be incorrect; I should double-check the nuclear spin values. Both 35Cl and 37Cl have nuclear spin I = 3/2, which means they are not I = 0 and could, in principle, split the proton signal, so the singlet cannot be explained by zero spin alone [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Even though I = 3/2 nuclei can couple, the key is whether the coupling is observable in practice. Nuclei with I > 1/2 often possess an electric quadrupole moment that interacts with electric field gradients at the nucleus, driving rapid quadrupolar relaxation that effectively decouples the spin from the proton and broadens the coupled multiplet beyond detection, yielding an apparent singlet for the proton [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I'm applying this correctly to CHCl3. The chlorine nuclei in CHCl3 have substantial quadrupole moments and relax extremely rapidly via quadrupolar mechanisms, so the 1H–Cl scalar coupling is averaged out and the proton resonance collapses to a singlet despite the non-zero spin of chlorine; this is a classic example of quadrupolar relaxation masking heteronuclear coupling [^notfound].

> Let me consider the alternatives carefully. Options about rigidity or rotation are misleading because molecular motion does not eliminate scalar coupling; it modulates dipolar interactions and relaxation, but does not remove the J-coupling itself, so rigidity or rotation cannot explain a singlet in this context. Similarly, intermolecular exchange would broaden or shift resonances rather than selectively remove heteronuclear splitting, and stating that chlorine has I = 0 is simply factually wrong, so those distractors fail on physical grounds [^notfound].

> I should double-check the exact wording of the best answer. The most accurate choice is that both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments, because this is the root cause of rapid quadrupolar relaxation that decouples the proton from chlorine and produces a singlet. Options claiming no quadrupole moment or I = 0 are incorrect, and options invoking rigidity, rotation, or exchange do not address the coupling issue correctly [^notfound].

> Final answer: A. Both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments, which cause rapid quadrupolar relaxation that averages the 1H–Cl scalar coupling and yields a singlet for the proton in 12CHCl3 [^notfound].

---

The 1H NMR spectrum of 12CHCl3 is a singlet because **both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments** [^notfound] that cause rapid quadrupolar relaxation, effectively decoupling the chlorine nuclei from the proton and eliminating observable splitting [^notfound]. This quadrupolar relaxation dominates over any scalar coupling, so the proton appears as a single peak. Options E and I are incorrect because chlorine isotopes have **non-zero spin (I = 3/2)** [^notfound], and options C and F are irrelevant because there is no significant proton exchange in chloroform.

## Nuclear spin and quadrupole moments of chlorine isotopes

Both 35Cl and 37Cl have **nuclear spin I = 3/2** [^notfound], which means they possess a nuclear magnetic moment and can, in principle, couple with adjacent protons. However, they also have **electric quadrupole moments** [^notfound] that interact with electric field gradients at the nucleus, enabling rapid quadrupolar relaxation [^notfound].

---

## Quadrupolar relaxation and its effect on NMR spectra

Quadrupolar relaxation is the dominant relaxation mechanism for nuclei with spin I > 1/2 in asymmetric environments. In CHCl3, the chlorine nuclei experience asymmetric electric fields, so quadrupolar relaxation is very efficient, with **relaxation times (T1 and T2) on the order of microseconds**. This rapid relaxation effectively decouples the chlorine nuclei from the proton, making the scalar coupling constant (J) effectively zero and causing the proton signal to appear as a singlet [^notfound].

## Comparison with other chlorinated methanes

To illustrate this, consider the 1H NMR spectra of other chlorinated methanes:

| **Molecule** | **Number of chlorine atoms** | **Observed 1h nmr signal** |
|-|-|-|
| CH3Cl | 1 | Doublet (due to coupling with 35Cl/37Cl) |
| CH2Cl2 | 2 | Triplet (due to coupling with two 35Cl/37Cl nuclei) |
| CHCl3 | 3 | Singlet (due to quadrupolar relaxation) |

---

In CH3Cl and CH2Cl2, the quadrupolar relaxation is less efficient because the electric field gradients are smaller, so the coupling to chlorine is observable and results in splitting. In CHCl3, the cumulative effect of three chlorine atoms increases the efficiency of quadrupolar relaxation, leading to a singlet [^notfound].

---

## Why other options are incorrect

- **Option E**: Incorrect. Both 35Cl and 37Cl have non-zero spin (I = 3/2) [^notfound].
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments [^notfound].
- **Options C and F**: Incorrect. There is no significant proton exchange in chloroform that would affect the NMR spectrum.

---

## Conclusion

The 1H NMR spectrum of 12CHCl3 is a singlet because **both 35Cl and 37Cl have electric quadrupole moments** [^notfound] that cause rapid quadrupolar relaxation, effectively decoupling the chlorine nuclei from the proton and eliminating observable splitting [^notfound].

### Nanoscale π-conjugated ladders [^94d4a004]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Cryogenic single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy

The singlet-singlet annihilation responsible for photon antibunching in the double-stranded ladder structures can be suppressed by reducing the overlap between the emission spectrum of a “donor” chromophore and the absorption of an “acceptor”, where the acceptor is the excited state of a second chromophore. Such a suppression can arise when the extrinsic electronic disorder along the π-electron system induced, for example, due to interactions with the amorphous environment, exceeds the intrinsic spectral width of the transition. A simple way to probe this condition is to cool the sample down to cryogenic temperatures. Figure 4D shows the temporal evolution of the fluorescence spectrum of single molecules of 12 8 and 12 n at a temperature of 5 K. In contrast to the results from photon-correlation spectroscopy obtained at room temperature (panels A–C), the fluorescence of the octamer at 5 K clearly shows two distinct transitions, corresponding to the two conjugated rails. The spectra change in peak position and intensity with time, manifesting spectral diffusion and blinking due to interactions with the environment. Less intense features are apparent in the fluorescence spectrum due to the discrete vibronic progression. The spectrum of the ladder polymer shows up to six distinct peaks, corresponding to simultaneously emitting spectrally distinct chromophores. We conclude that, at these low temperatures, excitonic motion along the ladder rails is inhibited, as is the singlet-singlet annihilation effect. The subtle disorder in the ladder structure serves to localize the emission centres within the molecule, thereby providing a direct fingerprint of the overall structural complexity of the molecule in luminescence.

### Hyperpolarized singlet NMR on a small animal imaging system [^1d1e12b7]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Nuclear spin hyperpolarization makes a significant advance toward overcoming the sensitivity limitations of in vivo magnetic resonance imaging, particularly in the case of low-gamma nuclei. The sensitivity may be improved further by storing the hyperpolarization in slowly relaxing singlet populations of spin-1/2 pairs. Here, we report hyperpolarized (13) C spin order transferred into and retrieved from singlet spin order using a small animal magnetic resonance imaging scanner. For spins in sites with very similar chemical shifts, singlet spin order is sustained in high magnetic field without requiring strong radiofrequency irradiation. The demonstration of robust singlet-to-magnetization conversion, and vice versa, on a small animal scanner, is promising for future in vivo and clinical deployments.

### Engineering stable radicals using photochromic triggers [^4a70680b]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

We believe that the above-mentioned mechanism is reasonable because CHCl 3 is the relatively most effective hydrogen donor upon irradiation,. In this way, this process can be perfectly demonstrated by the presence of an even strong hydrogen donor (thiophenol, see Fig. 4b). The radical species is still difficult to be directly detected by mass spectrometry simply because of its oxygen and CHCl 3 dependence. Therefore, only unreacted molecular ion peaks can be found (see Supplementary Fig. 13 for comparison). However, an indirect approach can be employed by the addition of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO) to covalently couple with the monoradical species to prove this issue. Key fragment peaks (e.g. m/z = 730.1854) upon the coupling structure were observed in Fig. 4i (see also the illustration for the coupling and fragment analysis in Supplementary Fig. 14), the high-resolution value of which showed a very close agreement with that calculated (mass error < 9 ppm). Besides, preparative HPLC was employed to isolate the adduct of photo-irradiated compound 1 coupled with TEMPO (from the new compound signal with the retention time of 6.388 min, see details showed in Fig. 4g and Supplementary Fig. 15). As shown in the 1 H NMR spectrum (see Fig. 4h), several characteristic peaks were observed, including the pyrrole proton, thiophene protons and peroxide proton. These results for the adduct show good agreement with the mechanism we proposed. In addition, we emphasize that another possible mechanism regarding a participation of Cl radical can be ruled out, since a common photochromic phenomenon was also observed in carbon tetrachloride (see Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 1v). These control studies further supported the suggested route as shown in Fig. 4f.

### A fast and sensitive 1H NMR method to measure the turnover of the H2 hydrogen of lactate [^b1955497]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

A fast and sensitive procedure to determine the turnover of the H2 hydrogen of lactate and quantify its (2)H-enrichment by (1)H NMR is illustrated using C6 cells metabolizing (3-(13)C) lactate in 50% (2)H(2)O (vol/vol). (2)H substitution of the lactate H2 hydrogen resulted in two easily detectable transformations of the vicinal H3 doublet resonance: 1) the formation of an H3 singlet due to the disappearance of the homonuclear coupling to H2 ((3)J(betaH-alphaH) = 7.0 Hz), and 2) an upfield isotopic shift derived from the vicinal (2)H2 substitution (Delta(3) = -0.007 ppm). Only those lactate molecules that have passed through the cell cytosol experience these effects, since H2 deuteration involves lactate dehydrogenase activity and NAD((2)H). Thus, analysis of the observed shifted and unshifted H3 lactate resonances from the incubation medium allows the discrimination of the perprotonated (3-(13)C) lactate added as substrate, and the (3-(13)C, 2-(2)H) lactate recycled to the incubation medium after passage through the cytosol.

### Direct observation of spin-forbidden transitions through the use of suitably polarized light [^cc8c8538]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

The study of excited triplet states of a molecular system is a difficult task because accessing them involves forbidden transitions from the singlet ground state. Nevertheless, absorption spectra of many molecules present, at low energies, the weak fingerprint of these triplet states. At higher energies this information is usually masked by the intense signal of the singlet states. Here we show, for the specific case of the sulphur dioxide molecule, that the combined use of polarized light and molecular alignment can enhance the triplet part of the spectrum, even making it the only absorption process.

Determination of free and total chlorine

Chlorine in solution was quantitatively determined via N, N’–diethyl–p–phenylenediamine (DPD) colorimetric method. 4.88 g of sodium phosphate dibasic, 8.12 g of sodium phosphate monobasic and 0.16 g of disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate dihydrate were dissolved in 200.0 mL of 1.0 M NaOH to prepare a buffer reagent (reagent A).100 mg of DPD was dissolved in 100.0 mL of deionized water to obtain the chromogenic reagent (reagent B). and 50 g of potassium iodide was dissolved in 50.0 mL of deionized water to obtain the reducing reagent (reagent C). To quantitatively determine the amount of free chlorine (Cl 2 and ClO − in solution), 5 mL of diluted sample solution was added to a test tube to which 0.5 mL of reagent B and 0.5 mL of reagent A were successively added. Following mixing and standing for 1 min, absorption value at 520 nm was quickly determined on DR 900 UV–vis colorimeter (Hach). For total chlorine determination (Cl 2, ClO − and N–chlorourea in solution), an additional 0.1 mL of reagent C was added into test tube and standing for 3 min, then absorption value evaluated by colorimetry. The concentration–dependent absorption spectra were calibrated using standard active chlorine solution of different concentrations. The amount of N–chlorourea or N, N’–dichlorourea can be calculated through active chlorine content using the following equations: n N–chlorourea = n total Cl − n free Cl or n N, N’–dichlorourea = (n total Cl − n free Cl) / 2, where n is the amount of product (mole). Moreover, the concentrations of urea and chlorourea in long–term electrolysis were also determined via 12 C NMR (Supplementary Fig. 23b).

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements provided direct evidence of the radical formation and suggested that radicals with a magnetic field strength at 3200–3400 mT were generated in CDCl 3 solution after UV irradiation (Fig. 3b). In contrast, the EPR spectra did not show radical signals in DMSO- d 6 solution after UV irradiation (Fig. 3c, d). These results feature a solvent-dependence of yielding the radical. It is worth noting that such a radical could be easily detected by EPR even without any radical trapping agent, suggesting that they are quite stable. The lifetime of the radicals is further determined to be hours by a decay curve based on the absorbance at 630 nm in chloroform under an oxygen-saturated condition (Fig. 3e, f).

### Improvements in precision and accuracy of complex-relative to real-domain linear combination model spectral fitting not necessarily recovered by zero filling [^2246b9c3]. NMR in Biomedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Although the information obtained from in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H MRS) presents a complex-valued spectrum, spectral quantification generally employs linear combination model (LCM) fitting using the real spectrum alone. There is currently no known investigation comparing fit results obtained from LCM fitting over the full complex data versus the real data and how these results might be affected by common spectral preprocessing procedure zero filling. Here, we employ linear combination modeling of simulated and measured spectral data to examine two major ideas: first, whether use of the full complex rather than real-only data can provide improvements in quantification by linear combination modeling and, second, to what extent zero filling might influence these improvements. We examine these questions by evaluating the errors of linear combination model fits in the complex versus real domains against three classes of synthetic data: simulated Lorentzian singlets, simulated metabolite spectra excluding the baseline, and simulated metabolite spectra including measured in vivo baselines. We observed that complex fitting provides consistent improvements in fit accuracy and precision across all three data types. While zero filling obviates the accuracy and precision benefit of complex fitting for Lorentzian singlets and metabolite spectra lacking baselines, it does not necessarily do so for complex spectra including measured in vivo baselines. Overall, performing linear combination modeling in the complex domain can improve metabolite quantification accuracy relative to real fits alone. While this benefit can be similarly achieved via zero filling for some spectra with flat baselines, this is not invariably the case for all baseline types exhibited by measured in vivo data.

### Vacancy control in acene blends links exothermic singlet fission to coherence [^d292df98]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra taken for the TET blends, shown in Fig. 1 e, and 1f, mirror the continuous change of the spectral shape from neat TET to that of isolated monomers. Due to the statistical distribution of spacer molecules within the film, TET molecules in the blend have a varying number of other TET molecules as in-plane neighbours ranging from 4 (the bulk limit) down to 0 (the monomer limit), with the relative contribution of these configurations changing with TET fraction. These variations are borne out in Fig. 1 g, and 1h, where the PL spectrum is deconvolved into spectral contributions from such configurations. The difference between the results of the decomposition for TET:6PH and TET:PIC blends is attributable to differences in the steric compatibility of the molecules and in the symmetry of the unit cell (see Supporting Information for details). Overall, the distribution of configurations resulting from this PL deconvolution deviates slightly from the binomial distribution expected for randomly intermixed TET and spacer molecules. The observed deviations are consistent with PL being preceded by exciton hopping to low-energy sites with an increased number of neighbouring TET molecules, which lower the energy locally through intermolecular interactions, as proposed before,.

Time-resolved spectroscopy and determination of singlet fission rates

In order to determine the SF dynamics in the TET blends, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. The TRPL intensity shown in Fig. 2a,b is indicative of the time-dependent photoexcited singlet state population, and features a prompt, subnanosecond decay followed by a low-amplitude, longer-lived tail. These fast and slow components have in previous reports on neat TET thin films been assigned to SF and delayed fluorescence from triplet–triplet annihilation, respectively,. At high TET concentrations, the latter attribution is confirmed by its magnetic field dependence. For decreased TET concentrations, however, the slow component does not change with the applied magnetic field (see Supporting Information), indicating that it is not due to enhanced triplet–triplet annihilation, and we instead assign it to singlet state emission from fully isolated TET monomers within the blends. Importantly, the fast component is seen to dramatically slow down with decreasing TET fraction. In the following, we focus on this component, as it reflects the upper limit of the concentration-dependent SF rate.

### Doubly N-confused and ring-contracted [ 24 ] hexaphyrin Pd-complexes as stable antiaromatic N-confused expanded porphyrins [^549a9a4f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Results

With the aim to synthesize m -benziporphyrin(1.1.0.0) 5, we attempted the cyclization reaction of α, α ’-diboryltripyrrane 3a with 1,3-dibromo-4-methoxybenzene under the usual Suzuki–Miyaura coupling conditions (Pd 2 (dba) 3, X-phos, Cs 2 CO 3, CsF, and toluene/DMF). In addition to the target 5 which was actually obtained in 5% yield, we isolated dark green product 6 in ca. 1% (Fig. 2). Fortunately, the structure of 6 has been revealed by X-ray analysis to be a symmetric and planar [18]triphyrin(5.1.1) with a small mean-plane deviation (MPD) of 0.26 Å (Fig. 3a, b). The carbonyl oxygen atom is hydrogen bonded with the two adjacent pyrrolic NH groups and the C=O bond length is 1.288(7) Å, being distinctly longer than those of usual ketones (1.23 Å),. This structural feature suggests a significant contribution of a dipolar resonance state. The 1 H NMR spectrum of 6 shows a singlet at 9.74 ppm due to the vinylic proton, two doublets at 8.36 and 8.08 ppm (J = 4.0 Hz) and a singlet at 8.31 ppm due to the pyrrolic protons, and signals due to the NH protons at 3.89 (2H) and −4.13 (1H) ppm, suggesting a distinct diatropic ring current, reflecting its 18 π -electronic circuit. The absorption spectrum of 6 shows a split Soret-like band at 419 and 444 nm and vibronic-structured Q-like bands as characteristic features of aromatic porphyrinoids (Fig. 4). Further, 6 displays vibronic-structured fluorescence at 652 and 721 nm with a high quantum yield of Φ F = 0.48. These data strongly indicate that 6 is an aromatic tripyrrolic porphyrinoid. Actually, the calculated NICS values are negative (−12.15 ppm) inside the macrocycle.

### Broad line emission from iron K-and L-shell transitions in the active galaxy 1H 0707-495 [^1c758f3f]. Nature (2009). Excellent credibility.

Since the 1995 discovery of the broad iron K-line emission from the Seyfert galaxy MCG-6-30-15 (ref. 1), broad iron K lines have been found in emission from several other Seyfert galaxies, from accreting stellar-mass black holes and even from accreting neutron stars. The iron K line is prominent in the reflection spectrum created by the hard-X-ray continuum irradiating dense accreting matter. Relativistic distortion of the line makes it sensitive to the strong gravity and spin of the black hole. The accompanying iron L-line emission should be detectable when the iron abundance is high. Here we report the presence of both iron K and iron L emission in the spectrum of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707-495. The bright iron L emission has enabled us to detect a reverberation lag of about 30 s between the direct X-ray continuum and its reflection from matter falling into the black hole. The observed reverberation timescale is comparable to the light-crossing time of the innermost radii around a supermassive black hole. The combination of spectral and timing data on 1H 0707-495 provides strong evidence that we are witnessing emission from matter within a gravitational radius, or a fraction of a light minute, from the event horizon of a rapidly spinning, massive black hole.

### Resolution and uncertainty of laplace inversion spectrum [^32d00c8e]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2007). Low credibility.

Laplace inversion has been widely used in analyzing nuclear magnetic resonance data to obtain a spectrum of decay time constant, such as the T(2) spectrum. However, due to the ill-conditioned nature of such inversion, it is difficult to determine the reliability and error of the resulting spectrum. This article describes methods used to analyze resolution and to obtain bounds of integral quantities of the spectrum.

### Tunable afterglow for mechanical self-monitoring 3D printing structures [^285082ae]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

The mechanism of these host/guest doping systems is illustrated in a simplified energy diagram as shown in Fig. 1g. After photo-excitation, the excitons in the singlet state of the host matrix (S 1H) can either decay to the lowest singlet excited state of the guest molecule (S 1G) through Fӧrster energy transfer process (i) or to its triplet state (T 1H) via ISC process (ii). Then, the singlet excitons of the guest molecule undergo an efficient radiative decay emitting fluorescence, which can also be converted to the triplet states of the guest (T 1G) and host (T 1H) molecules through intramolecular ISC process (ii) and singlet-triplet energy transfer (iii), respectively. The triplet state of the host matrix between S 1G and T 1G works as an intermediate energy-tunable platform, promoting excitons decay via (iv) rISC process upconverting excitons to the S 1G for TADF emission and (v) triplet-triplet Dexter energy transfer to the T 1G state for long-lived RTP. It illustrates that a dual-emission with concurrent TADF and RTP characters can be obtained by properly selecting the host matrix, whose triplet state plays a synergistic role in the energy transfer process for tunable TADF/RTP ratios and lifetimes.

### Designing chemical systems for precision deuteration of medicinal building blocks [^2b0295e2]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

MRR analysis of THPs

In virtually all reactions involving deuterium, numerous isotopic impurities can be produced. To understand the mechanistic origin of isotopic impurities, it is useful to determine the sample composition through quantitative analysis of all chemically distinct deuterated versions of the analyte present in the reaction mixture. While 1 H NMR spectroscopy can be a useful analytical tool for determining the site and approximate amount of deuterium incorporation in a single compound, quantitative analysis becomes a substantial challenge with mixtures of isotopologues and isotopomers. Since multiple distinct isotopic variants contribute to the proton resonances, it is not possible to determine the sample composition in terms of chemically distinct deuterated versions of the analyte from the 1 H NMR spectrum. In general, mass spectrometry cannot differentiate isotopomers and, therefore, it is typically used to determine the isotopologue distribution. MRR spectroscopy provides a method to determine the sample composition in terms of the chemically distinct isotopic variants. The rotational spectrum is determined mainly by the moments-of-inertia of the molecule so that both the masses of the nuclei and their positions in the molecular structure define the spectrum. An important feature of the technique is that the spectral pattern for each chemically distinct isotopic variant can be predicted to high accuracy from an equilibrium geometry obtained from quantum chemistry. This approach allows for high-confidence, library-free species identifications. The spectral resolution of MRR instruments is exceptionally high, thus enabling direct analysis of complex mixtures, including the identification of low-level isotopic impurities since spectral overlap is not a significant issue. Other molecular spectroscopy methods, such as infrared or Raman vibrational spectroscopy, do not offer these features limiting their use in the analysis of isotopic impurities of deuterated molecules. In this work, isotopic impurities present down to 0.3% relative to the major species can be identified and quantified in a measurement using approximately 10 mg of sample. For this study, each isotopologue of 14 was analyzed via MRR to confirm the regio- and stereochemistry of the target compound as well as to identify and quantify any impurities present (Fig. 3B). In the analysis, the presence of all under-deuteration (impurities with one fewer deuterium incorporated relative to the target), mis-deuteration (an isotopomer of the target), and over-deuteration variations (with one more deuterium than the target) were checked. A total of 36 variations were calculated, treating the alkene positions as predetermined by the choice of originating pyridine. In this way, it could be shown that specific isotopic impurities are not present at the detection limit and this information can be useful for elucidating the reaction mechanisms that lead to isotopic impurities. The specific deuteration isomers checked for each target reaction product are listed in the Supplementary Information. In these summaries of the isotopic composition of the sample, a value of zero indicates that the isotopic variant could not be detected in the sample.

By means of entanglement renormalisation, a tree of linearly connected vibrational modes connected to the electronic system via entanglement renormalisation nodes (blue) can be created, allowing facile computation of non-Born-Oppenheimer dynamics for large molecules (>100 atoms, further details in Methods). The vibrational modes are grouped by symmetry and colour coded to indicate tuning (orange) or coupling (green) mode behaviour. b Projected total time-dependent mode displacements for all symmetry groups and their corresponding assignment. We remark the ~200-fold lower displacement amplitude for A 2, B 1 and B 2 modes compared with the A 1 modes. c S 1 → 1 TT coherence transfer Raman spectrum (blue) and resonance Raman representation of the calculated spectrum (orange). d Intrinsic 1 TT Raman spectrum (purple) compared with the resonance Raman representation of calculations initiated in 1 TT (orange). Calculated modes marked with an asterisk in (c) and (d) are not detected in the experimental spectrum, likely due to resonance Raman enhancement effects

Though the simulations are performed at absolute zero, this theoretical model correctly reproduces the essential room temperature electronic photophysics of DP-Mes—quantitative singlet fission from S 1 to 1 TT, mediated by coupling to charge-transfer states which are not directly populated—and provides full dynamic information about the nuclear motion(see Supplementary Fig. 11 for a brief discussion of temperature effects). Based on the simulations we can examine the role of each vibrational mode during the singlet fission reaction in DP-Mes and its contribution to the experimentally observed impulsive Raman spectrum. To accurately compare the calculations to the experimental results it is important to note that the recorded impulsive Raman intensity depends on the dimensionless displacement parameter, Δ, of the state-specific vibrational normal modes of DP-Mes according to Eq. (1), where ω denotes vibrational frequency.

### Exploring the vibrational series of pure trilobite rydberg molecules [^8df2a114]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Because of the large dipole moments of the trilobite molecules, precise electric field compensation during the excitation pulses is necessary. To achieve this we use the momentum imaging capabilities of our reaction microscope. In this field compensation measurement, the atoms are ionized and accelerated in the residual electric field for a variable wait time. Afterwards, we measure the momenta of the ions and extract the electric field from the linear dependence on the wait time.

Figure 3 shows the molecular spectrum red detuned to the 22F 7/2 state covering the two trilobite potential wells. We observe a vibrational series of up to ν = 6 in each of the potential wells, which are equally spaced. The anharmonicity is less than 10 percent, confirming the harmonic oscillator shape of the potential wells. Thereby, the highest observed vibrational states are consistent with the theoretically predicted potential depths. Next, we analyze in detail the position of the vibrational states and the conclusions one can draw for the molecular potential. Inspecting the different terms in Eq. (1) shows that the molecular potential for the trilobite curve is proportional to the respective scattering length. High-precision molecular Rydberg spectroscopy is therefore a tool to determine the electron-atom scattering lengths. Because of the crossing with the butterfly curves, both the triplet p-wave as well as the dominant triplet s-wave scattering channels have to be considered. However, because of the relative insensitivity to the triplet p-wave scattering, we cannot accurately determine the corresponding scattering length and instead use previously measured values. Since the mixed trilobite has a small singlet admixture, the splitting of the two potential curves also depends on the singlet s-wave scattering length. Singlet scattering lengths calculated by a two-active-electron modelfit the observed splitting well over the entire range of relevant internuclear distances, with a value ofat the position of the potential minimum. To determine the triplet s-wave scattering length, we employ an iterative procedure. The position of the inner hard wall r 0 of the model potential is varied and the Schrödinger equation is solved for the altered potential to determine the scattering length. With this changed scattering length, the molecular Hamiltonian is diagonalized and the vibrational bound states in the new potential energy curve are calculated. This is repeated until the deviation to the measurement is minimized. The only free parameter is hereby r 0. We find a value ofat the position of the potential minimum. The triplet s-wave scattering length at zero momentum can then be calculated from r 0 and the polarizability of the perturber α = 320.1 a.u.with. This results in.

### Maximizing spectral sensitivity without compromising resolution in phase-incremented, steady-state solution NMR [^d0b30086]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The β - coefficients (Fig. 2d) can be used recursively to interrogate other contributions I(f) even if f ≠ 0, and thereby to introduce spectral resolution within the ±1/2 TR interval. In general NB spectral bands will thus become resolvable within this interval; assuming α has been chosen small enough to provide enough A k ≠ 0 coefficients, NB will then be dictated by the number M of phase increments used in the experiment; in our processing pipeline, we usually set NB = M /2. This β -based treatment, however, cannot address SSFP’s folding problem; therefore, peaks separated by multiples of 1/ TR (usually tens or hundreds Hz) will end up falling on the sameband, and their precise resonance positions will remain unknown. As explained in ref.it is possible to endow the SSFP signal in Eq. [1] with a suitably large window that unfolds this information by sampling not just, but numerous N t points within each 0 ≤ t ≤ TR period. Performing discrete FTs on these shortFIDs will yield spectra with an overall bandwidth of ≈2π N t /TR, with each data point p separated by a frequency increment ≈2π/ TR (in angular frequency units). As detailed in Fig. 3, adding onto this FT the phase-incremented filtering procedure described in Fig. 2, can then dissect each of these spectral elements into NB finer bands. Although conceptually simple this reconstruction requires addressing subtle but important issues associated with spectrometer deadtimes and band-dependent offsets, which if left unaddressed lead to spectral artifacts and phase distortions in the resulting peaks. With all these problems being deterministically addressed (ref.), Fig. 4 compares the performance of the resulting PI-SSFP approach vs FT-NMR 13 C results, for a 5 mM sucrose sample in D 2 O. For simplicity the Figure, as all data presented in this paper, centers on nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) enhanced, 1 H-decoupled solution-state acquisitions,. As can be appreciated the resolution and SNR t of both methods are comparable, raising the question of what would then be the advantage of having an SSFP-based approach that, while capable and based on its own processing pipeline, performs similarly as FT-based methods. We turn next to address this question, by describing under which conditions will PI-SSFP exceed FT-NMR’s SNR t performance.

### Maximizing spectral sensitivity without compromising resolution in phase-incremented, steady-state solution NMR [^63a70749]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Very recently, driven both by curiosity and by promises of increased SNR t, we revisited SSFP’s potential in a number of high resolution spectroscopic applications,. These spectroscopic studies led to the realization that some of SSFP’s main weaknesses –strong offset sensitivity, periodic regions of high and null intensities, repeated folding patterns– may actually contain the seeds for achieving high resolution among inequivalent sites over large bandwidths, as demanded by analytical liquid-state NMR. Based on this we recently proposed an approach to attain high resolution NMR information from SSFP signals, which monitors steady-state responses over a series of offsetscovering thefolding interval, and then exploits the a priori known dependence of a peak’s intensity on offset to pinpoint the latter within such interval. In addition, the extreme fold-over associated with SSFP acquisitions was dealt with by a discrete FT of the short FIDs that were sampled within the inter-pulse intervals TR. Solution-state 13 C NMR spectra which compared well with FT-NMR data could then be obtained on simple organic compounds, using this phase-incremented (PI) SSFP approach. Still, given that line shapes in these PI-SSFP spectra did not arise from a FT, their sensitivity and point-spread functions (PSFs) possessed a number of distinctive properties. Most remarkable among them was a dependence of the spectral resolution on the flip-angle α used in the excitation of the spins; this is in marked contrast to resolution in FT-NMR, where line widths are dictated by the duration of the acquired free-induction decay (FID) signals. Indeed, in PI-SSFP NMR arbitrary short acquisition times are no impediment for resolving closely-spaced resonances, as it is the combination of α flip angles being applied and of offsets M being interrogated –but not necessarily to the FID acquisition time given by TR– that govern PI-SSFP’s ability to distinguish inequivalent sites. The fact that relatively small αs were then needed to obtain the customary, Hz-sized resolution was then a mixed blessing: on one hand it freed peak intensities from the usual T 1 -weighting that affects FT-NMR spectra, but on the other it prevented maximization of the SSFP SNR t potential –which as illustrated by the | M x,y | values presented in Fig. 1, benefits from larger flip angles when considered over an arbitrary range of offsets.

NMR spectroscopy

NMR experiments were carried out at 298 K, using a Bruker 900 MHz Avance III HD spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe. Standard 5 mm NMR tubes were used for the measurements. The samples were prepared in 10 mM MES- d 13 buffer (H 2 O:D 2 O:DMSO- d 6 =85:10:5, pH 6.0, Sigma-Aldrich), and the concentration of synthetic peptides was adjusted to 50 μM. The lanthanides were added as the nitric acid salts (5 mM stock solutions in the same buffer), and the samples were allowed to equilibrate for at least 10 min before measurement. The 1 H NMR spectra of the all peptides were assigned using the standard homonuclear two-dimensional NMR methodology. Total correlation spectroscopy was conducted with a mixing time of 60 ms, and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy with a mixing time of 300 ms. The titration experiments were performed by adding Ln ion solutions to the peptide solutions. 1D and total correlation spectroscopy spectra were measured at each titration step to trace the chemical shift changes. All NMR data were processed and analysed with Topspin 3.1, NMRPipeand Sparky.

### Lactate isotopomer analysis by 1H NMR spectroscopy: consideration of long-range nuclear spin-spin interactions [^3bf99b1b]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Lactate is a key metabolite and its rates of cellular uptake and release, its production rates from glucose and glycogen, and its interconversion rate with pyruvate are important determinants of cellular energy production. If lactate precursors such as pyruvate and glucose are labeled appropriately with (13)C, (1)H NMR spectroscopy provides a means of quantifying lactate production from each source and allows measurement of all these rates within a single experiment. However, due to the multiplicities of the resonance lines (from nuclear spin-spin couplings) in lactate (13)C isotopomers, the (1)H NMR spectra were found to be more complex than expected, requiring determination of all spin-spin interactions in this anion. All such values were determined for lactate and its precursor pyruvate. The method was then applied to simultaneously measure the rates of exogenous lactate uptake and rates of release of glucose-, glycogen-, and pyruvate-derived lactate in the isolated perfused rat heart.

### Electrical detection of ortho-para conversion in fullerene-encapsulated water [^9921dad7]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Water, like dihydrogen, has two different spin isomers, called ortho and para, which have different spin state symmetries. In ortho -water, the spin state of the two proton nuclei is symmetric under particle exchange and the total nuclear spin has quantum number I =1. In para -water, the spin state is antisymmetric and has nuclear spin quantum number I =0. Water spin isomerism is of relevance to a broad range of scientific fields from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to astrophysics, and closely related to long-lived nuclear spin states, which also involve the slow interconversion of nuclear singlet and triplet states.

Physical properties of dihydrogen H 2, such as heat capacity or thermal conductivity, depend on the concentration of ortho and para spin isomers. Do the spin isomers of water also have different bulk properties? Since water, unlike dihydrogen, possesses an electric dipole moment, the spin isomers of ortho and para water are expected to display a distinct response to electric fields. This effect was predicted theoretically; and observed in beam experiments, but no bulk properties have been reported.

Although it is feasible to separate ortho- and para -water molecules in rarified molecular beams, it remains challenging to study the separated isomers in the condensed phase, since rapid proton exchange obscures the spin isomerism in bulk water, and strong intermolecular interactions usually quench the molecular rotation at low temperatures. Spin isomer-enriched water may be captured in an inert gas matrix and studied using infrared spectroscopy, but this approach provides little control over the molecular environment.

In contrast, the supramolecular endofullerene H 2 O@C 60, composed of C 60 carbon cages that each encloses a single water molecule, forms a well-defined lattice. The synthesis of this material provides macroscopic quantities of a stable substance that contains isolated and freely rotating water molecules. It has been studied under a very wide range of physical conditions using various spectroscopic techniques. Dielectric measurements were made on a single crystal of H 2 O@C 60, but without anticipating, or observing, a dependence on spin isomer composition.

### Entangled spin-polarized excitons from singlet fission in a rigid dimer [^82d00c48]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To fit spectra, we compute the ensemble-averaged trEPR spectrum directly in the adiabatic basis, use discretization to calculate and sample over molecular orientations, and use simulated annealing to determine best fit parameters. For each orientation in the fitting protocol, the initial states of the trEPR spectra come from the nonadiabatic transition theory. These simplifications are substantial. Namely, the computed trEPR spectra only depend on the parameters D, X and β. Including X is essential but the orthorhombicity parameter E is not included because it does not significantly improve fit results for either the dimer or the monomer (Supplementary Note 2.7). Supplementary Notes 2.4 – 2.7 contain the details of the theory and the fitting procedure.

Figure 2 a shows the prompt EPR spectrum—the spectrum immediately following SF—for TIPS-BP1' (200–400 ns, Fig. 1 a and Supplementary Fig. 5) along with a calculation of it. The best-fit values D = 1322 ± 3 MHz and X = 59 ± 1 MHz are consistent with those for pentacene derivatives and dimers, respectively. Remarkably, the fit value of β = 111.1 ± 0. 2 ∘ is within 0.2% of the calculated value from DFT simulations for the quintet in a model of TIPS-BP1' (110. 9 ∘, unrestricted- ω -B97XD/6-31G(d)).

Without changing solvent for autonomous operation: Isomer B - 1 (1 mg) was dissolved in 12DCB and one drop of benzene- d 6 for easier locking and shimming was added and a 1 H NMR spectrum was recorded (starting point, B isomer). Afterward, the NMR tube was irradiated with a 520 nm LED, and again a 1 H NMR spectrum was recorded (motor step 1, mainly D isomer was obtained).

### Oxygen-catalysed sequential singlet fission [^94f6dc6f]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Fig. 3 
Spectral evolution in time and oxygen dependence of kinetic traces. a Spectral evolution of a 0.5 mM solution of TIPS-Pn in THF. In the initial 6 ns, the transient spectrum is determined by S 1 excited-state absorption with a maximum at 450 nm. Additionally, signatures of ground-state bleach and stimulated emission are observed at 640 and 700 nm, respectively, in good agreement with the absorption and emission spectra (black and blue lines). After 50 ns, a triplet ESA with a maximum at 500 nm can be observed in lieu of the singlet. No further spectral changes are observed. b Selected transients at 500 nm probe wavelength. The kinetic traces for a 0.5 mM solution of TIPS-Pn (see inset) show a stark contrast when using THF stored under atmospheric conditions (blue) compared to degassed THF (red). At the maximum of the triplet ESA (500 nm), the initial fast decay of the singlet is observed. In the case of degassed THF, the amplitude of the triplet is very weak at µs delays. However, in the solution containing oxygen, after the fast singlet decay, the triplet amplitude rises slowly until a local maximum is observed at a probe delay of ≈ 0.4 µs. This behaviour indicates an oxygen-catalysed SF process. Additionally, the triplet decays much faster than in the degassed solution (;) due to further interaction with oxygen (see Supplementary Note 5 for more details). Source Data are provided as a Source Data file

The TA signal of TIPS-Pn evolves on the ns time scale for a concentration of 0.5 mM. Spectral shape and amplitude remain constant in the fs-ps time window. Hence, according to previous reports, the earliest TA spectrum is assigned to the S 1 state. It shows a prominent ESA peak at 445 nm together with weaker features at 507, 533 and 572 nm. Bleach and SE explain the negative peaks at 593, 644 and 702 nm. This TA spectrum decays on the same time scale as that of fluorescence, giving rise to a long-lived component (green spectrum in Fig. 3a) with ESA peaks at 465 and 498 nm, bleach at 590 and 642 nm and no signature of SE. This last spectrum is assigned to the triplet state T 1 of TIPS-Pn. There is no indication of additional states.

### Nuclear spin coupling crossover in dense molecular hydrogen [^647a361e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

This can only be assumed for weak or moderate intermolecular interactions, i.e. when nearest neighbour distances (r n) are much shorter (≈0.7Å at ambient conditions) than next-nearest neighbour distances (r nn ≈3Å at ambient conditions), allowing for sufficient intramolecular wave function overlap (left side of Fig. 1a).

Fig. 1 
Overview of both spin-pairing and non-pairing regimes.

a Schematic representation of the wave function overlap (red lines) of H 2 molecules. b Schematic representation of the nuclear spin energy levels under the influence of an external magnetic field B 0 for the pairing (i.e. quadrupole interaction) and non-pairing (dipole–dipole interaction) regimes. c Theoretical line shapes in the pairing and non-pairing regime. ω 0 = 2 πf 0 denotes the Larmor frequency of the hydrogen nuclei, ω Q, η and C q are the quadrupole frequency, the asymmetry parameter and the quadrupole coupling constant, respectively.

Under high enough densities, however, intermolecular interactions increase significantly as r nn decreases by ~70% within 100 GPa,. At these pressures, r nn approaches r n and collective nuclear quantum fluctuations increase rapidly.

For decades, theoretical,, and experimentalstudies indicated that under such extreme pressures odd values of J become unstable, rapidly decaying into even states, which leads to potential indistinguishability of the hydrogen spin isomers on experimental timescales.

The only experimental technique in high-pressure research to directly study the H 2 nuclear spin states is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, detecting the linear response of the nuclear spin system upon radio-frequency excitation in a magnetic field B 0. The spin-singlet state of para -hydrogen is NMR silent, whereas application of B 0 lifts the three-fold degeneracy of the ortho states and allows for an excitation of nuclear spin transitions (Fig. 1b). Nuclear spin-pairing in ortho -hydrogen leads, furthermore, to a finite electric quadrupole moment, eQ, interacting with the local charge distribution defined by the structural arrangement of hydrogen molecules. Thus, the quadrupolar coupling can be considered the dominant spin interaction, resulting in characteristic NMR line shapes(Fig. 1c).

### Resolution of creatine and phosphocreatine 1H signals in isolated human skeletal muscle using HR-MAS 1H NMR [^16cfe3ca]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Proton NMR spectra of freshly isolated human skeletal muscle samples contain creatine and phosphocreatine resonances with distinct chemical shifts that are easily visualized with magic angle spinning (MAS, spinning the sample rapidly at 54.7 degrees with respect to the magnetic field) methods. The identification of the phosphocreatine resonance was based on two findings: that (i) the possible small dipolar coupling does not contribute to line splitting under rapid MAS, and (ii) the 1H signal decreases concurrently with the phosphocreatine resonance observed in 31P NMR experiments. In the MAS 1H spectra, the phosphocreatine resonance remains a singlet with a linewidth of less than 3 Hz. The creatine resonances are split into two peaks with linewidths at half height of approximately 2 and 6 Hz, respectively. The resonance with the broader linewidth represents creatine that is significantly motion-restricted and suggests that a creatine pool in muscle tissue is highly compartmentalized.

### Gadoterate meglumine [^c3d3b33c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Gadoterate is a paramagnetic molecule that develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. The magnetic moment enhances the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of tissues.

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occurs with:

differences in proton density
differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1)
differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2)

When placed in a magnetic field, gadoterate shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in target tissues. At recommended doses, the effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in the T1-weighted sequences.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Gadoterate affects proton relaxation times and consequently the MR signal, and the contrast obtained is characterized by the relaxivity of the gadoterate molecule. The relaxivity values for gadoterate are similar across the spectrum of magnetic field strengths used in clinical MRI (0.2 to 1.5 T).

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity allows distribution of gadoterate in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and infarcts.

### Maximizing spectral sensitivity without compromising resolution in phase-incremented, steady-state solution NMR [^60699f1d]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 10 
Effects of choosing different regularization factors λ on the LASSO-based PI-SSFP data processing.

This is exemplified on the {1H}15 N NMR data introduced in Fig. 9. Notice that, in accordance to the literature,, the effect is largely cosmetic: frequency elements devoid of influence are progressively suppressed until becoming null, while spectral elements containing meaningful information (i.e. the peaks) remain mostly untouched in both amplitude and spread (line width). Blue traces are zoomed regions from the indicated peaks; empty regions were cropped away for clarity.

Another factor that remains to be unraveled concerns how will T 1 and T 2 times affect the PI-SSFP line shapes. The influence of these times is very well understood in multi-scan FT-NMR: here T 1 will define the signal intensity via the Ernst angle, and T 2 the line width and the optimal matching weighting function to be used. The actual FT inversion relating a FID to a spectrum, however, is independent of these time constants. By contrast, T 1 and T 2 enter in the definition of thePI-SSFP transformation matrix, meaning that line shapes may become affected if these are unknown or very wrongly assumed. While we have not found significant evidence for such effects in numerical simulations, this is a feature that remains to be further investigated. Another intriguing possibility concerns what will happen if steady-states are not necessarily reached over the PI-SSFP procedure; SSFP experiments have, after all, been extensively used in hyperpolarized NMR imaging, under scenarios where polarizations are rapidly decreasing over the course of the pulsing –. We hypothesize that even under such cases, suitable processing avenues could still enable the acquisition of high resolution NMR spectra via phase-incremented, rapid-pulsing approaches, by relying on the linear relations and principles described above. Additional ways of exploiting this linearity to retrieve spectra that are not based on regularized reconstruction, can also be devised. These and other aspects of this intriguing new route to high-resolution NMR, will be discussed in upcoming studies.

### Measurements of the persistent singlet state of N2O in blood and other solvents – potential as a magnetic tracer [^f9394e67]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The development of hyperpolarized tracers has been limited by short nuclear polarization lifetimes. The dominant relaxation mechanism for many hyperpolarized agents in solution arises from intramolecular nuclear dipole-dipole coupling modulated by molecular motion. It has been previously demonstrated that nuclear spin relaxation due to this mechanism can be removed by storing the nuclear polarization in long-lived, singlet-like states. In the case of N(2)O, storing the polarization of the nitrogen nuclei has been shown to substantially increase the polarization lifetime. The feasibility of utilizing N(2)O as a tracer is investigated by measuring the singlet-state lifetime of the N(2)O when dissolved in a variety of solvents including whole blood. Comparison of the singlet lifetime to longitudinal relaxation and between protonated and deuterated solvents is consistent with the dominance of spin-rotation relaxation, except in the case of blood.

### Hyperpolarization of 13C through order transfer from parahydrogen: a new contrast agent for MRI [^8869126a]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2005). Low credibility.

The order within proton pairs in organic molecules, resulting from hydrogenation with parahydrogen, can be transferred in great part to nearby carbon 13 spins through adequate field manipulations. The molecules with hyperpolarized 13C thus obtained can be used as new contrast agents of high efficiency in MRI. After a brief presentation of the hydrogenation process and apparatus, in relatively low magnetic field, we describe the procedure of order transfer to the 13C spins through a sudden drop from the initial field to zero field followed by an adiabatic remagnetization. The expected final polarizations in the absence of relaxation are given for several compounds. Finally, we show an example of MR images observed in vivo on animals as an illustration of the contrast capacity of this new method.

### Understanding silicate hydration from quantitative analyses of hydrating tricalcium silicates [^d48f1336]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Methods

NMR spectroscopy

The 1 H and 29 Si NMR isotropic chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane using tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silane [((CH 3) 3 Si 4)Si] as a secondary standard. All measurements were performed using zirconia MAS rotors and at room temperature. Solid-state 1D 29 Si NMR experiments were carried out using a Bruker Avance-III 500 spectrometer (magnetic field 11.7 T). Magic-angle-spinning (MAS) spectra were measured using a Bruker MAS NMR probe with 4 mm rotors, at spinning frequencies of 7 kHz, and without decoupling. The single-pulse 29 Si MAS NMR spectra were acquired with a π /2 pulse length of 6 μs, a recycle delay of 1,000 or 100 s, and 64 or 16 scans for the 29 Si-enriched non-hydrated and hydrated Ca 3 SiO 5 samples, respectively. { 1 H} 29 Si CPMAS NMR spectra were recorded using a 1 H rf power of 93 kHz, a contact time of 5 ms, and recycle delay of 10 s. The number of scans was 184 for hydrated Ca 3 SiO 5 samples and 2,000 for non-hydrated sample. Hartmann–Hahn matching was ensured by a ramp on the 29 Si rf field intensity. 2D { 1 H}- 29 Si heteronuclear dipolar correlation (HETCOR) experiments were conducted on a Bruker Avance-700 (16.4 T) spectrometer at ambient temperature, under 4 kHz MAS conditions, with a 7 ms CP contact time, recycle delay of 10 s and 66 t 1 increments of 50 μs each. Solid-state 2D J -mediated 29 Si{ 29 Si} DQ correlation NMR experiments were conducted using the refocused-INADEQUATE techniqueand a 18.8 T Bruker AVANCE-III NMR spectrometer. The experiments were conducted under conditions of 12.5 kHz MAS using a Bruker 3.2 mm H-X double resonance probehead. The 2D 29 Si{ 29 Si} spectrum was acquired using a 2.5 μs 1 H π /2 pulse, 3.5 ms contact time for 29 Si{ 1 H} CP, 6.0 μs 29 Si π /2 pulses, SPINAL-64 1 H decoupling, 152 t 1 increments, an incremental step size of 80 μs, a recycle delay of 2 s and 3,072 scans for each t 1 increment, which corresponds to an experimental time of 260 h (∼11 days).

### Dehydrogenation of anhydrous methanol at room temperature by o-aminophenol-based photocatalysts [^8959e486]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As apH 2 and apH − can promote one-proton and two-electron transfers, it is not surprising that these can generate electron(s), hydrogen radical(s) or a hydride (Fig. 1). To gain a better mechanistic understanding of the observed PHERs, photochemical reactions were carried out in the presence of 2-methylpropane-2-thiol (t -BuSH), which is able to act as a hydrogen radical scavenger on account of the relatively low-bond dissociation energy of the S–H bond, resulting in the formation of di- tert -butyl disulfide (t -Bu 2 S 2).

The 1 H NMR spectrum of t -BuSH prior to photoirradiation at 289±10 nm (24 h) in MeOH- d 4 is shown in Fig. 7a. A singlet peak was observed at δ =1.40 p.p.m. and assigned to the protons of the t -Bu group. After photoirradiation, no considerable change was observed in the spectrum (Supplementary Fig. 12), which is consistent with the absence of an absorption ∼289 nm (Supplementary Fig. 13). The 1 H NMR and ultraviolet–visible spectra of t -Bu 2 S 2 in MeOH- d 4 and MeOH are shown in Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 13, respectively. In MeOH- d 4, the 1 H NMR spectrum of t -Bu 2 S 2 exhibits a singlet resonance at 1.29 p.p.m. while the ultraviolet–visible spectrum shows an absorption ∼289 nm in MeOH (Supplementary Fig. 13). After photoirradiation of a MeOH- d 4 solution of t -Bu 2 S 2 at 289±10 nm (5 h), major singlet peaks emerged at 1.71, 1.40, 1.29 and 0.88 p.p.m. together with several minor peaks, which demonstrates the photochemical reactivity of t -Bu 2 S 2 (Fig. 7c). These resonances are thus indicative of the in situ formation of t -Bu 2 S 2 and the reaction products from its photochemical decomposition.

Results and discussion

Structural characterization of the double helicates

The synthetic procedures of rac / Rp − 60° pseudo-ortho- bis(ethynyl) [2.2]PCP diplatinum(II) complexes (rac/Rp -PCP) and 120° dipyridyl TPE (TPy) were depicted in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. Chiral double helicates R p, R p-PCP-TPy1 and R p, R p-PCP-TPy2 were prepared in nearly quantitative yield by stirring diplatinum(II) complex R p-PCP with corresponding TPy1 or TPy2 in the mixed solvents of dichloromethane and acetone at 60 °C overnight. Similarly, double helicates PCP-TPy1 and PCP-TPy2 were also prepared in nearly quantitative yields by stirring diplatinum(II) complex rac- PCP with corresponding TPy1 or TPy2 under identical conditions. These all double helicates were characterized by various analytic techniques, including 1 H NMR, 31 P{ 1 H} NMR, and 2D diffusion-ordered 1 H NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) and electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS).

1 H NMR spectrum of PCP-TPy1 clearly shows a set of peaks (Fig. 2A). Downfield chemical shifts were observed for α-pyridyl protons H 1, β-pyridyl protons H 2 and phenyl protons H 3 with Δ δ = 0.02, 0.37 and 0.12 ppm, respectively, owing to the coordination of the pyridyl moieties with the platinum atoms. In the 31 P{1H} NMR spectra (Fig. 2A), the singlet peak displays an obvious upfield shift from 20.87 to 16.01 ppm for PCP-TPy1, which is a characteristic feature for the formation of metal-coordination bonds. The similar changes in the 1 H NMR and 31 P{1H} NMR spectra were also observed for R p, R p-PCP-TPy1, PCP-TPy2 and R p,R p-PCP-TPy2 (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).

### A quantum spin-probe molecular microscope [^7572d703]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Results

System overview

The set-up is shown in Fig. 1a and consists of a single controllable electronic spin defect in a semiconductor lattice, located 2–4 nm below the substrate surface, above which the target molecule is located. For high-resolution imaging we assume the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom in the molecule are suppressed, by keeping the system and its hydrated environment in a typical temperature range of 77 K and below. Positioning the molecule above the spin probe can be achieved in several ways. Mechanical placement of the molecule onto a silicon surface can be performed using an STM/AFM tip, or with optional initialisation of covalent bonding via STM current. Alternatively, a number of molecules can be placed on the surface statistically ensuring probe to target proximity. The spatial localization of the probe spin allows it to be in close proximity to the molecule and the dipole interaction field between the molecular nuclear spins and the electronic probe spin assumes the role equivalent to the classical gradient field in conventional MRI (Fig. 1a). The direction of the background magnetic field B 0 (with magnitude of order 1-2 T), defines the quantization axis of both the probe spin and the nuclear spins of the molecule, thus providing a way of controlling the effective strength and direction of the dipole interaction between the probe and nuclei spins. The nuclear spins in the molecule are subjected to two different regimes of control—a high amplitude constant radio frequency field used for nuclear decoupling, and a considerably weaker NMR field for resonant excitation. We primarily focus on imaging the 1 H nuclear density as the most abundant species in organic molecules, however, as we will show the method is also applicable to other spin species (for example, 13 C or 14,15 N) through isotope enrichment. As a MRI based method, our protocol encodes structural spatial information onto frequency space, however, in contrast to conventional MRI, where the magnetic field gradient forms equipotential planar slices, the nuclei experiencing equal interaction with the probe spin are located on curved, non-uniform slices, corresponding to dipole lobes (Fig. 1a). The exact shape of the interaction slices depends on the probe's electronic wave function, which for simplicity we assume is highly localized (for example, NV), but in principle can be pre-characterized (for example, Si:P)and/or calibrated using known structures. Details of the actual probe electronic wave function would modify the coupling profile, however, the overall imaging methodology itself is independent of any particular shape of the interaction slices.

### UnidecNMR: automatic peak detection for NMR spectra in 1-4 dimensions [^6d76f76f]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Results

Theory

The kernel of the algorithm was originally developed to analyse mass spectrometry data, a problem that shares many features with NMR data analysis. The method relies on the assumption that a spectrum of intensities, I, can be reasonably expressed as a convolution of a peak shape function, g, and an array of delta functions or sources, f, each of which spans the same set of spectral frequencies, i. The algorithm aims to perform the deconvolution that removes the peak shape function from the data, providing a user with a list of sources, f, that dictates both the peak positions and intensities. The kernel iterates (t) on the intensities of each spectral element:

When the back-calculated spectrum, (f∗g), has the same intensity as the data I at frequency i, then the ratio is equal to 1,and the algorithm has converged. The action of the algorithm is to suppress sources that are adjacent to the true ‘centre’ of a resonance. A user supplies a noise threshold and a peak shape function g (Fig. 1a). In our implementation, the initial intensities are set to the initial intensities of the raw data found at each position, and then iteratively adjusted according to Eq. (1) until convergence, where the final values in f provide the central locations and intensities of the picked peaks. To determine convergence, the changes made in intensities are assessed in each step, and when these fall below a user-specified threshold, or when the calculation exceeds a pre-specified number of maximum iterations, the calculation stops. The selected peak shape g should be a reasonable match for the average resonance in a spectrum, although the final results are reasonably tolerant to this parameter being mis-set (Supplementary Fig. 1a), as expected in the case of experimental data where there is a wide range of peak shapes. The algorithm can work on data of arbitrary dimensionality, which renders it highly amenable to NMR analysis.

### Spectral fitting: the extraction of crucial information from a spectrum and a spectral image [^0b6add67]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

A highly accurate line-width simulation computer program is used that can account for both high amplitude and frequency of the Zeeman modulation in an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiment. This allows for the overmodulation of EPR lines to increase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in EPR spectra and spectroscopic images, without any sacrifice in the determination of the intrinsic line width (1/gamma. T(2e)). The technique was applied to continuous-wave EPR spectroscopic images of a narrow, single-line trityl spin probe wherein a full EPR spectrum was extracted from each 3D spatial voxel. Typical improvements are a three- to fivefold increase in SNR in the high-gradient projections in the image and a reduction in the standard deviation (SD), by a factor of 3, of the line widths in the low-gradient domain. This method is a general one that is also applicable to the analysis of conventional (14)N or (15)N nitroxide spin probes.

### Time-and site-resolved kinetic NMR for real-time monitoring of off-equilibrium reactions by 2D spectrotemporal correlations [^3823643f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Fig. 3 
1D Slice-selective NMR spectra of the enzymatically-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction described in Fig. 2.

A Slice-selective (2 mm) 1 H NMR spectra of the methyl region acquired at 8 distinct positions along the NMR coil, collected under similar experimental conditions as those in Fig. 2, but utilizing a 1 second acquisition time. The improved resolution reveals the J -coupling of the sites. B Integrated signal intensities for the reactant (black circles) and product (red circles) plotted as a function of both position and reaction time against the lines of best fit from the kinetic analysis (k cat = 12.0 s −1 and t 0 = 45 s).

A feature of the kinetic NMR method introduced in Fig. 1 is its capability to control the time resolution used to probe the reaction coordinate in a simple, programmable manner. For many time-resolved kinetic NMR techniques this time resolution is often dictated by factors requiring major setup changes—like modifications in the fluid path length or in the rate at which reactants flow. For the spatially-encoded NMR spectra revealed by 2D spectrotemporal correlations, kinetic time resolution is ultimately governed, for a given flow rate, by the spatial resolution of the EPSI imaging readout—an easily tunable and controllable parameter. To demonstrate this added flexibility, Fig. 4 shows how the time resolution can be increased by a factor of ca. 6 vs. that in Fig. 2, by increasing both the flow rate by a factor of 3.3× (v ≈ 1 mL/min), and the EPSI gradient readout spatial resolution by a factor of 2× (T a = 1 ms and Δ z = 115 μm). Under these experimental conditions, a reaction-time resolution of ca. 86 ms was achieved. Note that this time resolution is shorter than the total time required to collect the entire EPSI gradient echo train, which lasted 200 ms in total (i.e. N EPSI = 100 for T a = 1 ms). This added flexibility for monitoring kinetic processes with high temporal resolution comes at a price, however, which is evidenced by the ca. 3× reduction in signal-to-noise (SNR) for Fig. 4 vs. Fig. 2. This results from the combined effects of the increased flow rate and of the higher spatial resolution of the gradient readout. Also noticeable is a further deterioration of the spectral resolution, as a result of the signal decay brought about by turbulences acting in the presence of stronger field gradients. Despite these SNR and resolution deteriorations, it is still possible to achieve similar kinetic fits as those ascertained in Fig. 2 : three independent measurements here yielded k cat = 11.7 ± 0.3 s −1 and t 0 = 12 ± 1 s. As before, 1D slice-selective pulse-acquire measurements carried out under the same experimental conditions yield virtually identical kinetic parameters (Fig. 4 D, E). Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Figs. 4 – 6 contained therein provide a more in-depth analysis of the combined effects of the imaging spatial resolution and flow rate on the overall SNR.

### Singlet oxygen-mediated selective C-H bond hydroperoxidation of ethereal hydrocarbons [^090f28a9]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Singlet O 2 is a key reactive oxygen species responsible for photodynamic therapy and is generally recognized to be chemically reactive towards C=C double bonds. Herein, we report the hydroperoxidation/lactonization of α-ethereal C-H bonds by singlet O 2 ( 1 Δ g ) under exceptionally mild conditions, i.e., room temperature and ambient pressure, with modest to high yields (38~90%) and excellent site selectivity. Singlet O 2 has been known for >90 years, but was never reported to be able to react with weakly activated C-H bonds in saturated hydrocarbons. Theoretical calculations indicate that singlet O 2 directly inserts into the α-ethereal C-H bond in one step with conservation of steric configuration in products. The current discovery of chemical reaction of singlet oxygen with weakly activated solvent C-H bonds, in addition to physical relaxation pathway, provides an important clue to a 35-year-old unresolved mystery regarding huge variations of solvent dependent lifetime of singlet O 2 .

### A facile route to old and new cyclophanes via self-assembly and capture [^503e24e3]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

To showcase the utility of the sulfur extrusion process, we next sought to prepare the known 2,11,20-trithia[3.3.3](1,3,5)cyclophane 3 by exposing tris(disulfide) [4.4.4](1,3,5)cyclophane [L 3 2] to a stoichiometric amount of HMPT for 1.5 h at an ambient temperature. The trithiacyclophane 3 was formed in quantitative yield by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and isolated in 95% yield from disulfide [L 3 2] (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. 8). Over two steps, this provides an isolated yield of 65%, a significant improvement over the reported 5.3% yieldobserved by treatment of 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)benzene with 1,3,5-tris(mercaptomethyl)benzene H 3 L 3 or the 24% optimized yield from 1,3,5-tris(bromomethyl)benzene and Na 2 S (ref.). Surprisingly, no evidence of ring opened, oligomeric thiother products has been observed using our route (Supplementary Figs 15, 16 and 21). Remarkably, this entire two-step self-assembly and capture method can be performed in one pot: treatment of H 3 L 3 with SbCl 3, I 2 and HMPT also forms 3 as observed by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. 11). Thioether 3 is known to serve as a starting point to form cyclophane 4 from established procedures.

### Two-electron transfer stabilized by excited-state aromatization [^77232f42]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

In the comparative analysis between the experimental and calculated IR spectra (Fig. 3), the IR spectrum calculated for the S 0 state of TMTQ showed excellent consistency with that obtained experimentally. This reveals that the S 0 optimized geometry derived from calculations and the true ground electronic state molecular structure of TMTQ are certainly close. To obtain valuable theoretical data for IR spectra in the excited states, TD-DFT calculations were carried out in the S 1 and T 1 states. These two lowest lying related excited states are well known to be structurally similar in closed-shell molecules. On the other hand, the accurate prediction of spectroscopic properties in the excited states of π-conjugated molecules remains a challenge for quantum chemical methods, a situation which is particularly difficult for the elucidation of excited-singlet states and significantly ameliorated in the corresponding triplet state due to the distinctive electron-electron correlation. Hence, it is sometimes preferred to consider TD-DFT calculations of the excited triplet state to understand the homolog excited-singlet state rather than conduct them on the singlet state itself. Going to the current results in our study, the experimental transient IR spectrum of TMTQ is compared with those obtained for the S 0 and T 1 states (Supplementary Figs. 11 – 13) from which we observe that, in line with the discussion above, the resemblance to the T 1 state is better than that for the S 1 state, from which we consider the former to qualitatively understand the changes in the transient IR experimental spectrum and use these results to guide and address the qualitative changes in molecular geometries and conformations in the excited two-electron CT state.

The wavefunctions are drawn at their respective binding energies, in orange for the mixed potential and in blue for the triplet F = 1 potential. b Measured spectrum. The energy axis is shared with the theoretical potential shown on the left. The peaks are labeled with the vibrational quantum numbers ν m for the mixed potential and ν t for the triplet F = 1 potential.

A peculiar property of trilobite Rydberg molecules is their large permanent electric dipole moment. This stems from the large concentration of the electron density at the position of the ground state atom (see Fig. 1 b). The dipole moments are measured by applying an electric field and observing the broadening of the molecular line. Close to zero field, the full width at half maximum obtained from a Lorentzian fit to the molecular peaks is 7 MHz. As the rotational splitting (60 kHz) can therefore not be resolved in our experiment, we fit the spectra with the convolution of a Lorentzian with a step function of width 2 d E. From the fitted widths d E for different electric fields we can deduce the dipole moment as shown in Fig. 4. We find electric dipole moments up to ~ 1700 Debye, which corresponds to 0.8 times the internuclear distance. This reflects the highly efficient binding mechanism, which accumulates the electron density at the location of the ground state atom. For the theoretical calculation of the dipole moments we write the electronic wavefunction at internuclear distance R on the basis of the unperturbed statesand then integrate over the vibrational wavefunction Φ

### On the nature of hydrogen bonding in the HS dimer [^9fdff5fb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

However, only a single vibrational transition in (H 2 S) 2 is predicted to be intensive enough for observation in this frequency range. Thus, the assignment of the IR spectra was up to now a puzzle to be solved. Here, we present an intermolecular potential surface and use it to predict the different tunneling energy levels of the H 2 S dimer as well as its far-infrared spectrum, and compare them to those of the water dimer. We used our helium nanodroplet machine in Bochum to record the first mass-selective measurement of IR spectra of small H 2 S clusters. Based on these measurements, we can unambiguously assign three bands to the H 2 S dimer, while in the same frequency range also trimer bands are observed. After increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, we were able to resolve a rotational substructure of each of the dimer bands. As explained in the Methods section, H 2 S (just as H 2 O) has two different nuclear spin isomers, called para and ortho H 2 S (pH 2 S and oH 2 S), which have different rotational states. Based on the observed nuclear spin multiplicitiess of alternating rotational levels, see the table in the Methods section, we could assign the observed IR absorption peaks at 2598.2, 2602.0 and 2604.2 cm −1 to the donor bound S-H stretch mode in ortho-ortho, ortho-para, and para-para H 2 S dimers and additional bands to larger clusters. So far, only transitions in one of these species —ortho-para—had been observed in microwave studies, which provided the rotational constants of its lowest two states. In contrast to the tetrahedral structure of ice, in the condensed form of H 2 S each molecule is surrounded by twelve neighbors,, indicating a more isotropic and less directional intermolecular potential. The binding energy D e was calculated to be about 7 kJ/mol, which is roughly one third of the D e of the water dimer, indicating a shallower potential energy surface.

### Identifying eigen-like hydrated protons at negatively charged interfaces [^d6a8f05d]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Despite the importance of the hydrogen ion in a wide range of biological, chemical, and physical processes, its molecular structure in solution remains lively debated. Progress has been primarily hampered by the extreme diffuse nature of the vibrational signatures of hydrated protons in bulk solution. Using the inherently surface-specific vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy technique, we show that at selected negatively charged interfaces, a resolved spectral feature directly linked to the H 3 O + core in an Eigen-like species can be readily identified in a biologically compatible pH range. Centered at ~2540cm -1 , the band is seen to shift to ~1875cm -1 when forming D 3 O + upon isotopic substitution. The results offer the possibility of tracking and understanding from a molecular perspective the behavior of hydrated protons at charged interfaces.

### Living supramolecular polymerization of fluorinated cyclohexanes [^f454abae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Variable temperature CD measurements of M 3 at slow cooling and heating rates (0.5 K min −1) revealed pronounced hysteresis (Fig. 3c). For monomer M 2, in which only two methylene groups separate all-cis C 6 H 6 F 5 and the amide bond, hysteresis was also observed but the T e during cooling was 11 K higher (Supplementary Fig. 10), while for monomer M 4 hysteresis was negligible and oligomeric species were observed already at 328 K (Supplementary Fig. 10). The observation of hysteresis and the distinct differences observed for M 2, M 3, and M 4 can be explained by the varying ability of these monomers to form intramolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds, whose strength should heavily depend on the length of the spacer.

We therefore proceeded to gather experimental and computational evidence for monomer folding. First, we investigated whether the kinetic stability of M 3 (Fig. 3a) may be a result of intramolecular interactions by studying the kinetics of the polymerization at different concentrations at a constant temperature of 293 K. At all concentrations studied, we observed sigmoidal kinetic curves with lag times decreasing upon increasing concentration of M 3 (Supplementary Fig. 11). DLS analyses performed on 1.2 mM solution of M 3 in the solvent mixture used for kinetic studies (cyclohexane/chloroform 84:16 v/v) displayed a unimodal scattering peak with a hydrodynamic diameter of ~ 1.1 nm (Supplementary Fig. 12). The diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) of M 3 (1.2 mM in C 6 D 12 /CDCl 3 84:16 v/v at 295 K) provided a diffusion coefficient similar to non-assembling and non-folding reference compound Ref 2 (Supplementary Figs. 13, 14). While these results clearly indicate that no off-pathway aggregates are involved, we also attempted to study folding more directly by variable temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopy. To this end, a 1.2 mM solution of M 3 in C 6 D 12 /CDCl 3 (84:16 v/v) was cooled from 333 to 283 K, revealing a strong temperature-dependence of the chemical shift of the amide and aromatic protons, which is in agreement with the expected temperature-dependence of the equilibrium between unfolded and folded states (Supplementary Figs. 15, 16). In a 19 F/ 1 H-HOESY NMR experiment on M 1 in 30 mM solution (CDCl 3), we observed weak 19 F/ 1 H NOE of two fluorine atoms in all-cis C 6 H 6 F 5 with both amide and aromatic protons (Supplementary Fig. 18). Fourier-transform infrared spectral measurement (FT-IR) performed with 1.2 mM solution of M 3 C 6 H 12 /CHCl 3 (84:16 v/v) revealed no presence of stretching frequency corresponding to hydrogen-bonded amide hydrogens but small shifts of amide I band which could be attributed to the formation of CH···π interactions between all-cis C 6 H 6 F 5 and aromatic ring (Supplementary Figs. 23, 24). Combined HOESY and FTIR results confirm that folding is indeed present but likely not limited to a single structure and conventional C=O···H–N intramolecular hydrogen bond.

### Synthesis and reactivity of a mononuclear non-haem cobalt (IV)-oxo complex [^80956e13]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Terminal cobalt(IV)-oxo (Co IV -O) species have been implicated as key intermediates in various cobalt-mediated oxidation reactions. Herein we report the photocatalytic generation of a mononuclear non-haem [(13-TMC)Co IV (O)] 2+ (2) by irradiating [Co II (13-TMC)(CF 3 SO 3 )] + (1) in the presence of [Ru II (bpy) 3 ] 2+ , Na 2 S 2 O 8 , and water as an oxygen source. The intermediate 2 was also obtained by reacting 1 with an artificial oxidant (that is, iodosylbenzene) and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. In particular, the resonance Raman spectrum of 2 reveals a diatomic Co-O vibration band at 770cm -1 , which provides the conclusive evidence for the presence of a terminal Co-O bond. In reactivity studies, 2 was shown to be a competent oxidant in an intermetal oxygen atom transfer, C-H bond activation and olefin epoxidation reactions. The present results lend strong credence to the intermediacy of Co IV -O species in cobalt-catalysed oxidation of organic substrates as well as in the catalytic oxidation of water that evolves molecular oxygen.

### Maximizing spectral sensitivity without compromising resolution in phase-incremented, steady-state solution NMR [^6e837a21]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is an essential tool in contemporary chemistry, widely used in both academia and industry to derive molecular structures, dynamics and concentrations –. Whether carried on liquid or solid samples, whether focusing on glasses or on living organisms, nearly all NMR experiments follow Anderson-and-Ernst’s Nobel-award-winning Fourier Transform (FT) proposition –. That is not surprising as FT-NMR is simple, general, and provides excellent resolution while covering large spectral bandwidths. Furthermore, and crucial in its eventual adoption as “the” way of collecting NMR data, FT-NMR exhibits better signal-to-noise ratio per(SNR t) than alternative frequency-domain-based approaches. However, it is also known that if spectral resolution and the faithful coverage of peak intensities over large bandwidths are not a must, the Anderson-Ernst FT-NMR proposal is not necessarily optimal for achieving the highest SNR t : when T 1 ≈ T 2, as is often in solution-state experiments, and if a peak’s offset and the excitation pulse angle can be chosen at will, Carr’s steady-state free-precession (SSFP) NMR can often provide a superior SNR t –. While instances where SSFP could become a method of choice in spectroscopic applications have been described in low-resolution and in solid-state NMR and NQR –, the aforementioned limitations have constrained SSFP’s use to MRI –where it is widely exploited under variety of vendor-dependent acronyms –. SNR t advantages were also here the defining reasons of why MRI, a widely used yet costly medical imaging modality where both scanning duration and data quality are of essence, was quick to adopt SSFP. Indeed, with a focus on a single water resonance whose offset can be chosen more-or-less at will and with T 1 and T 2 times that are reasonably close, MRI was also uniquely posed to deal with SSFP’s main two drawbacks: its lack of spectral resolution, and its strong dependence on the offset (i.e. the chemical shift) of the targeted peaks. SSFP’s spectral resolution limitations can be adumbrated from its pulse sequence, which involves a train of closely spaced pulses with constant flip-angle α, applied at repetition times« T 2,T 1 (Fig. 1, top). This leads to signals S(t) that are a combination of free induction decays (FIDs) and of multiple echoes –the latter reflecting, at each TR, a sum of histories associated to different coherence transfer pathways – (or as known in the MRI literature, to different extended phase diagrams,) refocusing at the top of every pulse in the sequence. SSFP’s SNR t potential and offset dependence –qualities which will both be central in this study– are highlighted in Fig. 1 (bottom). It follows from these extensively verified predictions that steady-state pulses can lead to transverse magnetizations reaching up to 50% of the thermal equilibrium magnetization, in a nearly constant emission of NMR signals. Such feat, however, requires the resonance being addressed to have a suitable, a priori known offset Δ, and the use of relatively large flip angles α. The issue of offset-dependence has been particularly detrimental in high-resolution NMR settings: given SSFP’s repeated pulsing, offsets will arise (e.g. an on-resonance situation) where a steady, large-flip-angle pulsing with a constant phase (e.g. x), will lead to a null (M x,y ≈ 0) signal. Furthermore, given SSFP’s periodicity, its offset-dependent excitation profile will repeat itself modulo. When coupling to this alternating dark/bright spectral pattern the limited spectral resolution arising from its demand for short TRs, it is clear why SSFP’s SNR t advantages were no match against the generality and convenience of FT-NMR. Thus SSFP, together with related driven-equilibrium options, have remained in the fringes of spectroscopic NMR applications.

### A molecular movie of ultrafast singlet fission [^7106d4bc]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Identification of transferred coherence

To elucidate the origin of the different contributions in the 1 TT vibrational coherence spectrum and how it is affected by the S 1 → 1 TT crossing event, we carried out impulsive Raman reference measurements on 1 TT after the initial singlet fission dynamics were complete (9 ps after photoexcitation, with a Raman pulse tuned to the 1 TT excited-state absorption, see Methods for details). In Fig. 3, we compare the resulting intrinsic 1 TT Raman spectrum (purple) with the transferred S 1 → 1 TT spectrum isolated earlier (blue). Both exhibit the same high-frequency signature bands (>1200 cm −1) with similar intensity ratios. In the lower-frequency region, however, we observe numerous modes (127, 793, 1126 and 1207 cm −1) with strongly enhanced intensities in the S 1 → 1 TT Raman spectrum.

Fig. 3 
Identification of transferred coherence. Comparison of impulsive Raman spectra directly generated in 1 TT (bottom, purple) and transferred from S 1 via singlet fission (top, blue, reproduced from Fig. 2). Experimental spectra are normalised to the high-frequency peak at 1392 cm −1, which is truncated for clarity. Arrows indicate regions where singlet fission increases the peak (coherence) intensity. Dashed vertical lines are a guide to the eye indicating the dominant vibrational modes

Studies of photoinduced internal conversion in β-caroteneand rhodopsinsuggest that vibrational modes which show similar frequencies and relative intensities in both Raman spectra (intrinsic and transferred) can be assigned to tuning modes of the underlying photochemical process. Such modes are required in a process mediated by a conical intersection or avoided crossing to yield electronic degeneracy between initial and final electronic states, but they take no active part in the reaction. In contrast, the presence of additional modes in the transferred coherence Raman spectrum has been largely unexplored. While the exact nature of these modes cannot be obtained from our experiments, the difference between transferred and intrinsically generated impulsive Raman spectra reflects a fundamental difference in the mechanism of vibrational coherence generation (see Supplementary Discussion, section 3, for further discussion).

### A hyperpolarized equilibrium for magnetic resonance [^8257e554]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging (MRI) play an indispensable role in science and healthcare but use only a tiny fraction of their potential. No more than ≈10p.p.m. of all ¹H nuclei are effectively detected in a 3-Tesla clinical MRI system. Thus, a vast array of new applications lays dormant, awaiting improved sensitivity. Here we demonstrate the continuous polarization of small molecules in solution to a level that cannot be achieved in a viable magnet. The magnetization does not decay and is effectively reinitialized within seconds after being measured. This effect depends on the long-lived, entangled spin-order of parahydrogen and an exchange reaction in a low magnetic field of 10⁻³ Tesla. We demonstrate the potential of this method by fast MRI and envision the catalysis of new applications such as cancer screening or indeed low-field MRI for routine use and remote application.

### Automatic structure-based NMR methyl resonance assignment in large proteins [^e46eb96b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Therefore, we sought to address the performance of MethylFLYA starting solely from 2D HMQC and 4D methyl–methyl NOESY spectra, whilst being ‘blind’ to the known 1 H- 13 C resonance frequencies and methyl residue types. To this end, we performed both manual and automated peak picking of both the 2D [1 H, 13 C]-HMQC and 4D methyl–methyl NOESY spectra of EIN (see Methods, Supplementary Table 5, Supplementary Figs. 6, 7). The methyl residue types (Ala, Ile, and ambiguous Leu/Val), were assigned based on the BMRB chemical shift statisticsand the known number of expected peaks of different residue types (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 7). The high degree of overlap between the average methyl chemical shifts of Leu and Val rendered them difficult to separate, and therefore MethylFLYA treated them as ambiguous. The methyl peaks falling in overlapping regions for other residue types, i.e. Ala and Leu/Val, were either assigned a type based on the “best guess” (see Methods, Supplementary Fig. 7), or assigned ambiguously to the three possible types (Ala or ambiguous Leu/Val). As anticipated, when provided with the minimum amount of information, the percentage of strong (confident) assignments dropped significantly, from 74% attained when using the unfiltered methyl–methyl NOESY peak list, the known 1 H- 13 C frequencies with known residue types, and the geminal Leu/Val resonance pairing (Fig. 2), to 30% or 24% when using only the manually or CYPICK-analyzed [1 H, 13 C]-HMQC and 4D methyl–methyl NOESY spectra, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7D). Nonetheless, the accuracy of the strong assignments remained high with only three and four methyls assigned incorrectly for manually- and CYPICK-acquired peak lists, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7E). The robustness of MethylFLYA to the highly ambiguous and partially incorrect input information is notable, especially when considering that the BMRB-derived assignment of residue types led to seven resonances with incorrectly assigned methyl residue type labels (Supplementary Fig. 7A, B). In fact, the assignment reflected this erroneous input information, as Ala12 and Ala160, that were attributed the wrong residue type, were assigned incorrectly by both approaches (Supplementary Fig. 7A, E). We here note that the user can use structure-based methyl resonance predictors, such as SHIFTX2, to flag the methyls that are expected to deviate significantly from BMRB chemical shift statistics and therefore likely to acquire an incorrect residue type label and subsequent misassignment (Supplementary Fig. 8). In addition, the user can exclude from consideration any strong assignments to the methyl resonances with a highly ambiguous residue type (i.e. Ala or ambiguous Leu/Val). If structure-based methyl resonance prediction is applied to exclude from consideration any strong assignments of the methyls that are expected to have a misassigned residue type (Supplementary Fig. 8), the assignment errors are reduced to only one or two methyls using manually or CYPICK-acquired peak lists, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7E (i), (iii)). Attributing the methyl peaks in the overlapped regions of Ala/Val methyl residue types to both Ala and Leu/Val resulted in a somewhat higher percentage of strong assignments, but a further increase in errors (Supplementary Fig. 7D), and is therefore not recommended with the present implementation of MethylFLYA.

### Perspectives on NMR in drug discovery: a technique comes of age [^a01347d9]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2008). Medium credibility.

In the past decade, the potential of harnessing the ability of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to monitor intermolecular interactions as a tool for drug discovery has been increasingly appreciated in academia and industry.

### Hyperpolarized nanodiamond with long spin-relaxation times [^2482f03d]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The use of hyperpolarized agents in magnetic resonance, such as (13)C-labelled compounds, enables powerful new imaging and detection modalities that stem from a 10,000-fold boost in signal. A major challenge for the future of the hyperpolarization technique is the inherently short spin-relaxation times, typically <60s for (13)C liquid-state compounds, which limit the time that the signal remains boosted. Here we demonstrate that 1.1% natural abundance (13)C spins in synthetic nanodiamond can be hyperpolarized at cryogenic and room temperature without the use of free radicals, and, owing to their solid-state environment, exhibit relaxation times exceeding 1h. Combined with the already established applications of nanodiamonds in the life sciences as inexpensive fluorescent markers and non-cytotoxic substrates for gene and drug delivery, these results extend the theranostic capabilities of nanoscale diamonds into the domain of hyperpolarized magnetic resonance.

### Gadoterate meglumine (Dotarem) [^17d41cf0]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Gadoterate is a paramagnetic molecule that develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. The magnetic moment enhances the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of tissues.

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occurs with:

differences in proton density
differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1)
differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2)

When placed in a magnetic field, gadoterate shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in target tissues. At recommended doses, the effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in the T1-weighted sequences.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Gadoterate affects proton relaxation times and consequently the MR signal, and the contrast obtained is characterized by the relaxivity of the gadoterate molecule. The relaxivity values for gadoterate are similar across the spectrum of magnetic field strengths used in clinical MRI (0.2 - 1.5 T).

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity allows distribution of gadoterate in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and infarcts.

### Dimethyl sulfone in human cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma confirmed by one-dimensional (1) H and two-dimensional (1) H-(13) C NMR [^f2328279]. NMR in Biomedicine (2005). Low credibility.

(1)H-NMR spectroscopy at 500 MHz was used to confirm that a previously unidentified singlet resonance at 3.14 ppm in the spectra of cerebrospinal fluid and plasma samples corresponds to dimethyl sulfone (DMSO(2)). A triple resonance inverse cryogenic NMR probe, with pre-amplifier and the RF-coils cooled to low temperature, was used to obtain an (1)H-(13)C HSQC spectrum of CSF containing 8 microM (753 ng/ml) DMSO(2). The (1)H-(13)C correlation signal for DMSO(2) was assigned by comparison with the spectrum from an authentic reference sample. In plasma and CSF from healthy controls, the concentration of DMSO(2) ranged between 0 and 25 micromol/l. The concentration of DMSO(2) in plasma from three of four patients with severe methionine adenosyltransferase I/III (MAT I/III) deficiency was about twice the maximum observed for controls. Thus, DMSO(2) occurs as a regular metabolite at low micromolar concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma. It derives from dietary sources, from intestinal bacterial metabolism and from human endogenous methanethiol metabolism.

### Time-and site-resolved kinetic NMR for real-time monitoring of off-equilibrium reactions by 2D spectrotemporal correlations [^7bd5b145]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Chemical kinetics from 2D spectrotemporal NMR correlations: overall principles

At the heart of the spectrally-resolved kinetic NMR experiment hereby discussed is the co-application of rapid-mixing flow methodologies with ultrafast spatial-spectral imaging schemes. To understand how the combined use of these two modalities allows for the real-time observation of off-equilibrium reactions, consider a situation in which a chemical reaction is initiated by the rapid mixing of reagents. These reagents then flow with uniform plug-like velocity through a vertical NMR tube with both ends open. The tube is wrapped by an observation (e.g. Helmholtz) coil, where flow occurs in the z direction parallel to the external field, while the coil is located downstream from the point of mixing (Fig. 1A). Suppose as well that the spin magnetization of at least one of the reactants is pre-polarized, and that the flow is calibrated in such a manner that regions located near the bottom and top of the NMR coil contain predominantly reactants and products, respectively; i.e. concentration changes and intermediate transient reaction species occur at locations within the NMR coil’s field of view. Then, under conditions of stable, continuous, and plug-like flow, each point located at a defined distance away from the point of mixing will contain a unique set of chemical species that correspond to a particular time point along the reaction coordinate (Fig. 1B). This in turn will give rise to a unique, z -dependent NMR spectrum, whereby the unidirectional flow maps in a one-to-one fashion the reaction coordinate of the kinetic process onto the z spatial dimension of the NMR coil. Thus, even though the NMR-emitting spins are changing with respect to time due to the kinetics and varying their positions due to the flow, each z position will yield a distinct, steady NMR spectrum that corresponds to a definite moment in the reaction process (Fig. 1C). Given such a scenario, it is possible to retrieve temporally-resolved kinetic information about how the reaction affects individual chemical sites, using a 2D chemical shift imaging approach – in which gradient-based imaging manipulations resolve, while maintaining chemical site resolution, NMR spectra arising along distinct positions of the z spatial axis. While numerous spectroscopic imaging approaches can do this, speed is also of the essence in this particular case, as the syringe-driven kinetic steady state cannot be maintained indefinitely. Consequently, we decided to employ the echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) readout block (Fig. 1D) –, which delivers 2D spatial/spectral NMR datasets in a single scan, correlating the spins’ position using a single-axis gradient (in this case, the direction of the flow along the z axis) in one dimension, with chemical shifts along the orthogonal dimension. The EPSI signal readout occurs while oscillating a bipolar gradient that repeatedly de-phases and re-phases the transverse spin magnetization, resulting in a series of gradient echoes modulated in time by the chemical shift evolution (and by J -couplings, here disregarded). Achieving the desired spectrally-resolved 1D images is accomplished by post-processing, which first involves splicing the 1D EPSI signal (FID) into a 2D matrix, whereby each gradient echo is placed in a single row and indexed as a function of a time variable t 2 (Fig. 1E). In this way, the z spatial information is encoded along rows defined by a wavenumber k z, while t 2 encodes down each column the chemical shifts – whose evolution is unaffected by the oscillating gradients. After such rearrangement, which may include appropriate alignment of the even and odd gradient echoes, 2D Fourier transformation with respect to k z and t 2 reveals the spectrally-resolved 1D spatial profiles for each chemical site. If the time T a required to collect each gradient echo (≈100–500 µs) is small with respect to the timescale of the kinetic process, this 2D dataset then reflects the underlying kinetics affecting each chemical site over the course of the reaction (Fig. 1F).

### Singlet oxygen-mediated selective C-H bond hydroperoxidation of ethereal hydrocarbons [^41c73f70]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Synthetic applications

To explore the synthetic application of such a unique singlet O 2 -mediated α-ethereal C–H bond functionalization, many cyclic/linear aliphatic ether-containing substrates were subjected to photo irradiation in the presence of air and a photosensitizer. Tables 1 and 2 show many aliphatic cyclic and linear ether substrates can react with singlet O 2 to form hydroperoxides and/or lactones with yields ranging from 24 to 90% after 8-12 h blue LED light irradiation at room temperature in the presence of a Lewis acid, γ-Al 2 O 3 under 1 atm O 2 atmosphere. In the absence of γ-Al 2 O 3, the same products were obtained in lower yields. When the substrates contain both α-methylene C–H and α-methine C–H bonds, the hydroperoxidation occurs selectively and exclusively at the methine C–H bond (Table 1, entries 6–8). Upon co-existence of α-benzylic C–H and α-methylene C–H bonds, the hydroperoxidation occurs selectively and exclusively at the α-benzylic C–H bond (Table 2, entries 14 and 15). To further explore the possibility of using singlet O 2 for α-ethereal C–H bond functionalization of ethereal molecules with complex structures, (-)-ambroxide (1s) was photolyzed in a dichloromethane-acetonitrile (9:1) solution in the presence of meso -TPP (1 × 10 −5 M) and 10 mol% triethyl borane (Et 3 B). After 15 h blue LED light irradiation, sclareolide (3s) was obtained with 72% yield (Fig. 2a). The product was confirmed by 1 H/ 13 C NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray diffraction (see Supplementary Fig. 29 and 30). As expected, lactonization occurs selectively and exclusively at α-ethereal C–H bond of this macrocyclic ether, but not at methyl, methylene or methine C–H bonds. Only trace amounts of hydroperoxide product were observed, which were characterized by 1 H-NMR. When pitofenone was subjected to a reaction with singlet O 2, an ester was formed selectively at the methylene site adjacent to the ethereal oxygen, but not at those adjacent to tertiary amine site (Fig. 2b).

### Nearest-neighbor NMR spectroscopy: categorizing spectral peaks by their adjacent nuclei [^18669f80]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Methyl-NMR enables atomic-resolution studies of structure and dynamics of large proteins in solution. However, resonance assignment remains challenging. The problem is to combine existing structural informational with sparse distance restraints and search for the most compatible assignment among the permutations. Prior classification of peaks as either from isoleucine, leucine, or valine reduces the search space by many orders of magnitude. However, this is hindered by overlapped leucine and valine frequencies. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor nuclei, coupled to the methyl carbons, resonate in distinct frequency bands. Here, we develop a framework to imprint additional information about passively coupled resonances onto the observed peaks. This depends on simultaneously orchestrating closely spaced bands of resonances along different magnetization trajectories, using principles from control theory. For methyl-NMR, the method is implemented as a modification to the standard fingerprint spectrum (the 2D-HMQC). The amino acid type is immediately apparent in the fingerprint spectrum. There is no additional relaxation loss or an increase in experimental time. The method is validated on biologically relevant proteins. The idea of generating new spectral information using passive, adjacent resonances is applicable to other contexts in NMR spectroscopy.

### Proton mediated spin state transition of cobalt heme analogs [^841fd72c]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The spin state transition from low spin to high spin upon substrate addition is one of the key steps in cytochrome P450 catalysis. External perturbations such as pH and hydrogen bonding can also trigger the spin state transition of hemes through deprotonated histidine (e.g. Cytochrome c). In this work, we report the isolated 2-methylimidazole Cobalt(II) [Co(TPP)(2-MeHIm)] and [Co(TTP)(2-MeHIm)], and the corresponding 2-methylimidazolate derivatives where the N-H proton of axial 2-MeHIm is removed. Interestingly, various spectroscopies including EPR and XAFS determine a high-spin state (S=3/2) for the imidazolate derivatives, in contrast to the low-spin state (S=1/2) of all known imidazole analogs. DFT assisted stereoelectronic investigations are applied to understand the metal-ligand interactions, which suggest that the dramatically displaced metal center allowing a promotion e g (d π )→b 1g ([Formula: see text]) is crucial for the occurrence of the spin state transition.

### A cell-free platform for the prenylation of natural products and application to cannabinoid production [^87e8d0be]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

NMR spectroscopy

NMR spectroscopy was used to identify prenyl-products, and quantify 5-p-1,6-DHN. The PyOx/PTA cell-free system was used to produce prenyl-DHN. A total of 200 µL reactions were pooled, and extracted three times with an equivalent amount of nonane and then the nonane was evaporated. The product of the reactions was suspended in 500 µL of deuterated methanol (CD 3 OD), with 2 mM 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as an internal standard. Spectra were collected on an AV400 Bruker NMR spectrometer. The amount of the prenylated compound in the sample was determined with reference to the internal TMB standard. We compared the proton signal from TMB (3H, singlet) at 6.05 ppm with an aromatic proton corresponding to 5-p-1,6-DHN (1H, doublet) at 7.27 ppm.

NMR was also used to identify the product of the enzymatic system with divarinic acid as the aromatic substrate. The PyOx/PTA system was set up as detailed above, and the reactions were quenched at 24 h. The reactions were extracted as detailed above (under the subheading: Quenching Reactions), and analyzed on the HPLC. There was a new major peak at 6.7 min that we predicted to be the prenylated divarinic acid. We HPLC purified the peak, removed the solvent, and redissolved the pure component in 600 µL of CD 3 OD. A proton spectrum collected with an AV500 Bruker NMR spectrometer was compared to a proton spectrum published by Shoyama et al.for CBGVA to confirm that CBGVA was the main product. Based on the report by Shoyama et al. the study by Bohlmann et al. we conclude that the prenylation of divarinic acid occurs at the C3 carbon of divarinic acid. Shoyoma et al.published the chemical shifts of CBGVA in CD 3 OD, so by direct comparison of our NMR spectra to the published chemical shifts we conclude that we produced CBGVA. This is further supported by the work conducted by Bohlmann, which suggests that if the prenylation occurred at the C5 site, we would observe a proton with a chemical shift around 5.8 ppm, which we did not observe, Supplementary Figure 11.

The luminescence quantum yields of the L-OMe coordinated complexes (3 : 1.1%, 5 : 1.4%, 7 : 2.8%) were found to be significantly higher than those of the L-H coordinated (1 : 1.9%) or L-NMe 2 coordinated (2 : >0.1%, 4 : 0.4%, 6 : 0.5%) compounds. All complexes were found to have excited state lifetimes in the nanosecond range (Supplementary Figs. 31 – 37) in degassed (222–542 ns) and aerated saturated (36–96 ns) solutions. As the lifetimes drastically decrease in the presence of air, it indicates that the excited state can interact with a component in the air. For identification of the type of ROS produced upon light exposure, electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was employed using the singlet oxygen (1 O 2) scavenger 2,2,6,6–tetramethylpiperidine and the • OOH or • OH radical scavenger 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N -oxide. While no signals for the formation of • OOH or • OH radicals were detected, the formation of 1 O 2 in acetonitrile and PBS was confirmed by observation of the characteristic 1 O 2 -induced triplet signal in the ESR spectrum (Supplementary Figs. 38 – 44). The amount of generated 1 O 2 was quantitatively determined by two methods: directly by measurement of the phosphorescence of 1 O 2 ; indirectly by monitoring the change in absorbance of a 1 O 2 scavenger. The singlet oxygen quantum yields were found to be between 16–77% in acetonitrile and 1–11% in an aqueous solution (Table 1). The comparison between the values indicates that the L-OMe coordinated complexes (3, 5, 7) are able to produce 1 O 2 more efficiently than 1 and the L-NMe 2 coordinated Ru(II) complexes (2, 4, 6). Overall, complex 7 was found with the highest singlet oxygen quantum yield (acetonitrile: 68–77%, aqueous solution: 10–11%).

### 1H MRS studies in the Finnish boron neutron capture therapy project: detection of 10B-carrier, L-p-boronophenylalanine-fructose [^a50280fb]. European Journal of Radiology (2005). Low credibility.

This article summarizes the current status of 1H MRS in detecting and quantifying a boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) boron carrier, L-p-boronophenylalanine-fructose (BPA-F) in vivo in the Finnish BNCT project. The applicability of 1H MRS to detect BPA-F is evaluated and discussed in a typical situation with a blood containing resection cavity within the gross tumour volume (GTV). 1H MRS is not an ideal method to study BPA concentration in GTV with blood in recent resection cavity. For an optimal identification of BPA signals in the in vivo 1H MR spectrum, both pre- and post-infusion 1H MRS should be performed. The post-infusion spectroscopy studies should be scheduled either prior to or, less optimally, immediately after the BNCT. The pre-BNCT MRS is necessary in order to utilise the MRS results in the actual dose planning.

### Gadobutrol [^d92c16c5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occurs with:

Differences in proton density
Differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1)
Differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2)

When placed in a magnetic field, gadobutrol shortens the T1and T2relaxation times. The extent of decrease of T1and T2relaxation times, and therefore the amount of signal enhancement obtained from gadobutrol, is based upon several factors including the concentration of gadobutrol in the tissue, the field strength of the MRI system, and the relative ratio of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times. At the recommended dose, the T1shortening effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequences. In T2*-weighted sequences the induction of local magnetic field inhomogeneities by the large magnetic moment of gadolinium and at high concentrations (during bolus injection) leads to a signal decrease.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Gadobutrol leads to distinct shortening of the relaxation times even in low concentrations. At pH 7, 37°C and 1.5 T, the relaxivity (r1) - determined from the influence on the relaxation times (T1) of protons in plasma - is 5.2 L/(mmol·sec) and the relaxivity (r2) - determined from the influence on the relaxation times (T2) - is 6.1 L/(mmol·sec). These relaxivities display only slight dependence on the strength of the magnetic field. The T1shortening effect of paramagnetic contrast agents is dependent on concentration and r1relaxivity (see Table 3). This may improve tissue visualization.

Compared to 0.5 molar gadolinium-based contrast agents, the higher concentration of gadobutrol results in half the volume of administration and a more compact contrast bolus injection. At the site of imaging, the relative height and width of the time intensity curve for gadobutrol varies as a function of imaging location and multiple patient, injection, and device-specific factors.

Gadobutrol is a water-soluble, hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient between n-butanol and buffer at pH 7.6 of about 0.006.

### Automated NMR resonance assignments and structure determination using a minimal set of 4D spectra [^85cbb338]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

NMR remains the only biophysical technique that can deliver high-resolution structures of proteins and other biomolecules in their functional, aqueous environment, which constitutes the basis for studying interactions with other molecules and therapeutic compounds. However, standard approaches for NMR resonance assignment rely on recording several complementary datasets which can be limiting for larger, more complex systems due to increased resonance overlap and require a significant time investment by a trained expert to analyze the spectra and establish a complete list of resonance assignments aided by computational tools. Established methods to overcome this problem utilize selective isotopic labeling, which can be limiting in terms of the information content present in the NMR data, expensive and challenging to perform for certain systems.

Here, we propose an automated approach for full structure determination using 2–3 4D NMR spectra recorded on a 13 C, 15 N uniformly labeled sample. First, 4D-CHAINS addresses the assignment problem in an efficient and highly robust manner, yielding the correct assignments for at least 95% of residues and error rates of less than 1.5% (Supplementary Table 1). It is further worth noting that the vast majority of resonances corresponding to sidechain methyls, which are important probes in identifying the protein fold, are correctly assigned by our method. Therefore, the use of 4D-CHAINS allows near-complete assignment of sidechain methyls without the need for site-specific labeling on a perdeuterated background(Supplementary Table 4). Second, autoNOE-Rosetta uses a highly parallelizable iterative algorithm run on a computer cluster to perform assignment of long-range NOEs alongside the structure determination process. The full pipeline takes approximately 10–12 days to execute for a typical protein sample, including the time needed for NMR data acquisition, and requires minimum supervision.

Hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen generation

We next determined if Hf-DBB-Ru could generate both hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen upon X-ray irradiation (Fig. 1g). Hydroxyl radicals were detected via aminophenylfluorescein (APF) assay, in which APF reacts with hydroxyl radicals to give bright green fluorescence at 515 nm upon excitation at 490 nm. The amount of APF trapped in Hf-DBB-Ru or Hf-DBA was first estimated by detecting chemically produced hydroxyl radicals using APF in the presence of the nMOF. The percentage of APF trapped in the nMOF is approximated to one minus the fluorescence intensity ratio of APF with nMOF over that of APF without nMOF (Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. 4). An aqueous solution or an aqueous dispersion of Hf-DBB-Ru or Hf-DBA at a Hf concentration of 20 μM was added 5 μM APF and then irradiated with X-ray in the dose range of 0 to 10 Gy. The fluorescence signals at 515 nm were detected. We deduced the fluorescence intensity corresponding to the amounts of hydroxyl radicals generated by Hf-DBB-Ru, Hf-DBA, and H 2 O by correcting for the percentage of APF trapped in the nMOF (Fig. 1h). Hydroxyl radical generation for all groups increased linearly with X-ray dose and the relative enhancement of hydroxyl radical generation compared with water was determined to be 54.2% and 30.5% for Hf-DBB-Ru and Hf-DBA, respectively.

We used singlet oxygen sensor green (SOSG) assay to detect singlet oxygen generation by Hf-DBB-Ru. 12.5 μM SOSG was added to an aqueous solution or an aqueous dispersion of Hf-DBB-Ru or Hf-DBA at a Hf concentration of 20 μM and irradiated with X-ray in the dose range of 0 to 3 Gy. The fluorescence signals at 540 nm for DBB-Ru and Hf-DBA were determined by subtracting that of an aqueous solution. As shown in Fig. 1i, Hf-DBB-Ru showed significant SOSG signal while Hf-DBA showed no singlet oxygen generation. APF and SOSG assays thus show that Hf-DBB-Ru generates both hydroxyl radical by Hf 6 SBUs via radiosensitization and singlet oxygen through energy transfer from Hf 6 SBUs to DBB-Ru ligands upon X-ray irradiation.

### Ultrafast bridge planarization in donor-π-acceptor copolymers drives intramolecular charge transfer [^bbb45ee4]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

FSRS of TDPP-BBT polymer

The structural evolution of polymer subsequent to the photoexcitation and the generation of the ICT character in the singlet manifold of states is probed by recording time-resolved Raman snapshots using FSRS. In order to be in-resonance selectively with the excitonic state, we collected Stokes shifted Raman data with 816 nm Raman pump pulse and compressed broadband probe pulse with a spectral range of 850−1300 nm. The excited state was populated using 0.25 mW actinic pulse centered at 650 nm to excite primarily the emissive population of the TDPP-BBT polymer in chlorobenzene. We plot the excited state Raman spectrum at various time delays in Fig. 4. The spectra represent the vibrational snapshots of only the excited population after removal of the ground state bleach fraction (details of FSRS data analysis is discussed in Supplementary Notes 4 – 5). The metric for recovering the pure excited state spectrum by adding back the ground state fraction at all the time-delays was constrained by the bleach recovery dynamics observed in the TA (see Supplementary Fig. 4). In fact, in the FSRS measurements, we find that the excited state species is long-lived till 800 ps indicating the singlet exciton species. The ground state Raman spectrum (Fig. 4, bottom trace in black) is plotted to compare the magnitude of the changes in vibrational frequencies and intensities of the modes. We observe the same number of excited state normal modes mirroring the ground state Raman spectrum. Both the peak area kinetics and ground state bleach recovery dynamics show long-lived state (see Supplementary Figs. 18 – 19) up to 800 ps indicating that the singlet exciton Raman modes have been resonantly enhanced. In order to support our assignment, we recorded the stimulated Raman spectrum of the hole-doped polymer after reaction with oxidant FeCl 3. Supplementary Fig. 21 provides a comparative plot of the hole polaron Raman spectrum with the exciton spectra at 1 ps. It is evident that although the number of normal modes is the same, the peak positions are shifted with respect to that of the exciton. In addition, the ground state bleach recovery kinetics (shown in Supplementary Fig. 19) obtained while analyzing the FSRS data also shows a long-lived excited state that is in good agreement with the data obtained via TA. We do not see any evidence for decay of the excited state population which matches the polaron pair population decay dynamics obtained from TA. It should be mentioned that the 816 nm Raman pump does depopulate the polaron states through charge recombination back to the ground state (see Supplementary Figs. 17 and 35) without altering the lifetime of the exciton as confirmed by TA with Raman pump on. The Raman-induced depopulation supports our assignment that indeed the red-edge of the absorption spectrum (greater than 750 nm) of TDPP-BBT in solution is primarily from stacked configurations of the polymer which can generate polarons as primary excitations. Therefore, the recorded Raman spectra demonstrate the structural evolution of the polymer backbone in the singlet exciton state.

### Ultrafast multidimensional laplace NMR for a rapid and sensitive chemical analysis [^6a2f6503]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Traditional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy relies on the versatile chemical information conveyed by spectra. To complement conventional NMR, Laplace NMR explores diffusion and relaxation phenomena to reveal details on molecular motions. Under a broad concept of ultrafast multidimensional Laplace NMR, here we introduce an ultrafast diffusion-relaxation correlation experiment enhancing the resolution and information content of corresponding 1D experiments as well as reducing the experiment time by one to two orders of magnitude or more as compared with its conventional 2D counterpart. We demonstrate that the method allows one to distinguish identical molecules in different physical environments and provides chemical resolution missing in NMR spectra. Although the sensitivity of the new method is reduced due to spatial encoding, the single-scan approach enables one to use hyperpolarized substances to boost the sensitivity by several orders of magnitude, significantly enhancing the overall sensitivity of multidimensional Laplace NMR.

### Time-and site-resolved kinetic NMR for real-time monitoring of off-equilibrium reactions by 2D spectrotemporal correlations [^ee12e0d7]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

While these analytical simulations can be used to predict the kinetically-resolved 1D NMR spectra for distinct positions, a conventional 1D pulse-acquire experiment cannot deconvolve the individual spatially-dependent contributions to the A and B signals. Spatially-selective acquisitions employing field gradients are needed to unravel this information, as described in the next Paragraph.

Real time gradient-driven decoding of the spatially encoded chemical kinetics

The spectrotemporal NMR method in Fig. 1 relies on EPSI to retrieve the aforementioned spatially-encoded kinetic information with chemical shift resolution. Modeling the effects of the EPSI time-dependent oscillating gradient readout with the zero-order chemical kinetics and the continuous plug-like flow can be accomplished by appending to the treatment in the preceding Paragraph, the relevant gradient-induced shifts that affect each spin as it changes position due to the flow, and as it changes chemical environment due to the chemical kinetics. In addition, the various boundary conditions detailed in the previous Paragraph need to be respected. Once again the NMR signal of the starting reactant A as a function of all these factors is easier to summarize, and is given bywhereis given by Eq. (7),is the gyromagnetic ratio of the imaged spins in rad∙Hz/T,is the time-dependent gradient amplitude in G/cm, andis the time-dependent position of a given flowing spin at timethat had an initial position, with. The new exponent in Eq. (9) highlights the fact that spins are undergoing motion while being imaged—a topic, which has been extensively discussed in the NMR and MRI literature,–. As is well known from such studies, this gradient/flow combination can result in signal attenuations and/or in secular-like shifts of the signals. Supplementary Note 4 investigates this phenomenon in greater detail as it pertains to spectrotemporally-encoded NMR correlations, and demonstrates that in a pre-phased EPSI readout of the kind given in Eqs. (9 – 11), the spin evolution is compensated against the effects of plug-like flow. Therefore, the resulting NMR signals are devoid of flow-induced frequency shifts (even if they will be affected by flow-dependent broadening related to out-flowing of polarized spins and in-flowing of unpolarized/ones, vide supra).

### Gadoteridol [^9f3506b8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Gadoteridol is a paramagnetic agent and, as such, develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. The relatively large magnetic moment produced by the paramagnetic agent results in a relatively large local magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rates of water protons in the vicinity of the paramagnetic agent.

In MRI, visualization of normal and pathologic brain tissue depends, in part, on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with: 1) differences in proton density; 2) differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1); and 3) differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2). When placed in a magnetic field, gadoteridol decreases T1 relaxation times in the target tissues. At recommended doses, the effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in the T1-weighted sequences.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Gadoteridol affects proton relaxation times and consequently the MR signal. Signal intensity is affected by the dose and relaxivity of the gadoteridol molecule. Consistently, for all gadolinium based contrast agents, the relaxivity of gadoteridol decreases with the increase of the magnetic field strength used in clinical MRI (0.2-3.0T).

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity allows accumulation of gadoteridol in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts. The pharmacokinetics of gadoteridol in various lesions is not known.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of intravenously administered gadoteridol in normal subjects conforms to a two-compartment open model.

Distribution

After intravenous administration, gadoteridol is rapidly distributed in the extracellular space. The plasma distribution volume (mean ± SD) for the non-renally impaired adults was 0.205 ± 0.025 L/kg. It is unknown if protein binding of gadoteridol occurs in vivo .

Following GBCA administration, gadolinium is present for months or years in brain, bone, skin, and other organs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] .

Metabolism

It is unknown if biotransformation or decomposition of gadoteridol occur in vivo .

### Enzymatic synthesis of lignin derivable pyridine based polyesters for the substitution of petroleum derived plastics [^2078a2b5]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Enzymatic polymerizations in organic media

In total, 8 × 10 −4 mol of diester (0.2 M) and 8 × 10 −4 mol of BDO (0.2 M) (diester:diol ratio = 1:1) were added together with 4 mL of DPE in a 25-mL round bottom flask. The mixture was then stirred at 85 °C until complete dissolution of the monomers in the solvent. In total, 10% w w −1 (calculated on the total amount of the monomers) of iCaLB was then added and the reaction was run for 6 h at 1000 mbar. A vacuum of 20 mbar was subsequently applied for an additional 90 h while maintaining the reaction T at 85 °C. Warm chloroform was added to the reaction mixture to solubilize the polymer product and the biocatalyst was filtered off. The chloroform was then removed under vacuum. The polymer-DPE mixture was subsequently crashed out in ice-cold methanol achieving precipitation of the products. Three methanol washing steps were subsequently performed in order to remove the residual DPE. The reactions led to white powdery polymerization products (see Supplementary Figs. 17 – 20). See Supplementary Figs. 1 – 3 for the 1 H-NMR spectroscopy data of the various purification steps. The reproducibility of the reactions was certified by performing duplicate runs of selected reactions and all relative characterization data are included in the ESI file.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy

1 H and 13 C-NMR spectroscopy analysis were performed on a JEOL JNM-ECS400A spectrometer at a frequency of 400 MHz for 1 H and 100 MHz for 13 C. CDCl 3 was used as NMR solvent if not otherwise specified. A drop of TFA was added to ensure the full solubilization of the polyDET-BDO synthesized in DPE. 1 H-NMR analysis was performed on all synthesized samples (see Supplementary Figs. 38 – 43 for the fully assigned NMR spectra of some selected reactions carried out in DPE).

### Automated NMR resonance assignments and structure determination using a minimal set of 4D spectra [^8afc5db3]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Common NOEs are utilized to derive missing TOCSY-based assignments. For every residue separately, the NOESY peak intensities are normalized and peaks with low intensity (threshold 0.1 or specified otherwise) are left out. 4D-CHAINS scans the sequence backwards. For each residue where there is a missing assignment, it matches its unassigned NOE peaks with the unassigned NOE peaks of the next residue. For each peak where there is a match, a probability is derived for the missing atom-type assignments from the 2D density map of the particular residue type. Atom-type probabilities must belong to the 80th percentile of the density maps to be considered further. This filter prevents making any decisions when the correct assignment does not belong to any of the matched peaks. Accordingly, each probability is modified by the intensity of the corresponding peak to a score. This process is necessary to identify the correct assignment of methyl groups among the available options, because intraresidue methyl-amide NOEs yield stronger correlations. Several intensity transformations were tested extensively (see below) and the best performance for obtaining NOESY-type methyl assignments is given by the product of the 2D histogram probability and the intensity of the NOESY peak transformed by an exponential function, e.g. 2Dprob×(100×intensity 2). The highest score or product of scores provides the assignments for the missing atom types.

### Time-and site-resolved kinetic NMR for real-time monitoring of off-equilibrium reactions by 2D spectrotemporal correlations [^d419e6d1]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides detailed information about dynamic processes through line-shape changes, which are traditionally limited to equilibrium conditions. However, a wealth of information is available by studying chemical reactions under off-equilibrium conditions— e.g. in states that arise upon mixing reactants that subsequently undergo chemical changes—and in monitoring the reactants and products in real time. Herein, we propose and demonstrate a time-resolved kinetic NMR experiment that combines rapid mixing techniques, continuous flow, and single-scan spectroscopic imaging methods, leading in unison to a 2D spectrotemporal NMR correlation that provides high-quality kinetic information of off-equilibrium chemical reactions. These kinetic 2D NMR spectra possess a high-resolution spectral dimension revealing the individual chemical sites, correlated with a time-independent, steady-state spatial axis that delivers information concerning temporal changes along the reaction coordinate. A comprehensive description of the kinetic, spectroscopic, and experimental features associated with these spectrotemporal NMR analyses is presented. Experimental demonstrations are carried out using an enzymatically catalyzed reaction leading to site- and time-resolved kinetic NMR data, that are in excellent agreement with control experiments and literature values.

### Automated NMR resonance assignments and structure determination using a minimal set of 4D spectra [^4db777cf]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

In the present implementation of the 4D-CHAINS algorithm, no mapping mistakes were made for the four protein targets. The NH-mapping coverage varied between 96 and 100% (Supplementary Figure 4 ; left column). To better evaluate the mapping performance of 4D-CHAINS, only the 13 C- 1 H correlated frequencies of α- and β-atoms were retained in the TOCSY input peak list to imitate the scenario of using a 4D CBHBCAHA(CO)NH experiment in conjunction with the 4D 13 C, 15 N edited HMQC-NOESY-HSQC. Interestingly, only the coverage dropped slightly but again no mistakes were introduced (Supplementary Figure 4 ; right column). This control experiment highlights the robustness of 4D-CHAINS that stems mainly from the predictive power of 13 C– 1 H correlated chemical shifts and the reliability of the connectivities established when carbon and proton frequencies are coupled.

### Nearest-neighbour resonating valence bonds in YbMgGaO [^84c6cc46]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Since its proposal by Anderson, resonating valence bonds (RVB) formed by a superposition of fluctuating singlet pairs have been a paradigmatic concept in understanding quantum spin liquids. Here, we show that excitations related to singlet breaking on nearest-neighbour bonds describe the high-energy part of the excitation spectrum in YbMgGaO 4 , the effective spin-1/2 frustrated antiferromagnet on the triangular lattice, as originally considered by Anderson. By a thorough single-crystal inelastic neutron scattering study, we demonstrate that nearest-neighbour RVB excitations account for the bulk of the spectral weight above 0.5meV. This renders YbMgGaO 4 the first experimental system where putative RVB correlations restricted to nearest neighbours are observed, and poses a fundamental question of how complex interactions on the triangular lattice conspire to form this unique many-body state.

### Deazaflavin reductive photocatalysis involves excited semiquinone radicals [^400ee858]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Triplet state reaction forms transiently stable semiquinone

TA spectroscopy in the ns to μs range was used in order to study the triplet state formation of 5 ox (Fig. 4a, e as well as further details in Supplementary Notes 2 and 8). In comparison to isoalloxazines, its yield is low being only ca. 11% (Supplementary Table 1). In the presence of the substrate p -BA (50 mM), no reaction is observed with either the excited singlet or triplet state of 5 ox (Fig. 4b, e). In contrast, in the presence of the sacrificial electron donor DIPEA (50 mM) electron transfer (eT) from DIPEA to the triplet state occurs forming the semiquinone 5 sq (Fig. 4c, f), whose spectrum agrees well with the electrochemically generated spectrum (Fig. 5g and Supplementary Note 9). The yield for eT can be determined from the corresponding decay rates to, where k 0 is the total decay rate constant of the triplet in the absence and k q in the presence of DIPEA. Considering the concentration of DIPEA (50 mM), the corresponding bi-molecular reaction rate with the triplet state is given to be (8.7 ± 0.1) × 10 8 M −1 s −1 (k eT = Φ eT k q ([DIPEA]) −1). However, in the available spectral window of our experiment, we do not observe spectral signatures of the corresponding DIPEA radical cation. The assignment as the semiquinone radical is further proven by recording its electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum under photo-stationary conditions (Supplementary Note 10). In the presence of both p -BA and DIPEA, again, only the triplet reaction with DIPEA is observed, but no indication for a reaction between p -BA and 5 sq is found (Fig. 4d, f). In summary, while the excited singlet state reaction with DIPEA results in a singlet born spin correlated radical pair, 1 [5 sq, DIPEA •+], which recombines faster than it is formed owing to spin allowance, the triplet reaction with DIPEA involves a triplet born radical pair, 3 [5 sq, DIPEA •+], which is spin forbidden for recombination, thus allowing its accumulation (Fig. 4g).

### Absence of glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) in human bile is an indication of cholestasis: a 1H MRS study [^ba57eef4]. NMR in Biomedicine (2009). Low credibility.

The utility of (1)H MR spectroscopy in detecting chronic cholestasis has been investigated. The amide proton region of the (1)H MR spectrum of human bile plays a major role in differentiating cholestatic (Ch) patterns from the normal ones. Bile obtained from normal bile ducts contains both taurine and glycine conjugates of bile acids--cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), and deoxycholic acid (DCA). Absence of a glycine-conjugated bile acid glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) has been observed in bile samples obtained from primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients. A total of 32 patients with various hepatobiliary diseases were included in the study. Twenty-one patients had PSC and 11 had normal cholangiograms. One PSC patient was excluded from the study because of a bad spectrum. Seventeen out of the 20 PSC patients showed an absence of GCDCA in their (1)H MR spectrum of bile. Six of the 11 reference patients with normal cholangiogram also showed spectra similar to those of PSC, indicating the possibility of cholestasis. DQF-COSY and TOCSY experiments performed on bile samples from PSC patients also revealed absence of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in some of the bile samples, suggesting possible damage to the cholangiocytes by the toxic bile. These observations suggest that analysis of human bile by (1)H MRS could be of value in the diagnosis of chronic Ch liver disorders.

Fig. 5 
Theoretical model of hydrogen bond transformations. Schematic diagram of each transformation process (a – e) with five low-lying energy structures (f – j) and corresponding transmission spectra at a zero bias voltage (k – o)

To further explore the feasibility of interconversions among the five structures, we have calculated the lowest energy reaction pathways (Supplementary Fig. 16), and found that for the first kind of the intermolecular proton transfer process, the reaction barriers are rather small (~0.35 eV), which indicates that proton can readily migrate between the terminal electronegative O/N atoms in the quadruple hydrogen bond at room temperature. While for lactam–lactim tautomerism, a somewhat higher energy barrier of about 0.67 eV was obtained, which can also be overcome at room temperature. Moreover, previous studies of similar hydrogen bonding dimers have shown that a local electric field (bias voltage) can increase the rate constant of the tautomeric equilibrium by lowering the barrier height,,. Therefore, it is expected that these five structures can emerge alternately in response to thermal and electric stimuli under our experimental conditions.

### Time-and site-resolved kinetic NMR for real-time monitoring of off-equilibrium reactions by 2D spectrotemporal correlations [^ab7363e5]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is capable of studying dynamic processes with atomic-level resolution over a large range of time scales, owing to the extreme sensitivity of the nuclear spin interactions to changes in the surrounding atomic environment. For example fast dynamic processes occurring on 10 −7 –10 −3 s time scales can be studied with suitable relaxation-time measurements, while slower chemical exchanges in the 10 −3 –10 0 s scales can be monitored by analyzing variations in the resulting NMR spectral line shapes,. Both of these cases are usually studied under equilibrium conditions, whereby dynamic fluctuations happen but chemical species remain under steady-state concentrations. A wealth of information, however, can also be garnered by studying dynamic processes that begin from an off-equilibrium state, and monitoring the progression of chemical kinetics as it proceeds towards equilibrium in real time. So-called stopped-flow NMR techniques have proven particularly effective at studying off-equilibrium chemical reactions, without suffering from deleterious spectral artifacts that may otherwise arise from the transient formation and decay of species –. Stopped-flow NMR has thus been used for studying chemical reactions in polymer and in biomolecular chemistry (e.g. protein and nucleic acid folding); stopped-flow NMR has also been combined with nuclear hyperpolarization methods, which among other benefits allows for the facile detection of unreceptive nuclei. Despite their advantages, stopped-flow NMR methods are limited by the mandatory relaxation-delay and dead-time periods needed for spin polarization, mixing, and sample stabilization, as well as the necessity to acquire data from multiple sample batches: all these demands complicate the method, and decrease its capability to analyze the reaction coordinate. There exists, however, another method for monitoring chemical reactions with NMR that can also provide information with respect to the temporal characteristics of reactions processes, which involves the continuous flow of reagents through the NMR probehead –. One such possibility relies on a continuous flow reactor, in which the flow rate of reactants is systematically changed; different stages in the reaction can then come into view of the detector, even if the method is challenged by short residence times and requires an ample supply of reactants. Alternatively, experiments can monitor spectra at constant flow rates but at one or more instants following reagent mixing. Even further information with respect to the spatial—and hence the temporal—distribution of reaction processes could arise if they were monitored as a function of position within the NMR coil. Based on this premise, this work introduces and develops a time-resolved kinetic NMR experiment that combines rapid-mixing and continuous-flow methodologies, with single-scan spectroscopic imaging principles. The result is a novel type of 2D spectrotemporal NMR correlation experiment that is capable of providing high-quality, site-resolved kinetic insight about chemical reactions. The principles underlying these time- and site-resolved kinetic NMR experiments are discussed in the subsequent sections, including experimental demonstrations that monitored the depletion and formation of 1 H methyl resonances evolving from an enzymatically-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction with millisecond time resolution.

### Initial-site characterization of hydrogen migration following strong-field double-ionization of ethanol [^dcab0fd8]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

An essential problem in photochemistry is understanding the coupling of electronic and nuclear dynamics in molecules, which manifests in processes such as hydrogen migration. Measurements of hydrogen migration in molecules that have more than two equivalent hydrogen sites, however, produce data that is difficult to compare with calculations because the initial hydrogen site is unknown. We demonstrate that coincidence ion-imaging measurements of a few deuterium-tagged isotopologues of ethanol can determine the contribution of each initial-site composition to hydrogen-rich fragments following strong-field double ionization. These site-specific probabilities produce benchmarks for calculations and answer outstanding questions about photofragmentation of ethanol dications; e.g., establishing that the central two hydrogen atoms are 15 times more likely to abstract the hydroxyl proton than a methyl-group proton to form H[Formula: see text] and that hydrogen scrambling, involving the exchange of hydrogen between different sites, is important in H 2 O + formation. The technique extends to dynamic variables and could, in principle, be applied to larger non-cyclic hydrocarbons.

### Gadoterate meglumine (Clariscan) [^d2b8338a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Gadoterate is a paramagnetic molecule that develops a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. The magnetic moment enhances the relaxation rates of water protons in its vicinity, leading to an increase in signal intensity (brightness) of tissues.

In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occurs with:

differences in proton density
differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1)
differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2)

When placed in a magnetic field, gadoterate shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in target tissues. At recommended doses, the effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in the T1-weighted sequences.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Gadoterate affects proton relaxation times and consequently the MR signal, and the contrast obtained is characterized by the relaxivity of the gadoterate molecule. The relaxivity values for gadoterate are similar across the spectrum of magnetic field strengths used in clinical MRI (0.2 to 1.5 T).

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier or abnormal vascularity allows distribution of gadoterate in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and infarcts.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of total gadolinium assessed up to 48 hours following an intravenously administered 0.1 mmol/kg dose of gadoterate meglumine in healthy adult subjects demonstrated a mean elimination half-life (reported as mean ± SD) of about 1.4 ± 0.2 hours and 2.0 ± 0.7 hours in female and male subjects, respectively. Similar pharmacokinetic profile and elimination half-life values were observed after intravenous injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadoterate meglumine followed 20 minutes later by a second injection of 0.2 mmol/kg (1.7 ± 0.3 hours and 1.9 ± 0.2 hours in female and male subjects, respectively).

Distribution

The volume of distribution at steady state of total gadolinium in healthy subjects is 179 ± 26 and 211 ± 35 mL/kg in female and male subjects respectively, roughly equivalent to that of extracellular water. Gadoterate does not undergo protein binding in vitro . The extent of blood cell partitioning of gadoterate is not known.

Following GBCA administration, gadolinium is present for months or years in brain, bone, skin, and other organs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Synthesis of amphiphile 5

To a solution of 1 (267 mg, 0.4 mmol) and Et 3 N (0.6 mL) in dichloromethane (30 mL), a solution of triphosgene (179 mg, 0.6 mmol) in dichloromethane (30 mL) was added dropwise at 0 °C under nitrogen atmosphere.

### Gadobenate dimeglumine (Multihance) [^18ec655d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1  Mechanism of Action

Gadobenate dimeglumine is a paramagnetic agent and, as such, develops
a magnetic moment when placed in a magnetic field. The large magnetic
moment produced by the paramagnetic agent results in a large local
magnetic field, which can enhance the relaxation rates of water protons
in its vicinity leading to an increase of signal intensity (brightness)
of tissue.

In magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends
in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that
occur with 1) differences in proton density; 2) differences of the
spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1); and 3) differences
in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2). When placed in
a magnetic field, gadobenate dimeglumine decreases the T1 and T2 relaxation
time in target tissues. At recommended doses, the effect is observed
with greatest sensitivity in the T1-weighted sequences.

12.2  Pharmacodynamics

Unlike other tested paramagnetic contrast agents (See Table 3), MultiHance
demonstrates weak and transient interactions with serum proteins that
causes slowing in the molecular tumbling dynamics, resulting in strong
increases in relaxivity in solutions containing serum proteins. The
improved relaxation effect can contribute to increased contrast-to-noise
ratio and lesion-to-brain ratio, which may improve visualization.

Disruption of the blood-brain barrier
or abnormal vascularity allows enhancement by MultiHance of lesions
such as neoplasms, abscesses, and infarcts. Uptake of MultiHance into
hepatocytes has been demonstrated.

### Carbon defect qubit in two-dimensional WS [^2fda1360]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Identifying and fabricating defect qubits in two-dimensional semiconductors are of great interest in exploring candidates for quantum information and sensing applications. A milestone has been recently achieved by demonstrating that single defect, a carbon atom substituting sulphur atom in single layer tungsten disulphide, can be engineered on demand at atomic size level precision, which holds a promise for a scalable and addressable unit. It is an immediate quest to reveal its potential as a qubit. To this end, we determine its electronic structure and optical properties from first principles. We identify the fingerprint of the neutral charge state of the defect in the scanning tunnelling spectrum. In the neutral defect, the giant spin-orbit coupling mixes the singlet and triplet excited states with resulting in phosphorescence at the telecom band that can be used to read out the spin state, and coherent driving with microwave excitation is also viable. Our results establish a scalable qubit in a two-dimensional material with spin-photon interface at the telecom wavelength region.

Drug treatment

Cells were exposed for a 24 h period to varying drug concentrations (as indicated in their respective citations below) while control cells were exposed to the corresponding DMSO (CAS 67-68-5, Sigma-Aldrich, D8418) dilution: metformin (glucophage; CAS 1115-70-4, 15169101, MP Biomedicals, stock 3 M in PBS), genistein (CAS 446-72-0, 10005167100 Cayman Chemicals, stock 100 mM in DMSO), haloperidol (haldol; CAS 52-86-8, 15369690 MP Biomedicals, stock 50 mM in DMSO). For acyl-carnitine measurements, the medium was supplemented with 1 mM-carnitine (CAS 6645-46-1, Sigma-Aldrich, C0283). Each experiment was performed in three biological repeats.

NMR spectroscopy

NMR experiments were performed on a 500-MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer with a 5-mm TXI z-gradient probe (Bruker-BioSpin, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 298 K. 13C enrichments were determined by one-dimensional 1H NMR difference spectroscopy (13C-coupled spectrum minus the 13C-decoupled spectrum). Two-dimensional indirect-detected 13C, 1H J-resolved HSQC spectra were recorded over an experimental time of 1.5 d per spectrum with 5,120 indirect 13C data points, at 80 p.p.m. 13C sweep width, 40 p.p.m. carrier position, 4,096 direct 1H increments, 3 s recycling delay and 8 scans. Before Fourier transformation, the data were multiplied with a squared sine-bell window function, phase corrected and zero-filled to 8,192 data points, for indirect 13C sampling.

### Maximizing spectral sensitivity without compromising resolution in phase-incremented, steady-state solution NMR [^d4777751]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Theoretical background

A deterministic approach to the 1D PI-SSFP NMR spectral reconstruction

As mentioned, the PI-SSFP proposal to collect high resolution 1D NMR spectra relies on acquiring and processing an array of (signal-averaged) steady-state FIDs of duration TR, as a function of offset. This is best carried out by signal averaging a series of NS scans, where the carrier offset is constant, but the phases of consecutive RF pulses are incremented in steps of(Fig. 2a). This will provide an array of M FIDs, sampled over times 0 < t < TR. Assuming for simplicity the presence of a single peak positioned at a frequency f, and given the aforementionedperiodicity of the SSFP signal response S on f, it is possible to describe the ensuing M steady-state FIDs at times t = 0 (e.g. immediately after each pulse) as the discrete Fourier series, whereis the spectral intensity of the peak at frequency f. Thein Eq. [1] are discrete Fourier coefficients reflecting the multiple transfer pathways depicted in Fig. 1, that can be calculated analytically and whose amplitude decays to zero as | k | increases,. These coefficients depend on the flip-angle α, on E 2 = exp(-TR/T 2) and, more weakly, on E 1 = exp(-TR/T 1); importantly, the larger the flip-angle α or the shorter the T 2, the faster the A k will decay to zero with |k |. We have recently shownthat knowledge of thesecoefficients –whether from analytical or numerical sources– can allow one to find from theset, the spectral amplitudethat, after multiple potential foldings within the ±1/2TR interval, will characterize a peak of frequency f. Assuming for the sake of simplicity that the frequency being searched for has not folded over, i.e. that, we proposed recreating the NMR spectrum within such range using a linear combination of thesignals. Denoting this linear combination as F (f) and the a priori unknown coefficients that will be involved in it as { β m } 0≤m≤M-1, we define the linear combination as
