## Question

Adverse effects of albuterol/ipratropium

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the adverse effects of albuterol/ipratropium. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and mechanism-based toxicities. Then, I should verify the most authoritative sources, especially FDA labels, to anchor frequency and severity. Next, I will categorize adverse effects by organ system and highlight serious risks. After that, I should review clinical trial data to contextualize real-world risk. Finally, I will consider special populations, drug interactions, and monitoring or counseling points, and I will double-check any conflicting statements before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic basis for adverse effects. Albuterol is a short-acting beta2-agonist that can cause sympathetic stimulation and hypokalemia, while ipratropium is a short-acting muscarinic antagonist that can cause anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, urinary retention, and ocular effects; the combination adds bronchodilation via distinct pathways but also combines class-specific adverse effects, so I need to keep both mechanisms in mind as I proceed [^a60713cb] [^b5c5aad3].

> I will now examine the most authoritative sources to anchor the adverse effect profile. The FDA labels for Combivent Respimat and for ipratropium/albuterol inhalation solution provide structured listings of common and serious adverse reactions, including cardiovascular, ocular, and anticholinergic effects, and they also specify contraindications and warnings that shape risk stratification and counseling, so I should prioritize these data when stating frequencies and clinical significance [^b5c5aad3] [^86b9a502] [^12674baa].

> Next, I should review clinical trial safety data to ensure the label signals align with observed events. In a 12-week COPD trial of Combivent Respimat, adverse reactions were generally similar across treatment arms, with cough occurring more frequently with the Respimat combination than comparators, and no new safety signals emerging, which supports the label's characterization of the combination as well tolerated in COPD populations when used as directed [^c7ee561b] [^292b380e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about asthma populations. I initially thought the combination might carry the same safety profile in asthma, but wait, let me verify the asthma-specific data. In moderate-to-severe asthma, randomized trials comparing ipratropium/albuterol to albuterol alone showed improved bronchodilation with a similar overall safety profile, though a small excess of severe exacerbations was observed in the combination arm without statistical significance, so I should be cautious about extrapolating COPD safety wholesale to asthma and note that routine maintenance use in asthma is not established [^7e599d74] [^2a07e8b3].

> Let me categorize the adverse effects by organ system to make this clinically actionable. Common effects include tremor, nervousness, palpitations, tachycardia, headache, dry mouth, dysgeusia, cough, and gastrointestinal upset, which are consistent with beta-agonist and anticholinergic effects. Serious risks include paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiovascular ischemia or arrhythmias, hypokalemia, angle-closure glaucoma, and urinary retention, which mandate vigilance and patient counseling [^b5c5aad3] [^86b9a502] [^46c1b99b].

> I should double-check ocular and urinary risks because these are often overlooked. Ipratropium can precipitate or worsen narrow-angle glaucoma if aerosol contacts the eye, and it can cause urinary retention in men with prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction; case reports and labels document unilateral mydriasis and acute urinary retention, so patients must be instructed on proper inhaler technique and screened for predisposing conditions [^46c1b99b] [^ac07b77e] [^99387568].

> Next, I should review drug interactions that amplify risk. Non–potassium-sparing diuretics can worsen beta-agonist–induced hypokalemia, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants can potentiate cardiovascular effects of albuterol, and beta-blockers can antagonize bronchodilation; concomitant anticholinergics can additively increase anticholinergic burden, so medication reconciliation is essential before prescribing the combination [^c1c59530] [^411a7ef9] [^8ea00589].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, safety and effectiveness of Combivent Respimat are not established, though ipratropium added to SABA in acute asthma ED care reduces hospitalizations without clear safety concerns; in older adults, adverse event patterns are broadly similar, but I should maintain heightened vigilance for cardiovascular and anticholinergic effects; in pregnancy, data are limited, so risk–benefit discussion is prudent given low systemic exposure with inhaled therapy [^0bb62bd1] [^a36b36c6] [^6d32b960].

> I need to ensure dosing and monitoring guidance is explicit. The recommended dose is one inhalation four times daily, not to exceed six inhalations in 24 hours; patients should be counseled to seek care if they need more frequent dosing, as this signals worsening control and increases risk of adverse effects; for patients on diuretics or with cardiac disease, checking potassium and ECG may be reasonable if symptoms arise, and any new ocular pain, visual halos, or urinary difficulty warrants prompt evaluation [^eb24c33b] [^9b884acf] [^a7d2d3bb].

> But wait, what if the patient reports a metallic taste or hoarseness. I should confirm that taste perversion and dysphonia are recognized anticholinergic effects and generally mild, while reminding myself that persistent or severe symptoms should prompt reassessment of inhaler technique, rinsing after use if a steroid is coadministered, and consideration of alternative bronchodilator strategies if adverse effects limit adherence or quality of life [^86b9a502] [^bcae57e3].

> In summary, I should emphasize that albuterol/ipratropium combines beta-agonist sympathomimetic effects with anticholinergic effects, yielding a profile that is generally well tolerated at recommended doses but with meaningful risks including paradoxical bronchospasm, cardiovascular stimulation, hypokalemia, angle-closure glaucoma, and urinary retention. Careful patient selection, technique training, and counseling on red flags mitigate harm while preserving the bronchodilator benefits in appropriate COPD and selected acute asthma settings [^b5c5aad3] [^86b9a502] [^a36b36c6].

Albuterol/ipratropium is generally well tolerated, but **common adverse effects** include tremor, nervousness, palpitations, tachycardia, dry mouth, taste disturbance, cough, and gastrointestinal upset [^86b9a502] [^12674baa]. Serious risks include **paradoxical bronchospasm**, cardiovascular effects (hypertension, arrhythmias), hypokalemia, and ocular effects (acute narrow-angle glaucoma, mydriasis) if sprayed into the eyes [^46c1b99b] [^51e206bf] [^88ba85f2]. Urinary retention may occur in patients with prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction [^46c1b99b]. Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, or urinary retention, and avoid exceeding six inhalations per 24 hours [^a7d2d3bb] [^eb24c33b].

---

## Common adverse effects

Common adverse effects occur in **1–10% of patients** and are usually mild and self-limited:

- **Tremor**: Very common with albuterol due to beta-agonist activity [^ac9dae09].
- **Nervousness**: Common with albuterol [^ac9dae09].
- **Palpitations and tachycardia**: Common with albuterol [^86b9a502].
- **Dry mouth**: Common with ipratropium due to anticholinergic effects [^742f190c].
- **Taste disturbance**: Common with ipratropium (bitter or metallic taste) [^bcae57e3].
- **Cough**: Common with both agents [^86b9a502].
- **Gastrointestinal upset**: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dyspepsia are common [^86b9a502].

---

## Serious adverse effects

Serious adverse effects are **rare but require immediate medical attention**:

- **Paradoxical bronchospasm**: Life-threatening; discontinue immediately if it occurs [^46c1b99b].
- **Cardiovascular effects**: Hypertension, arrhythmias, and myocardial ischemia have been reported, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease [^46c1b99b] [^51e206bf].
- **Hypokalemia**: Beta-agonists can cause significant potassium shifts, particularly with diuretics or high doses [^a7d2d3bb] [^51e206bf].
- **Ocular effects**: Acute narrow-angle glaucoma, mydriasis, and eye pain can occur if the aerosol is sprayed into the eyes [^46c1b99b] [^88ba85f2].
- **Urinary retention**: Risk increases in patients with prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction [^46c1b99b] [^99387568].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

- **Contraindications**: Hypersensitivity to albuterol, ipratropium, or atropine derivatives [^b97b749c] [^340ac6c4].
- **Precautions**: Use caution in patients with cardiovascular disease, glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder-neck obstruction [^a7d2d3bb] [^46c1b99b].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid concurrent use with other anticholinergics, beta-agonists, or MAO inhibitors due to additive effects [^c1c59530] [^411a7ef9].

---

## Clinical management of adverse effects

- **Mild effects**: Manage symptomatically (e.g. hydration for dry mouth, reassurance for tremor).
- **Serious effects**: Discontinue the medication immediately and seek emergency care (e.g. paradoxical bronchospasm, severe cardiovascular symptoms, acute glaucoma, urinary retention).
- **Monitoring**: Regularly assess for cardiovascular symptoms, electrolyte disturbances, and ocular or urinary symptoms, especially in high-risk patients [^a7d2d3bb].

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^7e599d74]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Many patients with asthma require frequent rescue medication for acute symptoms despite appropriate controller therapies. Thus, determining the most effective relief regimen is important in the management of more severe asthma. This study's objective was to evaluate whether ipratropium bromide/albuterol metered-dose inhaler (CVT-MDI) provides more effective acute relief of bronchospasm in moderate-to-severe asthma than albuterol hydrofluoroalkaline (ALB-HFA) alone after 4 weeks.

Methods

In this double-blind, crossover study, patients who had been diagnosed with asthma for ≥ 1 year were randomized to two sequences of study medication "as needed" for symptom relief (1–7 day washout before second 4-week treatment period): CVT-MDI/ALB-HFA or ALB-HFA/CVT-MDI. On days 1 and 29 of each sequence, 6-hour serial spirometry was performed after administration of the study drug. Co-primary endpoints were FEV1 area under the curve (AUC0-6) and peak (post-dose) forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) response (change from test day baseline) after 4 weeks. The effects of "as needed" treatment with ALB-HFA/CVT-MDI were analyzed using mixed effect model repeated measures (MMRM).

Results

A total of 226 patients, ≥ 18 years old, with inadequately controlled, moderate-to-severe asthma were randomized. The study met both co-primary endpoints demonstrating a statistically significant treatment benefit of CVT-MDI versus ALB-HFA. FEV1 AUC0-6h response was 167 mL for ALB-HFA, 252 mL for CVT-MDI (p < 0.0001); peak FEV1 response was 357 mL for ALB-HFA, 434 mL for CVT-MDI (p < 0.0001). Adverse events were comparable across groups.

Conclusions

CVT-MDI significantly improved acute bronchodilation over ALB-HFA alone after 4 weeks of "as-needed" use for symptom relief, with a similar safety profile. This suggests additive bronchodilator effects of β2-agonist and anticholinergic treatment in moderate-to-severe, symptomatic asthma.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Adverse reaction information concerning Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution was derived from the 12-week controlled clinical trial.

Additional adverse reactions reported in more than 1% of patients treated with Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution included constipation and voice alterations.

In the clinical trial, there was a 0.3% incidence of possible allergic-type reactions, including skin rash, pruritus, and urticaria.

Additional information derived from the published literature on the use of albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide singly or in combination includes precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma, acute eye pain, blurred vision, mydriasis, paradoxical bronchospasm, wheezing, exacerbation of COPD symptoms, drowsiness, aching, flushing, upper respiratory tract infection, palpitations, taste perversion, elevated heart rate, sinusitis, back pain, sore throat and metabolic acidosis. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Conclusions

These findings are consistent with those from recent studies that demonstrated the value of using the long-acting anticholinergic, tiotropium, as add-on therapy to ICS, or as an add-on to ICS plus LABA, or compared with doubling the ICS dose, in the chronic management of moderate or severe asthma. The results of this study suggest that use of a short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator in a fixed-dose combination with a SABA has a greater effect on lung function in moderate-to-severe asthma than SABA alone, and should therefore provide better symptomatic relief. In the future, additional studies will be useful to investigate the additive effects of these drugs in patients with all spectra of asthma severity.

These results support the use of a short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator in a fixed-dose combination with a SABA in asthma, and the need for further clinical trials to determine the role of short- and long-acting anticholinergics (ipratropium and tiotropium, respectively) for managing asthma.

Study end points

Co-primary endpoints were FEV 1 area-under-the-curve (AUC 0–6) above test-day baseline from 0 to 6 h, and peak FEV 1 response. The study defined peak FEV 1 response as the maximum change in FEV 1 from test-day baseline within the 6-hour post-treatment interval, after 4 weeks of treatment.

The secondary endpoints were the mini Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-AQLQ) responses, ACQ-7 responses, and the number of puffs of study medication and open-label ALB-HFA (AM and PM) patients used during each treatment period. Other endpoints included forced vital capacity, peak expiratory flow (data not shown), night-time awakenings due to asthma symptoms (from eDiary), and duration of bronchodilator FEV 1 response. Bronchodilator response was achieved if an FEV 1 value of ≥ 1.15 times the corresponding test-day baseline value was recorded at any time-point during the first 6 h after treatment administration. Termination of bronchodilator response was identified by the first fall of < 1.15 times the corresponding test-day FEV 1 baseline value on two consecutive measurements following a bronchodilator response during the 6-hour observation period on the test day. Duration of bronchodilator response was defined as the time interval between onset (bronchodilator response first achieved) and termination of bronchodilator response; duration was zero if there was no bronchodilator response.

Safety endpoints included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, screening laboratory values (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis), and electrocardiogram (ECG).

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^bdc1b26e]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the availability of effective asthma controller therapies, a significant proportion of patients have suboptimal asthma control, characterized by frequent symptoms, lifestyle restrictions, and healthcare use. In addition to controller medications, acute reliever or rescue medications, e.g. short-acting β 2 -agonists (SABAs) are used to treat acute symptoms and exacerbations. The frequency of SABA use as rescue medication reflects the frequency and intensity of symptoms, and is an important component for classifying asthma severity and level of disease control.

Short-acting anticholinergic agents have been used in asthma for decades; however, their exact role in asthma has not been well established. Studies directly comparing short-acting anticholinergic agents with a variety of SABAs have shown that SABAs provide greater bronchodilation than short-acting anticholinergic agents alone in stable asthma; however, individual studies have demonstrated that specific asthma populations, e.g. older patients, and those whose asthma is related to psychogenic factors, cigarette smoke, or β-blocking drugs, might benefit from anticholinergic therapy.

Short-acting anticholinergic agents have also been evaluated in combination with a SABA or sequentially following SABA administration. The rationale for use of a combination of a short-acting anticholinergic agent and a SABA includes differences between the two classes of medications regarding mechanisms of action, side-effect profiles, onset and duration of action, and site of action. Studies evaluating combination therapy with a short-acting anticholinergic and a SABA have shown variable results, mainly due to small numbers of patients or inappropriate patient populations; however, many of these studies showed an additional (although not significant) benefit.

Combivent® inhalation aerosol metered-dose inhaler (CVT-MDI) is a fixed-dose combination of the short-acting anticholinergic, ipratropium bromide, and the SABA, albuterol sulfate, using a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) propellant. It should be noted that the CFC-MDI formulation of Combivent (CVT-MDI) used in this study is no longer available, but Combivent is available in the Respimat® Soft Mist™ inhaler (Combivent® Respimat®), which is considered therapeutically equivalent to the CFC-MDI formulation, and studies in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have indicated that it has similar bronchodilator effects.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^2a07e8b3]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

In this study, the overall safety profile of CVT-MDI was similar to ALB-HFA. As previously observed with short-acting anticholinergics, patients receiving CVT-MDI reported more cough. The patient population chosen for this study had moderate-to-severe asthma, and was symptomatic despite continuous treatment with ICS with or without LABA and other asthma controller medications, and had ACQ scores ≥ 1.5. Therefore, in this population with poor asthma control, exacerbations are expected to be more frequent. Although there was a slight excess of patients in the CVT-MDI group (seven CVT-MDI vs. two ALB-HFA patients) who met the protocol-defined criteria for severe asthma exacerbation, no patients were hospitalized, and one patient discontinued on day 29 of the study due to a severe asthma exacerbation. While differences in the number of severe asthma exacerbations between the groups were not significant, exacerbation data was examined in greater detail. An independent review of the severe asthma exacerbations revealed no specific pattern except that five of the seven patients who had severe asthma exacerbations in the CVT-MDI group had a body mass index (BMI) of 32.5–48.2 kg/m 2. In two of these patients, respiratory infection preceded the exacerbation.

Based on an analysis of the individual eDiary data, there was no increased use or misuse of open label ALB-HFA and/or blinded study medication before the onset of the severe exacerbation in four of the seven CVT-MDI group patients. There was also no evidence of a decrease in the PEF, indicating the onset of worsening of asthma, in four of the seven CVT-MDI group patients.

At day 29, mean change in FEV 1 AUC 0–6 from test-day baseline was 85 mL greater with CVT-MDI versus ALB-HFA (252 mL vs. 167 ml, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2a). In a post-hoc analysis, at day 29, the mean ratio of FEV 1 AUC 0–6 response to test-day baseline FEV 1 was 13% for CVT-MDI and 8.3% for ALB-HFA (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2b). The mean test-day baseline at day 29 for FEV 1 was 219.3 mL for CVT-MDI and 212.6 mL for ALB-HFA. Mean change from test-day baseline in peak FEV 1 for CVT-MDI was 77 mL greater than ALB-HFA (434 mL vs. 357 ml, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2c). In a post-hoc analysis, at day 29, the mean ratio of peak FEV 1 response to test-day baseline FEV 1 was 22% for CVT-MDI and 17.6% for ALB-HFA (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2d). The mean change from test-day baseline in FEV 1 was greater at all post-dose time-points in those receiving CVT-MDI (Fig. 3).

Greater bronchodilation with CVT-MDI than with ALB-HFA was noted in all subgroups. The subgroup analyses demonstrated that treatment differences were consistent across the subgroups, with no significant treatment by subgroup interactions (Table 2 and Fig. 4 [FEV 1 AUC 0–6] and Table 3 and Fig. 5 [peak FEV 1]). The single exception was a marginally significant treatment by subgroup interaction for the subgroup of onset of asthma for FEV 1 AUC 0–6 (p = 0.0463); however, this study was not powered to assess whether all subjects with more severe asthma and low lung function (FEV 1 < 45% predicted) would benefit from the regime.

### Is there a rationale and role for long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators in asthma? [^8e2ed2ab]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Clinical Evidence of Anticholinergic Bronchodilators in Asthma

Historically, short-acting anticholinergic bronchodilators have not been considered appropriate for the control of asthma, except in some cases for the acute treatment of asthma attacks in patients with chronic stable asthma, and in those who experience adverse events from SABAs, such as tachycardia, arrhythmia and tremor. Although short-acting anticholinergics are considered less effective rapid bronchodilators than SABAs such as salbutamol, there are data to suggest that, for acute exacerbations, ipratropium in combination with a SABA as reliever medication improves lung function to a greater extent than a SABA alone. In a double-blind, randomised trial, Rodrigo and Rodrigoinvestigated the effects of high-dose ipratropium plus the SABA albuterol (registered generic name for salbutamol in the USA) in adults with acute asthma, in the emergency department. Patients receiving high-dose ipratropium plus albuterol had a greater improvement in peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in 1 s compared with patients who received albuterol alone. The risk of hospital admission was 49% lower in the ipratropium/albuterol arm. Further, a meta-analysis has indicated that the addition of a short-acting anticholinergic to a SABA is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of hospitalisation in children. Thus, in adults or children, the main justification for the use of short-acting anticholinergic drugs in acute asthma is reduction of the elevated airway smooth muscle and cholinergic tone during an acute crisis, although administration of multiple doses has been associated with a reduction in hospitalisations and risk of hospitalisation.

Drug Interactions

Anticholinergic agents

Although ipratropium bromide is minimally absorbed into the systemic circulation, there is some potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Caution is, therefore, advised in the co-administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution with other drugs having anticholinergic properties.

β-adrenergic agents

Caution is advised in the co-administration of Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution and other sympathomimetic agents due to the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects.

β-receptor blocking agents

These agents and albuterol sulfate inhibit the effect of each other. β-receptor blocking agents should be used with caution in patients with hyperreactive airways, and if used, relatively selective β1selective agents are recommended.

Diuretics

The electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by β-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the β-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of β-agonist-containing drugs, such as Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, with non-potassium sparing diuretics.

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants

Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents because the action of albuterol sulfate on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of ipratropium / albuterol INH (also known as Combivent Respimat):
- **Cardiac arrest**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as fatalities, including cardiac arrest, have been associated with the excessive use of inhaled sympathomimetic drugs in patients with asthma.
- **Cardiovascular adverse events**: use caution in patients taking other sympathomimetic agents.
- **Cardiovascular adverse events**: use caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension.
- **Cardiovascular adverse events**: use extreme caution in patients taking MAOIs or TCAs or within 2 weeks of discontinuation.
- **Decreased drug efficacy**: use caution in patients taking β-blockers.
- **Decreased serum potassium**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as β-agonists may cause significant hypokalemia. Use caution in patients taking non‑potassium-sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.
- **Drug hypersensitivity reaction**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as hypersensitivity reactions, including urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, anaphylaxis, and oropharyngeal edema, may occur after the administration of ipratropium/albuterol.
- **Increased intraocular pressure**: use caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.
- **Paradoxical bronchospasm**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as life-threatening paradoxical bronchospasm may occur after administration. Discontinue immediately if paradoxical bronchospasm occurs.
- **Sympathomimetic adverse effects**: use caution in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines.
- **Urinary retention**: use caution in patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck obstruction.

Albuterol

In a mouse reproduction study, subcutaneously administered albuterol sulfate produced cleft palate formation in 5 of 111 (4.5%) fetuses at a dose approximately equivalent to the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m2basis at a maternal dose of 0.25 mg/kg/day) and in 10 of 108 (9.3%) fetuses at approximately 14 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m2basis at a maternal dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day). Similar effects were not observed at approximately less than MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m2basis at a maternal dose of 0.025 mg/kg/day). Cleft palate also occurred in 22 of 72 (30.5%) fetuses from females treated with 2.5 mg/kg/day isoproterenol (positive control).

In a rabbit reproductive study, orally administered albuterol sulfate induced cranioschisis in 7 of 19 (37%) fetuses at approximately 1100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m2basis at a maternal dose of 50 mg/kg/day).

In a rat reproduction study, an albuterol sulfate/HFA-134a formulation administered by inhalation did not produce any teratogenic effects at exposures approximately 80 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m2basis at a maternal dose of 10.5 mg/kg). A study in which pregnant rats were dosed with radiolabeled albuterol sulfate demonstrated that drug-related material is transferred from the maternal circulation to the fetus.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no available data on the presence of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, or its components, ipratropium bromide or albuterol, in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Although lipid-insoluble quaternary cations pass into breast milk, ipratropium concentrations in plasma after inhaled therapeutic doses are low. Similarly, plasma levels of albuterol after inhaled therapeutic doses are low in humans. Therefore, ipratropium and albuterol concentrations in human breast milk are likely to be correspondingly low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for albuterol and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from albuterol or from the underlying maternal condition.

### The efficacy and safety of inhaled fluticasone propionate / salmeterol and ipratropium / albuterol for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: an eight-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study [^a4165a09]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The pathology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes both obstructive and inflammatory components.

Objective

The aim of this study was to confirm the findings of a previous study that compared the efficacy of a combination of 2 short-acting bronchodilators with the use of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta-agonist in the treatment of COPD.

Methods

We conducted an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study of subjects with moderate to severe COPD to compare fluticasone propionate/salmeterol 250/50 microg BID (FSC) with ipratropium/albuterol 36/206 microg QID (IB/ALB). The primary efficacy measure was morning preadministration forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)). Secondary measures were morning peak expiratory flow (PEF), 6-hour FEV(1) AUC, percentage of symptom-free nights, Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) score, and overall daytime symptom score. Additional measures included sleep symptoms, supplemental albuterol use, and nighttime awakenings due to respiratory symptoms. Safety evaluations were based on clinical adverse events and COPD exacerbations.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between the FSC (n = 180) and IB/ALB (n = 181) groups, including mean age (63.7 and 65.4 years, respectively), mean body weight (81 and 79 kg, respectively), screening pulmonary function (mean [SD], 43.7% [14.2%] and 41.6% [13.4%] of predicted FEV(1)), race (82% and 91% white), and sex (64% and 62% male). FSC resulted in greater improvements in morning preadministration FEV(1), morning PEF, and 6-hour FEV(1) AUC (all, P < 0.001), TDI score (P = 0.026), overall daytime symptom score (P = 0.024), percentage of symptom-free nights (P = 0.010), nighttime awakenings due to respiratory symptoms (P = 0.002), sleep symptom score (P = 0.003), and percentage of days and nights without rescue albuterol use compared with IB/ALB (P = 0.021 and P < 0.001, respectively). Compared with day 1, the FEV(1) AUC at week 8 increased by 0.38 L-h with FSC and decreased by 0.18 L-h with IB/ALB (P < 0.001 between groups). The type and incidence of adverse events were similar between the 2 groups. One or more adverse event was reported for 81 (45%) and 85 (47%) subjects in the FSC and IB/ALB groups, respectively.

Conclusion

In this 8-week study, subjects with moderate to severe COPD experienced greater improvements in lung function and symptom measures with FSC than with IB/ALB.

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT 12-Week Clinical Trials

The safety data described in Table 1 below are derived from one 12-week, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group trial that compared COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg), CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg), and ipratropium bromide delivered by the RESPIMAT inhaler (20 mcg) administered four times a day in 1460 adult COPD patients (955 males and 505 females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 486 were treated with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. The COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasian (88.5%) patients with a mean age of 63.8 years, and a mean percent predicted FEV1at screening of 41.5%. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction were excluded from the trial.

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Table 1 shows all adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency of ≥ 2% in the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT treatment group in the 12-week COPD trial. The frequency of the corresponding adverse reactions in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol and ipratropium bromide delivered by the RESPIMAT inhaler groups is included for comparison. The rates are derived from all reported adverse reactions of that type not present at baseline, whether considered drug-related or not by the clinical investigator.

10 OVERDOSAGE

The effects of overdosage are expected to be related primarily to albuterol sulfate. Acute overdosage with ipratropium bromide by inhalation is unlikely since ipratropium bromide is not well absorbed systemically after inhalation or oral administration. Manifestations of overdosage with albuterol may include anginal pain, hypertension, hypokalemia, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats per minute, metabolic acidosis, and exaggeration of the pharmacologic effects listed in the Adverse Reactions section [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. As with all beta2-adrenergic agonist aerosol medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with abuse.

Treatment of overdosage consists of discontinuation of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT together with institution of appropriate medical and supportive therapy. Dialysis is not appropriate treatment for overdosage of albuterol as an inhalation aerosol; the judicious use of a cardiovascular beta‑receptor blocker, such as metoprolol tartrate, may be indicated.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^a1d1352c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Peters et al. showed that the addition of tiotropium to low-dose ICS resulted in significant improvements in morning and evening PEF, and pre-bronchodilator FEV 1. The combination of tiotropium and low-dose ICS was comparable to a LABA/ICS combination and was significantly better than doubling the ICS dose. In a separate study of patients with severe uncontrolled asthma despite treatment with at least high-dose ICS plus LABA, the addition of tiotropium significantly improved lung function; however, no significant differences were observed in asthma-related health status or rescue medication use in this crossover and short-term setting, the design of which may have impacted the clinical outcome. In a larger, 48-week study of a similar population of patients, the add-on therapy of tiotropium to high-dose ICS/LABA led to significant increases in lung function and significantly increased the time to first severe asthma exacerbation. Bateman et al. showed that adding tiotropium to medium-dose ICS was non-inferior to salmeterol and superior to placebo in patients with moderate asthma with the B16-Arg/Arg genotype whose asthma was not well controlled with ICS alone. Once-daily tiotropium Respimat® added on to ICS was shown to improve lung function in symptomatic adult and adolescent patients with moderate asthma. These studies support a potentially important therapeutic role for the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium as maintenance therapy in the treatment of patients with asthma.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol compared with albuterol in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma: a randomized controlled trial [^0eea3aa8]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Patients were excluded from the study if they had been diagnosed with COPD or other significant disease; however, all patients who were non-smokers or ex-smokers who stopped smoking for > 1 year prior to study participation and had a smoking history < 10 pack-years were eligible. Patients who had been hospitalized for cardiac failure in the past year or who had a recent history of myocardial infarction were excluded.

The study included a 2-week screening period to establish patients' baseline asthma measures and confirm eligibility using bronchodilator reversibility testing — 12% and 200 mL improvement in FEV 1 post-bronchodilator after four puffs of ALB-HFA MDI — at visit two. Patients recorded symptoms, medication use (maintenance ICS ± LABA and "as needed") and peak expiratory flow (PEF) in an electronic diary (eDiary)/peak flow meter (Asthma Monitor® [AM3]; ERT Products, Philadelphia) during the screening period. After the run-in period, eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to either CVT-MDI or ALB-HFA. Patients used blinded study medication as needed (two puffs every 4–6 h, up to four times daily) between visits for symptom relief during the 4-week treatment period. Additionally, patients received open-label ALB-HFA for use if symptom relief could not be achieved with the blinded study medication. Maintenance therapy with high- or low-dose ICS had no impact on outcomes (Table 2) and, as this was a crossover study, all patients served as their own control.

Following the first 4-week treatment period, patients had a 1–7 day washout period (a 6–8-hour wash-out period is generally considered adequate for short-acting antimuscarinics (SAMAs) before entering the second 4-week treatment period with crossover treatment using either CVT-MDI or ALB-HFA. All other (non-asthma) concomitant therapies taken at screening and throughout the trial period were recorded. For washout, patients were instructed to refrain from using their study medication for at least 6 h prior to the scheduled clinic visit. On days 1 and 29, patients underwent lung function testing with 6-hour serial spirometry. Baseline FEV 1 was measured 10-minutes before, and at 5, 15, 30, 60 min, and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 h after study drug administration.

8.4 Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT in pediatric patients have not been established. COMBIVENT RESPIMAT is indicated for use in patients with COPD on a regular aerosol bronchodilator who continue to have evidence of bronchospasm and who require a second bronchodilator. This disease does not normally occur in children.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In the 12-week trial in COPD, 48% of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT clinical trial patients were 65 years of age or over. In general, there were no marked differences between the proportion of patients with adverse reactions for the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol treated patients. Cardiac and lower respiratory disorders occurred less frequently in the patients under the age of 65 and were balanced across treatment groups.

No overall differences in effectiveness were observed among treatment groups. Based on available data, no adjustment of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT dosage in geriatric patients is warranted.

### Randomized pilot trial of ipratropium versus placebo in children with critical asthma [^90ff55e5]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To test the effects of inhaled ipratropium on clinical outcomes of critical asthma in the first randomized trial of this adjunctive therapy in critically ill children.

Design

Pilot, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, and randomized-controlled trial PATIENTS: Thirty children (15 per group) with critical asthma receiving high-intensity albuterol per a standardized pathway utilizing objective assessments to wean patients to less frequent albuterol administration.

Interventions

Subjects were randomized to receive either nebulized ipratropium bromide (500µg in 0.9% saline per dose) or an equivalent volume of nebulized 0.9% saline every 6h until the patient was successfully weaned to albuterol doses every 2h ("q2 albuterol").

Measurements and Main Results

Demographics, initial clinical severity score, and asthma histories were similar between groups. There was no significant difference in the median duration of high-intensity albuterol between the treatment group (17.5 [10.3–22.1]h) and placebo group (14.6 [12.7–24.5] days; p = .56). Similarly, there was no significant difference in pediatric intensive care unit length of stay (22.6 [21.1–33.6] vs. 21.4 [16.1–35.8]h; p = .74) or hospital length of stay (48.0 [41.8–59.8] vs. 47.3 [37.2–63.1]h; p = .67). In multivariate linear regression adjusting for identified confounders, treatment with ipratropium was not significantly associated with any of the three outcomes. Side effects were rare and occurred with equally between both groups CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive therapy with ipratropium was not associated with decreased duration of high-intensity albuterol or shortened length of stay when compared to placebo. A larger, multicenter trial is warranted to confirm that ipratropium does not improve clinical outcomes.

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT Long-Term (48-week) Safety Trial

Long-term chronic use safety data for COMBIVENT RESPIMAT were obtained from one 48-week, randomized, multicenter, open-label, parallel-group trial that compared COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg), CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg), and the free combination of ipratropium bromide (34 mcg) and albuterol (180 mcg) HFA inhalation aerosols administered 4 times a day in 465 adult COPD patients (273 males and 192 females) 40 years of age and older. Of these patients, 157 were treated with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT. The COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group was composed of mostly Caucasian (93.5%) patients with a mean age of 62.9 years, and a mean percent predicted FEV1at screening of 47.0%. An evaluation of the safety data from the trial revealed that most adverse reactions were similar in type and rate between treatment groups. However, cough occurred more frequently in patients enrolled in the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT group (7.0%) compared to those in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (2.6%) or the free combination of ipratropium bromide and albuterol HFA inhalation aerosols (3.9%) groups.

In addition to the adverse reactions reported in the controlled clinical trial with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, adverse reaction information concerning CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol is derived from two 12-week controlled clinical trials (N = 358 for CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol). Adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of patients in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol treatment group include: bronchitis, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, dyspnea, cough, pain, respiratory disorder, sinusitis, pharyngitis, and nausea. Adverse reactions reported in < 2% of patients in the CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol treatment group include: edema, fatigue, hypertension, dizziness, nervousness, tremor, dysphonia, insomnia, diarrhea, dry mouth, dyspepsia, vomiting, arrhythmia, palpitation, tachycardia, arthralgia, angina, increased sputum, taste perversion, urinary tract infection, dysuria, dry throat, and bronchospasm.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including beta-adrenergic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, and oral and inhaled steroids, commonly used in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and these drugs with respect to safety and effectiveness.

7.1 Anticholinergic Agents

There is the potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid coadministration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

7.2 Beta‑adrenergic Agonists

Caution is advised in the coadministration of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT and other sympathomimetic agents due to the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.5)].

7.3 Beta-receptor Blocking Agents

Beta-receptor blocking agents and albuterol inhibit the effect of each other. Beta-receptor blocking agents should be used with caution in patients with hyperreactive airways.

7.4 Diuretics

The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia which may result from the administration of non‑potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta2-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta2-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonist‑containing drugs, such as COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, with non‑potassium sparing diuretics. Consider monitoring potassium levels.

7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAOs or tricyclic antidepressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

### Ipratropium bromide [^ac07b77e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adverse events reported by less than 1% of the patients receiving ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% during the controlled clinical trials that are potentially related to ipratropium bromide's local effects or systemic anticholinergic effects include: taste perversion, nasal burning, conjunctivitis, coughing, dizziness, hoarseness, palpitation, pharyngitis, tachycardia, thirst, tinnitus, and blurred vision. No controlled trial was conducted to address the relative incidence of adverse events for three times daily versus four times daily therapy.

Nasal adverse events seen in the clinical trial with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) patients (see Table 2) were similar to those seen in the common cold trials. Additional events were reported at a higher rate in the SAR trial due in part to the longer duration of the trial and the inclusion of Upper Respiratory Tract Infection (URI) as an adverse event. In common cold trials, URI was the disease under study and not an adverse event.

There were no reports of allergic-type reactions in the controlled clinical common cold and SAR trials.

Post-Marketing Experience

Allergic-type reactions such as skin rash, angioedema, including that of the throat, tongue, lips and face, generalized urticaria (including giant urticaria), laryngospasm, and anaphylactic reactions have been reported with ipratropium bromide nasal solution, 0.06% and for other ipratropium bromide containing products, with positive rechallenge in some cases.

Additional side effects identified from the published literature and/or post-marketing surveillance on the use of ipratropium bromide containing products (singly or in combination with albuterol), include: urinary retention, prostatic disorders, mydriasis, cases of precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma, acute eye pain, ocular irritation wheezing, dryness of the oropharynx, tachycardia, edema, gastrointestinal distress (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), bowel obstruction, constipation, nasal discomfort, throat irritation, hypersensitivity, accommodation disorder, intraocular pressure increased, glaucoma, halo vision, conjunctival hyperaemia, corneal edema, heart rate increased, bronchospasm, pharyngeal edema, gastrointestinal motility disorder, mouth edema, stomatitis, and pruritus.

After oral inhalation of ipratropium bromide in patients suffering from COPD/Asthma supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation have been reported.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Ipratropium Bromide 0.5 mg and Albuterol Sulfate 3 mg* Inhalation Solution

*Equivalent to 2.5 mg albuterol base

Prescription Only.

Read the patient information that comes with Ipratropium Bromide 0.5 mg and Albuterol Sulfate 3 mg before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment.

What is Ipratropium Bromide 0.5 mg and Albuterol Sulfate 3 mg?

Ipratropium Bromide 0.5 mg and Albuterol Sulfate 3 mg is a combination of two medicines called bronchodilators. Ipratropium Bromide 0.5 mg and Albuterol Sulfate 3 mg contains albuterol sulfate, which is a beta-adrenergic agonist, and ipratropium bromide, which is an anticholinergic. These two medicines work together to help open the airways in your lungs. Ipratropium Bromide 0.5 mg and Albuterol Sulfate 3 mg is used to help treat airway narrowing (bronchospasm) that happens with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adult patients who need to use more than one bronchodilator medicine.

5.1 Paradoxical Bronchospasm

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT can produce paradoxical bronchospasm that can be life-threatening. If it occurs, therapy with COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.

5.2 Cardiovascular Effects

The albuterol sulfate contained in COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, like other beta‑adrenergic agonists, can produce a clinically significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, and/or symptoms. If these symptoms occur, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT may need to be discontinued. There is some evidence from postmarketing data and published literature of rare occurrences of myocardial ischemia associated with albuterol. In addition, beta‑adrenergic agonists have been reported to produce electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, such as flattening of the T wave, prolongation of the QTc interval, and ST segment depression. Therefore, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

5.3 Ocular Effects

Ipratropium bromide, a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, is an anticholinergic and may increase intraocular pressure. This may result in precipitation or worsening of narrow-angle glaucoma. Therefore, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT should be used with caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Patients should avoid spraying COMBIVENT RESPIMAT into the eyes. If a patient sprays COMBIVENT RESPIMAT into their eyes they may cause acute eye pain or discomfort, temporary blurring of vision, mydriasis, visual halos, or colored images in association with red eyes from conjunctival or corneal congestion. Advise patients to consult their physician immediately if any of these symptoms develop while using COMBIVENT RESPIMAT.

5.4 Urinary Retention

Ipratropium bromide, a component of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT, is an anticholinergic and may cause urinary retention. Therefore, caution is advised when administering this medication to patients with prostatic hyperplasia or bladder-neck obstruction [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Concomitant use of ipratropium and tiotropium in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^99387568]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the current data evaluating the efficacy and safety of ipratropium used in combination with tiotropium in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Data Sources

A literature search using MEDLINE (1966-August 2012) and EMBASE (1973-August 2012) was conducted using the search terms ipratropium, tiotropium, combination drug therapy, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. References of identified articles were reviewed for additional relevant citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles regarding the concomitant use of ipratropium and tiotropium were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Two prospective randomized controlled trials have demonstrated increases in bronchodilation with ipratropium when added to maintenance tiotropium therapy, suggesting potential benefits during short-term, combined use. One study reported significantly higher peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) responses with both ipratropium (230 mL) and fenoterol (315 mL) compared to placebo (178 mL) when added to maintenance tiotropium. The peak response with fenoterol was significantly higher than with ipratropium (FEV(1) difference = 84 mL). Another study reported a mean difference in FEV(1) of 81 mL (95% CI 27 to 136) with albuterol versus placebo and a mean difference in FEV(1) of 68 mL (95% CI 3 to 132) with ipratropium versus placebo. The difference between albuterol and ipratropium when added to maintenance tiotropium was not significant. One large observational study reported a significantly higher risk of acute urinary retention in individuals receiving combination therapy with a short- and long-acting anticholinergic agent compared to those receiving monotherapy (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.71). Individuals at highest risk were men and those with evidence of benign prostatic hypertrophy.

Conclusions

While ipratropium may provide spirometric improvements in lung function for patients receiving tiotropium maintenance therapy, the clinical significance of these improvements has not been documented and the risk of anticholinergic adverse effects is increased with combination therapy. Further studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of concomitant ipratropium and tiotropium are warranted before combination use can be recommended for select patients.

### Use of inhaled / nebulised ipratropium bromide in addition to standard first-line treatment with inhaled / nebulised short-acting beta 2-agonist and systemic steroid in the management of acute asthma exacerbations: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^c66c4048]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The role of inhaled/nebulised ipratropium bromide (IB) in asthma is unclear.

Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of inhaled/nebulised IB for asthma management in children.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science until July 2024. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and followed international guidelines for reporting systematic reviews. Outcomes included morbidity, escalation of care, length of hospital stay, mortality, adverse events and lung function.

Results

We included 24 studies (total participants n = 3238). The hospitalisation rate (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.00, I ² 30%), hospital stay in hours (MD 1.75, 95%CI -0.87 to 4.36, I ² 15%) and paediatric intensive care (PICU) admission (RR 0.91, 95%CI 0.35 to 2.32, I ² 0%) were similar. The hospitalisation rate was lower in patients who received IB nebuliser (RR 0.76, 95%CI 0.64 to 0.90, I ² 0%). The asthma severity score was significantly better in the IB group (MD -0.38, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.12, I 2 59%). No serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

This review found high-certainty evidence that the IB nebuliser leads to a lower hospitalisation rate. However, when inhaled/nebulised IBs were analysed together, the hospitalisation rate was similar, with moderate certainty evidence. IB improved asthma clinical scores, with low certainty evidence. No difference was reported in other prespecified outcomes. Considering the current evidence and safety profile, inhaled/nebulised IB needs to be considered as an additional treatment for acute asthma exacerbation.

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

ATROVENT HFA has been used concomitantly with other drugs, including sympathomimetic bronchodilators, methylxanthines, oral and inhaled steroids commonly used in the treatment of COPD. With the exception of albuterol, there are no formal studies fully evaluating the interaction effects of ATROVENT HFA and these drugs with respect to safety and effectiveness.

Anticholinergics: May interact additively with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Avoid administration of ATROVENT HFA with other anticholinergic-containing drugs (7.1)

7.1	Anticholinergic Agents

There is potential for an additive interaction with concomitantly used anticholinergic medications. Therefore, avoid coadministration of ATROVENT HFA with other anticholinergic-containing drugs as this may lead to an increase in anticholinergic adverse effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.5)].

Adverse effects and contraindications — nebulized N-acetylcysteine, ipratropium bromide, and albuterol: Reported adverse effects with nebulized N-acetylcysteine include nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, fever, rhinorrhea, drowsiness, chest tightness, bronchial irritation, and, less frequently, bronchospasm in patients with known asthma; bleeding at the injection site was reported with intratracheal instillation versus nebulized administration via an intermittent positive-pressure breathing device, and this event was attributed to the invasive administration technique rather than the medication. For ipratropium bromide, less common adverse effects include tachycardia, palpitations, eye pain, urinary tract infections, and urinary retention, and it is not recommended for patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction. The manufacturer lists adverse reactions after use of albuterol inhalation solution such as urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hoarseness, oropharyngeal edema, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, and extrasystole.

### Use of regularly scheduled albuterol treatment in asthma: genotype-stratified, randomised, placebo-controlled cross-over trial [^cf3103b2]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

The issue of whether regular use of an inhaled beta2-adrenergic agonist worsens airflow and clinical outcomes in asthma is controversial. Retrospective studies have suggested that adverse effects occur in patients with a genetic polymorphism that results in homozygosity for arginine (Arg/Arg), rather than glycine (Gly/Gly), at aminoacid residue 16 of the beta2-adrenergic receptor. However, the existence of any genotype-dependent difference has not been tested in a prospective clinical trial.

Methods

Patients with mild asthma, not using a controller medication, were enrolled in pairs matched for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) according to whether they had the Arg/Arg (n = 37; four of 41 matches withdrew before randomisation) or Gly/Gly (n = 41) genotype. Regularly scheduled treatment with albuterol or placebo was given in a masked, cross-over design, for 16-week periods. During the study, as-needed albuterol use was discontinued and ipratropium bromide was used as needed. Morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was the primary outcome variable. The primary comparisons were between treatment period for each genotype; the secondary outcome was a treatment by genotype effect. Analyses were by intention to treat.

Findings

During the run-in period, when albuterol use was kept to a minimum, patients with the Arg/Arg genotype had an increase in morning PEFR of 23 L/min (p = 0.0162); the change in patients with the Gly/Gly genotype was not significant (2 L/min; p = 0.8399). During randomised treatment, patients with the Gly/Gly genotype had an increase in morning PEFR during treatment with regularly scheduled albuterol compared with placebo (14 L/min [95% CI 3 to 25]; p = 0.0175). By contrast, patients with the Arg/Arg genotype had lower morning PEFR during treatment with albuterol than during the placebo period, when albuterol use was limited (-10 L/min [-19 to -2]; p = 0.0209). The genotype-attributable treatment difference was therefore -24 L/min (-37 to -12; p = 0.0003). There were similar genotype-specific effects in FEV1, symptoms, and use of supplementary reliever medication.

Interpretation

Genotype at the 16th aminoacid residue of the beta2-adrenergic receptor affects the long-term response to albuterol use. Bronchodilator treatments avoiding albuterol may be appropriate for patients with the Arg/Arg genotype.

### Tiotropium in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-a review of clinical development [^4af0123d]. Respiratory Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Tiotropium vs ICS/LABA

Tiotropium 18 μg QD provided a bronchodilatory effect comparable to fluticasone/salmeterol 250/50 μg BID in a 6-week RCT (n = 107) of patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD. In addition, in the Investigating New Standards for Prophylaxis in Reducing Exacerbations (INSPIRE) trial (n = 1323), fluticasone/salmeterol 500/50 μg BID was comparable to tiotropium 18 μg QD in reducing exacerbations (modeled annual exacerbation rate = 1.28 vs 1.32; p = 0.656) in patients with severe and very severe COPD after 2 years of treatment. However, fluticasone/salmeterol was associated with an increased incidence of pneumonia compared with tiotropium (p = 0.008).

Tiotropium vs short-acting muscarinic antagonist/short-acting β 2 -agonist (SAMA/SABA) combinations

Patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD taking ipratropium/albuterol 36/206 μg QID delivered via a pMDI who switched to tiotropium 18 μg QD had significantly improved lung function compared with those who continued taking ipratropium/albuterol (difference in mean trough FEV 1 at 84 days = 0.086 L; p < 0.0001) in a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind, double-dummy study (n = 676). The incidence of respiratory adverse events was lower in the tiotropium group than in the ipratropium/albuterol group. Additionally, tiotropium significantly reduced the risk of exacerbations (p = 0.0086) and COPD-related referrals/hospitalizations (p = 0.004) compared with ipratropium/salbutamol at the end of treatment in a retrospective, 12-month, follow-up study (n = 4193) using the United Kingdom General Practice Research Database.

### Efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide / albuterol delivered via respimat inhaler versus MDI [^f0d23190]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

We compared the efficacy and safety of ipratropium bromide/albuterol delivered via Respimat inhaler, a novel propellant-free inhaler, versus chlorofluorocarbon (CFC)-metered dose inhaler (MDI) and ipratropium Respimat inhaler in patients with COPD. This was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, 12-week, parallel-group, active-controlled study. Patients with moderate to severe COPD were randomized to ipratropium bromide/albuterol (20/100mcg) Respimat inhaler, ipratropium bromide/albuterol MDI [36mcg/206mcg (Combivent Inhalation Aerosol MDI)], or ipratropium bromide (20mcg) Respimat inhaler. Each medication was administered four times daily. Serial spirometry was performed over 6h (0.15min, then hourly) on 4 test days. The primary efficacy variable was forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) change from test day baseline at 12 weeks. A total of 1209 of 1480 randomized, treated patients completed the study; the majority were male (65%) with a mean age of 64 yrs and a mean screening pre-bronchodilator FEV(1) (percent predicted) of 41%. Ipratropium bromide/albuterol Respimat inhaler had comparable efficacy to ipratropium bromide/albuterol MDI for FEV(1) area under the curve at 0-6h (AUC(0–6)), superior efficacy to ipratropium Respimat inhaler for FEV(1) AUC(0–4) and comparable efficacy to ipratropium Respimat inhaler for FEV(1) AUC(4–6). All active treatments were well tolerated. This study demonstrates that ipratropium bromide/albuterol 20/100mcg inhaler administered four times daily for 12 weeks had equivalent bronchodilator efficacy and comparable safety to ipratropium bromide/albuterol 36mcg/206mcg MDI, and significantly improved lung function compared with the mono-component ipratropium bromide 20 mcg Respimat inhaler.

### Long-acting β-agonists in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: current and future agents [^929b1707]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Current position in management guidelines

SABAs such as salbutamol (albuterol), terbutaline, pirbuterol or fenoterol and/or short-acting muscarinic antagonists (SAMAs) such as ipratropium bromide or oxitropium bromide are recommended as rescue medication for all severities of COPD to relieve acute symptoms of bronchospasm. For patients with Stage II (moderate) or more severe COPD, regular treatment with a twice-daily LABA such as formoterol or salmeterol, or a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) such as tiotropium, is more effective and convenient than treatment with the shorter-acting agents. As symptoms progress, combining bronchodilators from different classes is recommended to improve efficacy. Inhaled corticosteroids may be added to bronchodilator treatment in patients with severe COPD and a history of repeated exacerbations.

No one long-acting bronchodilator is recommended over another in management guidelines, because few studies have specifically compared different LABAs. In addition, studies comparing LABAs with LAMAs have not been designed or powered to answer this clinical question to date, providing inconclusive results. The choice therefore depends on availability and the response of the individual patient. Inhaled therapy is preferred to oral therapy, in light of the greater risk of systemic side effects with oral beta-agonists and the unfavorable safety profile of oral methylxanthines.

Recently, there has been extensive research into the efficacy and safety of available twice-daily LABAs, as well as the development of new long-acting β 2 -agonists which have the potential for once-daily use. This paper focuses on the current and future role of LABAs in COPD management. The efficacy and safety of currently available LABAs is reviewed, and their limitations considered. Articles were identified using a PubMed search including search terms for all currently available LABAs (salmeterol, formoterol, arformoterol), β 2 -agonists, efficacy, safety and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/COPD. This is followed by the authors' views on the ideal criteria for a new LABA for COPD, and a discussion of the extent to which novel LABAs, currently being developed, may meet these criteria.

### Tiotropium versus ipratropium bromide for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^afd09c88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Tiotropium and ipratropium bromide are both recognised treatments in the management of people with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There are new studies which have compared tiotropium with ipratropium bromide, making an update necessary.

Objectives

To compare the relative effects of tiotropium to ipratropium bromide on markers of quality of life, exacerbations, symptoms, lung function and serious adverse events in patients with COPD using available randomised controlled trial (RCT) data.

Search Methods

We identified RCTs from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and ClinicalTrials.gov up to August 2015.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel group RCTs of 12 weeks duration or longer comparing treatment with tiotropium with ipratropium bromide for patients with stable COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and then extracted data on study quality and outcome results. We contacted trial sponsors for additional information. We analysed the data using Cochrane Review Manager.

Main Results

This review included two studies of good methodological quality that enrolled 1073 participants with COPD. The studies used a similar design and inclusion criteria and were of at least 12 weeks duration; the participants had a mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 40% predicted value at baseline. One study used tiotropium via the HandiHaler (18 µg) for 12 months and the other via the Respimat device (5 µg and 10 µg) for 12 weeks. In general, the treatment groups were well matched at baseline but not all outcomes were reported for both studies. Overall the risk of bias across the included RCTs was low. For primary outcomes this review found that at the three months trough (the lowest level measured before treatment) FEV1 significantly increased with tiotropium compared to ipratropium bromide (mean difference (MD) 109 mL; 95% confidence interval (CI) 81 to 137, moderate quality evidence, I(2) = 62%). There were fewer people experiencing one or more non-fatal serious adverse events on tiotropium compared to ipratropium (odds ratio (OR) 0.5; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.73, high quality evidence). This represents an absolute reduction in risk from 176 to 97 per 1000 people over three to 12 months. Concerning disease specific adverse events, the tiotropium group were also less likely to experience a COPD-related serious adverse event when compared to ipratropium bromide (OR 0.59; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.85, moderate quality evidence). For secondary outcomes, both studies reported fewer hospital admissions in the tiotropium group (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.15 to 0.70, moderate quality evidence); as well as fewer patients experiencing one or more exacerbations leading to hospitalisation in the people on tiotropium in both studies (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.99, moderate quality evidence). There was no significant difference in mortality between the treatments (OR 1.39; 95% CI 0.44 to 4.39, moderate quality evidence). One study measured quality of life using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ); the mean SGRQ score at 52 weeks was lower in the tiotropium group than the ipratropium group (lower on the scale is favourable) (MD -3.30; 95% CI -5.63 to -0.97, moderate quality evidence). There were fewer participants suffering one of more exacerbations in the tiotropium arm (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95, high quality evidence) and there was also a reported difference in the mean number of exacerbations per person per year which reached statistical significance (MD -0.23; 95% CI -0.39 to -0.07, P = 0.006, moderate quality evidence). From the 1073 participants there were significantly fewer withdrawals from the tiotropium group (OR 0.58; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.83, high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This review shows that tiotropium treatment, when compared with ipratropium bromide, was associated with improved lung function, fewer hospital admissions (including those for exacerbations of COPD), fewer exacerbations of COPD and improved quality of life. There were both fewer serious adverse events and disease specific events in the tiotropium group, but no significant difference in deaths with ipratropium bromide when compared to tiotropium. Thus, tiotropium appears to be a reasonable choice (instead of ipratropium bromide) for patients with stable COPD, as proposed in guidelines. A recent large double-blind trial of the two delivery devices found no substantial difference in mortality using 2.5 µg or 5 µg of tiotropium via Respimat in comparison to 18 µg via Handihaler.

### Ipratropium bromide plus nebulized albuterol for the treatment of hospitalized children with acute asthma [^a44ed9cc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether the addition of repeated doses of nebulized ipratropium bromide (IB) to a standardized inpatient asthma care algorithm (ACA) for children with status asthmaticus improves clinical outcome.

Study Design

Children with acute asthma (N = 210) age 1 to 18 years admitted to the ACA were assigned to the intervention or placebo group in randomized double-blind fashion. Both groups received nebulized albuterol, systemic corticosteroids, and oxygen according to the ACA. The intervention group received 250 microg IB combined with 2.5 mg albuterol by jet nebulization in a dosing schedule determined by the ACA phase. The placebo group received isotonic saline solution substituted for IB. Progression through each ACA phase occurred based on assessments of oxygenation, air exchange, wheezing, accessory muscle use, and respiratory rate performed at prescribed intervals.

Results

No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in hospital length of stay (P = 0.46), asthma carepath progression (P = 0.37), requirement for additional therapy, or adverse effects. Children > 6 years (N = 70) treated with IB had shorter mean hospital length of stay (P = 0.03) and more rapid mean asthma carepath progression (P = 0.02) than children in the placebo group. However, after adjustment was done for baseline group differences, the observed benefit of IB therapy in older children no longer reached statistical significance.

Conclusion

The routine addition of repeated doses of nebulized IB to a standardized regimen of systemic corticosteroids and frequently administered beta-2 agonists confers no significant enhancement of clinical outcome for the treatment of hospitalized children with status asthmaticus.

Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary of Evidence

Our search identified 403 unique articles, of which 15 underwent full-text review. Thirteen articles were identified that reported adverse effects of short-acting inhaled bronchodilators that could be available to first aid providers caring for patients with reactive airway disease; however, none directly addressed the PICOST. Examples of identified adverse effects were tachycardia, arrhythmias, tremor, dizziness, and a decrease in serum potassium concentrations. Bronchodilators included albuterol (salbutamol) through a nebulizer, albuterol (salbutamol) through a metered dose inhaler, fenoterol through a metered dose inhaler, ipratropium through a nebulizer, and metaproterenol through a nebulizer.

Tachycardia was noted with albuterol; however, the increase in heart rate was less when albuterol was delivered through metered dose inhaler compared with delivery by nebulizer (MD, −6.47 bpm [95% CI, −11.69 to −1.25]; P = 0.02). Other studies noted palpitations (salbutamol)and premature ventricular contractions (fenoterol and albuterol)after the use of inhaled bronchodilators.

Multiple studies – documented a decrease in serum potassium concentration after the use of short-acting β-agonists, although these were typically mild (mean decrease, 0.54 mmol/L in 1 study and 0.52 mmol/L in another), and of uncertain clinical significance.

Case reports – describe multiple side effects in patients exposed to short-acting bronchodilators. A case of unilateral mydriasis developed after nebulized ipratropium came into contact with an eye, resulting in the person receiving a CT scan of the brain to evaluate for intracranial abnormalities. Severe bronchospasm occurred after exposure to an albuterol inhaler and nebulizer treatment. Last, 1 patient developed takotsubo cardiomyopathy that was associated with repetitive use of an albuterol inhaler.

### Pharmacologic agents that promote airway clearance in hospitalized subjects: a systematic review [^a21e25d7]. Respiratory Care (2015). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic agents to promote mucus clearance may reduce the sequelae of obstructive secretions. We systematically reviewed comparative studies of pharmacologic agents for mucus clearance in hospitalized or postoperative subjects without cystic fibrosis and over 12 months of age. We searched MEDLINE and other databases from January 1970 to July 2014 to identify relevant literature. Two reviewers independently assessed each study against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two reviewers also independently extracted data regarding subject and intervention characteristics and outcomes and assigned overall quality ratings. The 9 studies meeting review criteria included 5 randomized controlled trials, 3 crossover randomized controlled trials, and one retrospective cohort study. Studies were small and together included a total of 379 subjects (mean of 42 subjects per study). N-acetylcysteine, heparin plus N-acetylcysteine, albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and saline were assessed. Studies reported no benefit of studied agents on expectoration, pulmonary function, and atelectasis and little effect on changes in sputum volume, weight, or viscosity. Adverse effects of agents were not consistently reported. Nausea was reported in 2 studies of N-acetylcysteine (one paper reported 2 experiments and did not clearly identify in which experiment adverse effects occurred), 3 studies reported that there were no adverse events, and 3 studies did not address adverse effects at all. Further research with clearly characterized populations and interventions is needed to understand the potential benefits and adverse effects of mucoactive agents.

### Estimating the effects of continuous albuterol dosage on clinical outcomes for pediatric critical asthma exacerbation: a retrospective cohort study [^3965f92e]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Medium credibility.

4.4 Strengths and Limitations

One of the strengths of our study is the use of stabilized inverse probability weighting (SIPW) to adjust for potential confounding factors and selection bias, enhancing the robustness of our results. Another strength of our study is the use of change in PASS as our primary outcome, which gives a composite representation of the patient's clinical status in the domains most relevant to critical assessment of asthma.

However, our study also has limitations. Reliance on data from a single academic pediatric center, may limit the generalizability of our findings. While use of SIPW bolstered our causative claims for treatment effects, this is still a retrospective observational study and may be subject to residual bias due to unmeasured confounders. Thus, causality should be interpreted with caution. Less than a quarter of patients assigned to the 10 mg/h treatment group were subsequently increased to 15 mg/h based on clinical status. However, we would expect patients like this to bias the data toward poorer outcomes for the 10 mg/h treatment group, which we did not observe. A significant portion of our cohort were missing the primary outcome of PASS at 24‐h, which may add bias to our conclusions. The difference in age between the groups led to a whole cohort difference in weight‐based albuterol dosing received which may bias the study outcomes. However, the post‐hoc sub analysis revealed that when stratified by age, the treatment group did receive a lower weight‐based dose of continuous albuterol as well as flat rate dosing. While additional therapies such as ipratropium, magnesium sulfate, and epinephrine were included in the analysis, others were not, such as cumulative pre‐hospitalization albuterol or systemic steroids, which may introduce bias. Finally, although relatively limited, there were still missing observations for some outcomes, which could also add bias to the results.

4.5 Future Directions

Future research could follow several different threads of inquiry. First, studies could replicate our findings in diverse clinical settings and populations to validate the effectiveness of 10 mg/h of initial continuous albuterol in pediatric asthma management. Second, studies could investigate even lower dosages, a broader panel of dosages, and/or weight‐based dosing regimens to see if comparable outcomes persist. Also, studies could further investigate the long‐term outcomes and possible adverse effects associated with lower doses of continuous albuterol. Finally, prospective, randomized trials would be most effective in determining the true treatment effects of separate dosing regimens.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0c36d300]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Short-acting inhaled beta2 agonist bronchodilators (SABA) — e.g., salbutamol (albuterol), terbutaline — are administered by pMDI, DPI or, rarely, as solution for nebulization or injection. Inhaled SABAs provide quick relief of asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction and are used for pre-treatment before exercise; SABAs should be used only as-needed (not regularly) and at the lowest dose and frequency required, and SABA-only treatment is not recommended because of the risk of severe exacerbations and asthma-related death. Currently, inhaled SABAs are the most commonly used bronchodilator for acute exacerbations requiring urgent primary care visit or ED presentation. Adverse effects include tremor and tachycardia with initial use; tolerance develops rapidly with even 1–2 weeks of regular use, with increased airway hyperresponsiveness, reduced bronchodilator effect, and increased airway inflammation. Excess use or poor response indicate poor asthma control and risk of exacerbations, and dispensing of 3 or more 200-dose canisters per year is associated with increased risk of exacerbations, while dispensing of 12 or more canisters per year is associated with markedly increased risk of death.

Study patients

Eligible patients were 40 to 75 years of age with an established clinical history of COPD; current or prior history of at least 10 pack-years of cigarette smoking; measured post-ipratropium forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of ≤ 0.70; measured post-ipratropium FEV 1 ≥ 50% and ≤ 85% of predicted normal values; and demonstrated reversibility to ipratropium (> 200 mL improvement and/or > 12% and > 150 mL improvement from baseline FEV 1 30 minutes following administration of 4 puffs of ipratropium).

Key exclusion criteria were a primary diagnosis of asthma, history of significant diseases other than COPD, acute worsening of COPD that required treatment within 6 weeks prior to screening or between the screening and baseline visits, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction, known narrow-angle glaucoma, uncontrolled hypertension, or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities.

Study patients meeting the entry criteria who were taking certain COPD medications at screening (TIO, oral β 2 -agonists, long-acting β 2 -agonists [LABAs], combination corticosteroid/LABA products, theophylline, leukotriene inhibitors [zafirlukast, montelukast, zileuton], or cromoglycate and/or nedocromil) discontinued these medications for the duration of the trial and were switched to short-acting bronchodilators (ipratropium, albuterol, or ipratropium/albuterol combination), with or without an inhaled corticosteroid. During the study, 3.1% (n = 1) of study subjects were using concomitant inhaled corticosteroids. Patients that were not taking any of the COPD medications, and were previously maintained on albuterol, ipratropium or a combination thereof, with or without an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) for at least one week prior to screening (Visit 1a), were permitted to proceed directly to Visit 2, providing they met all entry criteria. Study patients previously treated with a maintenance dose of an ICS that was not administered as a fixed dose combination together with a LABA were permitted to continue the ICS, providing the daily dose did not exceed 1,000 μg of fluticasone or equivalent, and they had been maintained on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks.

### Inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists versus ipratropium for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^5ba4e78f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled short acting beta2 adrenergic agonists and ipratropium bromide are both used in the treatment of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Objectives

In patients with acute exacerbations of COPD to: 1. To assess the efficacy of short-acting beta-2 agonists against placebo; 2. Compare the efficacy of short-acting beta-2 agonists and ipratropium.

Search Strategy

A comprehensive search of the literature was carried out of EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane COPD trials register was carried out using the terms: bronchodilator* OR albuterol OR metaproterenol OR terbutaline OR isoetharine OR pirbuterol OR salbutamol OR beta-2 agonist.

Selection Criteria

All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus.

Data Collection and Analysis

All trials that appeared to be relevant were assessed by two reviewers who independently selected trials for inclusion. Differences were resolved by consensus. References listed in each included trial were searched for additional trial reports. Trials were combined using Review Manager using a fixed effects model. The size of the treatment effects were tested for heterogeneity.

Main Results

We identified no placebo-controlled comparisons of beta-2 agonists. Three studies permitted comparison of ipratropium to an inhaled beta-2 agonist. These studies included a total of 103 patients. The beta2-agonists used were: fenoterol and metaproterenol. One study was a parallel group trial of regular therapy for seven days. The other two were cross over studies of single dose treatments, with efficacy measured 90 min post dose. There was no washout period between treatments. Both treatments produced an improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) after 90 min in the range 150–250 ml. The was no difference between treatments, mean difference in FEV1 10 ml; 95% CI -220, 230 ml. In one small crossover study (n = 10) there was a significant improvement in arterial PaO2 after 30 minutes with ipratropium (+5.8 mm Hg ± 3.0 (SEM)) compared to metaproterenol (-6.2 ± 1.2 mm Hg), but this was not significant at 90 min. There were no data concerning respiratory symptoms. The crossover studies showed no evidence of an additive effect of the two treatments, although they were not designed specifically to test this.

Reviewer's Conclusions

There are few controlled trial data concerning the use of inhaled beta2-agonist agents in acute exacerbations of COPD and none that have compared these agents directly with placebo. None of the studies used the more modern beta2-agonists used most widely in this setting (salbutamol and terbutaline). Beta2-agonists and ipratropium both produce small improvements in FEV1, but beta2-agonists may worsen PaO2 for a period. We could not draw conclusions concerning possible additive effects.

### Prevention of acute exacerbations of COPD: American College of Chest Physicians and Canadian Thoracic Society guideline [^5e2a2c78]. Chest (2015). Medium credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation prevention — short-acting muscarinic antagonist plus short-acting β2-agonist vs short-acting β2-agonist alone — In patients with moderate to severe COPD, we suggest the use of short-acting muscarinic antagonist plus short-acting β2-agonist compared with short-acting β2-agonist alone to prevent acute moderate exacerbations of COPD (Grade 2B). Evidence notes there has been only one study with exacerbation as an end point that favored the combination (ipratropium plus short-acting β2-agonist), but it had serious bias and inconsistency and was rated as overall low quality; five additional studies enrolling 1,591 patients from 42 to 85 days used addition or increase in oral steroids as an end point and in aggregate had an overall moderate quality of evidence, leading to a grade 2B recommendation. Values and preferences emphasize reducing the risk of acute exacerbations along with comparative small benefits in quality of life, exercise tolerance, and lung function versus short-acting β2-agonist alone, with no significant differences in serious adverse events between regimens.

Procedures

Spirometry was performed according to American Thoracic Society criteria at baseline, four weeks and every six months following randomisation. After screening, spirometry was performed prior to, and following, short-acting bronchodilator and study drug administration. Short-acting bronchodilators were administered sequentially (ipratropium bromide four actuations, albuterol four actuations 60 minutes later) with spirometry being performed 30 minutes following the last dose. HRQoL was measured using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) at baseline and every six months. Exacerbations were recorded on case report forms and were required to follow a standard definition as follows: an increase in or the new onset of more than one respiratory symptom (cough, sputum, sputum purulence, wheezing or dyspnea) lasting three days or more and requiring treatment with an antibiotic or a systemic corticosteroid. All adverse events were recorded throughout the period of study drug administration. In addition, investigators were requested to collect vital status information on patients who prematurely discontinued study medication during the four years of the trial.

Data Analysis

Spirometric variables (FEV 1, FVC and slow vital capacity) and SGRQ were analysed using random-effects models. The decline of lung function over time was analysed with random co-efficient regression. Patients were categorised according to quartiles based on the annualised rate of post-bronchodilator FEV 1 decline. As treatment intervention with tiotropium would potentially interact with the health outcomes measured, the analysis was stratified by treatment group. Hazard ratios for exacerbations, hospitalised exacerbations and death were determined using Cox regression. The numbers of exacerbations and associated hospitalisations were calculated using Poisson regression with adjustment for overdispersion and treatment exposure. Baseline data were not included in the FEV 1 model.

### For COPD a combination of ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate is more effective than albuterol base… [^6660a661]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

The patients' symptoms were graded from 0 to 3. Safety end points were frequency of adverse events, changes from baseline physical examination findings over the 29 days, and changes from baseline in vital signs during the pulmonary function test days. Adverse events were recorded at each visit by the physician, including date of onset, number of minutes between the time of the last dose of study medication and the onset of the event, end date, intensity of the event, treatment required, outcome of the event, and the investigator's assessment of each event's relationship to the study drug. Adverse events were similar between the 2 treatment groups. During active treatment, 45 of 177 patients receiving combined therapy and 60 of 180 patients receiving albuterol therapy reported adverse events or worsening of the preexisting condition that was present at baseline.

Lower respiratory tract system disorders were the most commonly reported adverse events. These were reported by 16 patients receiving combined therapy and 30 receiving albuterol alone; the difference was not statistically significant. Investigators were asked to rate the probability that adverse events were drug related using the criteria by Karch and Lasagna, 6 ie, "possible, " "probable, " or "definite. " Over the course of the 29 days of active therapy, 13 patients using combined medication and 14 patients using albuterol alone were classified as having adverse events that were at least possibly related to drug treatment. Fewer patients using combined therapy reported moderate to severe adverse events than with albuterol alone. Fewer patients receiving combined therapy reported moderate to severe COPD exacerbations than those receiving albuterol.

There was no evidence of potentiation of adverse events in the combined therapy group compared with albuterol base alone. In fact, the overall incidence of adverse events was lower in the combination therapy group than in the albuterol group. Nor was combination therapy associated with worsening of adverse effects: only 14. 1% of patients using the combination aerosol reported moderate to severe adverse events, compared with
22. 2% in the albuterol group.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT is one inhalation four times a day. Patients may take additional inhalations as required; however, the total number of inhalations should not exceed six in 24 hours.

Prior to first use, the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT cartridge is inserted into the COMBIVENT RESPIMAT inhaler and the unit is primed. When using the unit for the first time, patients are to actuate the inhaler toward the ground until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times. The unit is then considered primed and ready for use. If not used for more than 3 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler once to prepare the inhaler for use. If not used for more than 21 days, patients are to actuate the inhaler until an aerosol cloud is visible and then repeat the process three more times to prepare the inhaler for use [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Safety and efficacy of additional doses of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT beyond six inhalations/24 hours have not been studied. Also, safety and efficacy of extra doses of ipratropium or albuterol in addition to the recommended doses of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT have not been studied.

### Ipratropium bromide and albuterol sulfate (redPharm drug) [^a60713cb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is a combination of the β2-adrenergic bronchodilator, albuterol sulfate, and the anticholinergic bronchodilator, ipratropium bromide.

Mechanism of Action

Albuterol sulfate

The prime action of β-adrenergic drugs is to stimulate adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The cAMP thus formed mediates the cellular responses. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that albuterol has a preferential effect on β2-adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that β2-adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, recent data indicated that 10% to 50% of the β-receptors in the human heart may be β2-receptors. The precise function of these receptors, however, is not yet established. Albuterol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects. Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other β-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients.

Ipratropium bromide

Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic (parasympatholytic) agent, which blocks the muscarinic receptors of acetylcholine, and, based on animal studies, appears to inhibit vagally mediated reflexes by antagonizing the action of acetylcholine, the transmitter agent released from the vagus nerve. Anticholinergics prevent the increases in intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting from the interaction of acetylcholine with the muscarinic receptors of bronchial smooth muscle.

Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution

Ipratropium Bromide and Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution is expected to maximize the response to treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by reducing bronchospasm through two distinctly different mechanisms: sympathomimetic (albuterol sulfate) and anticholinergic / parasympatholytic (ipratropium bromide). Simultaneous administration of both an anticholinergic and a β2-sympathomimetic is designed to produce greater bronchodilation effects than when either drug is utilized alone at its recommended dosage.

Health Outcomes

The proportion of patients with at least one exacerbation over four years showed a minimal difference from the lowest rate of decline (Q1 = 66.6% [tiotropium] and 73.3% [control]) to the largest rate of decline (Q4 = 73.8% [tiotropium] and 76.6% [control]) (Figure 2A). However, in general, there was an increased rate of exacerbations with increasing rate of decline in post-bronchodilator FEV 1 (Table 3). The highest proportion of patients with at least one hospitalised exacerbation was in the group with the largest rate of decline (Q1 = 19.5% [tiotropium] and 26% [control], Q4 = 33.8% [tiotropium] and 33.1% [control]) (Figure 2B). Overall, the time to the first exacerbation and first hospitalised exacerbation was shorter with increasing rate of decline in FEV 1 quartiles, although results were somewhat inconsistent, especially for patients in the third quartile in the control group (Table 4).

Conclusions

In terms of clinical outcomes and safety, we could not find convincing evidence that salmeterol and formoterol have demonstrated advantages to ipratropium, a less expensive drug, for patients with stable COPD and poor reversibility. Compared to placebo, we found evidence of reduced rescue inhaler usage and improved spirometric outcomes without a significant impact on quality of life or exercise capacity.

Short-acting antimuscarinics (anticholinergics) — e.g., ipratropium bromide and oxitropium bromide, which may be in combination with SABA — are delivered by pMDI or DPI for as-needed use; ipratropium is a less effective reliever medication than SABA, with slower onset of action. Short-term use in severe acute asthma, where adding ipratropium to SABA reduces the risk of hospital admission, is described; adverse effects are dryness of the mouth or a bitter taste.

### The use of ipratropium bromide for the management of acute asthma exacerbation in adults and children: a systematic review [^90e5908d]. The Journal of Asthma (2001). Low credibility.

Ipratropium bromide is a quaternary anticholinergic bronchodilator that is commonly used to treat obstructive lung disease. Although ipratropium is not usually employed as a first-line bronchodilator to treat chronic asthma, it has been used extensively in hospital emergency departments as adjunctive therapy for the emergency treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. This review will summarize the physiological actions of ipratropium and the rationale for its use as an anticholinergic bronchodilator. Evidence available from randomized trials and from two meta-analyses is summarized to determine whether the addition of inhaled ipratropium to inhaled beta2-agonist therapy is effective in the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation in children and adults. Published reports of randomized, controlled trials assessing the use of ipratropium and concurrent beta2-agonists in adult acute asthma exacerbation were identified by a search of electronic databases, as well as by hand searching. Data from 10 studies of adult asthmatics, reporting on a total of 1377 patients, were pooled in a meta-analysis using a weighted-average method. Use of nebulized ipratropium/beta2-agonist combination therapy was associated with a pooled 7.3% improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 sec [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8–10.9%] and a 22.1% improvement in peak expiratory flow (95% CI, 11.0–33.2%) compared with patients who received beta2-agonist without ipratropium. For the three trials in adults reporting hospital admission data (n = 1064), adult patients receiving ipratropium had a relative risk of hospitalization of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.61–1.06). Similarly, randomized controlled studies of pediatric asthma exacerbation and a meta-analysis of pediatric asthma patients suggest that ipratropium added to beta2-agonists improves lung function and also decreases hospitalization rates, especially among children with severe exacerbations of asthma. The adult and pediatric studies did not report any severe adverse effects attributable to ipratropium when it was used in conjunction with beta2-agonists. In conclusion, there is a modest statistical improvement in airflow obstruction when ipratropium is used as an adjunctive to beta2-agonists for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. In pediatric asthma exacerbation, use of ipratropium also appears to improve clinical outcomes; however, this has not been definitively established in adults. It would seem reasonable to recommend the use of combination ipratropium/beta2-agonist therapy in acute asthmatic exacerbation, since the addition of ipratropium seems to provide physiological evidence of benefit without risk of adverse effects.

### Albuterol sulfate (albuterol) [^0bc50878]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

General

Albuterol, as with all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension; in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus; and in patients who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been seen in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some patients after use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.

Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. As with other beta-agonists, albuterol may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient, not requiring supplementation.

Information for Patients

The action of albuterol tablets may last up to 8 hours or longer. Albuterol tablets should not be taken more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of albuterol tablets without consulting your physician. If you find that treatment with albuterol tablets becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms get worse, and/or you need to take the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While you are taking albuterol tablets, other asthma medications and inhaled drugs should be taken only as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include palpitations, chest pain, rapid heart rate, and tremor or nervousness. If you are pregnant or nursing, contact your physician about use of albuterol tablets. Effective and safe use of albuterol tablets includes an understanding of the way that it should be administered.

### Management of acute loss of asthma control in the yellow zone: a practice parameter [^c6b6e996]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) plus anticholinergics in acute asthma — mixed evidence and dose effect: "There is controversy over the use of anticholinergic agents, such as ipratropium, as a reliever bronchodilator in the care of patients with acute asthma," with early studies showing that "the greatest improvement in FEV1 occurred at 45 and 90 minutes after therapy with the combined use of ipratropium and fenoterol compared with either alone in 148 patients with asthma with acute exacerbations," but others found "no long-term benefit," noting that "Although patients receiving the combination of albuterol plus ipratropium showed greater improvement in FEV1 at 45 minutes, no sustained benefit was seen at 90 minutes… " and that "in most of these studies, a low dose of ipratropium was used." In contrast, high-dose combination in the ED showed benefit: "4 puffs of high-dose ipratropium therapy (21 µg per puff) and albuterol (120 µg per puff) in 1 inhaler every 10 minutes for 3 hours," in "180 patients," produced "greater improvements in PEF (20.5%) and FEV1 (18.4%)," with hospitalization "39%… albuterol alone and… 20%… albuterol-ipratropium combination," and benefit greatest when "FEV1 of 30% or less of predicted and symptoms for at least 24 hours before ED presentation."

### Pharmacogenomic associations of adverse drug reactions in asthma: systematic review and research prioritisation [^f12f8023]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Table 3
Adverse drug reaction for each SNP in included studies.

ALL acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, FEV 1 forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FEF 25–75 forced expiratory flow at 25–75% of pulmonary volume, PEFR peak expiratory flow rate, BMD bone mineral density, GWAS genome-wide association study, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, SNP single-nucleotide polymorphism, CI confidence interval

Regarding the ADR's in SABAs, one study, examining 78 adults found that if participants had the homozygous Arg16/Arg16 allele then the performance was lower when on albuterol compared with the placebo, with the peak expiratory flow rate being 23 L/min better when albuterol was stopped. However, when this was replaced with ipratropium bromide, an anti-muscarinic, this group of participants had higher peak flow rates than when on albuterol or placebo.

For LABAs, one study that had examined 22 adult participants found that participants with the homozygous Gly16/Gly16 genotypes had maximum FEV 1, maximum FEF 25–75, 6 h FEV 1, and 6 h FEF 25–75 values lower compared with the Arg16/Arg16 genotype when given formoterol.

With inhaled corticosteroids, one study, examining 407 children from the PASS (Pharmacogenetics of Adrenal Suppression with Inhaled Steroids) study aged 5–18 years found that the SNP rs591118, located in the vicinity of the PDGFD gene, was associated with a higher risk of adrenal suppression (odds ratio in the paediatric asthma replication cohort 3.86, 95% CI 1.19–12.50).

For oral corticosteroids, two studies examined children aged 5–12 years, from the CAMP (Childhood Asthma Management Program) trial, and the effect of prednisone on bone mineral density (BMD) z scores and bone mineral accretion (BMA). For decreases in BMD- z scores one SNP was identified, rs6461639, and in the acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) replication cohort it was significant (p value = 0.016). With the other study, two associated SNPs were found to worsen BMA with increased prednisone dosage, rs989633 and rs207439.

Internal replication was undertaken in two of the studies, both that examined corticosteroids. However, additional publications attempting external replication of these polymorphisms have not been identified.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^bcae57e3]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Antimuscarinic drugs — adverse effects and safety in COPD — are summarized. Inhaled anticholinergic drugs are poorly absorbed which limits the troublesome systemic effects observed with atropine, and extensive use across doses and settings has shown them to be very safe; the main side effect is dryness of mouth, while occasional urinary symptoms have been reported without data proving a true causal relationship. Some patients using ipratropium report a bitter, metallic taste. An unexpected small increase in cardiovascular events in COPD patients regularly treated with ipratropium bromide has been reported, whereas in a large, long-term clinical trial tiotropium added to other standard therapies had no effect on cardiovascular risk. Although there were initial concerns about tiotropium delivered via the Respimat inhaler, a large trial observed no difference in mortality or exacerbation rates when comparing tiotropium in a dry-powder inhaler and the Respimat inhaler. There are less safety data for other LAMAs, but anti-cholinergic side-effect rates appear low and generally similar, and use of solutions with a facemask can precipitate acute glaucoma due to direct contact between the solution and the eye.

### Ipratropium bromide and albuterol (combivent respimat) [^662e1b30]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) was shown to be non-inferior to CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg) in terms of mean FEV1AUC0-6h. The LS mean (mL) (95% CI) of the treatment difference was -3 (-22, 15). The FEV1AUC0-4hfor COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg), was superior to that of ipratropium bromide [LS mean (mL) (95% CI) of the treatment difference was 47 mL (28, 66)] and the mean FEV1AUC4-6hfor COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) was non-inferior to that of ipratropium bromide [LS mean (mL) (95% CI) of the treatment difference was -17 (-39, 5)]. The FEV1results on Test Days 1, 29, 57, and 85 are shown in Figure 1.

In this trial, COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) was shown to be clinically comparable (statistically non-inferior) to CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg).

Additionally, in this trial, no differences in these efficacy comparisons were identified in males and females or in patients over 65 years of age versus those under 65 years of age. There were too few African-American subjects to adequately assess differences in effects in that population.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) was evaluated in COPD patients in one randomized, double-blind, double-dummy parallel group trial. This was a 12-week trial in a total of 1460 adult patients (955 males and 505 females) conducted to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) in COPD. All patients were required to have a clinical diagnosis of COPD, be at least 40 years of age or older, to have an FEV1of less than or equal to 65% predicted and an FEV1/FVC ratio of less than or equal to 0.7 at screening, and a smoking history of greater than 10 pack-years prior to entering the trial. Patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy, or bladder neck obstruction were excluded from the trial. The majority of the patients (89%) were Caucasian, had a mean age of 64 years, a mean percent predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV1of 41% and FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.45. The patients were randomized to one of the following active treatments COMBIVENT RESPIMAT (20/100 mcg) (n = 486), CFC-propelled COMBIVENT Inhalation Aerosol (36/206 mcg) (n = 491), and ipratropium bromide delivered by the RESPIMAT (20 mcg) (n = 483) administered four times a day. Data from 1424 patients were used in the efficacy analyses.

### Inhaled anticholinergics and short-acting beta (2)-agonists versus short-acting beta2-agonists alone for children with acute asthma in hospital [^8a0c3b23]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inhaled anticholinergics given in addition to β2-agonists are effective in reducing hospital admissions in children presenting to the emergency department with a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. It seems logical to assume a similar beneficial effect in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of anticholinergics added to β2-agonists as inhaled or nebulised therapy in children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation. To investigate the characteristics of patients or therapy, if any, that would influence the magnitude of response attributable to the addition of anticholinergics.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), which is derived through systematic searches of bibliographic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO and through handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts. The search is current to November 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials comparing the combination of inhaled or nebulised anticholinergics and short-acting β2-agonists versus short-acting β2-agonists alone in children one to 18 years of age hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality of trials and extracted data; disagreement was resolved by consensus or with the input of a third review author, when needed. Primary outcomes were duration of hospital stay and serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included admission and duration of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), ventilation assistance, time to short-acting β2-agonists spaced at four hours or longer, supplemental asthma therapy, duration of supplemental oxygen, change from baseline in asthma severity, relapse after discharge, adverse health effects and withdrawals.

Main Results

Seven randomised trials were included, four of which reported usable data on 472 children with asthma one to 18 years of age who were admitted to paediatric wards. No trials included patients admitted to the ICU. The anticholinergic used, ipratropium bromide 250 μg, was given every one to eight hours over a period from four hours to the entire length of the hospital stay. Two of four trials (50%) contributing data were deemed of high methodological quality. The addition of anticholinergics to β2-agonists showed no evidence of effect on the duration of hospital admission (mean difference (MD) -0.28 hours, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.07 to 4.52, 3 studies, 327 participants, moderate quality evidence) and no serious or non-serious adverse events were reported in any included trials. As a result of the similarity of trials, we could not explore the influence of age, admission site, intensity of anticholinergic treatment and co-interventions on primary outcomes. No statistically significant group difference was noted in other secondary outcomes, including the need for supplemental asthma therapy, time to short-acting β2-agonists spaced at four hours or longer, asthma clinical scores, lung function and overall withdrawals for any reason.

Authors' Conclusions

In children hospitalised for an acute asthma exacerbation, no evidence of benefit for length of hospital stay and other markers of response to therapy was noted when nebulised anticholinergics were added to short-acting β2-agonists. No adverse health effects were reported, yet the small number of trials combined with inadequate reporting prevent firm reassurance regarding the safety of anticholinergics. In the absence of trials conducted in ICUs, no conclusion can be drawn regarding children with impending respiratory failure. These findings support current national and international recommendations indicating that healthcare practitioners should refrain from using anticholinergics in children hospitalised for acute asthma.

### A randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study comparing formoterol dry powder inhaler with albuterol metered-dose inhaler [^2b936c28]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Formoterol is a beta2-adrenergic agent which, when inhaled, produces rapid and long-lasting bronchodilatation.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of formoterol powder for inhalation delivered via the Aerolizer device with placebo and with albuterol delivered via metered-dose inhaler in patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma.

Methods

In a multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group study, 541 patients were randomized at 26 trial sites to receive either formoterol, 12 microg twice daily; formoterol, 24 microg twice daily; albuterol, 180 microg four times daily; or a placebo for 12 weeks. The effects of each treatment on lung function, asthma symptoms, and frequency of rescue albuterol use were evaluated. Adverse effects and clinical laboratory parameters were also evaluated.

Results

The bronchodilatory effects of formoterol were rapid in onset and persisted for 12 hours. Both formoterol doses were more effective than placebo and albuterol for objective measures of lung function. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates were more improved with formoterol, and formoterol provided significantly greater improvements in asthma symptom scores compared with both albuterol and placebo. Overall, patients taking formoterol used significantly less rescue medication than did those taking albuterol or placebo. Nocturnal awakenings occurred less often with formoterol than with placebo or albuterol. The therapeutic effects of formoterol were maintained over the entire 12 weeks of treatment. Adverse events were similar for all treatment groups, and clinical laboratory data were unremarkable.

Conclusions

Rapid-onset, long-acting formoterol, administered via the Aerolizer inhaler, is an effective and safe treatment for patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, our study contributes to the understanding of inpatient pediatric asthma management by providing evidence that lower starting doses of continuous albuterol may be equally effective as higher doses in managing severe acute asthma exacerbations in children. By addressing concerns regarding variability in dosing practices and potential adverse effects, we have advanced knowledge in the field and paved the way for safer care as well as better resource management.

### Effects of formoterol (oxis turbuhaler) and ipratropium on exercise capacity in patients with COPD [^96293b40]. Respiratory Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Although long-acting inhaled beta 2-agonists improve various outcome measures in COPD, no double-blind study has yet shown a significant effect of these drugs on exercise capacity. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, patients received formoterol (4, 5, 9, or 18 micrograms b.i.d. via Turbuhaler), ipratropium bromide (80 micrograms t.i.d. via pMDI with spacer), or placebo for 1 week. Main endpoint was time to exhaustion (TTE) in an incremental cycle ergometer test. Secondary endpoints were Borg dyspnoea score during exercise, lung function, and adverse events. Thirty-four patients with COPD were included, mean age 64.8 years, FEV1 55.6% predicted, reversibility 6.1% predicted. All doses of formoterol, and ipratropium significantly improved TTE, FEV1, FEF25-75%, FRC, IVC, RV and sGAW compared with placebo. A negative dose-response relationship was observed with formoterol. Ipratropium increased time to exhaustion more compared with formoterol, 18 micrograms, but not with formoterol, 4.5 and 9 micrograms. No changes in Borg score were found. There was no difference in the adverse event profile between treatments. In conclusion, 1 week of treatment with formoterol and ipratropium significantly improved exercise capacity and lung function compared with placebo. However, a negative dose-response relation for formoterol was unexpected and needs further investigation.

### Combination bronchodilator therapy in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^883eac81]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Consideration of potential adverse effects of LAMA/LABA combinations

The safety profiles of both LAMAs and LABAs are well understood. However, when combining two entities, it is important to understand both the similarities and differences in adverse events. Given that both muscarinic antagonists and β 2 -agonists can have a detrimental effect on the cardiovascular system, these adverse events need to be monitored carefully in development programs for combination products. Initial results suggest that the cardiovascular safety profile of glycopyrronium plus indacaterol is similar to placebo, with no clinically significant differences observed versus placebo, and, to date, no safety concerns have been identified with tiotropium plus olodaterol. Free combinations of LAMA/LABA also seem well tolerated. No differences in blood pressure and pulse rate were observed with tiotropium plus salmeterol versus single-agent therapies and the meta-analysis of tiotropium plus formoterol data reported no differences in cumulative incidence of adverse events for the combination (33.2%) versus tiotropium alone (36.0%), stating that drug-related severe adverse events and cardiac effects were relatively rare.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^4ba1fb0f]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

Respiratory distress — notes/educational pearls: The combination of ipratropium with albuterol may decrease the need for hospital admission in certain patients. Magnesium sulfate may cause hypotension that will usually respond to a fluid bolus. Patient with acute heart failure and hypotension have high mortality. When assessing for cause of respiratory distress, CHF tends to be associated with lower levels of EtCO2 compared to COPD, and EtCO2 values that are extremely low and high are markers of poor outcomes and need for intubation or ICU admission.

### Efficacy and safety of formoterol for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^9ea85ba7]. Respiratory Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Formoterol is a selective long-acting beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist (LABA) that provides significant and sustained bronchodilatory effect for up to 12h following a single dose. The onset of effect is significantly faster with formoterol compared with an alternative LABA, salmeterol, although both have a similar duration of action. The overall efficacy of formoterol in improving lung function and controlling symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is comparable to that of salmeterol and potentially superior to that of ipratropium or theophylline. Formoterol provides additional benefit when administered in combination with other bronchodilators or inhaled corticosteroids. In clinical studies, formoterol was well tolerated and had an adverse-event profile similar to that of other beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists. Formoterol is a rapidly acting, well-tolerated, effective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist that can be regularly used as a long-acting bronchodilator for patients with moderate to severe COPD, as per recommendations of the current treatment guidelines.

Treatment of cough in athletes — evidence is limited to six studies evaluating respiratory symptom outcomes in 201 athletes (mean age, 20 years; 84% men). Across medications including ipratropium, albuterol, ciclesonide, montelukast, and budesonide, effects on exercise-induced respiratory symptoms including cough were modest or absent. A subgroup of crosscountry skiers had decreased cough after pretreatment with 80 mg of inhaled ipratropium, and a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial reported that a daily supplement of 600 mg of vitamin C for 21 days reduced the duration and incidence of upper RTI symptoms including cough before and following a 90-km run.

### Albuterol sulfate (proAir respiClick) [^ae016ed5]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

In addition to the adverse reactions reported from clinical trials with PROAIR RESPICLICK, the following adverse events have been reported during use of other inhaled albuterol sulfate products: Urticaria, angioedema, rash, bronchospasm, hoarseness, oropharyngeal edema, and arrhythmias (including atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles), rare cases of aggravated bronchospasm, lack of efficacy, asthma exacerbation (potentially fatal), muscle cramps, and various oropharyngeal side-effects such as throat irritation, altered taste, glossitis, tongue ulceration, and gagging. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

In addition, albuterol, like other sympathomimetic agents, can cause adverse reactions such as: angina, hypertension or hypotension, palpitations, central nervous system stimulation, insomnia, headache, nervousness, tremor, muscle cramps, drying or irritation of the oropharynx, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and metabolic acidosis.

### Regular treatment with formoterol for chronic asthma: serious adverse events [^72907aae]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiological evidence has suggested a link between beta-agonists and increases in asthma mortality. There has been much debate about possible causal links for this association, and whether regular (daily) long-acting beta(2)-agonists are safe.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to assess the risk of fatal and non-fatal serious adverse events in trials that randomised patients with chronic asthma to regular formoterol versus placebo or regular short-acting beta(2)-agonists.

Search Strategy

Trials were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials. Web sites of clinical trial registers were checked for unpublished trial data and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submissions in relation to formoterol were also checked. The date of the most recent search was July 2008.

Selection Criteria

Controlled parallel design clinical trials on patients of any age and severity of asthma were included if they randomised patients to treatment with regular formoterol and were of at least 12 weeks duration. Concomitant use of inhaled corticosteroids was allowed, as long as this was not part of the randomised treatment regimen.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion in the review. Outcome data were extracted by one author and checked by the second author. Unpublished data on mortality and serious adverse events were sought.

Main Results

The review includes 22 studies (8,032 participants) comparing regular formoterol to placebo and salbutamol. Non-fatal serious adverse event data could be obtained for all participants from published studies comparing formoterol and placebo but only 80% of those comparing formoterol with salbutamol or terbutaline. Three deaths occurred on regular formoterol and none on placebo; this difference was not statistically significant. It was not possible to assess disease specific mortality in view of the small number of deaths. Non-fatal serious adverse events were significantly increased when regular formoterol was compared with placebo (Odds Ratio 1.57 [95% CI: 1.05 to 2.37]). One extra serious adverse event occurred over 16 weeks for every 179 people treated with regular formoterol [95% CI: 75 to 2022]. The increase was larger in children than in adults, but the impact of age was not statistically significant. Data submitted to the FDA indicates that the increase in asthma-related serious adverse events remained significant in patients taking regular formoterol who were also on inhaled corticosteroids. No significant increase in fatal or non-fatal serious adverse events was found when regular formoterol was compared with regular salbutamol or terbutaline.

Authors' Conclusions

In comparison with placebo, we have found an increased risk of serious adverse events with regular formoterol, and this does not appear to be abolished in patients taking inhaled corticosteroids. The effect on serious adverse events of regular formoterol in children was greater than the effect in adults, but the difference between age-groups was not significant. Data on all-cause serious adverse events should be more fully reported in journal articles, and not combined with all adverse events or limited to those events that are thought by the investigator to be drug-related.
