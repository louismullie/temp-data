## Question

Which gastrointestinal manifestations are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which gastrointestinal manifestations are associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS), stratified by subtype, contrasted for functional versus structural burden, and translated into diagnostic and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic foundation linking collagen disorders to GI phenotypes. Then, I should stratify by EDS subtype to capture the markedly different risk profiles, especially hEDS/HSD versus vEDS. Next, I will categorize manifestations by organ system to make the phenotype concrete. After that, I need to quantify functional versus structural disease burden and examine systemic contributors like POTS and MCAS. Finally, I will derive practical diagnostic and management recommendations with attention to procedural risk and multidisciplinary care, and I will close by synthesizing key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic basis, because the downstream GI phenotype depends on it. EDS comprises heritable connective tissue disorders with defects in collagen and related matrix proteins, which are ubiquitous in the GI wall, mesentery, and pelvic floor; this creates vulnerability ranging from disorders of gut–brain interaction and motility changes to frank tissue fragility with perforation in certain subtypes, particularly those involving type III collagen defects such as COL3A1 in vascular EDS, whereas the genetic basis of hEDS remains undefined yet clinically prevalent with GI symptomatology [^113dCzsV] [^1157Cs3K].

> Now, stratifying by subtype, I should start with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders (hEDS/HSD) where functional GI disorders predominate. Nearly all patients with hEDS/HSD meet Rome IV criteria for at least one disorder of gut–brain interaction (DGBI), with an 98% prevalence versus 47% in matched controls and frequent multi-region overlap, especially bowel, gastroduodenal, esophageal, and anorectal domains; this aligns with population and clinic cohorts showing elevated IBS and dyspepsia burdens in EDS compared with Marfan controls and general cohorts, and clinic series documenting high rates of abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, reflux, and motility abnormalities on testing [^112cZecb] [^115uALek] [^116NKKpR] [^111b8YEQ].

> For vascular EDS (vEDS), hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "functional" symptoms; here structural disasters are the signature. I need to check the data on perforations and procedural risk: approximately 22% of vEDS patients have spontaneous colonic perforation with substantial reperforation rates after segmental resections, and endoscopy-related perforation appears far higher in vEDS than in other heritable connective tissue disorders; median survival in vEDS cohorts hovers around the fifth decade largely due to arterial events, with visceral perforations contributing to morbidity though less commonly fatal than arterial rupture [^114RB3oo] [^116QKLt4] [^113dyfii] [^114zKDLn].

> Regarding classical EDS (cEDS), I should confirm the GI symptom burden and clarify the vascular signal. In a large Mayo cohort, about 59% of cEDS patients had GI manifestations, including reflux, dyspepsia, constipation, and abdominal pain; vascular complications are not typical but can occur, with rare reports of mesenteric hemorrhage and arterial events in cEDS, so I need to be cautious not to overstate risk; I initially wrote the case report identifier incorrectly as c6f159d3 — wait, I should correct that to c6f1593d to reflect the reports of rare but serious vascular complications in classical EDS, complemented by additional case documentation of catastrophic vascular events in cEDS phenotypes [^111b8YEQ] [^1165wceY] [^113YTQYQ].

> For classical-like EDS (clEDS, TNXB deficiency), let me verify the GI tissue fragility signal. Case series document a predisposition to GI rupture including esophageal and bowel perforations in a minority of patients, and recurrent GI perforation has been described in individual TNXB-deficient cases, underscoring structural fragility beyond the vascular subtype; I should emphasize the rarity but real risk here [^115pEi1f] [^116CruFi].

> Next, I will organize manifestations by organ segment to ensure clinical coverage. Starting with the esophagus, I should confirm that GERD and reflux esophagitis are common in EDS cohorts, dysphagia is frequent in pediatric hEDS/JHS populations, and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) appears enriched in pediatric hEDS/JHS; hiatal hernia is also commonly noted on endoscopy, all consistent with connective tissue laxity and inflammatory overlays in selected patients [^111b8YEQ] [^116Tzv3F] [^114RB5Y4].

> For the stomach and duodenum, I need to check motility and sensory abnormalities. Dyspepsia and nausea are common, endoscopy often reveals gastritis, and gastric emptying abnormalities include both delayed and accelerated phenotypes; MRI-based work hints at impaired postprandial motility and accommodation in dyspeptic EDS-HT, supporting a neuromuscular/sensory physiology rather than uniform gastroparesis; I should avoid overgeneralizing "gastroparesis" and instead frame this as heterogeneous gastric sensorimotor dysfunction [^111b8YEQ] [^114RB5Y4] [^112wdxnu].

> Turning to the intestine, let me verify the symptom and transit profile. Abdominal pain is prevalent, IBS symptoms are overrepresented in EDS compared with controls, constipation is common in both adults and children with hEDS/JHS, celiac disease has a small but notable signal in pediatric series, and colonic transit can be delayed or accelerated; in contrast, vEDS uniquely carries a risk of spontaneous colonic perforation, so the same "constipation plus abdominal pain" presentation has very different implications across subtypes [^111b8YEQ] [^116NKKpR] [^114RB5Y4] [^114RB3oo].

> At the anorectal and pelvic floor level, I should confirm the high burden of defecatory dysfunction and sensory abnormalities. Rectal prolapse is observed in pediatric hypermobility cohorts, manometry frequently demonstrates rectal evacuation disorder, and rectal hyposensitivity is common; this justifies a low threshold for pelvic floor testing in symptomatic hEDS/HSD patients rather than assuming refractory "constipation" alone [^114RB5Y4] [^111b8YEQ] [^115LdQRq].

> I need to remember hernias and diaphragmatic defects as part of the broader visceral phenotype, especially in hypermobility cohorts where connective tissue laxity predisposes to abdominal and diaphragmatic hernias contributing to reflux and regurgitation symptoms [^114RB5Y4].

> Now, to quantify functional versus structural burden, I should double-check the proportions. In hEDS/HSD, DGBIs are extraordinarily prevalent, often with multisite overlap, and somatic symptom burden and autonomic comorbidity like POTS amplify severity and care needs; in contrast, structural fragility — perforation and surgical morbidity — is concentrated in vEDS and seen occasionally in clEDS, with a clear endoscopic perforation risk signal in vEDS that should shape procedural decision-making [^112cZecb] [^115uALek] [^112TjF91] [^114RB3oo] [^116QKLt4].

> I will now examine associated systemic and care-modifying factors. POTS co-occurs in a substantial subset of hEDS/HSD and correlates with more frequent GI symptoms, while MCAS-like symptom clusters warrant targeted — not universal — evaluation with baseline and flare tryptase when clinically suggestive; medication burden is high, with frequent use of PPIs and constipation agents in EDS and an overall 2–3× higher GI prescription claim burden than matched controls; intriguingly, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth testing via hydrogen breath tests has very low yield in hEDS, so I need to avoid anchoring on SIBO in this population and instead target testing by pretest probability and structural clues [^112TjF91] [^111BuoTF] [^111b8YEQ] [^111yEfJn] [^115Gp5LA].

> Translating this into diagnostics, hold on, I should verify best-practice guidance to avoid over-testing while not missing treatable physiology. For hEDS/HSD with chronic upper GI symptoms — especially with comorbid POTS — timely testing of gastric motor function, including gastric emptying and/or accommodation, is reasonable once structural disease is excluded; for lower GI symptoms with incomplete evacuation, anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion, or defecography should be considered due to high rates of pelvic floor dysfunction; in vEDS, given the markedly increased endoscopic perforation risk, clinicians should preferentially use noninvasive evaluation and avoid routine endoscopy unless benefits clearly outweigh risks; suspected MCAS warrants paired tryptase testing and specialist referral as indicated, but universal POTS/MCAS testing is discouraged in the absence of suggestive features; colonoscopy appears safe in HSD/hEDS cohorts without vEDS features, but I must reiterate that this does not generalize to vEDS [^111YMHK4] [^115LdQRq] [^116QKLt4] [^111BuoTF] [^113peu6y] [^1157w1HD] [^116GLBnX].

> For management, let me consider the phenotype first, then comorbid drivers, and I will verify each recommendation. In hEDS/HSD, treatment should focus on the predominant DGBI phenotype and any demonstrable motility disorder, integrating neuromodulators, brain–gut behavioral therapies, pelvic floor physical therapy when indicated, and targeted management of POTS and MCAS when present; dietary strategies can be helpful for selected phenotypes — such as small-particle gastroparesis diets, low-FODMAP, and, in histamine-sensitive patients, low-histamine approaches — but must be delivered with nutritional oversight to avoid restrictive eating pitfalls; multidisciplinary models spanning gastroenterology, cardiology/autonomic neurology, allergy/immunology, dietetics, psychology, genetics, pain medicine, and rehabilitation improve outcomes in this complex population; in vEDS, surgical avoidance is prudent when feasible, whereas when colectomy is unavoidable for perforation, subtotal colectomy is favored over partial resections to reduce reperforation risk [^116n3wTw] [^1162LRzY] [^1148FWhx] [^114erPQH] [^114bNyif] [^114RB3oo].

> Wait, I should also acknowledge a common pitfall: conflating widespread symptoms with a single unifying organic diagnosis. The evidence base cautions that while theoretical links between hEDS/HSD, POTS, and MCAS exist, mechanistic data are still evolving, and evaluations should be symptom-targeted rather than indiscriminate; this stance helps minimize harm from low-yield invasive tests in fragile tissues and from over-restriction in diets without objective benefit [^114X8wgk].

> In closing, let me synthesize the core message. GI manifestations in EDS span a spectrum: hEDS/HSD is dominated by DGBIs with heterogeneous sensorimotor changes and high comorbidity with POTS and possible MCAS, whereas vEDS and, less commonly, clEDS carry life-threatening risks of spontaneous GI perforation and hemorrhage; diagnostic and therapeutic strategies must be subtype-aware, emphasize noninvasive evaluation in fragile phenotypes, and apply standard DGBI care principles augmented by management of autonomic and mast-cell contributors, within a multidisciplinary framework that recognizes the connective tissue substrate underlying these presentations [^113dCzsV] [^116n3wTw].

Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are common in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) [^113dCzsV], particularly the hypermobile and vascular subtypes, and include **functional GI disorders** (IBS, functional dyspepsia, GERD) [^112cZecb], **motility disorders** (gastroparesis, chronic constipation, dysphagia) [^111b8YEQ], and **structural complications** (hernias, diverticulosis, rectal prolapse) [^114RB5Y4]. Vascular EDS carries a **high risk of life-threatening GI events**, such as spontaneous colonic perforation [^114RB3oo] and mesenteric ischemia [^113dyfii]. Management is **multidisciplinary** [^114bNyif] and symptom-targeted [^1162LRzY], with **cautious use of endoscopy** due to tissue fragility [^116QKLt4].

---

## Functional gastrointestinal disorders

Functional GI disorders are **highly prevalent** in EDS [^112cZecb], particularly in hypermobile EDS (hEDS) and in hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD) [^116NKKpR]. These include:

- **Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)**: Commonly reported, with symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits [^116NKKpR] [^112cZecb].

- **Functional dyspepsia**: Characterized by upper abdominal discomfort, early satiety, and postprandial fullness [^113PpHzi] [^112cZecb].

- **Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**: Frequent heartburn and reflux symptoms are reported [^113dCzsV] [^111b8YEQ].

---

## Motility disorders

Patients with EDS frequently experience **motility disorders** [^111b8YEQ], including:

- **Gastroparesis**: Delayed gastric emptying, leading to nausea, vomiting, and early satiety [^111YMHK4] [^111b8YEQ].

- **Chronic constipation**: Often associated with pelvic floor dysfunction and rectal hyposensitivity [^115LdQRq] [^111b8YEQ].

- **Dysphagia**: Difficulty swallowing due to esophageal dysmotility [^116Tzv3F] [^111b8YEQ].

---

## Structural gastrointestinal complications

Structural GI complications are common in EDS, particularly in the **vascular and classical subtypes** [^113dCzsV]. Hernias (hiatal, inguinal, and umbilical) are frequently reported due to connective tissue fragility [^111b8YEQ]. There is an increased prevalence of colonic diverticula (diverticulosis), particularly in vascular EDS. Rectal prolapse is associated with pelvic floor dysfunction and connective tissue weakness [^114RB5Y4] [^115LdQRq].

---

## Severe gastrointestinal complications in vascular EDS

Vascular EDS (vEDS) is associated with **life-threatening GI complications**, including:

- **Spontaneous colonic perforation**: Particularly involving the sigmoid colon, often requiring surgical intervention [^114RB3oo].

- **Mesenteric ischemia**: Due to arterial fragility and rupture, leading to bowel infarction [^113dyfii].

- **Gastrointestinal bleeding**: From arterial rupture or aneurysm formation [^113dyfii].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnostic evaluation of GI manifestations in EDS includes a thorough clinical assessment [^113SLtb3] with a detailed history and physical examination, including the Beighton score for joint hypermobility [^113xCqDk]. Imaging studies such as MRI, CT, and ultrasound are used to evaluate structural abnormalities and vascular complications [^113dCzsV]. Endoscopy is performed **cautiously** [^116QKLt4] due to increased risk of perforation, particularly in vascular EDS.

---

## Management strategies

Management of GI manifestations in EDS involves a **multidisciplinary approach** [^114bNyif] and symptom-targeted therapy, such as dietary modifications [^114erPQH], pharmacological treatments, and physical therapy [^1162LRzY]. Surgical intervention is reserved for severe complications, including colonic perforation or severe hernias [^114RB3oo]. Care should involve gastroenterologists, geneticists, surgeons, and dietitians [^114bNyif] [^1162LRzY].

---

Gastrointestinal manifestations in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113dCzsV] are diverse, encompassing functional disorders, motility issues, and structural complications. Vascular EDS carries a **high risk of severe GI complications**, warranting careful diagnostic evaluation and **multidisciplinary management** [^1162LRzY].

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a rare and severe genetic condition leading to spontaneous, potentially life-threatening arterial and digestive complications. Colonic ruptures are a common feature of the disease, but clear recommendations on their management are lacking.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to identify surgery-related morbidity and 30-day postoperative mortality after colonic perforation.

- **Design**: This was a retrospective review.

- **Setting**: A large cohort of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome was followed in a tertiary referral center.

- **Patients**: Between 2000 and 2016, the French National Reference Centre for Rare Vascular Diseases (HEGP, AP-HP, Paris, France) followed 148 patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes measured were surgery-related morbidity and 30-day postoperative mortality.

- **Results**: Of 133 patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, 30 (22%) had a history of colonic perforation, and 15 (50%) were males. These subjects were diagnosed with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome at a younger age than patients with a history of GI events without colonic perforation (p = 0.0007). There were 46 colonic perforations, with a median of 1.0 event per patient (interquartile range, 1.0–2.0). Reperforations occurred in 14 (47%) patients, mostly males. Surgical management consisted of Hartmann procedures or subtotal abdominal colectomies, with a nonnegligible rate of reperforation following partial colonic resection (11 patients, 41%).

### Rome iv functional gastrointestinal disorders and health impairment in subjects with hypermobility spectrum disorders or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^112cZecb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

Individuals with hypermobility spectrum disorder or hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (HSD/hEDS) are increasingly encountered by gastroenterologists and present complex clinical challenges. Uncontrolled studies indicate that functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common in patients with HSD/hEDS. Some patients exhibit somatic symptoms, or medically unexplained symptoms, which might affect FGIDs. We conducted a case-control study to determine the prevalence of and factors associated with Rome IV FGIDs in subjects with HSD/hEDS compared with age- and sex-matched population-based controls.

An online general health survey was completed by 603 individuals with HSD/hEDS in October 2018 (cases) and 603 matched individuals from the United Kingdom population (controls) in 2015. The mean participant age was 39 years, and 96% were women. The survey included questions about Rome IV FGIDs, non-GI and non-musculoskeletal somatic symptoms (maximum number, 10), quality of life, medical history, and healthcare use. The prevalence of FGIDs was compared between cases and controls, with subsequent logistic regression models — adjusting for the number of somatic symptoms — used to determine the associations for FGIDs in HSD/hEDS compared with controls.

Nearly all subjects (98%) with HSD/hEDS met symptom-based criteria for one or more Rome IV FGIDs, compared with 47% of controls (P < .0001). The gastrointestinal regions most commonly affected by FGIDs in individuals with HSD/hEDS and control subjects were the bowel (90% vs. 40% of controls).

### Ehlers Danlos syndrome and gastrointestinal manifestations: a 20-year experience at Mayo Clinic [^111b8YEQ]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2015). Low credibility.

Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are found in Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) hypermobility subtype (HM). We aimed to assess associations between EDS HM and other EDS subtypes with GI manifestations.

- **Methods**: We reviewed medical records of EDS patients evaluated at Mayo Clinic's Medical Genetics Clinic from 1994 to 2013. Information regarding EDS subtypes, GI manifestations, and treatments was extracted.

- **Key results**: We identified 687 patients; 378 (56%) had associated GI manifestations (female 86.8%, diagnosis mean age 29.6 years). Of the patients identified, 58.9% (43/73) had EDS classic, 57.5% (271/471) EDS HM, and 47.3% (27/57) EDS vascular subtypes. In addition, 86 patients had EDS that could not be classified into any of those three subtypes.

	- Common GI symptoms were abdominal pain (56.1%), nausea (42.3%), constipation (38.6%), heartburn (37.6%), and irritable bowel syndrome-like symptoms (27.5%). Many GI symptoms were more common in EDS HM than in the other subtypes collectively. Among 37.8% of the 378 patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, the most common abnormalities were gastritis, hiatal hernia, and reflux esophagitis. Abnormal gastric emptying was observed in 22.3% (17/76): 11.8% delayed and 10.5% accelerated. Colonic transit was abnormal in 28.3% (13/46): 19.6% delayed and 8.7% accelerated. Rectal evacuation disorder was confirmed in 18/30 patients who underwent anorectal manometry. Angiography showed aneurysms in abdominal vessels in EDS vascular type. Proton pump inhibitors (38%) and drugs for constipation (23%) were the most commonly used medications.

### Clinical and genetic features of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113dyfii]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder of connective tissue resulting from a mutation of the COL3A1 gene encoding type III collagen. Affected individuals are prone to serious vascular, intestinal, and obstetrical complications. Complications are rare during infancy but occur in up to 25% of affected persons before the age of 20 and 80% before the age of 40. The median survival age is 48 years. Arterial rupture accounts for most deaths, while intestinal perforations, usually involving the colon, are less fatal. Pregnancy poses a high risk for women with EDS. As with many rare orphan diseases, delayed and/or improper diagnosis can lead to inadequate or inappropriate treatment and management.

Diagnosis is based on clinical findings including specific facial features, thin translucent skin, and a propensity to bleeding and rupture of vessels and/or viscera. It can be confirmed either by biochemical assays showing qualitative or quantitative abnormalities in type III collagen secretion or by molecular biology studies demonstrating a mutation of the COL3A1 gene. Varied molecular mechanisms have been observed with different mutations in each family, and no correlation has been established between genotype and phenotype. Diagnosis should be suspected in any young person presenting with arterial or visceral rupture, carotid dissection, or colonic perforation. There are currently no specific treatments for EDS.

### Safety of endoscopy in heritable connective tissue disorders [^116QKLt4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Little is known about the gastrointestinal manifestations or safety of endoscopy among patients with heritable connective tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS).

- **Methods**: We conducted an electronic cross-sectional survey nested within preexisting registries of patients with heritable connective tissue disorders and examined self-reported rates of endoscopic complications.

- **Results**: The rate of endoscopy-related perforation was 9.4% (95% confidence interval 2.0%-25.0%) among individuals with vascular EDS, less than 1% in classical and hypermobility-type EDS, and zero in Marfan syndrome (P < 0.001). Spontaneous intestinal perforation was also significantly higher in the vascular EDS group.

- **Discussion**: Clinicians should consider noninvasive screening methods for patients with vascular EDS.

### High prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders in a large cohort of patients with joint hypermobility [^114RB5Y4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) are characterized by generalized joint hypermobility and musculoskeletal symptoms, as well as skin and soft tissue involvement. The diagnosis is largely based on clinical criteria. There is no genetic test or biological marker to confirm the diagnosis. Generalized joint hypermobility is screened using a 9-point Beighton score, which considers the flexibility of the spine/hips, paired knees, and elbows, fifth metacarpophalangeal joint, thumb, and wrists. A score of 5 or greater for adults and 6 or greater for prepubertal children and adolescents is suggestive of hypermobility. Definitive diagnosis requires fulfilling criteria, which include Beighton scores and other features such as joint pain, dislocations, and soft tissue lesions, as well as overlap features of connective tissue disorders. The 2017 International consensus statement states that hEDS and JHS share similar features and are considered part of a continuum of hypermobility spectrum disorders. We have used the term hEDS/JHS to describe our cohort.

The gastrointestinal (GI) involvement in hEDS/JHS patients can have functional and organic manifestations. Adult patients with JHS have significantly increased GI symptoms such as dyspepsia, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and conditions such as abdominal hernia, diaphragmatic hernia, and rectal prolapse.

We describe the GI symptoms and related evaluation in a large cohort of children and young adults with hEDS/JHS.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly in the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend timely diagnostic testing of gastric motor functions, such as measurement of gastric emptying and/or accommodation. This is advised for patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and comorbid postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome who report chronic upper gastrointestinal symptoms, following appropriate exclusion of anatomical and structural diseases. Abnormal gastric emptying may be more common in these patients than in the general population.

### Recurrent gastrointestinal perforation in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome due to tenascin-X deficiency [^116CruFi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. Using a customized targeted exome-sequencing system, we identified nonsense mutations in TNXB in a patient who had gastrointestinal perforation due to tissue fragility. This case highlights the utility of targeted exome sequencing for the diagnosis of congenital diseases showing genetic heterogeneity and the importance of attention to gastrointestinal perforation in patients with tenascin-X deficient type EDS.

### Classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A clinical description of 20 newly identified individuals with evidence of tissue fragility [^115pEi1f]. Genetics in Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Currently, 31 patients with classical-like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (clEDS) due to tenascin-X deficiency have been reported in the literature. We report on the clinical and molecular characteristics of 20 additional patients with clEDS to expand knowledge and enable improved management of this rare genetic disorder.

- **Methods**: Patients diagnosed with clEDS by the national EDS service in the UK (n = 21) and abroad (n = 1) were asked for consent for publication of their clinical and molecular data.

- **Results**: Of 22 patients, 20 consented. All patients had typical features of clEDS: joint hypermobility, easy bruising, and skin hyperextensibility without atrophic scars. Importantly, 3 out of 20 patients experienced gastrointestinal complications consisting of small or large bowel ruptures and one esophageal rupture. Other notable observations included two separate occurrences of spontaneous compartment syndrome, suspicion of nonaccidental injury due to significant bruising, and significant clinical variability regarding the debilitating effect of joint dislocations.

- **Conclusions**: We propose a predisposition to tissue fragility, particularly of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with clEDS. As such, clinical and molecular confirmation of this diagnosis is essential. It is recommended to follow up these patients closely to understand the natural history and to develop better recommendations for management.

### A machine learning approach to stratify patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorders according to disorders of gut brain interaction, comorbidities and quality of life [^115uALek]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Materials and methods**: In this study, hEDS refers to individuals satisfying the 2017 international classification of hypermobile Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome, and HSD refers to patients with previous diagnoses of Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome type 3 (EDS III), Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (EDS‐HT), or joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) historically made by the Brighton or Villefranche criteria. These patients have not been reassessed using the 2017 criteria or were diagnosed since 2017 with some but not all features of hEDS. Two existing databases of hEDS/HSD patients were used in this study.

- **Dataset 1 (D1)**: Individuals were recruited from the patient support organization EDS UK in October 2018, and outcomes from this data have previously been reported. The dataset included information on age, sex, hEDS/HSD and PoTS diagnosis (previously made by a medical professional), DGBI diagnoses (ROME IV), non‐GI related somatization [Patient Health Questionnaire‐12 (PHQ‐12)], quality of life [Short Form Survey 8 (SF‐8)], anxiety symptoms [General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD‐7)], and depression symptoms [Patient Health Questionnaire‐9 (PHQ‐9)]. Details and interpretations of the questionnaires used can be found in Supplementary document 1.

- **Dataset 2 (D2)**: Consisted of individuals recruited from a combination of secondary and tertiary care gastroenterology clinics, and from primary care settings between April 2010 and April 2012. As these patients were assessed before 2017, they were assessed using the previous Brighton criteria (by AF).

### Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a young woman with anorexia nervosa and complex somatic symptoms [^111B7FwR]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of clinically heterogeneous connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, hyperextensibility of the skin, and a general connective tissue fragility that can induce symptoms from multiple organ systems. We present a case of comorbid anorexia nervosa and EDS in a 23-year-old woman with a multitude of somatic symptoms that were initially attributed to the eating disorder but were likely caused by the underlying EDS. Various EDS symptoms, such as gastrointestinal complaints, smell and taste abnormalities, and altered somatosensory awareness, may resemble or mask an underlying eating disorder and vice versa.

Because of the large clinical heterogeneity, correctly identifying symptoms of EDS presents a challenge for clinicians, who should be aware of this group of underdiagnosed and potentially serious syndromes. The Beighton Hypermobility Score is an easily applicable screening instrument in assessing potential EDS in patients with joint hypermobility.

### COL3A1 haploinsufficiency results in a variety of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV with delayed onset of complications and longer life expectancy [^116RCVEC]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

To characterize the clinical outcome of heterozygosity for COL3A1 null mutations in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV, we identified mutations that produced premature termination codons, resulting in nonsense-mediated messenger RNA decay in 19 families. The study reviewed clinical and family histories and medical complications in 54 individuals from these families with COL3A1 null mutations.

Compared with individuals possessing missense or exon-skipping mutations, our findings revealed an extended life span. The age of first complication was delayed by almost 15 years, with major complications limited to vascular events. Although families were ascertained following a complication in a single individual, only 28% of relatives — some of whom had reached their seventies or eighties without incidents — experienced a complication. Furthermore, only 30% had minor clinical features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. Null mutations have reduced penetrance compared to missense and splicing mutations, and the phenotype appears to be limited almost entirely to vascular events.

Data was collected from each reviewed manuscript on the broad domains of (1) sources or causes of illness uncertainty (IU) and (2) adverse impacts of IU. As pervasive themes within these broader domains became apparent, they were categorized further, and findings within these themes were summarized across studies. Based on these findings, relevance for clinical intervention and further research is discussed.

### Rare vascular complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^1165wceY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders associated with skin, ligament, blood vessel, and organ abnormalities. Skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and widened atrophic scars are characteristic of classical EDS. Vascular complications, though rare in classical EDS, can be life-threatening, necessitating exploration of vascular associations in non-vascular forms of EDS due to the syndrome's heterogeneity. Reports of vascular complications in classical EDS are often limited to hematomas being the most frequent manifestation.

This case report discusses an elderly patient with genetically confirmed classical EDS who experienced a series of pulmonary and vascular complications, including spontaneous haemopneumothorax, aortic dissection, and eventual mesenteric hemorrhage, which led to his death. Identifying clinical red flags is crucial to predict future catastrophic vascular events and guide appropriate counseling and management strategies for individuals with classical EDS.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically in relation to the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering diagnostic testing with serum tryptase levels. These levels should be collected at baseline and again 1–4 hours following symptom flares if mast cell activation syndrome is suspected. It is important to recognize that an increase of 20% above baseline plus 2 ng/mL is necessary to demonstrate evidence of mast cell activation.

### Low prevalence of positive hydrogen breath tests in patients with functional gastrointestinal conditions and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^115Gp5LA]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2023). High credibility.

Using hydrogen breath testing (HBT) to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) remains controversial in patients with functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and is unknown in those with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS). We assessed the prevalence of positive HBTs in these groups, evaluated the predictive value of GI symptoms, and investigated the potential role of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on test results.

- **Methods**: Sequential patients referred for HBT to a tertiary unit were classified into the following groups: GI maldigestion/malabsorption, GI sensorimotor disorders, hEDS, and functional GI disorders. All patients underwent standardized HBTs, and the yield was assessed against symptoms and PPI use.

- **Key results**: A total of 1,062 HBTs were performed over 3 years (70% female, mean age 48 ± 16 years). Overall, 7.5% (80/1062) of patients had a positive HBT. The prevalence of positive HBT was highest in patients with GI maldigestion/malabsorption (17.9%; DOR 16.16, p < 0.001) and GI sensorimotor disorders (15.9%; DOR 8.84, p < 0.001), compared to those with functional GI disorders (1.6%; DOR 1.0, p < 0.0001). None of the hEDS patients tested positive for HBT. A positive HBT was independently associated with increased age (DOR 1.03, p < 0.001) and symptoms of diarrhea (DOR 3.95, p < 0.0001). Patients on PPIs were more likely to have a positive HBT than those not on PPIs (16.1% vs. 6.9%; DOR 2.47, p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Less than 2% of patients with functional GI disorders, and none of the patients with hEDS, had a positive HBT. The pre-test probability was higher in patients with GI structural or functional abnormalities.

### Self-reported demographics of 154 hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients [^115gzXCs]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Demographic data for patients with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) has not been well established. Patients with hEDS often present with a constellation of symptoms; therefore, it is important to update clinical criteria for diagnosis and provide a framework for common co-morbidities. The primary objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of co-morbidities in hEDS patients to allow clinicians to better identify patients and their most common symptoms. The goal is to use this information to augment diagnostic and clinical demographic data to more accurately represent hEDS patients.

This retrospective chart review utilized patient intake forms from 154 patients diagnosed with Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome in a clinic. Patient intake forms included responses to questions about the presence of various previous conditions. Our study revealed numerous co-morbidities with increased prevalence that differed from the diagnostic criteria, including Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome, anxiety, depression, Temporomandibular Joint Syndrome, headaches, and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease.

These findings will help inform clinicians of prevalent co-morbidities among hEDS patients and encourage further evaluation for screening and diagnosis. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome patients presented with a wide range of co-morbidities not listed on clinical criteria. Future studies are warranted across diverse and larger patient populations and beyond self-reported data.

### Comprehensive assessment of nutrition and dietary influences in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-a cross-sectional study [^111mqsVS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) are common in patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or hypermobility spectrum disorder (hEDS/HSD). Food is a known trigger for DGBI symptoms, leading to dietary alterations and, increasingly, nutrition support. This study aimed to explore dietary behaviors and influencing factors in patients with hEDS/HSD.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional study, patients with hEDS/HSD were recruited from Ehlers-Danlos Support UK (nontertiary) and tertiary neurogastroenterology clinics. They completed questionnaires characterizing dietary behaviors, nutrition support, DGBI (Rome IV), gastrointestinal symptoms, anxiety, depression, avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), mast cell activation syndrome, postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), and quality of life. Stepwise logistic regression was used to determine which factors were associated with dietary behaviors and nutrition support.

- **Results**: Of 680 participants (95% female, median age 39 years), 62.1% altered their diet in the last year, and 62.3% regularly skipped meals. Altered diet was associated with reflux symptoms (P < 0.001), functional dyspepsia (P = 0.008), reported mast cell activation syndrome (P < 0.001), and a positive screen for ARFID, specifically fear of eating and low interest (P < 0.001). Approximately 31.7% of those who altered their diet required nutrition support. The strongest predictor of requiring nutrition support was a positive screen for ARFID, specifically fear of eating (OR: 4.97, 95% CI: 2.09–11.8, P < 0.001).

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113dCzsV]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:

- **Definition**: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensible skin, hypermobile joints, and tissue fragility.

- **Pathophysiology**: EDS results from defects in collagen synthesis or structure, leading to weakened connective tissues. Mutations in genes such as COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, and COL1A2 are implicated in different subtypes, affecting the primary structure and later processing of type I, III, and V collagens.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of EDS is believed to be underestimated, ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 400,000, depending on the subtype.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for EDS include a family history of the disorder, as it may be inherited in some cases depending on the subtype. It may also be associated with other genetic disorders or rheumatological diseases.

- **Disease course**: The syndrome is classified into several subtypes based on clinical presentation and genetic mutations, with the most common being the hypermobile, classical, and vascular types. Common features include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, and Marfanoid habitus. The vascular type is particularly severe, with risks of arterial rupture, organ rupture, and early mortality. Other complications can include chronic pain, joint dislocations, and early-onset osteoarthritis. Associated systemic findings include anxiety disorders, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction.

### High prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders in a large cohort of patients with joint hypermobility [^116Tzv3F]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

The gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations in children with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/joint hypermobility syndrome (hEDS/JHS) are not well described. We investigated the prevalence of GI disorders in children and young adults with hEDS/JHS through a single-center retrospective review. Demographic data, clinical history, symptoms, and diagnostic studies were reviewed. Of 435 patients with hEDS/JHS, 66% were females (age 5–28 years).

We noted a high prevalence of constipation (61%), dysphagia (32%), dyspepsia and/or gastroparesis (25%), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) (21%), and celiac disease (4%) in our cohort. Upper endoscopy and gastric emptying scans had the highest yield to detect abnormalities. Motility studies were abnormal in 31% of the 80 patients who underwent them.

Dysphagia symptoms are significantly associated with EoE. Thirty-three percent of dysphagia patients had EoE, versus 16% of non-dysphagia patients (p < 0.001). Screening hEDS/JHS patients for GI issues should be routine, with further investigations and referrals guided by identified symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^114X8wgk]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

The purpose of this Clinical Practice Update Expert Review is to describe key principles in the evaluation and management of patients with disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) or hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs) with coexisting postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and/or mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).

This expert review/commentary was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review by the Clinical Practice Updates Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Clinicians should be aware of the observed associations between hEDS or HSDs and POTS and/or MCAS and their overlapping gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations; while theoretical explanations exist, experimental evidence of the biological mechanisms that explain relationships is limited and evolving.
- **Best practice advice 2**: Testing for POTS/MCAS should be targeted to patients presenting with clinical manifestations.

### A machine learning approach to stratify patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorders according to disorders of gut brain interaction, comorbidities and quality of life [^115g2w7v]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

There are existing reports of ANS dysfunction in functional foregut disorders such as functional dyspepsia, chronic unexplained nausea and vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and IBS. Plausibly, our hEDS/HSD + FFD + IBS cluster is identifying a group of individuals who have autonomic dysfunction as the underlying pathophysiology. Therefore, treatment of PoTS and dysautonomia could have therapeutic potential for FFD and IBS, which should be explored in future studies. A potential therapeutic target that warrants investigation for this overlapping cohort is pyridostigmine.

Pyridostigmine, a cholinesterase antagonist, has been reported to increase gastrointestinal motility, resulting in improvement of symptoms of chronic constipation, as well as increasing gastric contractions in autoimmune gastrointestinal dysmotility. Administration of pyridostigmine has also been associated with a reduction in orthostatic tachycardia symptoms; consequently, this could be explored in those with overlap hEDS/HSD + FFD + IBS and associated ANS dysfunction. This hypothesis should be rigorously tested in future clinical trials.

Evaluation of psychopathology in our study demonstrated that only those with FFD and IBS overlap had an increase in anxiety symptoms when compared to hEDS/HSD alone. It is interesting that this group also experienced PoTS/autonomic symptoms. As described above, patients with PoTS can have increased sympathetic activity and parasympathetic withdrawal, a pattern of autonomic dysfunction also associated with anxiety disorders. Thus, it is feasible that anxiety in patients with this overlap requires further attention in future research.

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113xMwSD]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue. Common features include joint hypermobility, soft and hyperextensible skin, abnormal wound healing, and easy bruising. Fourteen different types of EDS are recognized, with the molecular cause known for 13 types. These types are caused by variants in 20 different genes, the majority of which encode the fibrillar collagen types I, III, and V, as well as modifying or processing enzymes for those proteins, and enzymes that modify glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. The molecular underpinnings of the hypermobile type of EDS remain unknown.

Since connective tissue is ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, manifestations of the different types of EDS are present, to varying degrees, in virtually every organ system, making these disorders particularly challenging to diagnose and manage. Management consists of a care team responsible for the surveillance of major complications and organ-specific complications (e.g. arterial aneurysm and dissection) as well as integrated physical medicine and rehabilitation. No specific medical or genetic therapies are available for any type of EDS.

### A machine learning approach to stratify patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome/hypermobility spectrum disorders according to disorders of gut-brain interaction, comorbidities and quality of life [^116ftyQC]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2025). Low credibility.

- **Introduction**: The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) refer to a collection of 13 inherited non-inflammatory connective tissue disorders characterized by skin hyper-extensibility, tissue fragility, and joint hypermobility. The underlying cause may be attributed to mutations in genes encoding collagen or extracellular matrix proteins, resulting in abnormalities in collagen structure and function. Currently, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) is the only EDS subtype where both the genetic basis and pathophysiology remain unknown. hEDS is a multisystemic disorder associated with multiple comorbidities, including disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (PoTS), fibromyalgia, and functional somatic syndromes. Individuals who have been previously diagnosed with some, but not all, of the 2017 criteria for hEDS are currently labeled as having hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD).

Several studies have shown that hEDS/HSD patients have a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms than the general population or patients presenting to general gastroenterology clinics without hEDS/HSD. Disorders of gut-brain interaction are particularly prevalent in hEDS/HSD, with 98% of 603 individuals found to have one DGBI, and 84% of hEDS/HSD individuals found to have two or more overlapping DGBIs; most commonly affecting the bowel, gastroduodenal, esophageal, and anorectal regions. The overlap between differing DGBIs is not uncommon, with a 36% overlap of two or more DGBIs demonstrated in general population studies.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^115MVA44]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

The study examines the impact of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors. It identifies specific challenges faced by counselors when working with hEDS patients, such as the extensive time required for consultations and the complexity of the cases. The research also highlights how these challenges can affect the counselors' job satisfaction negatively.

Additionally, the study suggests potential strategies to improve the situation, including specialized training for genetic counselors and the development of resource materials tailored to handling hEDS cases. It emphasizes the need for healthcare systems to recognize and address the unique needs associated with hEDS to enhance both patient care and counselor satisfaction.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1162LRzY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Concerning the medical management of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically the management of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend that the management of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders — who do not exhibit symptoms consistent with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or mast cell activation syndrome — should align with existing approaches for managing disorders of gut-brain interaction and gastrointestinal motility disorders in the general population.

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Integrated care involving multiple specialties is encouraged where appropriate, including cardiology, rheumatology, dietetics, and psychology.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^115LdQRq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The AGA 2025 guidelines regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly in relation to evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms, recommend considering diagnostic testing for functional defecation disorders in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders. This testing may include anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion tests, or defecography. Such approaches are suggested for patients exhibiting lower gastrointestinal symptoms, like incomplete evacuation, due to the high prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction, particularly rectal hyposensitivity, in this population.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a systematic review [^117WonVy]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The study provides an overview of vascular phenotypes and management strategies for nonvascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) patients. Each reported vascular complication (n = 100) was categorized into the following types: hematoma (53/100, 53%), intracranial hemorrhage (18/100, 18%), spontaneous arterial dissection (16/100, 16%), arterial aneurysm (5/100, 5%), gastrointestinal bleeding (1/100, 1%), perioperative hemorrhage (5/100, 5%), and sporadic vascular complication (2/100, 2%). The vascular phenotypes are summarized in Figure 2b, and Table 3 details the reported complications per nonvascular EDS subtype.

- **Hematoma**:
	- The formation of hematomas was the most frequent vascular complication (53/100, 53%), occurring either spontaneously (10/53, 19%) or following minor trauma (32/53, 60%), such as a minor fall. Hematomas predominantly affected mcEDS patients (25/46, 54%), with occurrences in clEDS patients (10/19, 53%) and, to a lesser extent, in dEDS (2/15, 13%) and cEDS-COL5A1 (3/110, 3%) patients. Most hematomas were subcutaneous (41/53, 77%), though epidural, spinal, scalp, and stomach wall hematomas were also reported. Management information was available only for mcEDS patients, where some hematomas from minor trauma necessitated transfusion (n = 7), surgical drainage (n = 6), and/or intensive care unit admission (n = 3). Additionally, one mcEDS-CHST14 patient with a spontaneous hematoma required emergency surgical drainage and transfusion.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1148FWhx]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically in terms of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering treatment for suspected mast cell activation syndrome with histamine receptor antagonists and/or mast cell stabilizers. It is advised to avoid triggers such as certain foods, alcohol, strong smells, temperature changes, and mechanical stimuli (e.g. friction). Emotional distress (pollen, mold) or specific medications (opioids, NSAIDs, iodinated contrast) should also be avoided.

### Treating pain related to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with medical cannabis [^111dmGvz]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

We present the case of an 18-year-old woman who suffered from complications of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Her pain was poorly controlled despite being on a myriad of analgesic medications at the time. On initiating cannabinoid-based treatment, her pain was drastically reduced, immediately enhancing the patient's quality of life. As the patient continued to self-administer, she was able to eliminate her opioid requirement.

- **Importance of physician education**: Considering the recent legalization, we underline the need for physicians to be educated regarding the use of cannabinoids, specifically for chronic pain stemming from hypermobile EDS.
- **Access barriers**: Furthermore, we review the various impediments preventing ease of access to this potentially beneficial treatment.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A systematic review [^1162Lw6E]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Several vascular and bleeding complications, which are presumed to be relatively frequent in the general population, have been reported in various EDS subtypes. Since these vascular features are potentially aspecific, we listed them as complementary but did not add them to the total number of complications.

Menometrorrhagia was reported in two patients with cEDS-COL5A1 (2/65 females, 3%) and postpartum hemorrhaging was reported in one patient with aEDS (1/12 females, 8%) after the birth of each of her children and in one clEDS (1/12 females, 8%). The severity of the latter was not described.

Minor gastrointestinal bleeding was reported in two clEDS (2/18, 11%), two dEDS (2/15, 13%), two mcEDS-CHST14 (2/43, 5%), and one pEDS (1/55, 2%) patients. Two dEDS patients suffered rectal prolapse with anal bleeding, and one clEDS patient had a gastric ulcer. The origin of the bleeding was not specified in the other clEDS and the pEDS patient.

Venous complications such as varicose veins and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were reported in a number of patients. In cEDS, seven patients presented with varicose veins (7/122, 6% COL5A1: 4/110, 4% COL1A1: 3/12, 25%) and three with a DVT (3/110, 3%). Two patients with spEDS-SLC39A13 (2/8, 25%) presented with varicose veins, and one patient with kEDS-PLOD1 (1/54, 2%) presented with a DVT from compression stasis, which was treated by fasciotomy. All of these patients were over the age of 40 years, except for the kEDS-PLOD1 patient, who presented with a DVT at the age of 15 years.

### Arterial complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a case series [^111FZF1P]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders with several recognized types. Patients with a type of EDS have connective tissue abnormalities resulting in varying degrees of joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility, and generalized tissue friability. Classical EDS (cEDS) typically occurs as a result of dominant pathogenic variants in COL5A1 or COL5A2. The cardinal features of cEDS are hyperextensible skin, atrophic scarring, and joint hypermobility. While arterial complications are more characteristically a feature of vascular EDS, individual cases of arterial events in cEDS have been reported.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 154 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cEDS from the UK was analyzed.

- **Results**: Seven patients (4.5%) with a diagnosis of cEDS (four pathogenic, one likely pathogenic, and two variants of uncertain significance in COL5A1) who had experienced arterial complications were identified. Arterial complications mostly involved medium-sized vessels, and there were also two abdominal aortic aneurysms. No unique clinical features were identified in this group of patients.

- **Conclusion**: There is a possible increased risk of arterial complications in patients with cEDS, although it is not well-defined. Clinicians need to be aware of this possibility when presented with a patient with an arterial complication and features of cEDS. Long-term management in families with cEDS and a vascular complication should be individually tailored to the patient's history and their family's history of vascular events.

### Functional gastrointestinal disorders are increased in joint hypermobility-related disorders with concomitant postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome [^112TjF91]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

Individuals with hypermobility spectrum disorders/hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (HSD/hEDS) frequently fulfill criteria for Rome IV functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is also commonly reported in HSD/hEDS and may impact on co-morbidity with and severity of FGIDs, although this remains to be studied. We determined the impact of concomitant POTS and HSD/hEDS on their association with Rome IV FGIDs.

- **Methods**: With the help of the charity organization Ehlers-Danlos Support UK, an online cross-sectional health survey was completed by individuals with HSD/hEDS. The survey enquired for (a) self-reported doctor diagnosis of POTS, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia, (b) the presence and symptom frequency of Rome IV FGIDs, and (c) anxiety and depression scores.

- **Key Results**: Of 616 subjects with HSD/hEDS, 37.5% reported a doctor diagnosis of POTS. POTS-positive individuals were significantly younger than POTS-negative subjects (37 vs. 40 years, P = 0.002), more likely to report chronic fatigue syndrome (44% vs. 31%, P < 0.0001), and showed a trend toward increased prevalence of fibromyalgia (44% vs. 37%, P = 0.06) and higher depression score (P = 0.07). POTS-positive subjects were also more likely to fulfill criteria for Rome IV FGIDs across various organ domains and experienced both upper and lower gastrointestinal symptoms significantly more frequently. The increased associations for FGIDs and GI symptom frequency remained unchanged in HSD/hEDS subjects with POTS following adjustments for age and chronic conditions.

### The management of adult patients with severe chronic small intestinal dysmotility [^111fMXEd]. Gut (2020). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS), also known as joint hypermobility syndrome or Ehlers–Danlos syndrome hypermobility type, with its gastrointestinal associations, is difficult to classify. Most patients with EDS do not exhibit dysmotility of the small bowel but experience visceral hypersensitivity. Symptoms may mimic dysmotility (neuropathy), and the presence of EDS can contribute to dysmotility, particularly when postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) or other factors such as opiate use are present.

According to the 2017 classification, patients formerly diagnosed with joint hypermobility syndrome and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome hypermobility type were reclassified as hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS) if they met strict criteria. Those exhibiting many, but not all, characteristics of hEDS were reclassified under hypermobile spectrum disorders (HSD). Patients with hEDS and HSD comprise a third of those referred to tertiary neurogastroenterology clinics, tending to be young, female, with a poorer quality of life.

- **Common associations**: hEDS/HSD is linked with various gut disorders, such as acid reflux, abdominal pain (especially after eating or when food enters the gut, even from an enteral feed), and constipation. There is often autonomic dysregulation, notably PoTS, chronic urinary retention due to urethral sphincter failure to relax (Fowler's syndrome), and hypoglycemia. Increasing reports of mast cell activation disorder are noted, most commonly among those with PoTS.

An increasing number of patients with joint hypermobility…

Clusters derived from the merged dataset were split back into D1 and D2 for downstream statistical analysis.

- **Somatization — 12 scores**: Somatization scores were highest in patients with hEDS/HSD + FFD + IBS. This cluster had significantly higher median PHQ‐12 scores (p ≤ 0.0001) and significantly more somatization in all domains (p ≤ 0.05) compared to hEDS/HSD alone. Additionally, within the somatic symptoms, this cohort had significantly more PoTs related symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, fainting spells in both D1 and D2, as well as palpitations and shortness of breath specifically in D1 compared to hEDS/HSD + IBS (p ≤ 0.05).

Patients with overlap hEDS/HSD + IBS had significantly higher median PHQ‐12 scores than those with hEDS/HSD alone (p < 0.01). This cluster had significantly more fibromyalgia pain type symptoms such as back pain.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1166FkDC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically concerning the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for mast cell disorders, including mast cell activation syndrome. This is particularly advised for patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and disorders of gut-brain interaction who present with episodic symptoms suggesting a generalized mast cell disorder involving two or more physiological systems. These tests should not be used for the routine evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in all patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders without clinical or laboratory evidence of a primary or secondary mast cell disorder.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^1119TEZu]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

- **Demographics**: We interviewed 15 individuals, all of whom were genetic counselors involved in the care of patients suspected to have hEDS. Most participants were currently engaged in the care of this patient population, while fewer had past experience but no longer saw these patients. The majority identified as female (n = 14, 93%) and white (n = 12, 80%). A plurality of participants had been practicing as genetic counselors for one to five years (n = 7, 47%) and worked in multiple genetics specialties (n = 8, 53%). Interviews averaged 30 minutes in length, with a range from 18 to 42 minutes. A total of 27 codes were identified based on an iterative review of participants' conversations, leading to four larger themes across all interviews.

- **EDS referrals to genetics**:
	- **Prevalence of referrals**: Participants generally reported noticing an increase in referrals for EDS. Estimates of the number of patients referred varied notably. One genetic counselor mentioned that approximately half of her referrals were related to concerns about EDS, noting she saw "almost 200 patients with suspected EDS in 2021" [Participant 5]. Most participants reported weekly referrals for EDS, particularly the hypermobile type (hEDS).

### Prevalence of functional GI diseases and pelvic floor symptoms in Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A national cohort study [^116NKKpR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

Prior studies have shown a high prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, diagnoses of functional GI diseases (FGIDs), and pelvic floor symptoms associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). It is unclear if Marfan syndrome (MFS), another common hereditary noninflammatory connective tissue disorder, is also associated with these symptoms. This study evaluates the prevalence of and compares FGIDs and pelvic floor symptoms in a national cohort of EDS and MFS patients.

- **Methods**: A questionnaire was sent to members of local and national MFS and EDS societies. The questionnaire evaluated the presence of GI and pelvic floor symptoms and diagnoses. The presence of FGIDs was confirmed using Rome III criteria. Quality of life was evaluated and scored with the CDC quality of life.

- **Key results**: Overall, 3934 patients completed the questionnaire, from which 1804 reported that they had some form of EDS and 600 had MFS. In total, 93% of patients with EDS complained of GI symptoms and qualified for at least one FGID compared with 69.8% of patients with MFS. When comparing EDS prevalence of upper and lower GI symptoms as well as FGIDs, subjects with EDS reported a significantly higher prevalence of Rome III FGIDs compared with those with MFS. Irritable bowel syndrome (57.8% vs. 27.0%, P < 0.001), functional dyspepsia (FD) (55.4% vs. 25.0%, P < 0.001), postprandial distress (49.6% vs. 21.7%, P < 0.001), heartburn (33.1% vs. 16.8%, P < 0.001), dysphagia (28.5% vs. 18.3%, P < 0.001), aerophagia (24.7% vs. 12.3%, P < 0.001), and nausea (24.7% vs. 7.2%, P < 0.001) were all significantly reported.

### Colonoscopy is safe and not associated with higher pain scores in patients with hypermobility spectrum disorder: Results from an exploratory prospective study [^116GLBnX]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a non-inflammatory heritable connective tissue disorder resulting from defects in collagen structure, synthesis, or processing. Its manifestations frequently involve the cutaneous and musculoskeletal systems, such as skin laxity and joint hypermobility (JHM). The combined prevalence of all types of EDS appears to be at least 1 in 5000 individuals worldwide; however, good quality epidemiological data are lacking. The hypermobility type (hEDS) is the most common (80–90%); type 4 (vascular EDS) accounts for 3–6% of all EDS and is considered the most serious because it is associated with vascular rupture.

A key defining feature of EDS is JHM, which refers to the characteristic of being able to move joints, actively and/or passively, beyond normal limits. JHM can vary in intensity as well as in location, ranging from localized hyperflexibility (i.e. involving fewer than five joints) to generalized JHM (G-JHM), in which at least five different joints are affected.

**Learning points**: This is the first reported case of catastrophic clinical manifestations due to myocardial bleeding without coronary artery disease in a patient with vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS). Skin elasticity may be the key for diagnosis, which can be identified during physical examination. Invasive examination should be performed with more consideration in the management of vEDS. This is a remarkable case in which vEDS is diagnosed in a patient with normal parents without gene mutation.

### A magnetic resonance imaging study of gastric motor function in patients with dyspepsia associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-hypermobility type: A feasibility study [^112wdxnu]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for investigating gastric motor function in dyspepsia is limited, largely due to protocol complexity, cost, and limited availability. In this study, we explore the feasibility of a sub-60-minute protocol using a water challenge to assess gastric emptying, motility, and accommodation in a cohort of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome-Hypermobility Type (EDS-HT) patients presenting with dyspepsia.

- **Methods**: Nine EDS-HT patients (mean age 33, range: 26–50, all female) with a history of dyspepsia were recruited together with nine matched controls. Subjects fasted for six hours prior to MRI. A baseline anatomical and motility scan was performed, after which the subjects ingested 300 mL of water. The anatomical and motility scans were then repeated every 10 minutes for a total of 60 minutes. Gastric emptying time, motility, and accommodation were calculated based on the observations of two observers for each EDS-HT subject and compared to their matched control using paired statistics.

- **Key results**: Median motility increase following the water challenge was lower in EDS-HT subjects (11%, range: 0%-22%) compared to controls (22%, range: 13%-56%). P = .03. Median gastric emptying time was non-significantly decreased in EDS-HT subjects (12.5 minutes, range: 6–27) compared to controls (20 minutes, range: 7–30). P = .15. Accommodation was non-significantly reduced in EDS-HT subjects (56% increase, range: 32%-78%) compared to healthy controls (67% increase, range: 52%-78%). P = .19.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting an MRI protocol to evaluate gastric motor function in EDS-HT patients with dyspepsia within a 60-minute timeframe.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a systematic review [^116RSsHx]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Within the spectrum of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS), vascular complications are typically associated with the vascular subtype of EDS. However, vascular complications are also observed in other EDS subtypes, although the reports are anecdotal and the information is dispersed. To better document the nature of vascular complications among "nonvascular" EDS subtypes, we performed a systematic review.

We queried three databases for English-language studies from inception until May 2017, documenting both phenotypes and genotypes of patients with nonvascular EDS subtypes. The outcome included the number and nature of vascular complications.

A total of 112 papers were included, and data were collected from 467 patients, of whom 77 presented with a vascular phenotype. Severe complications included mainly hematomas (53%), which were frequently reported in musculocontractural and classical-like EDS; intracranial hemorrhages (18%), with a high risk in dermatosparaxis EDS; and arterial dissections (16%), frequently reported in kyphoscoliotic and classical EDS. Other, more minor, vascular complications were reported in cardiac-valvular, arthrochalasia, spondylodysplastic, and periodontal EDS.

Potentially life-threatening vascular complications are a rare but important finding in several nonvascular EDS subtypes, highlighting the need for more systematic documentation. This review will help familiarize clinicians with the spectrum of vascular complications in EDS and guide follow-up and management.

### The association between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobility type and gastrointestinal symptoms in university students: a cross-sectional study [^113PpHzi]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobility type (EDS-HT) have an increased prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, particularly reflux and dyspepsia. EDS-HT is associated with dysautonomia, psychopathology, and chronic pain, which can be associated with GI symptoms. The association between GI symptoms and EDS-HT in a 'non-patient' population and the effect of the above-mentioned factors has not been studied.

- **Methods**: In a cross-sectional study, a hypermobility questionnaire was used to screen university students; further clinical examination established the diagnosis of EDS-HT. Validated questionnaires assessed GI, somatic, pain, and autonomic symptoms, psychopathology, and quality of life (QOL). These were compared in students with and without EDS-HT; logistic regression analysis examined associations between EDS-HT, GI symptoms, and other variables.

- **Key results**: Of 1998 students screened, 162 were included: 74 with EDS-HT (21.0 years, 53% female) vs. 88 without EDS-HT (21.5 years, 65% female). Compared to non-EDS-HT students, EDS-HT students were more likely to have multiple GI symptoms (41.9% vs. 27.3%, P = .05), particularly postprandial fullness (34.4% vs. 15.9%, P = .01) and early satiety (32% vs. 17%, P = .03). They also exhibited greater autonomic symptoms (P = .8). The association between EDS-HT and postprandial symptoms was dependent on autonomic factors but independent of pain and psychopathology. Pain-related QOL scores were reduced in the EDS-HT group (80 vs. 90, P = .03).

- **Conclusions and inferences**: The previously described associations highlight the complex interplay between EDS-HT, GI symptoms, and autonomic and psychological factors. Understanding these dynamics may aid in the management and treatment of affected individuals.

### Underlying Ehlers-Danlos syndrome discovered during neuro-ophthalmic evaluation of concussion patients: a case series [^111RJb9h]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of heritable disorders that cause connective tissue defects. Signs of EDSs include hypermobile joints, loose skin, and fragile tissues due to defective connective tissue synthesis. Thirteen types of EDS have been identified with significant phenotypic heterogeneity. The overall prevalence of EDSs is between 1 in 2500 to 1 in 5000, and the classic and hypermobile EDS variants are the most common phenotypes. It is likely that the milder forms may be underdiagnosed due to their phenotypic heterogeneity. When hypermobile EDS is suspected, a detailed history should be obtained to assess hypermobility, easy bruising or bleeding, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal issues, repeated or voluntary joint dislocations, and history of hernia or muscle injury in the setting of minor trauma, so that the clinical diagnosis can be made.

However, studies and anecdotal observation have suggested that subclinical EDS can also be unmasked by a physical trauma event due to the tissue fragility associated with EDS. Neurological and spinal manifestations of EDS that can become evident in these patients include cervicogenic headache, migraine, cerebrospinal fluid hyper- or hypotension, Chiari malformation, and atlantoaxial/craniocervical instability. At present, there are no published reports focusing on the neuro-ophthalmic symptoms that might occur in EDS patients after mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).

In the following case series, we report neuro-ophthalmic manifestations that developed in patients with underlying EDS or joint hypermobility.

### Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome presenting as a pulsatile neck mass: A case report and review of literature [^113H5CGK]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome refers to a spectrum of connective tissue disorders typically caused by mutations in genes responsible for the synthesis of collagen. Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often exhibit hyperflexibility of joints, increased skin elasticity, and tissue fragility. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos (vEDS) is a subtype of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with a predilection to involve blood vessels. As such, it often manifests as vascular aneurysms and vessel rupture leading to hemorrhage. There are few reports describing primary prevention of aneurysms in the setting of undiagnosed, suspected vEDS.

We present a case of a 30-year-old woman who presents with a pulsatile neck mass found to have multiple arterial aneurysms on imaging, hyperflexibility, and characteristic facial features consistent with vEDS. As described in this case, management of a suspected connective tissue disorder is a multidisciplinary approach including vascular surgery, medical therapy, and genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis. We review literature regarding the care of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos as it might pertain to hospitalized patients.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder affecting collagen metabolism, leading to skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility. Patients can also experience cardiovascular complications, such as aneurysms and mitral valve prolapse, as well as gastrointestinal issues, like hernias and diverticulosis, and ocular defects. A proper history and examination are crucial for the early recognition of EDS signs and symptoms, as patients may initially present with delayed wound healing and abnormal scarring.

### Gastrointestinal medication burden among persons with the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^111yEfJn]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2021). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a group of heritable disorders of connective tissue associated with an increased prevalence of both structural and functional gastrointestinal (GI) conditions.

- **Methods**: We used 10 years (2005–2014) of administrative claims data comprised of 4,294 people with clinician-diagnosed EDS, aged 5–62 years, and compared their frequency of GI drug prescription claims to their age-, sex-, state of residence-, and earliest claim date-matched controls. We categorized the GI medications into the following groups: acid suppressants, anti-emetics, irritable bowel syndrome drugs, and visceral hypersensitivity (VHS) medications.

- **Key results**: Compared to controls, a significantly higher proportion of persons with EDS had prescription claims for at least one GI drug group, as well as for drugs in each of the four GI drug groups included in our study. By age-group, 25.7% of children and 45.1% of adults with EDS had prescription claims for at least one GI drug group compared with only 7.4% and 21.0% of controls, respectively (p < 0.0001). By gender, 44.0% of women and 25.3% of men with EDS had prescription claims for at least one class of GI drugs compared with 19.2% and 9.6% of controls, respectively (p < 0.0001).

- **Conclusions and key inferences**: Predominant medication burden occurs among women with EDS, beginning peri-pubertally for anti-emetics and VHS drugs. High GI medication burden underscores previous evidence that GI dysmotility is common among persons with EDS.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a systematic review [^115eKobo]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an umbrella term for a group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous connective tissue disorders. Over the past two decades, the Villefranche Nosology has been the standard for classifying EDS. It recognized six subtypes, most of which were caused by defects in the primary structure of collagen or collagen-modifying enzymes. Recent discoveries, however, have expanded the pathogenic spectrum to include EDS variants caused by defects in both noncollagenous extracellular matrix proteins and intracellular processes. This has led to an EDS reclassification, a task that was recently accomplished by an international EDS consortium.

Skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility are the clinical hallmarks of EDS, but more variable signs of soft connective tissue fragility are helpful in discriminating between the different types. Historically, arterial aneurysm and dissection have been synonymous with the vascular type of EDS (vEDS). This type of EDS is characterized by the presence of thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily and joint hypermobility, which is often confined to the small joints. The clinical picture is, however, dominated by remarkable vascular fragility that leads to spontaneous rupture of blood vessel walls, often without preceding vascular dilatation or aneurysm formation. Other life-threatening complications include rupture of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, gravid uterus, or other internal organs, such as the liver or spleen. The calculated median survival for vEDS patients is 48 years.

### Gastrointestinal disorders in joint hypermobility syndrome/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type: A review for the gastroenterologist [^111q6Ynv]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS)/Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (EDS-HT) is the most common hereditary non-inflammatory disorder of connective tissue, characterized by a wide range of symptoms, mainly joint hyperextensibility and musculoskeletal symptoms. A majority of patients also experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Furthermore, JHS/EDS-HT has specifically been shown to be highly prevalent in patients with functional GI disorders, such as functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.

- **Purpose**: The aim of this review was to examine the nature of GI symptoms and their underlying pathophysiology in JHS/EDS-HT. In addition, we consider the clinical implications of the diagnosis and treatment of JHS/EDS-HT for practicing clinicians in gastroenterology. Observations summarized in this review may furthermore represent the first step toward the identification of a new pathophysiological basis for a substantial subgroup of patients with functional GI disorders.

### Rare vascular complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113YTQYQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders often grouped with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes. These syndromes have variable abnormalities of the skin, ligaments, blood vessels, and viscera. The prevalence of EDS is estimated at 1 in 5000 births, lacking ethnic, racial, or geographical predisposition. The diverse genetic and molecular changes found in EDS result in poorly described subtypes and overlapping phenotypes. Despite this diversity, skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and widened atrophic scars remain the key diagnostic features in classical EDS, with minor manifestations such as bruising or bleeding diathesis. In contrast, vascular EDS predominantly presents with thin, translucent skin and a tendency for the rupture of hollow organs and arteries due to generalized vascular fragility, resulting in the worst prognosis among EDS subtypes. We present a case of an elderly man with genetically confirmed classical EDS, presenting with cumulative and devastating vascular complications throughout his life, resulting in his mortality.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^111LG4nk]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

In addition to education, participants reported specific strategies and skills they used with EDS patients. Common techniques included contracting, setting expectations, and redirecting conversations with their patients. Most participants expressed that they use their psychosocial skills more with this patient population.

To ensure the patient's expectations and needs are met, many participants stated they prioritize contracting with every patient they see for hEDS. One participant mentioned, "I do a good amount of contracting at the beginning of sessions to just say, 'This is who I am, this is what I can do, this is what we typically see. I'm going to assess your risk for one of these connective tissue disorders, and if what I imagine is true, and that the risk is low, we can still do testing'. I do a lot of that because I don't like disappointing people".

Another participant found contracting important because patients arrive with differing goals: "If someone just wants medical information and good referrals of the whole system, we can give them that. And if someone is just really looking for social support, I can do that" (participant 12).

Almost all participants discussed psychosocial counseling as their predominant role for hEDS patients. They provided support by listening, validating, and empathizing with their stories. Many stated that this part of their role is what differentiates them from other healthcare professionals.
