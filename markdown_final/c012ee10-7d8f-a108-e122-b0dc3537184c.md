## Question

Role of terlipressin in hepatorenal syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of terlipressin in hepatorenal syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of HRS and how terlipressin mechanistically fits. Then, I should verify the strength and consistency of efficacy data across randomized trials and meta-analyses. Next, I will examine safety signals and how they influence patient selection and monitoring. After that, I need to review guideline positions and practical dosing, including alternatives if terlipressin is contraindicated. Finally, I will consider special populations, transplant-related implications, and synthesize a balanced, clinically actionable conclusion with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and mechanism. HRS-AKI is a functional renal failure in advanced cirrhosis driven by splanchnic arterial vasodilation, effective hypovolemia, and neurohormonal activation that produces intense renal vasoconstriction; systemic inflammation amplifies this process, so the therapeutic target is to restore effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion pressure, which is why vasoconstrictors plus albumin are foundational [^d474608a] [^b18824c6] [^048fceee]. Terlipressin, a vasopressin analogue with predominant V1a activity, constricts splanchnic vessels, increases mean arterial pressure, and thereby improves renal perfusion; mechanistically, that aligns with observed clinical effects and supports its role as first-line pharmacotherapy in appropriate patients [^e6d8dd30] [^57418bef].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and consistency of efficacy signals. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses show terlipressin plus albumin roughly doubles HRS reversal versus albumin alone, with absolute differences around 15–20% and pooled odds ratios in the 4–5 range, though mortality benefits are inconsistent across studies and often not statistically significant in individual trials [^d17a9bad] [^924abef5] [^d44f5233]. I should double-check the pivotal CONFIRM trial: verified reversal occurred in 32% with terlipressin vs 17% with placebo, with secondary outcomes showing higher reversal without RRT and signals of benefit even in SIRS-positive patients, which is clinically meaningful even if mortality was not improved in that study [^d17a9bad]. Earlier Cochrane reviews suggested a mortality benefit, but I need to be cautious because those analyses included smaller, heterogeneous trials and may overestimate survival effects, so I should not overstate mortality benefits here [^2c773ce9] [^61240954].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about safety. I need to check the adverse event profile carefully. Terlipressin increases risks of ischemic events (digital, mesenteric, cardiac) and respiratory failure, with CONFIRM showing a 10% vs 3% respiratory failure signal and FDA labeling highlighting serious or fatal respiratory failure risk; this mandates careful selection, oxygenation assessment, and close monitoring during therapy [^d17a9bad] [^bd381274]. Let me reconsider the pathophysiology: terlipressin increases afterload while albumin expands preload, which together can precipitate pulmonary edema in patients with borderline cardiopulmonary reserve; this explains why hypoxemia, advanced ACLF, and very high creatinine are red flags where risks may outweigh benefits [^9f8a2520] [^541b374a]. I should confirm that continuous infusion may mitigate some adverse effects at lower total daily dose, but that formulation is not FDA-approved in the US, so bolus dosing with vigilance remains the standard here [^e0724599].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to ensure alignment. EASL recommends terlipressin plus albumin as first-line for HRS-AKI, with either bolus dosing or continuous infusion where available, and stepwise titration to a maximum of 12 mg/day if there is inadequate response after 48 hours; this reflects longstanding European practice and the strength of reversal data [^9050e4e2] [^6a525d18]. AASLD similarly recommends vasoconstrictors plus albumin as treatment of choice, with terlipressin as preferred when available and norepinephrine as an alternative; midodrine/octreotide is reserved when neither is feasible, acknowledging weaker evidence [^3be2a6c2] [^677de491]. AGA 2023 elevates terlipressin to first-line but explicitly advises avoiding use in hypoxemia, ongoing ischemia, or grade 3 ACLF, and exercising caution when creatinine exceeds 5 mg/dL or MELD is 35 or higher, which operationalizes safety screening in the US context [^9895245e] [^9f8a2520].

> I will now examine practical dosing and monitoring, and I should confirm the FDA-labeled regimen. The US label specifies 0.85 mg IV every 6 hours for up to 3 days, then 0.85–1.7 mg every 6 hours to a maximum of 14 days, with response defined as two consecutive creatinine values ≤ 1.5 mg/dL at least 2 hours apart; this aligns with trial protocols and provides a clear stopping rule if there is no biochemical improvement [^36a2f2b4] [^d17a9bad]. Let me verify adjuncts: albumin is coadministered, typically 40 g initially then 20–40 g daily, but I need to ensure we avoid fluid overload; in patients at risk of pulmonary edema, smaller albumin doses or even omission may be reasonable, balancing hemodynamic benefit against respiratory risk [^notfound]. I should confirm that continuous infusion, while associated with fewer adverse effects in some studies, is not currently available in the US, so bolus dosing with careful titration and monitoring is the practical approach here [^e0724599].

> But wait, what if terlipressin is contraindicated or unavailable. I need to check alternatives. Norepinephrine is an acceptable alternative with comparable reversal rates in several studies, though it requires ICU-level monitoring and may be less practical outside the ICU; nonetheless, head-to-head and meta-analytic data suggest noninferiority to terlipressin for reversal, albeit with different safety trade-offs [^ffc2155f] [^1a939888]. Midodrine plus octreotide is less effective than terlipressin for reversal but remains a low-cost, outpatient option when first-line agents cannot be used, and guidelines position it as a fallback strategy rather than equivalent therapy [^d44f5233] [^677de491]. I should double-check that any vasoconstrictor trial in this space is paired with albumin, as that remains standard supportive care to improve effective arterial blood volume [^3be2a6c2].

> Let me consider special populations and transplant-related implications. In ACLF, terlipressin may achieve faster and higher reversal than norepinephrine in some RCTs, but the risk of respiratory failure is magnified, so I need to ensure careful selection and close monitoring if used in this setting [^d4d3badc]. For patients with very high creatinine or advanced cardiopulmonary disease, the balance of risk and benefit shifts unfavorably, and guidelines advise against terlipressin in these scenarios, reinforcing the need to individualize decisions and consider palliative or bridge strategies early [^9f8a2520] [^541b374a]. I should confirm that responders to terlipressin have improved transplant outcomes and lower post-transplant RRT needs, and that MELD-based systems may disadvantage responders by lowering MELD; this argues for transplant referral and, where appropriate, advocacy for MELD-exception policies in terlipressin responders who remain high risk [^1eb5e764] [^22232b92].

> Hold on, I should verify pediatric and other off-label contexts. Small case series suggest terlipressin can improve urine output and creatinine in pediatric HRS-AKI, but evidence is limited and dosing is extrapolated; use should be cautious and ideally within specialist oversight given the ischemia risk profile [^759fe6fc]. For HRS-CKD (formerly type 2), evidence is sparse and guidelines are less prescriptive; terlipressin may be considered in select cases, but expectations for reversal are lower and decisions should be individualized with transplant evaluation in mind [^937a8da4] [^104b5529].

> Let me synthesize the clinical role succinctly. Terlipressin is the most effective medical therapy for reversing HRS-AKI, with an absolute increase in reversal of about 15–20% over albumin alone and consistent benefits across multiple RCTs and meta-analyses; however, it does not reliably improve short-term mortality and carries meaningful risks of ischemic and respiratory complications, so patient selection, oxygenation assessment, and vigilant monitoring are essential [^d17a9bad] [^924abef5] [^d44f5233]. Guidelines endorse terlipressin as first-line when available, with norepinephrine as a reasonable alternative in the ICU, and midodrine/octreotide as a fallback; albumin coadministration remains standard, but fluid status must be managed carefully to avoid pulmonary edema [^3be2a6c2] [^9050e4e2] [^677de491]. I need to ensure we also emphasize that HRS-AKI is a bridge-to-transplant disease: even with pharmacologic reversal, early transplant evaluation and listing are critical because transplant offers the only durable survival benefit in suitable candidates [^be47532f] [^d474608a].

> Finally, I should double-check key uncertainties and practical pearls. The optimal timing of initiation likely favors earlier treatment before creatinine rises above 5 mg/dL, but prospective data are limited; nonetheless, mechanistic reasoning and observational signals support not delaying once HRS-AKI is diagnosed and other causes are excluded [^9f8a2520] [^a518550c]. Continuous infusion may reduce adverse effects and total dose, but it is not FDA-approved in the US, so bolus dosing with careful titration and early reassessment remains the standard; if there is no creatinine decline by day 3–4 at maximal tolerated dose, discontinuation is advised to avoid futile exposure and complications [^e0724599] [^ff073f57]. I should confirm that patients and families are counseled about the goals of therapy — reversal of AKI and bridge to transplant — rather than guaranteed survival benefit, which remains unproven in aggregate despite consistent reversal signals [^d17a9bad] [^e0724599].

Terlipressin is the **first-line vasoconstrictor** for hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) [^3be2a6c2], with robust evidence that it **improves renal function** and increases HRS reversal rates compared to placebo or other agents [^d17a9bad] [^924abef5]. It is **superior to midodrine/octreotide** and comparable to norepinephrine for reversal, but is **not clearly superior for survival** [^d44f5233] [^ffc2155f]. Terlipressin is **FDA-approved** for HRS with rapid kidney function decline, but requires close monitoring for serious adverse effects, especially respiratory failure and ischemic events [^bd381274] [^9f8a2520]. Use is contraindicated in hypoxemia, ongoing ischemia, or severe ACLF; consider norepinephrine if terlipressin is unavailable or contraindicated [^9f8a2520] [^677de491].

---

## Mechanism of action

Terlipressin is a synthetic vasopressin analogue with **selective V1 receptor agonism** that causes splanchnic vasoconstriction, reduces portal venous pressure, and increases effective arterial blood volume, thereby improving renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate [^e6d8dd30] [^c3464cc0]. It also has mild V2 activity, which can cause water retention and hyponatremia, so sodium levels should be monitored [^e6d8dd30].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting terlipressin use

### Efficacy

- **CONFIRM trial**: Terlipressin plus albumin achieved verified HRS reversal in 32% vs 17% with placebo (P = 0.006), and improved renal function without increasing 90-day mortality [^d17a9bad].
- **Meta-analyses**: Consistently show higher HRS reversal rates with terlipressin versus placebo or other agents, though mortality benefits are inconsistent [^924abef5] [^d44f5233].
- **Comparison with other vasoconstrictors**: Terlipressin is superior to midodrine/octreotide for reversal and comparable to norepinephrine, with no clear survival advantage over norepinephrine [^d44f5233] [^ffc2155f].

---

### Safety

- **Respiratory failure**: Increased risk (10% vs 3% in CONFIRM), especially with high doses or pre-existing respiratory compromise [^d17a9bad] [^8d7922c8].
- **Ischemic events**: Digital, mesenteric, and cardiac ischemia can occur; monitor for ischemic symptoms and discontinue if they arise [^e0724599] [^9f8a2520].
- **Hyponatremia**: Due to V2 activity; monitor sodium and adjust therapy as needed [^e6d8dd30].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| AASLD 2021 | - Terlipressin is first-line for HRS-AKI <br/> - Use albumin concurrently <br/> - Monitor for adverse effects [^3be2a6c2] [^ff073f57] |
| EASL 2018 | - Terlipressin plus albumin is first-line <br/> - Consider continuous infusion to reduce adverse effects <br/> - Monitor closely for ischemic events [^9050e4e2] [^9b53c22d] |
| AGA 2023 | - Terlipressin is first-line <br/> - Avoid in hypoxemia, ongoing ischemia, or severe ACLF <br/> - Use caution if creatinine > 5 mg/dL or MELD ≥ 35 [^9895245e] [^541b374a] |

---

## Patient selection and monitoring

- **Indications**: HRS-AKI with rapid kidney function decline, without hypoxemia, ongoing ischemia, or severe ACLF [^9895245e] [^541b374a].
- **Contraindications**: Hypoxemia, ongoing coronary/peripheral/mesenteric ischemia, severe ACLF, or creatinine > 5 mg/dL [^9f8a2520] [^541b374a].
- **Monitoring**: Frequent assessment of renal function, respiratory status, and ischemic symptoms; adjust dose or discontinue if adverse effects occur [^e0724599] [^9b53c22d].

---

## Alternative therapies

- **Norepinephrine**: Comparable reversal rates to terlipressin; preferred when terlipressin is contraindicated or unavailable [^ffc2155f] [^677de491].
- **Midodrine/octreotide**: Less effective than terlipressin; consider only when first-line agents are unavailable [^d44f5233] [^677de491].
- **Renal replacement therapy**: Bridge to transplant for refractory cases or when pharmacologic therapy fails [^70fcfd3d].

---

## Impact on liver transplantation

Terlipressin-induced HRS reversal facilitates **liver transplantation** by improving pre-transplant renal function, reducing post-transplant dialysis needs, and potentially improving outcomes [^1eb5e764] [^b2641d18]. However, MELD score reductions from renal improvement can lower transplant priority, prompting discussions about MELD exceptions for HRS responders [^e8803c9f] [^22232b92].

---

## Limitations and controversies

- **Mortality benefit**: HRS reversal does not consistently translate into improved survival, especially outside transplant settings [^e0724599] [^d17a9bad].
- **Safety concerns**: Respiratory failure and ischemic events limit use in advanced liver disease or cardiopulmonary comorbidity [^d17a9bad] [^9f8a2520].
- **Cost and access**: High cost and limited availability in some regions constrain use; norepinephrine remains a practical alternative [^cf76b7f8] [^677de491].

---

Terlipressin is the **most effective medical therapy** for HRS-AKI, with strong evidence for renal reversal but inconsistent survival benefit. It is **first-line when used with albumin** and careful monitoring, with norepinephrine as a key alternative when terlipressin is unsuitable.

Background

Clinical trials suggest that terlipressin improves renal function in hepatorenal syndrome, but the evidence concerning mortality is equivocal.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of terlipressin alone or with albumin versus placebo, no intervention or albumin for hepatorenal syndrome.

Search Methods

Eligible trials were identified through electronic (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index databases) and manual searches until January 2012.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials involving patients with type 1 or type 2 hepatorenal syndrome were included irrespective of publication status or language.

Data Collection and Analysis

The review authors independently extracted data from trial reports and undertook correspondence with the authors. Primary outcome measures included mortality, reversal of hepatorenal syndrome and adverse events. Intention-to-treat, random-effects model meta-analyses were performed and results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and the I² statistic provided a measure of intertrial heterogeneity. Subgroup, sensitivity, regression and sequential analyses were performed.

Main Results

We identified six randomised clinical trials. All had high risk of bias. Five trials assessed terlipressin (with albumin in three trials) versus no intervention (with albumin in three trials) and one trial assessed terlipressin versus albumin. Data from five randomised trials on terlipressin alone (one trial) or terlipressin and albumin (four trials) were included in the review. In total, 74 of 155 (47.7%) patients randomised to terlipressin alone or terlipressin with albumin versus 98 of 154 (63.6%) patients randomised to no intervention, placebo or albumin died. Random-effects model meta-analysis found that terlipressin reduced mortality (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95). The results were stable when repeated with trials on terlipressin plus albumin, trials on patients with type 2 hepatorenal syndrome, and trials with a low risk of selection bias. No evidence of bias or small study effects were identified in regression analyses. In a trial sequential analysis on mortality, the cumulative Z curve approached but did not cross the monitoring boundary suggesting that the results were not stable to adjustment for sparse data and multiple comparisons. Analyses of the remaining outcome measures found that terlipressin and albumin increased the number of patients with reversal of hepatorenal syndrome as well as adverse events, including cardiovascular and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Authors' Conclusions

Terlipressin may reduce mortality and improve renal function in patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome. Whether the evidence is strong enough to support the intervention for clinical practice could be debated due to the results of the trial sequential analyses. However, the outcome measures assessed are objective, which reduces the risk of bias.

### Terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome [^6aff5ad3]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The definition and diagnostic criteria of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) has undergone recent changes. A major vasoconstrictor, terlipressin, has recently been approved as pharmacotherapy for HRS-AKI in the United States. The purpose of this review is to familiarize the readers with these new diagnostic criteria of HRS-AKI, and how best to use terlipressin.

Recent Findings

Terlipressin is effective either as bolus dosing or continuous infusion and can achieve reversal of HRS-AKI in approximately 40% of patients. Continuous infusion allows lower daily dose with equal efficacy and less side effects but not an approved mode of administration in the United States. Response to terlipressin in the randomized controlled trials was defined as repeat reduction of serum creatinine to less than 1.5mg/dl. Newer studies will likely require response to treatment to be defined as a repeat serum creatinine to be less than 0.3mg/dl from baseline. Terlipressin use is associated with ischemic side effects and potential for respiratory failure development.

Summary

Careful patient selection and close monitoring are necessary for its use. Response to terlipressin with HRS-AKI reversal is associated with improved outcomes with better survival and less requirement for renal replacement therapy.

### Terlipressin and the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome: how the CONFIRM trial moves the story forward [^5b985eea]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a form of acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in patients with advanced cirrhosis and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology underlying HRS begins with increasing portal pressures leading to the release of vasodilatory substances that result in pooling blood in the splanchnic system and a corresponding reduction in effective circulating volume. Compensatory activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and release of arginine vasopressin serve to defend mean arterial pressure but at the cost of severe constriction of the renal vasculature, leading to a progressive, often fulminant form of AKI. There are no approved treatments for HRS in the United States, but multiple countries, including much of Europe, use terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue, as a first-line therapy. CONFIRM (A Multi-Center, Randomized, Placebo Controlled, Double-Blind Study to Confirm Efficacy and Safety of Terlipressin in Subjects With Hepatorenal Syndrome Type 1), the third randomized trial based in North America evaluating terlipressin, met its primary end point of showing greater rates of HRS reversal in the terlipressin arm. However, due to concerns about the apparent increased rates of respiratory adverse events and a lack of evidence for mortality benefit, terlipressin was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We explore the history of regulatory approval for terlipressin in the United States, examine the results from CONFIRM and the concerns they raised, and consider the future role of terlipressin in this critical clinical area of continued unmet need.

### Terlipressin versus placebo or no intervention for people with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome [^2c773ce9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatorenal syndrome is a potentially reversible renal failure associated with severe liver disease. The disease is relatively common among people with decompensated cirrhosis. Terlipressin is a drug that increases the blood flow to the kidneys by constricting blood vessels. The previous version of this systematic review found a potential beneficial effect of terlipressin on mortality and renal function in people with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of terlipressin versus placebo/no intervention for people with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome.

Search Methods

We identified eligible trials through searches of the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index Expanded, and manual searches until 21 November 2016.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) involving participants with cirrhosis and type 1 or type 2 hepatorenal syndrome allocated to terlipressin versus placebo or no intervention. We allowed co-administration with albumin administered to both comparison groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from trial reports and undertook correspondence with the authors. Primary outcomes were mortality, hepatorenal syndrome, and serious adverse events. We conducted sensitivity analyses of RCTs in which participants received albumin, subgroup analyses of participants with type 1 or type 2 hepatorenal syndrome, and Trial Sequential Analyses to control random errors. We reported random-effects meta-analyses with risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed the risk of bias based on the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains. We graded the quality of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included nine RCTs with a total of 534 participants with cirrhosis and ascites. One RCT had a low risk of bias for mortality and a high risk of bias for the remaining outcomes. All included trials had a high risk of bias for non-mortality outcomes. In total, 473 participants had type 1 hepatorenal syndrome. Seven RCTs specifically evaluated terlipressin and albumin. Terlipressin was associated with a beneficial effect on mortality when including all RCTs (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; 534 participants; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 10.3 people; low-quality evidence). Trial Sequential Analysis including all RCTs also found a beneficial effect of terlipressin. Additional analyses showed a beneficial effect of terlipressin and albumin on reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.82; 510 participants; 8 RCTs; NNTB 4 people; low-quality evidence). Terlipressin increased the risk of serious cardiovascular adverse events (RR 7.26, 95% CI 1.70 to 31.05; 234 participants; 4 RCTs), but it had no effect on the risk of serious adverse events when analysed as a composite outcome (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.21; 534 participants; 9 RCTs; number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome 24.5 people; low-quality evidence). Non-serious adverse events were mainly gastrointestinal, including diarrhoea (RR 5.76, 95% CI 2.19 to 15.15; 240 participants; low-quality evidence) and abdominal pain (RR 1.54, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.43; 294 participants; low-quality evidence). We identified one ongoing trial on terlipressin versus placebo in participants with cirrhosis, ascites, and hepatorenal syndrome type 1. Three RCTs reported funding from a pharmaceutical company. The remaining trials did not report funding or did not receive funding from pharmaceutical companies.

Authors' Conclusions

This review suggests that terlipressin may be associated with beneficial effects on mortality and renal function in people with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, but it is also associated with serious adverse effects. We downgraded the strength of the evidence due to methodological issues including bias control, clinical heterogeneity, and imprecision. Consequently, additional evidence is needed.

### Terlipressin versus other vasoactive drugs for hepatorenal syndrome [^ffc2155f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatorenal syndrome is defined as severe renal failure occurring in people with cirrhosis and ascites. Systematic reviews of randomised clinical trials found that, compared with placebo, terlipressin may reduce mortality and improve renal function in people with hepatorenal syndrome, but we need current evidence from systematic reviews on the benefits and harms of terlipressin versus other vasoactive drugs.

Objectives

To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of terlipressin versus other vasoactive drugs for people with hepatorenal syndrome.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Science Citation Index Expanded; conducted manual searches of references in relevant literature; and wrote to experts and pharmaceutical companies (date of last search November 2016).

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials comparing terlipressin versus any other type of vasoactive drugs for hepatorenal syndrome. We allowed albumin and other cointerventions if provided equally in the comparison groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently extracted data. The primary outcomes were mortality, hepatorenal syndrome (persistent hepatorenal syndrome despite treatment), and serious adverse events. We conducted meta-analyses and present the results as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We performed sensitivity, subgroup, and Trial Sequential Analyses and evaluated bias control based on the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group domains.

Main Results

We included 10 randomised clinical trials with 474 participants. The trials compared terlipressin versus noradrenaline (seven trials), octreotide (one trial), midodrine and octreotide (one trial), or dopamine (one trial). All participants in both groups received albumin as cointervention. We classified two trials at low risk of bias and eight trials at high risk of bias in the assessment of mortality and all trials at high risk of bias for remaining outcomes. In five trials, investigators specifically stated that they did not receive funding from for-profit organisations. We had no information about the funding source from the remaining five trials. Terlipressin was not superior or inferior compared with other vasoactive drugs in regard to mortality when including the two trials with a low risk of bias (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.36; 94 participants, very low quality evidence) or when including all 10 trials (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.06; 474 participants; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). One meta-analysis including nine trials suggested a beneficial effect of terlipressin on hepatorenal syndrome (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99; 394 participants; I² = 26%; very low quality evidence). Due to the high mortality of hepatorenal syndrome, the registration of other serious adverse events is uncertain, but comparing terlipressin and other vasoactive drugs we found no significant difference (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.06; 474 participants; I² = 0%; very low quality evidence). Several trials did not report systematically of adverse events, but terlipressin seemed to increase the risks of diarrhoea or abdominal pain, or both (RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.19 to 10.27; 221 participants; 5 trials, I² = 0%). However, Trial Sequential Analyses found insufficient evidence to support or refute any differences between interventions for all outcomes. Considering reversal of hepatorenal syndrome, subgroup analyses on the type of other vasoactive drugs found that terlipressin was superior compared with midodrine and octreotide (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.72) or octreotide alone (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.96), but each subgroup only included one small trial. None of the remaining subgroup or sensitivity analyses found differences between terlipressin and other vasoactive drugs. We downgraded the evidence to very low quality because of the high risk of bias, imprecision, and the results of the Trial Sequential Analyses.

Authors' Conclusions

This review found insufficient evidence to support or refute beneficial or harmful effects of terlipressin and albumin versus other vasoactive drugs and albumin. Additional research is needed to evaluate if clinically meaningful differences exist between interventions.

### Terlipressin in hepatorenal syndrome [^c0f8b690]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the pharmacology, dosing, and adverse reactions of vasopressin and terlipressin for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) and assess the efficacy of the investigational drug terlipressin for HRS.

Data Sources

Articles evaluating prospective studies for vasopressin and terlipressin were discussed after being identified through PubMed (1966-November 2010), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-November 2010), and EMBASE (1985-November 2010) with combinations of the following terms: vasopressin, terlipressin, and hepatorenal syndrome. In addition, reference citations from publications identified were reviewed. Thirteen studies were identified for terlipressin, along with 4 meta-analyses and 1 case report. For vasopressin, 2 studies were identified.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Prospective clinical studies directly comparing terlipressin and vasopressin were evaluated, as well as prospective clinical studies and meta-analyses for terlipressin in HRS.

Data Synthesis

No randomized, placebo-controlled trials using vasopressin for the treatment of type I HRS have been published, and 4 randomized studies involving 197 patients provide the most current outcome data for use of terlipressin in HRS. Terlipressin differs significantly from vasopressin with regard to its pharmacology, dosing, and adverse drug reaction profile. There is a paucity of data on vasopressin for HRS.

Conclusions

No definitive recommendations can be made for the use of terlipressin for this indication until further, well-conducted studies are performed.

Interpretations of Terlipressin Data and Recommendations From the Expert Panel

A new drug application for terlipressin use in HRS‐1 (the nomenclature at the time of filing) has been reviewed by the FDA. The agency issued a complete response letter requesting more information to support the benefit‐risk ratio. The committee noted that an exploratory analysis of treatment effects on clinical outcomes showed terlipressin was not associated with improved survival compared with placebo and raised safety concerns regarding respiratory failure events.

However, there are no approved therapies for HRS‐AKI in the United States, and the current off‐label options are generally ineffective. Thus, in the United States, there is a significant unmet medical need, and terlipressin addresses that need for a subpopulation of those with HRS‐AKI. This recommendation is based on the careful interpretation of terlipressin data in the 3 registration trials. Per the old ICA criteria that dictated CONFIRM study eligibility, many patients were enrolled at advanced stages of HRS, resulting in late treatment interventions and poor outcomes. Nevertheless, primary and secondary endpoints were consistently met in patients treated with terlipressin and albumin compared with placebo and albumin in phase 3 studies. However, it is clear that further defining the population that has greatest benefit will improve the benefit‐risk parameters.

Efficacy of Pharmacologic Therapy

Although the off‐label use of midodrine and octreotide, as well as norepinephrine, in HRS‐AKI is widespread, much of the data are based on small, nonrandomized studies. Few data exist on the comparative efficacy of these drugs. In recent years, the first meta‐analysis of HRS‐1 (the accepted nomenclature at the time for HRS‐AKI) was published and provided some insight into the comparative efficacy of available agents. The authors identified 13 randomized controlled trials that enrolled 739 adults with HRS‐1. All of the studies compared the efficacy of vasoactive drugs, in combination with albumin, to placebos. The primary outcome was reduction in short‐term mortality. Secondary outcomes included reversal of HRS, relapse of HRS after initial reversal, and adverse events (AEs). Terlipressin studies were included in this meta‐analysis.

Table 3 compares the findings of the meta‐analysis to the recommendations from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) practice guidelines for HRS‐AKI. As demonstrated in the table, the authors of the meta‐analysis dispute the practice guidelines and suggest terlipressin should be adopted as a first‐line therapy in the management of HRS‐AKI. In the absence of better alternatives, however, clinicians in the United States generally follow these guidelines for HRS‐AKI management. Midodrine and octreotide, in combination with albumin, has become the regimen of choice based on availability and ease of administration despite the lack of data. Although norepinephrine has proven benefits, ICU administration is impractical, and therefore its use is uncommon.

### Comparative efficacy of pharmacological strategies for management of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^d44f5233]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

Several drugs have been studied to improve outcomes for patients with hepatorenal syndrome, but trials have reported variable efficacy. We aimed to compare the efficacy of different management strategies for type 1 hepatorenal syndrome.

Methods

For this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and Web of Science for papers published up to June 9, 2016. We selected randomised controlled trials of adults (> 18 years) with decompensated cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome that compared the efficacy of active vasoactive drugs (terlipressin, midodrine, octreotide, noradrenaline, and dopamine; alone or in combination) with placebo or each other. The primary outcome was reduction in short-term mortality. Secondary outcomes were reversal of hepatorenal syndrome, relapse of hepatorenal syndrome after initial reversal, and adverse events. We did pairwise and network meta-analyses to produce odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. We used the GRADE criteria to appraise quality of evidence.

Findings

We identified 13 randomised controlled trials done in 739 adults with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome. All participants received supportive therapy with albumin. Moderate-quality evidence might support the use of terlipressin over placebo for reduction of short-term mortality (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.41–1.05), whereas only low-quality evidence supported the use of noradrenaline, midodrine plus octreotide, and dopamine plus furosemide over placebo to reduce mortality, and no ORs for any of the comparisons versus placebo were significant. Moderate-quality evidence supported the use of terlipressin over midodrine plus octreotide (OR 26.25, 95% CI 3.07–224.21) to reverse hepatorenal syndrome, with low-quality evidence supporting the use of noradrenaline over placebo (4.17, 1.37–12.50) and over midodrine plus octreotide (10.00, 1.49–50.00) for this outcome. A median of 16% (range 5–20) of terlipressin-treated patients, and 33% (range 6–40) noradrenaline-treated patients with reversal of hepatorenal syndrome had recurrence on discontinuation of therapy. A median of 8% (range 4–22) terlipressin-treated patients required discontinuation of therapy due to serious adverse events.

Interpretation

Terlipressin with albumin might reduce short-term mortality compared with placebo in patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome. Terlipressin with albumin and noradrenaline with albumin are both superior to midodrine plus octreotide with albumin for reversal of hepatorenal syndrome. Pragmatic clinical trials of terlipressin with albumin are warranted to evaluate real-world effectiveness and safety in patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome.

### Terlipressin for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^bd9b24a4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of terlipressin and albumin in patients with hepatorenal syndrome.

Methods

A systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing terlipressin and albumin versus albumin with or without placebo in patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome was performed. The study protocol was registered at the PROSPERO platform (CRD42021246684).

Results

Nine randomized controlled trials fulfilled the selection criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. There was no evidence of a significant difference between the groups regarding mortality in 15 days [risk ratio (RR) = 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.47–1.13, P = 0.16, I² = 52%] or in 90 days (RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.80–1.09, P = 0.84, I² = 29%). Regarding hepatorenal syndrome reversal failure, a significant benefit was demonstrated in the terlipressin and albumin group (RR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.53–0.78, P < 0.00001, I2 = 72%). There was no evidence of a significant difference between the groups regarding adverse events (RR = 3.5, 95% CI = 0.94–13.09, P = 0.06, I2 = 89%).

Conclusion

Terlipressin associated with albumin led to a significantly lower rate of hepatorenal syndrome reversal failure, but there was no evidence of a significant effect of this treatment regarding mortality or adverse events.

### Terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome [^945ebaa2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Terlipressin may reverse some of the circulatory changes associated with hepatorenal syndrome.

Objectives

To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome.

Search Strategy

Electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Renal Group Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were combined with scanning of bibliographies and conference proceedings, and correspondence with experts and pharmaceutical companies. Last search update was July 2006.

Selection Criteria

Randomised clinical trials were included irrespective of dose or treatment duration. Included patients had type 1 or type 2 hepatorenal syndrome. Co-interventions were allowed if administered equally to both treatment and control groups.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were retrieved from trial reports and correspondence with the authors of included trials. Mortality was the primary outcome. Meta-analyses were performed to calculate risk differences (RD) for binary outcomes and weighted mean differences (WMD) for continuous outcomes. Both were presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to the limited number of trials, no subgroup analyses were performed.

Main Results

The initial searches identified 645 potentially relevant references. Six randomised trials were eligible for inclusion. Three trials are still ongoing. Three trials with a total of 51 patients assessed terlipressin 1 mg bid for 2 to 15 days. Co-interventions included albumin, fresh frozen plasma, and cimetidine 800 mg daily. One trial reported adequate bias control assessed by randomisation and blinding. All trials reported mortality. Terlipressin reduced mortality rates by 34% (RD -0.34, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.12). The control group mortality rate was 65%. Terlipressin improved renal function assessed by creatinine clearance (WMD 21 ml/min, 95% CI 17 to 26), serum creatinine (WMD -219 micromol/l, 95% CI -244 to -194), and urine output (WMD 707 ml/day, 95% CI -212 to 1625). Adverse events included headache, abdominal pain, cardiac arrhythmia, and hypertension.

Authors' Conclusions

Additional evidence on terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome is needed before reliable treatment recommendations can be made. The dose and duration of therapy, and the influence of co-interventions remain to be established.

### Practice guidance for the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications [^5d6b88d7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background:

Liver cirrhosis is a major global health burden worldwide due to its high risk of morbidity and mortality. Role of terlipressin for the management of liver cirrhosis–related complications has been recognized during recent years. This article aims to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidance on the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis–related complications.

Methods:

Hepatobiliary Study Group of the Chinese Society of Gastroenterology of the Chinese Medical Association and Hepatology Committee of the Chinese Research Hospital Association have invited gastroenterologists, hepatologists, infectious disease specialists, surgeons, and clinical pharmacists to formulate the clinical practice guidance based on comprehensive literature review and experts' clinical experiences.

Results:

Overall, 10 major guidance statements regarding efficacy and safety of terlipressin in liver cirrhosis were proposed. Terlipressin can be beneficial for the management of cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). However, the evidence regarding the use of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with ascites, post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, and bacterial infections and in those undergoing hepatic resection and liver transplantation remains insufficient. Terlipressin-related adverse events, mainly including gastrointestinal symptoms, electrolyte disturbance, and cardiovascular and respiratory adverse events, should be closely monitored.

Conclusion:

The current clinical practice guidance supports the use of terlipressin for gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and HRS in liver cirrhosis. High-quality studies are needed to further clarify its potential effects in other liver cirrhosis–related complications.

### Terlipressin plus albumin for the treatment of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome [^b045ebf2]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

The study CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) was published by Florence Wong and colleagues in 2021 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Hepatorenal syndrome. In the CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) study, the trial question was: what is the role of terlipressin in patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome? In the CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) study, the population was: 300 patients (121 female, 179 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome. The key exclusion criteria were serum creatinine level > 7.0 mg/dL; ≥ 1 large-volume paracenteses of ≥ 4 L within 2 days before randomization; sepsis or uncontrolled bacterial infection for which antibiotic treatment was administered for < 2 days. In the CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) study, the interventions were: n = 199 terlipressin (intravenous bolus injection of terlipressin plus albumin) n = 101 placebo (matching placebo solution for injection plus albumin). In the CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in verified reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (32% vs. 17%; AD 15%, 95% CI 4.31 to 25.69). In the CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in hepatorenal syndrome reversal (39% vs. 18%; AD 21%, 95% CI 8.54 to 33.46) Significant increase in the rate of hepatorenal syndrome reversal with no RRT through day 30 (34% vs. 17%; AD 17%, 95% CI 6.91 to 27.09) Significant increase in hepatorenal syndrome reversal in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (37% vs. 6%; AD 31%, 95% CI 12.61 to 49.39). In the CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. significant differences in adverse events leading to discontinuation of trial regimen (12% vs. 5%), respiratory failure (10% vs. 3%). In the CONFIRM (hepatorenal syndrome) study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, terlipressin was superior to placebo with respect to verified reversal of hepatorenal syndrome.

### From past to present to future: terlipressin and hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury [^0fcbd670]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a rare and highly morbid form of kidney injury unique to patients with decompensated cirrhosis. HRS is a physiologic consequence of portal hypertension, leading to a functional kidney injury that can be reversed by restoring effective circulating volume and renal perfusion. While liver transplantation is the only definitive "cure" for HRS, medical management with vasoconstrictors and i.v. albumin is a cornerstone of supportive care. Terlipressin, a V1a receptor agonist that acts on the splanchnic circulation, has been used for many years outside the United States for the treatment of HRS. However, its recent Food and Drug Administration approval has generated new interest in this population, as a new base of prescribers now work to incorporate the drug into clinical practice. In this article, we review HRS pathophysiology and diagnostic criteria, the clinical use of terlipressin and alternative therapies, and identify areas of future research in the space of HRS and kidney injury in cirrhosis.

### Role of terlipressin and albumin for hepatorenal syndrome in liver transplantation [^b2641d18]. Liver Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is one of the most ominous complications of portal hypertension in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites. It is associated with very high mortality on the wait list. Liver transplantation (LT) is the most successful therapeutic option for patients with HRS. However, not all the LT candidates with HRS are able to receive a deceased donor allograft in a timely manner because it is a scarce resource and patients may need alternative best supportive treatment with systemic splanchnic vasoconstrictors and albumin as a bridge to transplant. The combination of terlipressin and albumin is efficacious in the reversal of HRS and is used worldwide. More recently, the multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind study to confirm efficacy and safety of terlipressin in subjects with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (the CONFIRM study) trial demonstrated the efficacy of terlipressin and albumin in the reversal of HRS in a North American cohort. The aim of this article is to review the role of terlipressin and albumin in LT candidates with HRS in the United States.

### The current management of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury in the United States and the potential of terlipressin [^1ac36f6b]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of cirrhosis (hepatorenal syndrome [HRS]–AKI) is a severe and often fatal complication of end‐stage liver disease. The goals of treatment are to reverse renal failure and prolong survival in patients who are critically ill. However, interventions have limited efficacy, and mortality rates remain high. In the United States, the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy consists of the off‐label use of vasoconstrictive agents in combination with plasma expanders, a strategy that produces modest effects. Liver transplantation is the ultimate solution but is only an option in a minority of patients because contraindications to transplantation are common and organ availability is limited. Renal replacement therapy is a temporary option but is known to confer an extremely poor short‐term prognosis in patients with HRS‐AKI and at best serves as a bridge to liver transplantation for the minority of patients who are transplantation candidates. The high mortality rate associated with HRS‐AKI in the United States is a reflection of the suboptimal standard of care. Improved therapeutic options to treat HRS‐AKI are sought. Terlipressin is a drug approved in Europe for treatment of HRS‐AKI and supported by recommendations for first‐line therapy by some liver societies and experts around the world. This review article will discuss the substantial unmet medical need associated with HRS‐AKI and the potential benefits if terlipressin was approved in the United States.

TABLE 5
Terlipressin‐Treated Participants in CONFIRM Had a Shorter Length of ICU Stay

Post hoc analyses of CONFIRM examined how terlipressin use affects RRT after LT in this population. Through 90 days of follow‐up, 23.1% (46/199) of patients treated with terlipressin and 28.7% (29/101) of patients treated with placebo underwent LT. After transplantation, the rate of RRT in patients who received terlipressin was significantly lower than those who received placebo (19.6% [9/46] versus 44.8% [13/29], respectively; P = 0.03). The overall 90‐day survival rate for transplantation in the terlipressin group was 100% (46/46) compared with 93.1% (27/29) in the placebo group, but the differences were not statistically significant. A separate post hoc intention‐to‐treat analysis was conducted to assess the incidence of RRT among CONFIRM survivors. The cumulative incidences of the need for RRT for the terlipressin group at days 14, 30, and 90 were 23%, 26%, and 29%, respectively, compared with 35%, 36%, and 39%, respectively, for patients assigned to the placebo group (P = 0.03, 0.07, and 0.10, respectively). Among the survivors, significantly fewer patients treated with terlipressin remained dependent on RRT at days 14, 30, and 90 (22%, 26%, and 30%, respectively) compared with those treated with placebo (39%, 43%, and 46%; P < 0.01, P = 0.03, and P = 0.05, respectively). The 90‐day RRT‐free survival rate was 35% in the terlipressin group versus 30% in the placebo group (P = 0.08), with a numerically longer median number of RRT‐free days in the terlipressin group (20 versus 11 days). These analyses indicate that treatment with terlipressin and albumin for patients with HRS‐1 significantly decreases the need for RRT after LT, decreases the rate of RRT among survivors, and improves RRT‐free survival. Of note, a previous study in patients with HRS‐AKI demonstrated that terlipressin and albumin reduced the need for RRT after LT and reduced the risk of chronic kidney disease at 1 year after LT.

### Safety information… [^bd381274]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

FDA has approved Terlivaz injection to improve kidney function in adults with hepatorenal syndrome with rapid reduction in kidney function. Terlivaz is the first FDA-approved medication for this condition. Effectiveness The effectiveness of Terlivaz was assessed in a double-blind study. Participants with HRS with rapid reduction in kidney function were randomly assigned to receive Terlivaz or a placebo. Participants received either 0. 85 mg of Terlivaz or a placebo every six hours as an injection in the vein for a maximum of 14 days. The dose was adjusted based on changes in kidney function. The primary effectiveness outcome was the percentage of patients who had kidney function improvement, defined by two consecutive days of serum creatinine levels of 1. 5 mg/dL or less, obtained at least two hours apart, by day 14 or the participant's final day in the study.

Twenty-nine percent of participants in the Terlivaz group had kidney function improvement compared to 16 percent of participants in the placebo group. People with serum creatinine levels of 5 mg/dL or greater should not take Terlivaz because they are unlikely to benefit from treatment. Safety Information Terlivaz increases the risk of serious or fatal respiratory failure. Patients with low oxygen in their blood should not start the medication. During treatment, patients should be monitored for breathing problems with a pulse oximeter — a tool that measures oxygen levels in the blood. Side effects of Terlivaz may prevent patients from receiving a liver transplant. Terlivaz can cause ischemic events that may require pausing or stopping treatment; the medication may also cause fetal harm when used during pregnancy.

The most common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, respiratory failure, and dyspnea. See the prescribing information for additional information on risks associated with Terlivaz. Designations This application received priority review and fast track status. Terlivaz also received orphan drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.

### The current management of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury in the United States and the potential of terlipressin [^33149868]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

HRS‐AKI is no longer a rare condition given the tremendous increase in the number of patients with advanced liver disease in the United States, and clinicians should be attentive to the development of HRS‐AKI in patients with cirrhosis. Early diagnosis and interventions involving specialists (in particular, nephrologists) are essential to improve outcomes, but HRS‐AKI is often rapidly fatal under any circumstances without effective interventions. LT remains the most effective intervention, but few patients with HRS‐AKI undergo transplantation. RRT is a temporary life‐saving intervention but may ultimately worsen outcomes, especially if implemented for long periods, and increase the risk of renal insufficiency after LT. In terms of pharmacologic therapy, vasoconstriction and plasma expansion are necessary therapeutic interventions. The agent of choice for volume resuscitation is albumin, and judicious use is encouraged. No vasoconstrictors are approved for HRS‐AKI, yet midodrine/octreotide has become the mainstay of therapy despite the lack of evidence of therapeutic efficacy. Terlipressin, approved in Europe for the treatment of HRS‐AKI and supported by recommendations for first‐line therapy by some liver societies and experts around the world, would constitute a beneficial option for many patients with HRS‐AKI were it available in the United States.

Background

Liver cirrhosis is a major global health burden worldwide due to its high risk of morbidity and mortality. Role of terlipressin for the management of liver cirrhosis-related complications has been recognized during recent years. This article aims to develop evidence-based clinical practice guidance on the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications.

Methods

Hepatobiliary Study Group of the Chinese Society of Gastroenterology of the Chinese Medical Association and Hepatology Committee of the Chinese Research Hospital Association have invited gastroenterologists, hepatologists, infectious disease specialists, surgeons, and clinical pharmacists to formulate the clinical practice guidance based on comprehensive literature review and experts' clinical experiences.

Results

Overall, 10 major guidance statements regarding efficacy and safety of terlipressin in liver cirrhosis were proposed. Terlipressin can be beneficial for the management of cirrhotic patients with acute variceal bleeding and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). However, the evidence regarding the use of terlipressin in cirrhotic patients with ascites, post-paracentesis circulatory dysfunction, and bacterial infections and in those undergoing hepatic resection and liver transplantation remains insufficient. Terlipressin-related adverse events, mainly including gastrointestinal symptoms, electrolyte disturbance, and cardiovascular and respiratory adverse events, should be closely monitored.

Conclusion

The current clinical practice guidance supports the use of terlipressin for gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and HRS in liver cirrhosis. High-quality studies are needed to further clarify its potential effects in other liver cirrhosis-related complications.

Regarding medical management for hepatorenal syndrome, more specifically with respect to vasoactive agents, EASL 2018 guidelines recommend to consider administering terlipressin plus albumin as first-line therapy in patients with AKI-HRS. Consider administering terlipressin by IV boluses at the initial dose of 1 mg every 4–6 hours, or by continuous IV infusion (not available in the US) at an initial dose of 2 mg/day to reduce the global daily dose of the drug and, thus, the rate of its adverse effects. Increase the dose of terlipressin in a stepwise manner to a maximum of 12 mg/day after 2 days in case of nonresponse (decrease in serum creatinine < 25% from the peak value).

### Treating hepatorenal syndrome in the current era [^a2f6908c]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS-1) is a severe form of acute kidney injury (AKI) that affects individuals with advanced cirrhosis and ascites. The main pillar of its pathogenesis is rooted on marked maladaptive renal vasoconstriction. Because of the lack of a gold standard, establishing the diagnosis requires a meticulous process of recognizing its phenotypical features and ascertaining the absence of strong evidence of an alternative etiology of AKI. This is particularly important because a diagnosis of AKI due to HRS-1 prompts initiation of a specific vasoconstrictor pharmacotherapy. Terlipressin and norepinephrine are the most effective therapeutic agents for HRS-1. Treatment eligibility and choice of agent should follow a systematic assessment of clinical presentation, drug safety profile, practical and logistical considerations around intensive care unit bed availability and proximity of liver transplantation. Independently of the vasoconstrictor used, the goal of therapy is to target a sustained rise in mean arterial pressure to enable renal perfusion. Although albumin has been historically viewed as a key coadjuvant of vasoconstrictor therapy, newer data have emerged demonstrating that albumin may increase the risk for fluid overload. Conversely, diuretics may be safely introduced when clinically applicable. In this review, we navigate through the common challenges faced during the assessment, diagnosis and medical treatment of a patient with decompensated cirrhosis and AKI suspected to be due to HRS-1, emphasizing the newest lessons learned about the role of terlipressin, its safety profile, and the paradigm shift around the role of albumin in the management in HRS-1.

Purpose Of Review

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is encountered frequently in patients with end-stage liver disease and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. This review will focus and provide updates on pathophysiology, assessment of kidney function, new definitions, and treatment and prevention of HRS.

Recent Findings

Pathophysiology of HRS has been elucidated more recently and in addition to hemodynamic changes, the role of systemic inflammatory response contributes significantly to this process. Assessment of kidney function in patients with liver cirrhosis remains challenging. Novel glomerular filtration rate equations have been developed in patients with liver disease to better estimate kidney function and changes made in the definition of acute kidney injury (AKI), which are more aligned with KDIGO criteria for AKI. Vasoconstrictors, especially terlipressin, along with albumin remain the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of HRS-AKI. Biomarkers have been useful in differentiating ATN from HRS at an early stage.

Summary

HRS remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for patients with end-stage liver disease. Newer understanding of mechanisms in development and pathophysiology of HRS have helped with elucidation of the disease process.

The Impact of Renal Failure on Morbidity and Mortality in Cirrhosis

A diagnosis of HRS‐AKI confers a relatively short survival period. The literature indicates mortality rates ranging from 36% to 100%, with patients more likely to die if there are delays in therapy. Aside from the risk of death, HRS‐AKI is associated with additional deleterious consequences (Table 1). Patients with HRS‐AKI who are hospitalized are likely to require intensive care and, if discharged, have high readmission rates. These facts underscore the importance of timely diagnosis and effective intervention.

Defining Hepatorenal Syndrome

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)–acute kidney injury (AKI), a dire consequence of end‐stage liver disease, is a functional, progressive kidney failure that is potentially reversible but most often rapidly fatal. HRS‐AKI is observed in hepatic failure of any cause, but most often occurs in the setting of advanced cirrhosis. In advanced cirrhosis, portal hypertension reduces portal blood flow, which results in the release of vasodilators and blood pooling in the splanchnic circulation. This causes activation of both the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system. The intense renal vasoconstriction with predominant peripheral arterial vasodilation (mainly in the splanchnic circulation) that follows is considered the hallmark feature of HRS. In the United States, at least 633,000 adults are afflicted with cirrhosis, which represents 0.3% of the population. The estimated annual incidence for HRS type 1 (HRS‐1; the previously used term for HRS‐AKI) in the United States ranges from 9000 patients to more than 35,000 patients. Although these rates technically classify HRS‐AKI as rare, the literature regards it as a "relatively frequent problem". Approximately 20% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis experience HRS‐AKI. Previous studies have found that 18% of patients with advanced cirrhosis develop HRS‐AKI after 1 year of follow‐up, and this proportion more than doubles to 39% after 5 years.

The continuum of kidney damage that occurs in HRS‐AKI, initially reversible, can lead to permanent damage, ultimately in the form of irreversible renal failure if left untreated. Although recommendations for early and rapid interventions are widely accepted, favorable outcomes are seldom achieved. Current treatment options, particularly in the United States, are generally ineffective, and better options to manage HRS‐AKI are sought. The purpose of this article is to discuss the substantial unmet medical need associated with HRS‐AKI and delineate ways to improve therapy for this disease.

Use of Terlipressin in Patients With HRS‐AKI

Terlipressin is approved in Europe for the treatment of HRS‐1, and efficacy is supported by controlled studies, including the recently published CONFIRM trial in the United States, and is endorsed by 2 liver society guidelines. In contrast to the AASLD guidelines (Table 3), the European Association for the Study of the Liver Practice Guidelines recommends terlipressin and albumin as a first‐line therapy for HRS‐1 (now HRS‐AKI).

Terlipressin is a prohormone of lysine‐vasopressin and, via a tissue peptidase mechanism, causes prolonged release of lysine‐vasopressin, thereby prolonging the half‐life. This allows for administration in divided doses of 1 mg intravenously every 6 hours for up to 14 days, with alternative modes of delivery currently being studied. Terlipressin is selective for both V1 and V2 receptors. Stimulation of the V1 receptors causes splanchnic and extrarenal vasoconstriction, reducing splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure, ameliorating hyperdynamic circulation, and improving the effective circulatory volume and renal perfusion pressure. Stimulation of the V2 receptors increases water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts, which may result in hyponatremia. The AE profile is safe enough that ICU administration is unnecessary.

Terlipressin is under investigation in the United States for FDA approval for HRS‐AKI. It has been evaluated in 3 phase 3 studies. OT‐0401 and REVERSE (Randomized, placEbo‐controlled, double‐blind study to confirm the reVERSal of hepatorenal syndromE type 1 with terlipressin) are 2 multicenter, randomized phase 3 clinical studies comparing treatment with terlipressin plus albumin to placebo plus albumin in patients with HRS‐1 (currently HRS‐AKI). A summary of both studies is included in Table 4. The larger CONFIRM study was subsequently performed to confirm the efficacy and safety of terlipressin plus albumin versus albumin alone in patients with well‐defined HRS‐1. Terlipressin demonstrated efficacy and a favorable safety profile in all 3 studies (Table 4).

### Continuous recurrence of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome and long-term treatment with terlipressin and albumin: a new exception to MELD score in the allocation system to liver transplantation? [^f5aa8901]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The recurrence of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome has been described in up to 20% of responders to terlipressin and albumin after the discontinuation of the treatment. Subsequent recurrence of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome may require long-term treatment with terlipressin and albumin.

Methods

We describe our experience of long-term administration of terlipressin as a bridge to LT in three patients with cirrhosis and recurrent type 1 hepatorenal syndrome. For all three patients we requested an "early transplant" which is an option recognized in our country to reduce waiting times for liver transplantation.

Results

All three patients were transplanted within 2 months of onset of hepatorenal syndrome. All patients are still alive and none of them have developed chronic kidney disease.

Conclusions

The outcomes of these patients suggest that long-term treatment with terlipressin and albumin is effective and well tolerated in patients with continuous recurrence of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome and, therefore, should be considered an absolute priority criterion in the allocation system for liver transplantation.

### Controversies in terlipressin and transplantation in the United States: how do we MELD the two? [^e8803c9f]. Liver Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) is a severe complication of cirrhosis that carries a poor prognosis. The recent Food and Drug Administration approval of terlipressin has substantial implications for managing HRS-AKI and liver allocation in the United States. Terlipressin has been available in Europe for over a decade, and several countries have adapted policy changes such as Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score "lock" for HRS-AKI. In this article, we outline the European experience with terlipressin use and explore the question of whether terlipressin treatment for HRS-AKI should qualify for the MELD score "lock" in the United States in those who respond to therapy. Arguments for the MELD lock include protecting waitlist priority for terlipressin responders or partial responders who may miss offers due to MELD reduction in the terlipressin treatment window. Arguments against MELD lock include the fact that terlipressin may produce a durable response and improve overall survival and that equitable access to terlipressin is not guaranteed due to cost and availability. We subsequently discuss the proposed next steps for studying terlipressin implementation in the United States. A successful approach will require the involvement of all major stakeholders and the mobilization of our transplant community to spearhead research in this area.

TABLE 4
High‐Level Overview of Phase 3 Terlipressin Studies

In CONFIRM, patients were to have "well‐defined" HRS‐1 based on the modified criteria outlined by the ICA in adult patients with cirrhosis and ascites (Table 4). The demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of patients in CONFIRM were similar among treatment groups and indicate a population of patients with advanced HRS‐AKI, including the mean baseline sCr, which was 3.5 mg/dL for both the terlipressin and placebo groups. In addition, 42.2% of participants in the terlipressin group and 47.5% in the placebo group met the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), a group typically associated with poor outcomes. As depicted in Fig. 1, CONFIRM demonstrated that patients with HRS‐AKI treated with terlipressin plus albumin experienced a significantly greater reversal of worsening renal function compared with patients treated with albumin alone (placebo group), including patients with SIRS. Furthermore, although similar percentages of participants in each treatment group were admitted to the ICU, patients in the terlipressin group required 6.4 days of ICU care compared with 13.2 days in the placebo group (Table 5).

### The current management of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury in the United States and the potential of terlipressin [^ea4a2bf1]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

The CONFIRM study demonstrated that significantly more patients treated with terlipressin achieved verified HRS reversal than in those receiving placebo, an extremely important outcome. Considering a cohort of patients (n = 99) with access to LT from a previously published study of terlipressin plus albumin versus albumin alone, 35 of whom received LT, the 180‐day survival rates for patients who received transplants were 100% in those who received terlipressin plus albumin versus 94% in those who received albumin alone. This study also reported that the 180‐day survival rate in the nontransplant group was 34% in those who received terlipressin plus albumin versus 17% in those who received albumin alone. The survival rate was significantly better for those achieving a reversal of HRS versus those who did not (47% versus 4%; P < 0.001) and for those who received LT compared with those who achieved HRS reversal (97% versus 47%; P < 0.001). These data reinforce that LT is optimal for HRS‐AKI. However, the majority of patients with HRS‐AKI are ineligible for LT or a donor organ is unavailable if they are eligible. HRS‐AKI reversal with an effective therapy such as terlipressin is a meaningful strategy to improve survival.

Unfortunately, the MELD scoring system often provides a disservice to patients with HRS‐AKI on transplantation waiting lists. Patients with HRS‐AKI have demonstrated worse survival expectancy than other populations with cirrhosis with equivalent MELD scores. This is because patients with elevated sCr from HRS‐AKI have worse prognoses than patients with AKI because of parenchymal nephropathy. In Italy, the Italian Liver Allocation Policy was recently revised to reflect relevant critical issues and conceptual advances, one being "the inequity of a purely MELD‐based system governing organ allocation". The revised policy now considers HRS an exception, but to date, no such policy revision has been implemented in the United States. Finally, data demonstrate that effective pharmacological treatment of HRS‐AKI improves specific components of the MELD system (ie, sCr, sodium), reducing the score and adversely affecting the priority of patients on the waiting list for liver allocation who remain quite ill and still require life‐saving LT. Nevertheless, this should not be a reason to withhold treatment in patients with HRS‐AKI who are LT candidates, as the benefits of effective management far exceed the risk of decreased priority for LT. An update to amend the allocation policy to allow patients with HRS‐AKI to maintain priority for liver allocation in the setting of effective therapy would be ideal, but more advances in this field are needed. For example, the availability of validated biomarkers to differentiate HRS‐AKI from the pool of other kidney disorders (eg, parenchymal AKIs) is essential to avoid the mislabeling of patients and downstream implications on kidney allocation.

### The current management of hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury in the United States and the potential of terlipressin [^be47532f]. Liver Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver Transplantation

Liver transplantation (LT) is considered the optimal treatment for patients with HRS‐AKI because it corrects the underlying liver failure that underlies reversible HRS‐AKI, thereby curing both. In reality, this is rarely realized because most patients have contraindications to transplantation, organ availability is limited, and factors adversely impact prioritization of patients with HRS‐AKI who are listed for LT.

The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network is the unified transplantation network in the United States under the auspices of the United Network for Organ Sharing. According to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policy for LT, each adult LT candidate (≥ 18 years old) is assigned a score based on the Model for End‐Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scoring system, which prioritizes patients for liver allocation. The factors involved in this calculation are sCr, bilirubin, and international normalized ratio values, and, in patients with MELD scores > 10, sodium levels. MELD score is a prediction of 90‐day mortality; the higher the score, the higher the mortality rate.

The effects of terlipressin on RRT‐related outcomes are also important to consider. RRT is a provisional management strategy for HRS‐AKI known to confer an extremely poor prognosis and at best serves as a bridge to LT for the small number of patients who are transplantation candidates. Data on the use of RRT in patients with HRS‐AKI indicate that it is associated with increased mortality, a risk of serious complications, a threat of renal nonrecovery after LT, poor quality of life, and high costs. The benefits of terlipressin and albumin use on RRT alone should be considered a significant and clinically meaningful outcome when managing this serious disease for which there are no approved therapies.

The safety issues that are of concern have been infrequently encountered or successfully managed in patients treated with terlipressin for many years in Europe. Efforts to mitigate AEs and optimize favorable outcomes involve a better understanding of patient selection, including timing of therapy (ie, administering to the appropriate patients at the appropriate time), careful candidate selection, dosing method and titration, as well as the correct use of albumin and fluid monitoring. In the CONFIRM study, the majority (83%) of patients treated with terlipressin received albumin because of the advanced degree of HRS. There was likely an increase in afterload (from terlipressin use) and an increase in preload (from albumin use) that resulted in pulmonary edema and, ultimately, respiratory failure. It is plausible that if terlipressin were given earlier in the disease process (ie, at lower Cr levels), using the current consensus definition of HRS, it would potentially lead to higher rates of HRS reversal and lower incidences of respiratory failure. Appropriate patient selection would include patients early in the disease process with the avoidance of patients with cardiopulmonary issues. Careful administration of albumin is also necessary, with vigilance for fluid overload or impending respiratory failure. Future investigations with terlipressin should be designed to assess populations that optimize benefit from terlipressin and minimize toxicity.

Diagnosis

Previously, HRS was classified by the International Club of Ascites (ICA) as either type 1 (HRS‐1) or type 2 (HRS‐2), but the nomenclature has recently evolved. The original definition of HRS‐1 required that the diagnosis be established at an advanced stage of AKI, with a final serum creatinine (sCr) cutoff value of > 2.5 mg/dL. However, treatment efficacy proved to be limited if initiated in such advanced stages. The new terminology, per the consensus of the ICA, delineates HRS‐1 and HRS‐2 by the presence or absence of AKI, respectively. HRS‐1 is now referred to as HRS‐AKI and defined by changes in sCr and/or urinary output, among other diagnostic criteria that are detailed in Table 2. To encourage early and rapid interventions, this new definition of HRS‐AKI eliminates the final sCr cutoff value of ≥ 1.5 mg/dL and instead recommends treatment even when increases in sCr are small. Urinary output has also been added to the definition but because of challenges in sample collection is only recommended if a catheter is present. This discussion will focus on HRS as it relates to AKI (HRS‐AKI) in the setting of cirrhosis. HRS without AKI, formerly HRS‐2, is a diagnosis in the setting of chronic kidney disease and is beyond the scope of this article.

TABLE 2
ICA Diagnostic Criteria for HRS‐AKI *

As reflected in the diagnostic criteria, once HRS‐AKI is suspected, it is important to differentiate HRS‐AKI from structural kidney injury — acute tubular necrosis–AKI. This is considered a "real clinical challenge" because the most commonly used assessment for renal function — sCr — is a marker of kidney filtration and therefore cannot differentiate functional disease (ie, HRS‐AKI) from structural disease (ie, acute tubular necrosis–AKI). The utility of novel urinary biomarkers, which reflect structural injury, in combination with changes in filtration is under investigation for this purpose. Based on available data, the ICA has identified interleukin‐18, kidney injury molecule‐1, liver type fatty acid–binding protein, and neutrophil gelatinase‐associated lipocalin as promising biomarkers, but their availability is not widespread, nor is usage standardized. Another alternative is to evaluate the fractional excretion of sodium, but questions remain regarding appropriate cutoffs to distinguish between the 2 processes.

### A randomized, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of terlipressin for type 1 hepatorenal syndrome [^fa95d218]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) type 1 is a progressive functional renal failure in subjects with advanced liver disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of terlipressin, a systemic arterial vasoconstrictor, for cirrhosis type 1 HRS.

Methods

A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of terlipressin was performed. Subjects with type 1 HRS were randomized to terlipressin (1 mg intravenously every 6 hours) or placebo plus albumin in both groups. The dose was doubled on day 4 if the serum creatinine (SCr) level did not decrease by 30% of baseline. Treatment was continued to day 14 unless treatment success, death, dialysis, or transplantation occurred. Treatment success was defined by a decrease in SCr level to ≤ 1.5 mg/dL for at least 48 hours by day 14 without dialysis, death, or relapse of HRS type 1.

Results

Fifty-six subjects were randomized to each arm. Treatment success with terlipressin was double that with placebo (25% vs 12.5%, P = 0.093). SCr level improved from baseline to day 14 on terlipressin (-0.7 mg/dL) as compared with placebo (0 mg/dL), P < .009. Terlipressin was superior to placebo for HRS reversal (34% vs 13%, P = 0.008), defined by decrease in SCr level ≤ 1.5 mg/dL. Overall and transplantation-free survival was similar between study groups; HRS reversal significantly improved survival at day 180. One nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred with terlipressin, but the total adverse event rate was similar to placebo.

Conclusions

Terlipressin is an effective treatment to improve renal function in HRS type 1.

### Terlipressin plus albumin for the treatment of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome [^d17a9bad]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2021). Excellent credibility.

Background

The vasoconstrictor terlipressin is used for type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-1) in many parts of the world and is part of the clinical practice guidelines in Europe.

Methods

We conducted a phase 3 trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of terlipressin plus albumin in adults with HRS-1. The patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive terlipressin or placebo for up to 14 days; in both groups, concomitant use of albumin was strongly recommended. The primary end point was verified reversal of HRS, defined as two consecutive serum creatinine measurements of 1.5 mg per deciliter or less at least 2 hours apart and survival without renal-replacement therapy for at least 10 days after the completion of treatment. Four prespecified secondary end points were analyzed with the Hochberg procedure to account for multiple comparisons.

Results

A total of 300 patients underwent randomization - 199 were assigned to the terlipressin group and 101 to the placebo group. Verified reversal of HRS was reported in 63 patients (32%) in the terlipressin group and 17 patients (17%) in the placebo group (P = 0.006). With respect to the prespecified secondary end points, HRS reversal, defined as any serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg per deciliter or less during the first 14 days, was reported in 78 patients (39%) in the terlipressin group and 18 (18%) in the placebo group (P < 0.001); HRS reversal without renal-replacement therapy by day 30, in 68 (34%) and 17 (17%), respectively (P = 0.001); HRS reversal among patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (84 patients in the terlipressin group and 48 patients in the placebo group), in 31 (37%) and 3 (6%), respectively (P < 0.001); and verified reversal of HRS without recurrence by day 30, in 52 (26%) and 17 (17%), respectively (P = 0.08). At day 90, liver transplantations had been performed in 46 patients (23%) in the terlipressin group and 29 patients (29%) in the placebo group, and death occurred in 101 (51%) and 45 (45%), respectively. More adverse events, including abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and respiratory failure, occurred with terlipressin than with placebo. Death within 90 days due to respiratory disorders occurred in 22 patients (11%) in the terlipressin group and 2 patients (2%) in the placebo group.

Conclusions

In this trial involving adults with cirrhosis and HRS-1, terlipressin was more effective than placebo in improving renal function but was associated with serious adverse events, including respiratory failure.

Objectives

To review the current definitions and diagnostic criteria for acute kidney injury (AKI) and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) now termed HRS-AKI and discuss the challenges in deciding the most appropriate medication regimens to treat patients with HRS-AKI.

Data Sources

PubMed (inception to April 2023) with bibliographies of retrieved articles searched for additional articles; organizational websites for clinical practice guidelines (CPGs).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating albumin and vasoconstrictors for HRS-AKI.

Data Synthesis

A major change in the most recent revision of definitions and diagnostic criteria for HRS-AKI is the elimination of the set cutoff serum creatinine values for AKI. This change should be considered when comparing studies of HRS-AKI over time. Albumin has been administered to both vasoconstrictor treatment and placebo groups in all recent RCTs; however, there has never been a large RCT evaluating a no-albumin group. Most prospective trials comparing a midodrine/octreotide combination or norepinephrine to placebo or terlipressin have enrolled less than 100 patients limiting any conclusions regarding clinically important outcomes. Terlipressin with albumin has shown mixed results for complete HRS-AKI reversal with no reductions in crude mortality but adverse effect concerns involving ischemic and pulmonary events.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome with acute kidney injury is a potentially life-threatening syndrome with diagnostic and treatment challenges. Albumin plus a vasoconstrictor has become the routine HRS-AKI treatment even though there has not been a large RCT evaluating a no-albumin group. Terlipressin is the vasoconstrictor of choice for HRS-AKI in current CPGs, but it has adverse effect concerns and, until recently, was not available in the United States.

Conclusions

In conjunction with changes in the definitions and diagnostic criteria for HRS-AKI, debate continues regarding the optimal therapy for HRS-AKI, particularly considering recent trials demonstrating ischemic and pulmonary adverse events with terlipressin used in combination with albumin.

### The relationship between mean arterial pressure and terlipressin in hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury reversal: a post hoc analysis [^57418bef]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Terlipressin reverses hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI) by increasing mean arterial pressure (MAP). To further characterize the relationship between terlipressin and MAP and their impact on HRS-AKI reversal, we used patient-level data from phase 3 clinical trials REVERSE and CONFIRM.

Approach and Results

In this post hoc analysis we employed a linear mixed-effects model to assess terlipressin's impact on MAP, exploring the relationship between MAP, treatment group, and time, incorporating a random intercept for individual patients. Time-dependent Cox models analyzed MAP's role in HRS-AKI reversal. We conducted a mediation analysis to evaluate how time-weighted MAP mediated HRS-AKI reversal. This analysis included 487 patients (60% terlipressin, 40% placebo). At baseline, there were no differences in median MAP between terlipressin and placebo (77 mm Hg vs. 76 mm Hg, p = 0.3); the terlipressin group had significantly higher MAPs after randomization (day 1: 85 mm Hg vs. 75 mm Hg; day 3: 81 mm Hg vs. 76 mm Hg; all: p < 0.001). In mixed-effects models, terlipressin was associated with a 6.0 mm Hg increase in MAP over placebo occurring on day 1, with no significant interaction between the treatment group and time (p > 0.05). In time-dependent Cox models, each 5 mm Hg increase in MAP was associated with 1.17× the hazard of HRS-AKI reversal (95% CI: 1.11–1.22). In mediation analysis, MAP significantly mediated HRS-AKI reversal, regardless of treatment group (average proportion mediated: 33%, 95% CI: 14–76).

Conclusions

These data highlight that terlipressin leads to an early, sustained increase in MAP, which is a key pharmacodynamic target for HRS-AKI reversal.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of hepatorenal syndrome: insights into HRS-AKI and liver transplantation [^3cfbd70e]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI), accurate and early diagnosis is crucial. HRS is a severe condition seen in advanced cirrhosis, requiring prompt recognition and proper management to enhance patient outcomes. Diagnosis of HRS-AKI relies on serum creatinine elevations, similar to other AKI cases in cirrhosis. However, distinguishing HRS-AKI from other renal impairments in these patients can be challenging. Biomarkers and clinical criteria aid in diagnosis and guide treatment. The management of HRS-AKI initially involves improving the haemodynamic profile using albumin and vasoconstrictors like terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue. Despite some reports linking terlipressin to increased adverse events compared with norepinephrine, it remains the preferred choice in HRS-AKI and acute-on-chronic liver failure due to its faster, stronger response and improved survival. Additional therapies like midodrine (alpha-1 adrenergic agonist), octreotide (somatostatin analogue) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt are proposed as adjuvant treatments for HRS-AKI, aiming to improve vasoconstriction and renal blood flow. However, these adjunctive therapies cannot replace the definitive treatment for HRS-AKI-liver transplantation (LT).

### Hepatorenal syndrome [^d474608a]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome is a severe complication of end-stage cirrhosis characterized by increased splanchnic blood flow, hyperdynamic state, a state of decreased central volume, activation of vasoconstrictor systems, and extreme kidney vasoconstriction leading to decreased GFR. The contribution of systemic inflammation, a key feature of cirrhosis, in the development of hepatorenal syndrome has been highlighted in recent years. The mechanisms by which systemic inflammation precipitates kidney circulatory changes during hepatorenal syndrome need to be clarified. Early diagnosis is central in the management and recent changes in the definition of hepatorenal syndrome help identify patients at an earlier stage. Vasoconstrictive agents (terlipressin in particular) and albumin are the first-line treatment option. Several controlled studies proved that terlipressin is effective at reversing hepatorenal syndrome and may improve short-term survival. Not all patients are responders, and even in responders, early mortality rates are very high in the absence of liver transplantation. Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment of hepatorenal syndrome. In the long term, patients transplanted with hepatorenal syndrome tend to have lower GFR compared with patients without hepatorenal syndrome. Differentiating hepatorenal syndrome from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is often a challenging yet important step because vasoconstrictors are not justified for the treatment of ATN. Hepatorenal syndrome and ATN may be considered as a continuum rather than distinct entities. Emerging biomarkers may help differentiate these two conditions and provide prognostic information on kidney recovery after liver transplantation, and potentially affect the decision for simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation.

### Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis [^b18824c6]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome

Patients with cirrhosis and ascites can develop a specific form of renal dysfunction, which is termed hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Traditionally HRS was thought to be due to the altered haemodynamic alterations with hyperdynamic circulation as well as overactive endogenous vasoactive system which results in renal hypoperfusion. It is now recognised that systemic inflammation also plays an important role in the pathophysiology of HRS.

The traditional classification of HRS-1 and HRS-2 has recently been revised by the International Club of Ascites.HRS-1, which reflects a rapid reduction in renal function, has been proposed to be changed to HRS-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI). The new definition of HRS-AKI includes an increase in serum creatinine of ≥ 0.3 mg/dL (27 µmol/L) within 48 hours or ≥ 50% from baseline, without necessitating a final cut-off value of 1.5 mg/dL (133 µmol/L). This allows treatment to be started earlier. HRS-2, which represents renal dysfunction that does not progress rapidly, has been proposed to be changed to HRS-NAKI (non-AKI).

The mainstay of treatment of HRS-AKI involves HAS and vasoconstrictors, particularly terlipressin. Combination of terlipressin and HAS has been shown in RCTs to significantly improve renal function in HRS-AKI and improve short-term mortality (online supplemental table 12). Higher baseline serum creatinine is an independent predictor of failure to respond to vasoconstrictor treatment. A full review of HRS is beyond the scope of this guideline.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome and associated outcomes: a systematic reviews [^9fb7673c]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), a multiorgan condition of acute kidney injury, is seen in advanced liver disease. This study aims to evaluate the current treatment for HRS.

Methods

The authors searched PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar literature. After quality assessment, 31 studies were included in this review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses methodology and the population, intervention, comparison and outcome scheme were used. We included human-controlled trials that evaluate the current treatment for HRS. Two authors independently screened articles for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies.

Results

This study investigated the studies conducted on the effects of different treatments on follow-up of HRS patients. We gathered 440 articles, so 31 articles remained in our study. Of which 24 articles were conducted on terlipressin versus placebo or other treatments (midodrine/octreotide, norepinephrine, etc) that showed the higher rate of HRS reversal was detected for terlipressin in 17 studies (10 of them were significant), 2 studies achieved an insignificant lower rate of the model for end-stage liver disease score for terlipressin, 15 studies showed a decreased mortality rate in the terlipressin group (4 of them were significant).

Conclusion

This review showed that terlipressin has a significantly higher reversal rate of HRS than the other treatments. Even the results showed that terlipressin is more efficient than midodrine/octreotide and norepinephrine as a previous medication, in reverse HRS, increasing patient survival.

### Hepatorenal syndrome type 1: diagnosis and treatment [^fe9c13aa]. Advances in Kidney Disease and Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a feared complication in patients with advanced cirrhosis and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. While recognized as a distinct physiologic condition for well over one hundred years, a lack of objective diagnostic tests has made the diagnosis one of exclusion. Since 1979, multiple sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed. Though varying in detail, the principal intent of these criteria is to identify patients with severe, functional acute kidney injury that is unresponsive to volume resuscitation and exclude those with structural injury. However, accurate differential diagnosis remains challenging. Recently, multiple urinary biomarkers of kidney injury, including neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, have been studied as a means of objectively phenotyping etiologies of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis. Along with markers reflecting tubular functional integrity, including the fractional excretion of sodium, injury markers will likely be incorporated into future diagnostic criteria. Making an accurate diagnosis is critical, as therapeutic options exist for HRS but must be given in a timely manner and only to those patients likely to benefit. Terlipressin, an analog of vasopressin, is the first line of therapy for HRS in much of the world and has recently been approved for use in the United States. Significant questions remain regarding the optimal dosing strategy, metrics for titration, and the potential role of point-of-care ultrasound to help guide concurrent albumin administration.

### Novel predictors of response to therapy with terlipressin and albumin in hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury [^ef285591]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is defined as renal failure developing in patients with advanced cirrhosis of the liver, in the absence of significant structural abnormalities in the kidneys, due to vasoconstriction of the renal circulation. There are 2 types of HRS: (i) HRS with acute kidney injury (AKI; earlier called Type 1 HRS), characterized by a rapidly progressive impairment in renal function, associated with high mortality but with a potential for reversibility. The most common precipitants for HRS-AKI are bacterial infections, followed by drugs, gastrointestinal bleeding and severe alcoholic hepatitis; and (ii) HRS-non-AKI (earlier called Type 2 HRS), characterized by a moderate renal impairment with a progressive course that steadily evolves over weeks to months. HRS-non-AKI is further subclassified as HRS-acute kidney disease (renal dysfunction lasting for less than 3 months but not meeting the AKI criteria) and HRS-chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² for > 3 months).

The pathogenesis of HRS involves marked splanchnic vasodilatation due to portal hypertension and activation of systemic vasoconstrictors, both of which result in a significant reduction in the effective circulating blood volume and lead to marked impairment of renal blood flow.

Untreated HRS-AKI has an extremely dismal prognosis, with a median survival of weeks to months. The transplant-free survival can, however, be improved by the identification and removal of the precipitating factor of AKI and appropriate pharmacologic treatment. Various studies have shown that the best available pharmacologic therapy for HRS is a combination of intravenous terlipressin (splanchnic vasoconstrictor) and intravenous albumin. Terlipressin counteracts the splanchnic arterial vasodilatation, while albumin is a volume expander that further improves effective circulating volume and cardiac contractility. The safety and efficacy of terlipressin in patients with HRS-AKI have previously been evaluated in randomized trials, with response rates varying from 40–60%. A meta-analysis of clinical trials found that the pooled rate of patients with a complete response to terlipressin and albumin was 52%. In view of the modest rates of response to pharmacologic therapy, it is crucial to identify those patients with a low likelihood of treatment response early in the course, so that they can be offered other modalities of treatment, and workup for liver transplantation can be expedited.

Terlipressin

Wong et al investigated the effect of terlipressin (0.5 mg intravenous/5.5–6.5 hours) over 14 days on HRS 1 patients. HRS reversal was 39.1% in the treatment and 17.8% in the control group (p < 0.001). Mortality at 3 months of follow-up was 50.7% compared with 44.5% in the control group. The MELD score in the treatment and control groups was 32.7 ± 6.6 and 33.1 ± 6.2, respectively. Sanyal et al investigated the effect of terlipressin (1–2 mg intravenous/6 hours) over 14 days on HRS 1 patients. The HRS reversal was 27.4% in the treatment group vs 14.1% in the control group (p = 0.004). Mortality at 3 months of follow-up was 47.0% vs 50.3% in the control group (p = 0.716). The MELD score in the treated and control groups was 33.4 ± 6.1 and 32.9 ± 5.8, respectively (p < 0.001). Boyer et al evaluated the effects of terlipressin (1 mg intravenous/6 hour) for 14 days on HRS 1 patients. HRS reversal was 23.7% in terlipressin vs 15.1% in another group (p = 0.130). The mortality rate after 3 months of follow-up was 41.2% compared with 43.4% in the control group (p < 0.001). The MELD scores in the treatment and control groups were 33.5 ± 6.2 and 32.6 ± 5.5, respectively (p = 0.36). Zafar et al evaluated the effects of terlipressin (1 mg intravenous/4 hours) for 7–10 days on HRS types 1 and 2 patients. HRS reversal was 40.0% in the trial compared with 16.0% in the other group (p < 0.05). The mortality rate after 3 months of follow-up was 76.0% compared with 80.0% in the control group (p > 0.05). MELD scores were not provided in this study. Llahi et al studied the effect of terlipressin (1–2 mg intravenous/6 hours) over 15 days on HRS types 1 and 2 patients. The HRS reversal was 43.4% in the treatment group vs 8.6% in the control group (p = 0.017). Mortality at 3 months of follow-up was 73.9% vs 82.6% in the control group (p = 0.7). The MELD score in the treated and control groups was 30.0 ± 9.0 and 28.0 ± 8.0, respectively (p = 0.001). Neri et al investigated the effect of terlipressin (0.5–1 mg intravenous/8 hours) over 14 days on HRS 1 patients. The HRS reversal was 7.6% in the treatment group vs 0.0% in the control group (p < 0.001). Mortality after 3 months of follow-up was 50.0% compared with 84.6% in the control group (p < 0.0001). The MELD score was not reported in this study. Solanki et al evaluated the effects of terlipressin (1 mg intravenous/12 hours) for 15 days on HRS 1 patients. The mortality rate after 15 days of follow-up was 58.3% compared with 100% in the control group (p < 0.05). This study did not provide MELD score and HRS reversal.von Kalckreuth et al examined the effect of increasing the terlipressin dose. HRS types 1 and 2 patients received terlipressin (intravenous bolus of 1 mg/6 hours), and after 72 hours of not responding to treatment, the dose doubled. Response was defined as serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dL. This study showed terlipressin is effective in more than two-thirds of HRS patients (p < 0.01). Prolonging treatment beyond 7 days up to 20 days may increase response rates. Cavallin et al investigated the effect of a continuous terlipressin infusion (2–12 mg intravenous/24 hours) compared with a bolus (0.5–2 mg intravenous/4 hour) over 15 days on HRS 1 patient. HRS reversal was 55.8% in the continuous infusion group vs 18%.9% in the bolus group (p > 0.05). Mortality at 3 months of follow-up was 55.8% in the continuous infusion group vs 29.7% in the bolus group (p < 0.001). The MELD score in the continuous infusion and bolus group was 29.26 ± 7.8 and 29.8 ± 6.4, respectively (p > 0.05). Mujtaba et al reported that in type-1 HRS patients HRS reversal was almost two times higher in terlipressin-treated patients compared with placebo (31.5% vs 16.7%; p = 0.143), Overall survival through day 90 was similar in both study groups (p = 0.538); 55.6% patients in the terlipressin and 52.8% in the placebo group died through 90 days.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of hepatorenal syndrome: insights into HRS-AKI and liver transplantation [^c79ece2c]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury (HRS-AKI), accurate and early diagnosis is crucial. HRS is a severe condition seen in advanced cirrhosis, requiring prompt recognition and proper management to enhance patient outcomes. Diagnosis of HRS-AKI relies on serum creatinine elevations, similar to other AKI cases in cirrhosis. However, distinguishing HRS-AKI from other renal impairments in these patients can be challenging. Biomarkers and clinical criteria aid in diagnosis and guide treatment. The management of HRS-AKI initially involves improving the haemodynamic profile using albumin and vasoconstrictors like terlipressin, a synthetic vasopressin analogue. Despite some reports linking terlipressin to increased adverse events compared with norepinephrine, it remains the preferred choice in HRS-AKI and acute-on-chronic liver failure due to its faster, stronger response and improved survival. Additional therapies like midodrine (alpha-1 adrenergic agonist), octreotide (somatostatin analogue) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt are proposed as adjuvant treatments for HRS-AKI, aiming to improve vasoconstriction and renal blood flow. However, these adjunctive therapies cannot replace the definitive treatment for HRS-AKI — liver transplantation (LT). In cases unresponsive to medical management, LT is the only option to restore liver function and improve renal outcomes. Current evidence favours combined liver and kidney transplantation (CLKT) in certain situations. This review aims to evaluate the present evidence and recommendations on AKI in patients with cirrhosis, the pathophysiology of HRS-AKI, different treatments and indications for LT and CLKT. Understanding the complexities of managing HRS-AKI is crucial for optimising patient care and achieving better outcomes in this challenging clinical setting.

Renal Replacement Therapy

Renal replacement therapy (RRT) is a temporary option to potentially bridge the limited number of eligible LT candidates with HRS‐AKI to transplantation. Associated risks and poor outcomes, however, make RRT a suboptimal solution for such patients. RRT in patients who are critically ill is complicated by high morbidity and mortality rates. Survival with RRT in patients with end‐stage liver disease presenting with HRS‐AKI is short, and the overall benefit is not well documented. In LT candidates, a 59% mortality rate in patients requiring > 7 days of in‐hospital continuous RRT has been observed.

Patients with RRT are also at risk for general acute complications, such as intradialytic hypotension, increased risk of cardiac events, and complications related to venous access (including bleeding and infections). Patients with decompensated cirrhosis present additional physiologic challenges that impair adequate volume management during RRT. Portal hypertension and splanchnic vasodilation result in decreased effective circulating volume and low mean arterial pressure; both impact volume management. Continuous RRT involves intensive care unit (ICU) care, immobilization, anticoagulation, and subsequent bleeding risks. Intermittent RRT is complicated by hemodynamic instability attributed to rapid fluid and solute shifts, resulting in intradialytic hypotension and cerebral edema.

Although HRS‐AKI is thought to be reversible with LT, post‐LT renal function may be adversely affected. Data indicate that the longer patients are maintained on RRT while awaiting transplantation, the higher the risk of nonrecovery of renal function after LT. In 1041 LT recipients on RRT at the time of transplantation, 707 recipients (67.9%) had spontaneous recovery of renal function after LT. Patients who recovered spontaneously had a significantly shorter course of RRT in the pretransplant time period (15.6 versus 36.6 days; P < 0.001). Recovery of renal function was observed in 70.8% and 11.5% of recipients on RRT for < 30 days and > 90 days, respectively. In another study, 2112 adult transplantation recipients who received acute RRT for ≤ 90 days before LT were assessed. The adjusted renal nonrecovery risk increased by 3.6% per day of pretransplantation RRT (P < 0.001). According to the United Network for Organ Sharing criteria, if patients require dialysis for ≥ 6 weeks before LT, they are candidates for simultaneous kidney/LT because of this risk of renal nonrecovery.

### AGA clinical practice update on the evaluation and management of acute kidney injury in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^e0724599]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Terlipressin — efficacy, dosing, predictors, and safety in hepatorenal syndrome are summarized as follows: there have been 4 randomized controlled trials, 1 in Europe and 3 in North America, totaling 646 patients, comparing the efficacy of terlipressin combined with albumin vs placebo with albumin in reversing HRS, with response rates between 36% and 44%. Approximately 25% of patients in the European study were diagnosed with the previous definition of type 2 HRS, there was no difference in the overall survival or transplant-free survival between the terlipressin and placebo groups, and in the most recent United States and Canada study, 29% of patients reversed their HRS and survived for an additional 10 days after completion of treatment without the need for renal replacement therapy. Terlipressin is usually administered as intravenous bolus doses at 1–2 mg every 6 hours for up to 14 days but is discontinued if there is no response on day 3 or 4; continuous infusion has similar efficacy with lower total daily dose and fewer side effects. Predictors of response include a baseline bilirubin of < 10 mg/dL, a baseline serum creatinine of < 5 mg/dL, and a sustained increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 5–10 mm Hg. Patients on terlipressin need to be monitored for the development of ischemic complications such as arrhythmia, angina, and splanchnic and digital ischemia, and terlipressin should not be resumed in patients who experience cardiac or ischemic symptoms, even if the symptoms have subsided following discontinuation of treatment.

### Impact of liver transplantation on the survival of patients treated for hepatorenal syndrome type 1 [^8994adfc]. Liver Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

The development of hepatorenal syndrome type 1 (HRS1) is associated with a poor prognosis. Liver transplantation improves this prognosis, but the degree of the improvement is unclear. Most patients receive vasoconstrictors such as terlipressin before transplantation, and this may affect the posttransplant outcomes. We examined a cohort of patients with access to liver transplantation from our previously published study of terlipressin plus albumin versus albumin alone in the treatment of HRS1. The purpose of this analysis was the quantification of the survival benefits of liver transplantation for patients with HRS1. Ninety-nine patients were randomized to terlipressin or placebo. Thirty-five patients (35%) received a liver transplant. Among those receiving terlipressin plus albumin, the 180-day survival rates were 100% for transplant patients and 34% for nontransplant patients; among those receiving only albumin, the rates were 94% for transplant patients and 17% for nontransplant patients. The survival rate was significantly better for those achieving a reversal of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) versus those not achieving a reversal (47% versus 4%, P < 0.001), but it was significantly lower for the responders versus those undergoing liver transplantation (97%). We conclude that the use of terlipressin plus albumin has no significant impact on posttransplant survival. Liver transplantation offers a clear survival benefit to HRS1 patients regardless of the therapy that they receive or the success or failure of HRS reversal. The most likely benefit of terlipressin in patients undergoing liver transplantation for HRS1 is improved pretransplant renal function, and this should make the posttransplant management of this difficult group of patients easier. For patients not undergoing transplantation, HRS reversal with terlipressin and/or albumin improves survival.

### Practice guidance for the use of terlipressin for liver cirrhosis-related complications [^2815b989]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Liver cirrhosis is the 11th most common cause of death and, together with liver cancer, accounts for 3.5% of all deaths worldwide. It imposes a substantial health burden on many countries. There were 10.6 million cases of decompensated cirrhosis and 112 million cases of compensated cirrhosis globally in 2017. Ascites, gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) are common complications of liver cirrhosis, – which are mainly secondary to increased portal pressure, hyperdynamic circulatory state, – and systemic inflammation. Terlipressin is widely used for the management of gastroesophageal variceal bleeding and HRS. However, its optimal dosage and duration, timing of drug withdrawal, and monitoring and management of adverse events remain controversial.

### Terlipressin is superior to noradrenaline in the management of acute kidney injury in acute on chronic liver failure [^d4d3badc]. Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) carries a high short-term mortality in patients with cirrhosis and acute on chronic liver failure (ACLF). Terlipressin and noradrenaline are routinely used in cirrhosis with HRS and have been found to be equally effective. There are no data comparing the efficacy of terlipressin with noradrenaline in ACLF patients with HRS. In an open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT), consecutive patients with ACLF diagnosed with HRS acute kidney injury (AKI) were randomized to albumin with infusion of terlipressin (2–12 mg/day; n = 60) or noradrenaline (0.5–3.0 mg/h; n = 60). Response to treatment, course of AKI, and outcome were studied. Baseline characteristics, including AKI stage and sepsis-related HRS-AKI, were comparable between groups. Compared to noradrenaline, terlipressin achieved greater day 4 (26.1% vs. 11.7%; P = 0.03) and day 7 (41.7% vs. 20%; P = 0.01) response. Reversal of HRS was also better with terlipressin (40% vs. 16.7%; P = 0.004), with a significant reduction in the requirement of renal replacement therapy (RRT; 56.6% vs. 80%; P = 0.006) and improved 28-day survival (48.3% vs. 20%; P = 0.001). Adverse events limiting use of drugs were higher with terlipressin than noradrenaline (23.3% vs. 8.3%; P = 0.02), but were reversible. On multivariate analysis, high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD; odds ratio [OR], 1.10; confidence interval [CI] = 1.009–1.20; P = 0.03) and noradrenaline compared to terlipressin (OR, 3.05; CI = 1.27–7.33; P = 0.01) predicted nonresponse to therapy. Use of noradrenaline compared to terlipressin was also predictive of higher mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; CI = 1.32–3.30; P = 0.002). Conclusion: AKI in ACLF carries a high mortality. Infusion of terlipressin gives earlier and higher response than noradrenaline, with improved survival in ACLF patients with HRS-AKI.

### An open label, pilot, randomized controlled trial of noradrenaline versus terlipressin in the treatment of type 1 hepatorenal syndrome and predictors of response [^4768e14f]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is characterized by functional renal failure in end-stage liver disease. Terlipressin is the drug of choice for treating type 1 HRS (HRS-1). It is expensive and often not readily available. We, in an open label, randomized, pilot trial, compared the efficacy of terlipressin and noradrenaline on the renal functions and clinical outcome of patients with HRS-1 and also sought predictors of response. PATIENTS AND Forty consecutive patients with HRS-1 were randomized to receive noradrenaline 0.5–3.0 mg/h and

Methods

albumin (group A, N = 20) or terlipressin 0.5–2 mg, 6 hourly and albumin (group B, N = 20), until reversal of HRS (primary end point) or completion of 15 days of therapy (secondary end point). Systemic and renal parameters were monitored. Baseline parameters and delta creatinine at day 4 (DCD4) were used to predict response.

Results

The two groups were comparable at baseline. At similar time points, 10 (50%) patients in each group achieved primary end points. Patients in both groups had a significant (P < 0.05) decrease in serum creatinine from baseline (group A day 4 2.4 ± 1.2 mg/dL, day 8 1.6 ± 1.2 mg/dL, and day 15 1.0 ± 0.4 mg/dL; group B day 4 2.5 ± 1.5 mg/dL, day 8 1.8 ± 0.9 mg/dL, and day 15 1.2 ± 0.5 mg/dL) and progressive increase in creatinine clearance (group A day 4 26.5 ± 12.8 mL/min and day 15 59.8 ± 14.2 mL/min; group B day 4 31.4 ± 21.4 mL/min and day 15 54.9 ± 27.5 mL/min, P < 0.05). Median baseline plasma renin activity was reduced from 38.0 and 42.0 ng/mL/h to 3.0 and 8.0 ng/mL/h (P = 0.08) in groups A and B, respectively. Mean arterial BP and urine output significantly increased in both groups with therapy. Eleven (55%) patients in group A (10 responders) and an equal number in group B (8 responders) survived until day 15 (P = 0.798). Reversible cardiac ischemia was seen in one patient in each group. Noradrenaline therapy was significantly less expensive than terlipressin. On univariate analysis, the following baseline parameters predicted response to therapy: lower grade of encephalopathy, lower MELD score, higher creatinine clearance, higher mean arterial pressure (MAP), and lower plasma renin activity. However, on multivariate analysis only baseline creatinine clearance, MAP, and plasma renin activity were independent predictors of response. At day 4 of therapy, DCD4 was computed and a value of 0.15 mg/dL/day or more accurately predicted response. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for DCD4 0.15 mg/dL/day for predicting response to therapy were 90%, 75%, 78%, and 88%, respectively.

Conclusions

Noradrenaline may be an effective and safe alternative to terlipressin in improving renal functions. Various baseline parameters and DCD4 can be used to predict response to therapy.

### Noradrenalin vs terlipressin in patients with hepatorenal syndrome: a prospective, randomized, unblinded, pilot study [^8ed629f7]. Journal of Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Treatment of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is based on vasoconstrictors. Terlipressin is the one with the soundest evidence. Noradrenalin has been suggested as an effective alternative. The current study was aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of noradrenalin vs terlipressin in patients with HRS.

Methods

Twenty-two consecutive cirrhotic patients with HRS (9 with HRS type 1; 13 with HRS type 2) were included. Patients were randomly assigned to be treated with noradrenalin (0.1–0.7 microg/kg/min) and albumin (10 patients) or with terlipressin (1–2 mg/4h) and albumin (12 patients). Treatment was administered until HRS reversal or for a maximum of two weeks. Patients were followed-up until liver transplantation or death.

Results

Reversal of HRS was observed in 7 of the 10 patients (70%) treated with noradrenalin and in 10 of the 12 patients (83%) treated with terlipressin, p = ns. Treatment led in both groups to a significant improvement in renal and circulatory function. No patient developed signs of myocardial ischemia.

Conclusions

Data from this unblinded, pilot study suggest that noradrenalin is as effective and safe as terlipressin in patients with HRS. These results would support the use of noradrenalin, a cheap and widely available drug, in the management of these patients.

### Noradrenaline vs. terlipressin in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome: a randomized study [^cf76b7f8]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Various vasoconstrictors are useful in the management of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Terlipressin is the drug of choice; however, it is expensive. In this study, we evaluated safety and efficacy of terlipressin and noradrenaline in the treatment of HRS.

Methods

Forty-six patients with HRS type 1 were managed with terlipressin (group A, N = 23) or noradrenaline (Group B, N = 23) with albumin in a randomized controlled trial at a tertiary center.

Results

HRS reversal could be achieved in 9 (39.1%) patients in group A and 10 (43.4%) patients in group B (p = 0.764). Univariate analysis showed baseline Child Turcotte Pugh score (CTP), model of end stage liver disease (MELD), urine output on day 1(D1), albumin, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were associated with response. However, on multivariate analysis only CTP score was associated with response. Fourteen patients in group A and 12 in group B died at day 15 (p > 0.05). Noradrenaline was less expensive than terlipressin (p < 0.05). No major adverse effects were seen.

Conclusions

The results of this randomized study suggest that noradrenaline is as safe and effective as terlipressin, but less expensive in the treatment of HRS and baseline CTP score is predictive of response.

### Current pharmacologic therapies for hepatorenal syndrome-acute kidney injury [^d99a62b8]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) can occur in patients with cirrhosis and ascites due to splanchnic vasodilation, renal hypoperfusion, and vasoconstriction. HRS is a diagnosis of exclusion and portends a poor prognosis, with upward of 80% mortality at 2 weeks without treatment. This review will highlight randomized controlled trials for HRS pharmacotherapy.

Methods

A PubMed review of randomized controlled trials conducted over the past 25 years was undertaken; 18 studies were included.

Results

Initial studies showed that norepinephrine is as effective as terlipressin for HRS reversal. Midodrine with octreotide and albumin is less effective than terlipressin but better than albumin alone at improving 30-day mortality. Recently, terlipressin with albumin led to significantly higher rates of HRS reversal compared to albumin alone. Non-response to terlipressin can predict 90-day mortality in acute-on-chronic-liver failure.

Conclusions

Our current understanding of HRS treatment is improved by recent randomized clinical trials. Previous studies using varying medication doses along with the "old" definition of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS type 1) rather than HRS-AKI means that there is still a need for future multicenter prospective studies further refining the risk-benefit ratio of vasoconstrictors for HRS-AKI patients. The Food and Drug Administration has approved terlipressin for use in September 2022. Because it will take time to adapt into clinical practice, less cost-prohibitive vasoconstrictors should still be considered. Opportunities also exist to clarify the safety, timing of initiation, as well as possible discontinuation of terlipressin.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^1752247c]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a serious form of renal dysfunction in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. It is an important component of the acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) syndrome. Significant recent changes in the understanding of the pathophysiology of renal dysfunction in cirrhosis include the role of inflammation in addition to hemodynamic changes. The term acute kidney injury (AKI) is now adopted to include all functional and structural forms of acute renal dysfunction in cirrhosis, with various stages describing the severity of the condition. Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS1) is renamed HRS-AKI, which is stage 2 AKI [doubling of baseline serum creatinine (sCr)] while fulfilling all other criteria of HRS1. Albumin is used for its volume expanding and anti-inflammatory properties to confirm the diagnosis of HRS-AKI. Vasoconstrictors are added to albumin as pharmacotherapy to improve the hemodynamics. Terlipressin, although not yet available in North America, is the most common vasoconstrictor used worldwide. Patients with high grade of ACLF treated with terlipressin are at risk for respiratory failure if there is pretreatment respiratory compromise. Norepinephrine is equally effective as terlipressin in reversing HRS1. Recent data show that norepinephrine may be administered outside the intensive care setting, but close monitoring is still required. There has been no improvement in overall or transplant-free survival shown with vasoconstrictor use, but response to vasoconstrictors with reduction in sCr is associated with improvement in survival. Non-responders to vasoconstrictor plus albumin will need liver transplantation as definite treatment with renal replacement therapy as a bridge therapy. Combined liver and kidney transplantation is recommended for patients with prolonged history of AKI, underlying chronic kidney disease or with hereditary renal conditions. Future developments, such as the use of biomarkers and metabolomics, may help to identify at risk patients with earlier diagnosis to allow for earlier treatment with improved outcomes.

### Terlipressin versus noradrenaline in the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome: systematic review with meta-analysis and full economic evaluation [^62476b43]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and costs of terlipressin and noradrenaline for the treatment of hepatorenal syndrome from the perspective of the Brazilian public health system and that of a major private health insurance.

Methods

Comparison of efficacy was performed through a systematic review with a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials using a random-effects model. Economic evaluation was carried out through cost minimization.

Results

Four studies (154 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no evidence of a difference between treatments with terlipressin or noradrenaline in terms of 30-day survival (risk ratio = 1.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.84–1.30, P = 0.70). From the perspective of the public health system, costs of the treatments with terlipressin or noradrenaline were Int$7437.04 and Int$8406.41, respectively. From the perspective of the private health insurance, costs of treatments with terlipressin and noradrenaline were Int$13,484.57 and Int$15,061.01, respectively.

Conclusion

There was no evidence of superiority between treatment strategies using terlipressin or noradrenaline in terms of the survival of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, but the strategy using terlipressin was more economical under two different perspectives.

### Terlipressin in combined hepatorenal syndrome in patients with signs of chronic renal disease (terli-CKD) [^c16b448b]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome refers to a "functional" renal dysfunction that occurs in patients with cirrhosis and ascites due to reduced renal perfusion secondary to hemodynamic alterations in the arterial circulation and activation of endogenous vasoactive system. Traditionally, one distinguished between hepatorenal syndrome type 1, which was a rapidly progressive renal failure to greater than 2. 5 mg/dL within two weeks) or hepatorenal syndrome type 2, which has a less rapid course, with a progressive increase of SCr to greater than

1. 5 mg/dL. The diagnosis of HRS-AKI is based on ruling out other causes of AKI, mainly hypovolemia, ongoing infection, nephrotoxic medications, and intrinsic renal disease.

Nevertheless, with the increasing incidence of MASLD patients frequently have associated metabolic conditions which can lead to chronic renal injury and chronic kidney disease independent of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the treatment response to vasoactive therapy in patients who do not fulfill the criteria of hepatorenal syndrome due to the presence of signs of intrinsic nephropathy, but otherwise have a high suspicion of HRS-AKI. It is expected, that physicians considered the presence of a HRS-AKI-like syndrome as the dominating cause of AKI and a high proportion of patients were treated with terlipressin and albumin according to clinical practice.

The secondary aims include the evaluation of 3-month, 6-month and 12-month survival rate, the improvement of renal function at different time-points, the in-hospital mortality and duration of hospital stay as well as the need of renal replacement therapy, the need of LT during follow-up and the development of cirrhosis complications and acute-on-chronic liver failure. Drug: terlipressin or noradrenalin plus albumin
- Terli-CKD.
- Patients with cirrhosis confirmed by histology or liver stiffness or with unequivocal signs in ultrasound, endoscopy and/or blood tests hospitalized between 1st of January 2018 and 31st of December 2022.
- Evidence of ascites due to portal hypertension
- Clinical suspicion of HRS-AKI or HRS-AKI-like syndrome.

### Advances in the diagnosis and management of hepatorenal syndrome: insights into HRS-AKI and liver transplantation [^430c089e]. Egastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The administration of terlipressin by continuous intravenous infusion is better tolerated, associated with fewer adverse effects, and more effective at lower doses compared with bolus administration. Adverse events related to terlipressin use are abdominal pain with or without intestinal ischemia, peripheral ischemia, arterial hypertension, volume overload, pulmonary oedema, hyponatraemia, angina pectoris, arrhythmias, upper gastrointestinal symptoms and diarrhoea.

Recently, in the CONFIRM trial, terlipressin combined with albumin reversed HRS-AKI in 32% of patients, defined as two consecutive sCr measurements of 1.5 mg/dL or less without RRT. At 90 days, LT had been performed in 23% in the terlipressin group, and 29% in the placebo group, while death occurred in 51% and 45%, respectively. The proportion of HRS-AKI patients needing RRT after LT was significantly lower in the terlipressin and albumin arm compared with placebo (19.6% vs 44.8%, p = 0.04). The trial also revealed worrisome findings regarding increased rates of respiratory failure and related infectious complications, in addition to the known risk of precipitating ischaemic events. The CONFIRM study presents several important considerations. The majority (83%) of patients treated with terlipressin received high doses of albumin both before and after randomisation, with mean total doses ranging from 500 to 600 g. This was attributed to the advanced stage of HRS, as patients with creatinine levels greater than 2.25 mg/dL were included in the study. Additionally, terlipressin bolus administration was employed. These factors likely influenced the occurrence of pulmonary oedema and ultimately led to respiratory failure. These severe adverse effects were predominantly observed in patients with risk factors such as ischaemic heart disease, ACLF 3, and sCR levels exceeding 5 mg/dL. Consequently, the use of this drug is not recommended, particularly if sCr levels exceed 5 mg/dL.

Hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis

Guidance Statement 4. Terlipressin is recommended for the treatment of type-1 hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis.

HRS, a functional renal failure, is related to a reduction of effective arterial blood volume and mean arterial pressure (MAP) caused by visceral vasodilation in liver cirrhosis, which can activate sympathetic nervous and renin–angiotensin–aldosterone systems. In addition, it is associated with increased synthesis of vasoactive mediators, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes, thromboxane-A2, F2-isoprostane, and endothelin-1, which affects renal blood flow or glomerular microcirculation. Traditionally, HRS is classified into type 1 and type 2. Type 1 HRS is characterized by rapidly progressive renal failure with doubling of the initial serum creatinine concentration to a level greater than 226 mmol/L (i.e. 2.5 mg/dl) within 2 weeks. Type 2 HRS is characterized by steady or slowly progressive renal failure with a change of serum creatinine concentration from 133 to 226 mmol/L (i.e. from 1.5 to 2.5 mg/dl). In 2015, the International Club of Ascites (ICA) updated the definition of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with liver cirrhosis, which refers to an increase in serum creatinine concentration ⩾0.3 mg/dl (i.e. ⩾26.5 µmol/L) within 48 h, or a percentage increase in serum creatinine concentration ⩾50% from baseline which is known, or presumed, to have occurred within the prior 7 days. AKI is further classified as three stages. Stage 1: an increase in serum creatinine concentration ⩾0.3 mg/dl (i.e. 26.5 μmol/L) or an increase in serum creatinine concentration ⩾1.5 to 2-fold from baseline. Stage 2: an increase in serum creatinine concentration > 2- to 3-fold from baseline. Stage 3: an increase of serum creatinine concentration > 3-fold from baseline or serum creatinine concentration ⩾4.0 mg/dl (i.e. 353.6 μmol/L) with an acute increase ⩾0.3 mg/dl (i.e. 26.5 μmol/L) or initiation of renal replacement therapy. ICA further proposed the definition of HRS-AKI, which refers to the progression of AKI into stage 2 or 3 and meets the diagnostic criteria of HRS. Accordingly, HRS is divided into HRS-AKI (type 1 HRS) and HRS-NAKI (type 2 HRS). Even so, current evidence regarding terlipressin for the treatment of HRS is mostly based on traditional HRS classification.

### Terlipressin and albumin vs albumin in patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome: a randomized study [^9ff1895b]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatorenal syndrome is common in patients with advanced cirrhosis and constitutes a major problem in liver transplantation. There is no effective medical treatment for hepatorenal syndrome.

Methods

Forty-six patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome, hospitalized in a tertiary care center, were randomly assigned to receive either terlipressin (1–2 mg/4 hour, intravenously), a vasopressin analogue, and albumin (1 g/kg followed by 20–40 g/day) (n = 23) or albumin alone (n = 23) for a maximum of 15 days. Primary outcomes were improvement of renal function and survival at 3 months.

Results

Improvement of renal function occurred in 10 patients (43.5%) treated with terlipressin and albumin compared with 2 patients (8.7%) treated with albumin alone (P = 0.017). Independent predictive factors of improvement of renal function were baseline urine volume, serum creatinine and leukocyte count, and treatment with terlipressin and albumin. Survival at 3 months was not significantly different between the 2 groups (terlipressin and albumin: 27% vs albumin 19%, P = 0.7). Independent predictive factors of 3-month survival were baseline model for end-stage liver disease score and improvement of renal function. Cardiovascular complications occurred in 4 patients treated with albumin alone and in 10 patients treated with terlipressin and albumin, yet permanent terlipressin withdrawal was required in only 3 cases.

Conclusions

As compared with albumin, treatment with terlipressin and albumin is effective in improving renal function in patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome. Further studies with large sample sizes should be performed to test whether the improvement of renal function translates into a survival benefit.

Terlipressin

Therapy with systemic vasoactive agents and albumin is the current standard treatment of HRS-AKI. Terlipressin (triglycyl-lysine-vasopressin) is the synthetic analogue of vasopressin. It has up to six times greater affinity for the vascular receptor V1 than for the renal receptor V2, being less potent than vasopressin. Its action on the V1 receptors of thecauses vasoconstriction in both systemic and splanchnic circulations as well as intrahepatic vascular dilatation, thereby reducing intrahepatic resistance to portal inflow and thus improving the haemodynamic profile and GFRs of patients with HRS-AKI. Several clinical guidelines recommend a terlipressin dose of 2 mg every 4 hours given as an intravenous bolus over 2–5 days, or administration via continuous infusion. In an RCT conducted in Italy, a comparison was made between the use of bolus terlipressin and continuous infusion. The rate of adverse events was found to be lower in the infusion group (35.29%) compared with the bolus administration group (62.16%). Although the treatment response rate did not show a significant difference between the two groups (76.47% vs 64.85%; p value not significant), it is worth noting that the mean daily effective dose of terlipressin was lower in the infusion group, where terlipressin was administered continuously. Another recent study showed that low doses of terlipressin continuous infusion (4 mg in 24 hours for 5 days) are more effective than bolus administration in reducing HVPG at a lower dose with fewer adverse events. Usually, for continuous infusion of terlipressin, dilution of 1 mg in 50 mL of 5% glucose has been recommended. In other words, 4 mg can be diluted in 200–250 cc of 5% glucose. Considering a maximum daily dose of 120 to 150 µg/kg for 3–5 days. The immediate goal of therapy is to raise the mean arterial pressure (MAP) by approximately 10 to 15 mm Hg to a level of > 82 mm Hg, as this correlates with better renal outcomes. Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses showed that terlipressin was superior to placebo and octreotide for reversal of HRS and improving renal function, but non-superior compared with norepinephrine, with a rate of response of 50%–76.4%.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome in liver cirrhosis: a recent update [^fb923507]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

HRS-AKI is a form of AKI in cirrhosis. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. Recent changes in diagnostic criteria means that HRS-AKI can now be diagnosed at a lower level of sCr, thereby allowing earlier institution of treatment. Vasoconstrictors are the mainstay of treatment with terlipressin being the most commonly used worldwide, but terlipressin is not yet available in most parts of North America. Vasoconstrictors are usually given in conjunction with albumin, but care needs to be taken not to overdose patients with albumin. This is because albumin increases the cardiac preload by improving the volume status of the patients, whereas vasoconstrictors by increasing the afterload may cause cardiac failure with pulmonary edema in these patients. Timely assessment for liver transplant is necessary, as these patients still have a high mortality rate despite response to pharmacotherapy because of their advanced liver dysfunction. RRT may be used as a bridging therapy, but patients should not be maintained on long-term RRT while waiting for a liver transplant, as this has a negative impact on post-transplant patient outcomes including non-reversal of HRS. Combined liver kidney transplant should be considered for patients with underlying CKD or with prolonged pre-transplant RRT. The future will see the availability of new techniques and biomarkers to identify the susceptibility for HRS development, progression of HRS, and response to treatment. This will allow for personalized targeted treatment to improve patient outcomes.

### Use of terlipressin in critically ill children with liver disease [^759fe6fc]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Role in hepatorenal syndrome (HRS-AKI)

There was an improvement in urine output and serum creatinine after terlipressin administration, but the difference between the groups was not significant (Table 3 and Fig. 2). Both groups reported adverse effects (2 episodes of digital ischemia in non HRS group, and I episode of feeding intolerance in HRS group). Of the 7 patients with HRS, 5 responded with a decrease in serum creatinine at 48 h (response rate of 71.4%) whereas of the 9 patients with shock and on inotropes, only 4 responded with decrease in serum creatinine and increase of urine output (response rate of 33.3%).

Terlipressin dose

In our case series, the drug was initially given as a bolus dose in all cases, followed by either bolus or infusion. Doses are hence expressed as mcg/kg/hour, to account for this difference. Most administrations were as bolus doses of 1 mg (0.5–2 mg) at the start of drug use.

The average duration of bolus use was 40 h (0–60), with median of 5 boluses (range: 1–44) received. The median dose (IQR) used was 5.2(3.8–6.7 mcg/kg/hr). In HRS-AKI we used terlipressin at the dose of 5.2 (4.5–6.4) (IQR) mcg/kg/hr.

Outcome

Of the 16 patients, 7 patients died, mortality of 47.5%. Of these, 2 patients had HRS-AKI, giving a mortality of 28.5% to this group. There was no statistical difference in urine output, creatinine and mean arterial pressure, between the survivors and non-survivors. Multiple causes contributed to this mortality - gastrointestinal bleeding (in 4 patients), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (in 6 patients) and sepsis (in 2 patients).

et al, 60 patients with type 1 HRS were randomised to receive either terlipressin (started at 2 mg/day and increased by 1 mg/day) or a combination of terlipressin and norepinephrine infusion (a constant dose of terlipressin 2 mg/day and norepinephrine infusion started at 0.5 mg/hour and increased to 3 mg/hour) at 15 days. There was no significant difference in the response rate between the groups (50% vs 76.7%, p = 0.06). In addition, 30-day survival was similar (36.7% vs 53.3%, p = 0.13).

Terlipressin compared with dopamine

Silawat et al evaluated the efficacy of terlipressin (0.5–2 mg intravenous/12 hours) compared with dopamine (4 µg/min) in non-specified HRS patients. HRS reversal was 66.6% in the terlipressin vs 33.3% in the dopamine group (p > 0.05). Mortality at maximum follow-up was 20.0% in the terlipressin group compared with 26.6% in the dopamine group (p = 0.02). This study did not provide MELD scores or the duration of treatment.

Terlipressin compared with dopamine and furosemide

Srivastava et al investigated the effect of terlipressin (0.5 mg intravenous/6 hours) against dopamine (2 µg/kg/min) and furosemide (0.01 mg/kg/hour) for 5 days on HRS types 1 and 2 patients. Significantly more patients in the terlipressin group achieved HRS reversal than the placebo group (33.9% vs 12.5%; p = 0.008), mortality at 1 month of follow-up was 77.5% vs 80.0% in the dopamine and furosemide groups (p > 0.200). MELD score was not reported.

With regard to AEs in the CONFIRM trial, more patients in the terlipressin group experienced abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea as well as respiratory failure (14%) than in the placebo group (5%). The higher incidence of respiratory failure and acute respiratory failure in the terlipressin group is possibly related to the known cardiovascular and pulmonary effects of terlipressin and increased preload from aggressive hydration with albumin. A total of 9 patients (4.5%) in the terlipressin group died during the treatment period versus 1 (1%) in the placebo group; the most common cause of death during the treatment period was respiratory failure (3% for terlipressin and none for placebo). Furthermore, patients in the terlipressin group were more likely to develop respiratory failure and die from respiratory disorders within 90 days (11% versus 2%), which likely contributed to the observed mortality difference.

Pharmacologic Therapy

Currently, there are no approved medications for treating HRS‐AKI in the United States. Therapeutic alternatives are needed for the minority of patients who are critically ill and awaiting LT and the majority of patients who are ineligible for LT. At present, the mainstay of pharmacologic therapy consists of plasma expanders to increase intravascular volume and, in combination with vasoconstrictors, reverse splanchnic vasodilatation. This is thought to improve the systemic circulation and increase arterial pressure, leading to increased renal perfusion pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and overall renal function.

Volume Expansion

Albumin is considered a crucial plasma expander for the treatment of HRS‐AKI. Albumin maintains or increases cardiac output even in the most advanced phases of liver disease. Preclinical studies indicate that albumin may also have anti‐inflammatory properties. However, in a recent study in the United Kingdom, during which 777 patients with cirrhosis were given the standard of care dose of albumin (median of 20 g/patient) or increased albumin (to a target of ≥ 30 g/L), albumin did not reduce the incidences of infection, kidney dysfunction, or death.

Vasoconstrictors

The vasoconstrictive component of treatment can occur via several mechanisms. Alpha‐adrenergic receptor agonists, including norepinephrine and midodrine, act by binding to alpha‐1‐adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasoconstriction. The somatostatin analog octreotide inhibits the release of glucagon and other vasodilator peptides, leading to vasoconstriction in splanchnic, portal, and systemic circulations. Vasopressin and vasopressin analogs (ornipressin, terlipressin) bind to V1 receptors of vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to vasoconstriction, mainly of the splanchnic circulation. Despite the lack of approved indications in HRS‐AKI by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), vasoconstrictors that are commonly administered with albumin in the United States include midodrine and octreotide. The adrenergic agonist norepinephrine is also used to treat HRS‐AKI, but its administration requires ICU care. Thus, it is often used in patients with severe HRS‐AKI. Terlipressin, a vasopressin analog, is commonly used in combination with albumin for HRS‐AKI management around the world but is currently unavailable in the United States.

### Pharmacological therapies for hepatorenal syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^924abef5]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a serious complication of advanced chronic liver disease. Different pharmacological therapies have variable efficacy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacy of various drugs in the treatment of HRS.

Study

Randomized controlled trials comparing active drug with placebo or comparing 2 different drugs were included in this analysis. Primary study outcome was reversal of HRS. Secondary outcomes were HRS relapse and patient survival. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with type 1 HRS.

Results

Thirteen randomized controlled trial were eligible for analysis. Terlipressin plus albumin was more efficacious than placebo plus albumin (odds ratio = 4.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.72–12.93; P = 0.003) or midodrine plus albumin and octreotide (odds ratio = 5.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.69–20.85; P = 0.005), for HRS reversal. However, no significant difference was noted comparing terlipressin plus albumin versus noradrenaline plus albumin, octreotide plus albumin versus placebo plus albumin or noradrenaline plus albumin versus midodrine plus albumin and octreotide. None of the comparisons showed difference on HRS relapse or patient survival. Subgroup analysis revealed that terlipressin was more effective than placebo for type 1 HRS reversal, but no significant differences were noted between any other comparisons, and none of the comparisons showed difference on HRS relapse or patient survival.

Conclusions

Intravenous infusion of terlipressin is the most effective medical therapy for reversing HRS. Intravenous infusion of noradrenaline is an acceptable alternative. Studies are needed as basis for developing pharmacological strategies to reduce relapse of HRS and improve patient survival.

### Management of hepatorenal syndrome and associated outcomes: a systematic reviews [^e740427e]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a type of acute kidney dysfunction in patients with advanced liver disease. Recent changes in the definition of HRS have caused it to be known in two ways: acute with acute kidney injury (AKI)-HRSand chronic with chronic kidney disease-HRS. AKI-HRS is characterised by a severe kidney function impairment due to vasoconstriction of renal arteries in the absence of significant abnormalities in kidney tissue. There are two types of HRS with different characteristics and prognoses. HRS type 1 is characterised by the sudden onset of acute kidney failure and the rapid deterioration of the function of other organs. HRS type 2 has slow and progressive deterioration of renal function due to cirrhosis and portal hypertension and is associated with refractory ascites.

Pathogenetic mechanisms include circulatory dysfunction due to dilation of splanchnic arterial vessels, which activates vasoconstrictor factors. A severe systemic inflammatory reaction is one of the main triggers of AKI-HRS.

The only definitive treatment for HRS is a liver transplant. There are controversial results about the administration of different pharmacological therapeutic regimens have been used, including octreotide/midodrine as traditional treatment, norepinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin and vasopressin analogues (ornipressin, terlipressin, etc). Administration of intravenous albumin is an established coadjuvant therapy.

This systematic review assesses the current treatment for HRS and discusses the challenges in deciding the most appropriate medication regimens. We have also evaluated the effect of different treatments on the follow-up of HRS patients.

### Terlipressin in patients with cirrhosis and type 1 hepatorenal syndrome: a retrospective multicenter study [^36b01647]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a severe complication of cirrhosis associated with a short median survival time (< 2 weeks). Although the administration of terlipressin improves renal function, its effect on survival is unknown. This study investigated predictive factors of survival in patients with type 1 HRS treated with terlipressin.

Methods

Ninety-nine patients with type 1 HRS treated with terlipressin in 24 centers were retrospectively studied. Terlipressin-induced improved renal function was defined as a decrease in serum creatinine value to < 130 micromol/L or a decrease of at least 20% at the end of treatment.

Results

At inclusion, the Child-Pugh score was 11.8 ± 1.6 (mean ± SD). Terlipressin (3.2 ± 1.3 mg/day) was administered for 11 ± 12 days. Renal function improved in 58% of patients (serum creatinine decreased by 46% ± 17% from 272 ± 114 micromol/L). Median survival time was 21 days. Survival rate was 40% at 1 month. Multivariate analysis showed that improved renal function and Child-Pugh score ≤ 11 at inclusion were independent predictive factors of survival (P < 0.0001 and 0.02, respectively). Thirteen patients underwent liver transplantation (92 ± 95 days after HRS onset), 10 of whom had received terlipressin and had had improved renal function.

Conclusions

This retrospective uncontrolled study shows that in patients with type 1 HRS, terlipressin-induced improved renal function is associated with an increase in survival. Thus, a randomized trial investigating the effect of terlipressin on survival in patients with type 1 HRS should be performed.
