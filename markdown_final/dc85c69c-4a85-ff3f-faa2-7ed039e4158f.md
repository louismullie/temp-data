Answer Choices:

D. thirty-eight molecules of ATP.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option correctly states the net ATP yield when one molecule of glucose is converted to two molecules of pyruvate via glycolysis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the stoichiometry of ATP-consuming and ATP-producing steps in glycolysis. Then, I should verify the net balance and ensure I'm not conflating glycolysis with downstream oxidative phosphorylation. Next, I will check the provided references to confirm the canonical net yield. Finally, I will compare the options and select the correct answer, correcting any common misconceptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the core stoichiometry. Glycolysis consumes 2 ATP in the preparatory phase (hexokinase and phosphofructokinase-1) and produces 4 ATP in the payoff phase (phosphoglycerate kinase and pyruvate kinase), yielding a net of 2 ATP per glucose molecule, along with 2 NADH and 2 pyruvate, and no net water production in glycolysis itself [^ec0ab872] [^98fd45b4].

> Wait, let me verify the net yield against authoritative sources. Multiple independent references consistently state that glycolysis converts glucose to two pyruvate with a net gain of 2 ATP, including mammalian embryogenesis studies, immunology reviews, and metabolism-focused papers, which aligns with the classic biochemistry teaching [^dfeec71f] [^7cfd760c] [^ec0ab872].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about total ATP from glucose. I initially thought "about 36–38 ATP" might be relevant, but that figure includes mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation after glycolysis, not the net ATP from glycolysis alone; the question is specifically about the conversion of glucose to pyruvate, so the correct net is 2 ATP, not 36–38 ATP [^44d61a3c] [^a72e0a67].

> I need to check the distractors carefully. Option A claims six water molecules, but glycolysis does not produce a net six water molecules; water is involved in some steps, but there is no net accumulation of six waters per glucose in glycolysis, so this is incorrect. Option C claims three ATP, which overstates the net yield by one ATP and does not match the canonical balance. Option D claims thirty-eight ATP, which reflects total aerobic ATP yield including the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, not glycolysis alone [^ec0ab872] [^44d61a3c].

> Let me reconsider the exact wording to ensure precision. The question asks for the net formation during the conversion of one glucose to two pyruvate, which is precisely glycolysis; the net ATP formed in that process is 2 ATP, with 2 NADH also generated and 2 pyruvate produced, and no net water formation attributable to glycolysis itself [^ec0ab872] [^dfeec71f].

> Conclusion: The correct answer is B, two molecules of ATP, because glycolysis consumes 2 ATP and produces 4 ATP for a net gain of 2 ATP per glucose converted to two pyruvate [^ec0ab872] [^dfeec71f].

---

The conversion of one molecule of glucose to two molecules of pyruvate by glycolysis yields a **net 2 ATP** per glucose, accounting for the ATP consumed in early steps and produced in later steps. Options A, C, and D are incorrect: water is not a net product, three ATP is not the net yield, and 38 ATP reflects total aerobic respiration, not glycolysis alone [^dfeec71f] [^ec0ab872].

---

## ATP yield in glycolysis

Glycolysis is a 10-step pathway that converts glucose to two pyruvate molecules, generating ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation. The **net ATP yield** is calculated as follows:

| **Step** | **Reaction** | **Atp change** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Glucose → Glucose-6-phosphate | -1 ATP |
| 3 | Fructose-6-phosphate → Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate | -1 ATP |
| 7 | 1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate → 3-Phosphoglycerate | +2 ATP (×2) |
| 10 | Phosphoenolpyruvate → Pyruvate | +2 ATP (×2) |

---

Total ATP produced: 4 ATP; total ATP consumed: 2 ATP; **net ATP yield**: 2 ATP per glucose [^ec0ab872] [^dfeec71f].

---

## Analysis of answer choices

- **Option A**: six molecules of water** — Incorrect. Water is not a net product of glycolysis; while water participates in some reactions, there is no net formation of six water molecules.
- **Option B**: two molecules of ATP** — Correct. This matches the net ATP yield from glycolysis [^ec0ab872] [^dfeec71f].
- **Option C**: three molecules of ATP** — Incorrect. This overestimates the net ATP yield; the correct net yield is 2 ATP.
- **Option D**: thirty-eight molecules of ATP** — Incorrect. This reflects the total ATP from complete aerobic respiration (glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation), not glycolysis alone [^44d61a3c] [a72e0a67].

---

## Conclusion

The conversion of one glucose molecule to two pyruvate molecules by glycolysis results in a **net formation of 2 ATP molecules**. Therefore, the correct answer is **B. two molecules of ATP** [^ec0ab872] [^dfeec71f].

Our network generates many alternative trunk pathways

Our network reveals a huge number of alternative pathways connecting G3P and pyruvate, which are consistent with the rules of biochemistry. Enumerating these alternatives, we find 2, 29, 555 and 5,859 pathways of length 3, 4, 5 and 6, respectively, with the number of pathways increasing exponentially with path length (Supplementary Fig. 2). Some of these alternative pathways are found to use the same set of reaction types as the natural trunk pathway, but execute them in a different order (for example, left pathway of Fig. 2a), whereas others make use of a different set of reaction types (right pathway of Fig. 2a).

We wish to investigate how many of these alternative trunk pathways are feasible under typical physiological conditions. First, in the glycolytic direction, we demand that candidate pathways produce at least two ATP molecules. This is required so that the full glycolytic pathway produces a net ATP yield, as the two dominant forms of glycolysis, the EMP and ED pathways, consume one ATP molecule per G3P in their upper halves. In addition, motivated by considerations of simplicityand cost of enzyme production, we further restrict our analysis to those pathways with a near-minimal number of steps. This results in a set of 1,787 candidate glycolytic pathways of length 4, 5 and 6 that produce at least two ATP molecules, and a set of 6,445 biochemically plausible gluconeogenic pathways of lengths 3–6 (not taking into account thermodynamics).

The real paths maximize flux under physiological conditions

We next evaluated the performance of the alternative trunk pathways generated by our network, by comparing their steady-state metabolic flux. For glycolytic pathways, the metabolic flux corresponds to the rate of ATP production, whereas for gluconeogenic pathways, it corresponds to the rate of production of G3P (and ultimately of glucose). This flux depends not only on the total free energy change across a given pathway, but also on the distribution of the individual reaction free energies (see, for example, Fig. 1), which in turn depends on the intracellular environment via the concentrations of the external metabolites. For linear pathways, the flux can be calculated analytically, assuming linear kinetics with diffusion-limited enzymes(see Methods for details). We also assume that, for each pathway, the individual enzyme concentrations are optimized to maximize pathway flux, for a fixed total amount of enzyme (see Methods for details).

### Functional decomposition of metabolism allows a system-level quantification of fluxes and protein allocation towards specific metabolic functions [^292f8ec5]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

By using experimentally determined acetate production fluxes from ref. as well as the biomass composition for C-limited cells (Fig. 2 a), we were able to repeat the analysis for cells grown aerobically on a variety of carbon sources. We found that the efficiency of both the energetic and biosynthetic pathways depended strongly on the substrate, as seen in Fig. 4 d. The energy yields of the respiration pathways (Fig. 4 d) are ~ 4 ATP per C atom for glycolytic carbon sources (open circles), and 2.5 to 3 ATP/C atom for gluconeogenic carbon sources such as acetate, succinate, fumarate and pyruvate (filled symbols). The energetic efficiency of the fermentation pathway is typically 2 ATP/C atom for glycolytic carbon sources, while gluconeogenic carbon sources yield between 1 ATP/C atom (pyruvate) to ~ 2.6 ATP/C atom (glycerol).

The net energy yield associated with amino acid biosynthesis is also strongly affected by the carbon substrate on which the cells are grown (Fig. 4 e). Amino acid biosynthesis is on average much more expensive for cells grown on gluconeogenic carbon sources (empty symbols), compared to glycolytic substrates. For example, the synthesis of an amino acid on mannose produces about 3 ATP, while it consumes more than 4 ATP’s when cells are grown on acetate. (See Supplementary Fig. 7e -l for a breakdown of the costs for individual amino acids and nucleotides.)

Interestingly, no particular differences among glycolytic substrates is seen in either the energetic efficiencies (Fig. 4 d, filled circles) or the average ATP produced per synthesized amino acid (Fig. 4 e), in contrast to the wide range of growth rates achieved by cells reared on these substrates (shown as x-axis in Fig. 4 e). For example, owing to their similar chemical composition, mannose and glucose have very similar energetic yields, but the growth rates for cells grown on the two substrates differ by a factor 3. Therefore, the growth rates achieved with different glycolytic substrates do not appear to be determined by differences in the energetic parameters of each carbon source.

### Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative [^a97c5cf1]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The biochemical pathways of central carbon metabolism are highly conserved across all domains of life, and largely control the productivity of life on the Earth. Yet it remains unknown whether these pathways are the result of historical contingency during early evolution, or are instead optimal solutions to the problem of energy and biomass production. Put simply, are there alternative biochemically feasible pathways that could perform the same function, and if so, how do they perform compared with those found in nature?

Previous studies have mainly addressed this question either by constructing simplified artificial metabolic networks, or by mining databases of biochemical compounds and reactions for known organisms. Both of these approaches have drawbacks: the former does not capture real biochemistry, whereas the latter is limited to metabolites and reactions found in well-studied organisms. Nevertheless, this work has led to suggested optimality principles including maximizing biochemical flux or yield, minimizing biochemical steps or protein costsand ensuring that function is maintained in a changing environment. Only a few studies have attempted to explore the full universe of possible metabolic pathways, using realistic rules of biochemistry. In particular, using this approach, Noor et al.recently suggested that central carbon metabolism, taken as a whole, uses the minimal number of enzymatic steps needed to generate a predefined set of biochemical precursors.

Here, we perform an exhaustive computational search for all possible biochemically feasible alternatives to one of the most ancient and most highly conserved sections of central carbon metabolism, the trunk pathway of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. Glycolysis breaks down glucose to pyruvate, generating ATP, NADH and biosynthetic precursors, whereas gluconeogenesis uses ATP and NADH to generate glucose from pyruvate. The glycolytic-gluconeogenic pathway is almost linear and can be divided into two parts: an ‘upper' chain of reactions involving 6-carbon molecules, which connects glucose to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), and a ‘lower' chain of reactions involving 3-carbon molecules, which connects G3P to pyruvate (Fig. 1). This lower reaction chain is known as the trunk pathway. In prokaryotes, the glycolytic and gluconeogenic trunk pathways consist of almost the same set of five reactions, differing only in one step. In glycolysis, the exergonic conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate is coupled to the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, whereas in gluconeogenesis the reverse reaction is driven by the hydrolysis of ATP to AMP, either with release of inorganic phosphate (the phosphoenolpyruvate synthase (pps) route) or via consumption of inorganic phosphate and release of pyrophosphate (the phosphate dikinase (ppdk) route).

### Switching to the cyclic pentose phosphate pathway powers the oxidative burst in activated neutrophils [^b1a63c49]. Nature Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Cells can utilize nutrients through different metabolic routes to generate cofactors, energy and biosynthetic precursors at different proportions according to their needs. Specific to glucose, particular metabolic demands for ATP, NADPH, pyruvate and ribose are best matched with different metabolic modes. Glycolysis produces the most energy, at the rate of two ATP and two pyruvate per glucose, but no NADPH. OxPPP produces two NADPH and one ribose, while partially oxidizing glucose. In cells where biosynthetic demand for ribose exceeds the need for NADPH, such as proliferating cancer cells, ribose can additionally be produced from non-OxPPP –. In cells with a greater demand for NADPH but not for ribose, like many non-proliferating cells, the overflowing ribose resulting from oxPPP can be shunted back to glycolysis as F6P and GAP via non-OxPPP. If the demand for NADPH further increases, some or all of the F6P can be recycled back to G6P for additional NADPH production, at the cost of higher carbon oxidation and lower ATP production. This forms the pentose cycle, which produces up to six NADPH, and one ATP and one pyruvate per glucose (Fig. 7). In mammalian cells oxPPP is usually a minor route for the metabolism of G6P, with flux <10% of glycolysis,. This is also the case for neutrophils when oxidative burst is not activated. Strikingly, within 30 min following stimulation, neutrophils shifted to near-complete pentose cycle and oxPPP flux rose to >twofold of glucose uptake. While pentose cycle has been long proposed in theory as an intriguing potential glucose metabolism mode with ultra-high NADPH yield, and some carbon recycling at gross flux level has been reported,, to our knowledge, substantial pentose cycling at net flux level (characterized by reversed GPI net flux, uncoupled glycolysis and oxPPP flux exceeding glucose uptake) has not been experimentally demonstrated in mammalian cells. This study shows that neutrophils have remarkable metabolic flexibility that enables them to produce NADPH rapidly and on demand.

### Pyruvate kinase controls signal strength in the insulin secretory pathway [^3c8238e0]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic β cells couple nutrient metabolism with appropriate insulin secretion. Here, we show that pyruvate kinase (PK), which converts ADP and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into ATP and pyruvate, underlies β cell sensing of both glycolytic and mitochondrial fuels. Plasma membrane-localized PK is sufficient to close K ATP channels and initiate calcium influx. Small-molecule PK activators increase the frequency of ATP/ADP and calcium oscillations and potently amplify insulin secretion. PK restricts respiration by cyclically depriving mitochondria of ADP, which accelerates PEP cycling until membrane depolarization restores ADP and oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings support a compartmentalized model of β cell metabolism in which PK locally generates the ATP/ADP required for insulin secretion. Oscillatory PK activity allows mitochondria to perform synthetic and oxidative functions without any net impact on glucose oxidation. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic route for diabetes based on PK activation that would not be predicted by the current consensus single-state model of β cell function.

### Live fast, die young: neutrophils streamline their metabolism to maximize inflammation [^8ae049d0]. Infection and Immunity (2025). Medium credibility.

The first step of glycolysis requires hexokinases to rapidly phosphorylate glucose into glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), preventing it from leaving the cell (Fig. 1). From here, a series of reactions converts G6P into pyruvate, which is primarily converted into lactate rather than being oxidized in the mitochondria by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Phagocytosis is an incredibly energy-intensive process, relying solely on ATP generated from glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). As such, phagocytosis is abrogated in response to glycolysis inhibitors but insensitive to mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors. Studies also found that treating neutrophils with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) impairs phagocytosis of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, but treating neutrophils with sodium fluoride, an inhibitor of the glycolytic enzyme enolase, only decreases phagocytosis of Escherichia coli, but not S. aureus or S. agalactiae. The differing phenotypes may stem from their distinct sites of activity within the glycolytic pathway, with 2-DG acting early in glycolysis while sodium fluoride acting further downstream. Both inhibitors would prevent a net gain in ATP; however, inhibition of enolase would allow for glycolytic intermediates to be formed. The exact mechanism as to why differing chemical inhibitors and bacterial pathogens have inconsistent effects on phagocytosis remains unclear. Upon activation by invading pathogens, neutrophils rewire glucose flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to support the oxidative burst. During the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, G6P dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes the reaction of G6P to 6-phosphogluconolactone during the oxidative phase of the PPP, producing NADPH. NADPH fuels the oxidative burst by donating electrons for the reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide, which is a starting point to produce secondary ROS. Recently, neutrophils have been shown to utilize “pentose phosphate cycling” to maximize NADPH production from G6P at the cost of producing less downstream pyruvate. This mechanism reverses carbon flux through the upper part of glycolysis to feed back into the pentose phosphate pathway, maximizing the amount of NADPH yielded per glucose molecule to fuel NADPH oxidase at the cost of generating ATP. Highlighting the importance of PPP, individuals with a deficiency in G6PD possess neutrophils that exhibit a diminished oxidative burst and impaired NET release, which together could account for the recurrent bacterial infections observed in these patients.

### The ERK and JNK pathways in the regulation of metabolic reprogramming [^44d61a3c]. Oncogene (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cellular metabolism is the process by which a living cell converts nutrients into energy or new macromolecules through a series of biochemical reactions, known as catabolic pathways and anabolic pathways, respectively. Through catabolic pathways, carbon fuels such as glucose, fatty acids, and glutamine are broken down to generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used to maintain cellular functions and construct new cellular components. There are two major ATP-producing pathways in mammalian cells, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). These two metabolic pathways function in concert to provide energy for cellular and tissue homeostasis. During glycolysis, a normal differentiated cell oxidizes glucose into pyruvate, which enters the mitochondria to be further oxidized to carbon dioxide in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, producing the reduced electron carriers nicotinimide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). NADH and FADH2 are then used during OXPHOS to generate 36 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. OXPHOS is the main ATP-producing pathway in normal cells and is strictly dependent on the presence of oxygen. In fact, in the absence of oxygen, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to lactate with a net production of two molecules of NADH and only two molecules of ATP. Such a low ATP-producing pathway is referred to as anaerobic glycolysis or glucose fermentation and takes place in the cytoplasm. Thus, to survive in low oxygen conditions, a normal differentiated cell re-adjusts its glucose metabolism by shifting toward anaerobic glycolysis. Unexpectedly, rapidly proliferating tumor cells adopt this inefficient ATP-producing pathway as their chief manner of energy harvest even in the presence of sufficient levels of oxygen. This is not a new concept as it was anticipated by Otto Warburg more than 90 years ago when he observed that tumor slices and ascites cancer cells display an enhanced rate of glycolysis and produce larger amount of lactate compared to their normal counterparts despite the presence of adequate levels of oxygen for mitochondrial respiration. Subsequent works have revealed that this metabolic phenomenon is not restricted to cancer cells, but it is a common metabolic feature among all mammalian cells during periods of rapid proliferation.

### Functional decomposition of metabolism allows a system-level quantification of fluxes and protein allocation towards specific metabolic functions [^496bea06]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

One of the most immediate results enabled by FDM was the calculation of specific ATP and carbon costs for the biosynthesis of individual biomass component, as well as the ATP yields of the energetic pathways. These were generally uncorrelated with the rate of aerobic growth, although we noticed that gluconeogenic carbon sources tended to yield less energy and allow for slower growth rates compared to the best glycolytic carbon sources (compare e.g. succinate vs glucose in Fig. 4 d, e), or similar to the worst glycolytic sources (e.g. acetate and mannose, both yielding growth rates close to 0.3/h). This suggests that the energetic metabolism might play a more significant role in gluconeogenic growth than in growth on glycolytic substrates. In fact, the determination of carbon and energetic fluxes associated with the biosynthesis of cellular components showed that, for aerobic growth on glucose, the ATP flux produced as by-product of biosynthesis on glucose media is already sufficient to supply for the need for amino acid polymerization, the single biggest ATP expenditure for growing cells (Fig. 3 a–c). These results raise fundamental questions on the metabolic purposes of energy biogenesis by respiration and fermentation, which comprise 30% or more of the total carbon flux during aerobic growth on glucose, and are apparently not needed. Our analysis suggests two possibilities: first, the cell might be inefficiently producing energy via respiration, so that the actual energetic flux is lower than what could be estimated from the observed exchange fluxes. Second, the excess energy might be consumed by unknown processes, including puzzling wasteful energy-spilling pathways,.

### Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative [^b766b2a8]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Flux maximization is widely recognized as an important concept in the study of metabolism; both from the perspective of glycolysis and more broadly. Previous works addressing this issue for glycolysishave arrived at similar conclusions but have remained abstract in nature. For the first time, we attempt to expand on these fundamental and influential studies through the use of a realistic set of generic enzymatic rules along with the inclusion of thermodynamics. Our results add support to the picture that has been developing, and also suggest that evolutionary pressures on metabolic fluxes have to operate within the context of reasonable constraints on metabolite concentrations, and that neglecting these constraints can produce dramatically different outcomes. Our results also expand on the recent suggestion of Noor et al.that central carbon metabolism can be understood as a minimal walk between the set of metabolites essential for growth. We find that the requirement to produce a set of essential biochemical precursors is not sufficient to explain the biochemical structure of the natural trunk pathway, as alternative pathways are possible which produce the essential precursors with the same number of steps (for example, Path D, Fig. 4). Also, many of our alternative pathways produce very similar, but not identical, intermediates to those of the real trunk pathway and it is conceivable that these could be used as alternative precursors. Our results show that flux maximization provides a criterion by which these alternative minimal-length pathways may be distinguished. We also note that this criterion is not affected by ATP yield because alternative pathways producing three or more ATP molecules are never thermodynamically feasible under typical physiological conditions (Supplementary Fig. 7), hence there cannot be any trade-off between the yield and the flux in our model.

### A hexa-species transcriptome atlas of mammalian embryogenesis delineates metabolic regulation across three different implantation modes [^dfeec71f]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The generation of complex living organisms requires coordinated large-scale construction of biomass. Similar to most cellular functions, the anabolic synthesis of biomolecules is thermodynamically unfavourable and thus coupled to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis as a source of free energy,. In mammalian cells, ATP production relies on the processes of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) (Fig. 1a). Glycolysis converts the 6-carbon molecule glucose (sugar) into two 3-carbon molecules of pyruvate to generate 2 ATPs. In anaerobic conditions, pyruvate is predominantly reduced to lactate; however, in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate can be additionally further converted to water and CO 2 by OxPhos,. OxPhos refers to the step-wise reduction of oxygen to water via the electron transport chain in the mitochondrial membranes, generating approximately 33 ATP molecules, as defined by empirical measurements,. Interestingly, fast proliferating cells, including cancer, often favour the apparently less efficient glycolysis pathway even under aerobic conditions (Warburg effect),. The most likely explanation for the Warburg effect is that high glycolytic flux generates a multitude of anabolic precursors to synthesise biomass, while still producing sufficient ATP for cell homoeostasis,. Metabolites from glycolysis feed into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which generates ribose-5-phosphate for nucleotides and NADPH-reducing power for the nucleotide and lipid biosynthesis (Fig. 1a).

### Glucose regulation of β-cell KATP channels: It is time for a new model! [^001f14bf]. Diabetes (2024). Medium credibility.

An agreed-upon consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from healthy β-cells is essential for understanding diabetes pathophysiology. Since the discovery of the KATP channel in 1984, an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos)-driven rise in ATP has been assumed to close KATP channels to initiate insulin secretion. This model lacks any evidence, genetic or otherwise, that mitochondria possess the bioenergetics to raise the ATP/ADP ratio to the triggering threshold, and conflicts with genetic evidence demonstrating that OxPhos is dispensable for insulin secretion. It also conflates the stoichiometric yield of OxPhos with thermodynamics, and overestimates OxPhos by failing to account for established features of β-cell metabolism, such as leak, anaplerosis, cataplerosis, and NADPH production that subtract from the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production. We have proposed an alternative model, based on the spatial and bioenergetic specializations of β-cell metabolism, in which glycolysis initiates insulin secretion. The evidence for this model includes that 1) glycolysis has high control strength over insulin secretion; 2) glycolysis is active at the correct time to explain KATP channel closure; 3) plasma membrane-associated glycolytic enzymes control KATP channels; 4) pyruvate kinase has favorable bioenergetics, relative to OxPhos, for raising ATP/ADP; and 5) OxPhos stalls before membrane depolarization and increases after. Although several key experiments remain to evaluate this model, the 1984 model is based purely on circumstantial evidence and must be rescued by causal, mechanistic experiments if it is to endure.

Energy metabolism

Energy metabolism represents a fundamental aspect of life encompassing the complex set of biochemical processes by which organisms convert nutrients into energy, which is then utilized to maintain vital functions, facilitate growth and enable adaptation to the surrounding environment. The concept of energy balance is central to these processes, whereby the intake, storage and expenditure of energy must be carefully regulated in order to maintain homoeostasis. The primary energy currency of the cell is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is produced both directly and indirectly through the conversion of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Metabolism can be divided into two broad categories: catabolism, which involves the breakdown of molecules to produce energy, and anabolism, which encompasses the synthesis of essential macromolecules utilizing this energy. These two aspects of metabolism occur in a series of interrelated reactions that are essential for the development, growth and reproduction of an organism. This review will focus on the catabolic arm of energy metabolism and the metabolic shifts that support specific cellular differentiation processes.

The central chemical pathways that constitute catabolism are glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and fatty acid metabolism. Glycolysis is an anaerobic process that occurs within the cytoplasm, resulting in the production of two molecules of pyruvate and two molecules of ATP from a single molecule of glucose. Conversely under aerobic conditions, the pyruvate generated by glycolysis in the cytoplasm is transported to the mitochondria to fuel the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and OXPHOS, resulting in the production of ~36 molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per glucose molecule. Due to its efficiency, OXPHOS is typically the primary source of energy in terminally differentiated cells and under basal conditions. However, in certain circumstances, such as hypoxia or in specific cancer cells, there is a shift towards the glycolytic pathway, which is then used primarily for energy production. This process is referred to as the Warburg effect. Furthermore, fatty acid metabolism plays a pivotal role in energy production, particularly during periods of elevated energy demand or nutrient deprivation, such as limited glucose availability. Fatty acids are metabolized via β-oxidation in the mitochondria, resulting in the production of acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle and ultimately generates high levels of ATP. Although there is a balance between these pathways, this equilibrium can be disrupted depending on the cellular conditions, oxygen availability and nutrient supply, enabling cells to adapt their energy production to meet their needs.

### MacroD1 sustains mitochondrial integrity and oxidative metabolism [^76fe9b9e]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Mitochondria are the cells’ main energy hub, converting consumed and metabolized nutrients, like pyruvate, from sugar via TCA cycle activity and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) into ATP or GTP. In addition, pyruvate can also be metabolized by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which results in the generation of cytoplasmic lactate and the regeneration of cytoplasmic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +). The fate of pyruvate, thus, depends on oxygen and nutrient availability, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, and the energetic demand of the cell or organ. Mitochondria and the cytoplasm have distinct requirements for NAD +, and proper compartmentalization of redox equivalents is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and survival in response to environmental stressors –. While OXPHOS yields higher energy production from each glucose unit compared to anaerobic glycolysis, the latter is kinetically faster. The choice of OXPHOS versus lactate-dependent energy production involves multiple regulatory mechanisms that are still not fully understood. These metabolic fluxes are, for example, not only dependent on oxygen availability as observed by the Warburg effectbut are also linked to mitochondrial morphology and dynamics, such as their fusion or fission events. Mitochondrial fusion is positively associated with increased ATP production, while inhibition of fusion is related to impaired OXPHOS, mitochondrial DNA depletion, and/or ROS production,.

### Evidence for impaired glucose metabolism in the striatum, obtained postmortem, from some subjects with schizophrenia [^2a8348dc]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Two pathways that have a major role in glucose metabolism are the Embden–Meyerhof pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA).The Embden–Meyerhof pathway metabolize glucose to pyruvate with a net production of two ATP molecules and two molecules of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), both of which represent energy currency for a cell. Pyruvate can then be converted to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex with acetyl-CoA being a substrate for the TCA cycle. When one molecule of substrate, acetyl-CoA, is processed through the TCA there is a release of electrons from NADH and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH 2) to facilitate the production of 4 molecules of ATP. It has been reported that the activity of aconitase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and succinate thiokinase is lower in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from subjects with schizophrenia.These data are significant because these enzymes catalyse the first three reactions of the TCA.In addition, a gene expression array study has reported lower levels of mRNA for succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A and lactate dehydrogenase A in the hippocampus from subjects with schizophrenia.Succinate dehydrogenase is another enzyme in the TCA cycle, whereas lactate dehydrogenase can convert pyruvate to lactate, a product that does not enter the Embden–Meyerhof pathway.Hence, these data suggest that changes in glucose metabolism in the CNS from subjects with schizophrenia may be widespread across a number of regions.

### Targeting pyruvate kinase PEPs up insulin secretion and improves glucose homeostasis [^0ec36955]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The consensus model of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) holds that ATP generation by oxidative phosphorylation directly regulates K ATP channel activity and thus insulin granule release, a concept inconsistent with bioenergetic principles. Here, Lewandowski et al. (2020) and Abulizi et al. (2020) report that regulation of GSIS is much more complex as different sources of ATP generation are essential to control this process, which can be targeted in vivo and additionally modulate hepatic glucose production. These findings establish an important new conceptual framework of GSIS and in vivo glucose homeostasis.

### Cancer cell metabolism: implications for therapeutic targets [^c27874bd]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The Warburg effect: metabolic reprogramming

Glucose is the primary source of energy and is the main fuel for cellular respiration. In glucose utilization in normal conditions, 70% of ATP is known to be synthesized by oxidative phosphorylation and the rest by glycolysis. As the ATP yield varies with cellular conditions, the ratio between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation also varies in different cells, growth states and microenvironments. In hypoxia, for example, enhanced glycolysis compensates the compromised oxidative phosphorylation to maintain the cellular energetic balance. In most solid tumor cells, a switch in metabolism towards glycolysis over respiration in spite of their functional oxidative phosphorylation machinery manifests the cancer-specific aerobic glycolysis. When the oxidative phosphorylation machinery is limited for any reason (hypoxia, suppression of mitochondrial respiration and so on), other pathways such as lactate fermentation are recruited to supply the cellular energy demand. Cancer cells require a vast amount of energy in a short period of time in order to proliferate. Muscle cells in hypoxic conditions and embryo cells during development can adapt to an altered metabolism when oxygen supply is limited or when growth rate exceeds the regular energy supply, respectively. These cells convert glucose to lactate for fast, but less efficient, ATP generation, accompanying high glucose consumption. Likewise, cancer cells exhibit altered metabolism to meet energy needs during tumor progression; which is known as the Warburg effect.

2-DG interferes with the metabolism of glycoproteins

The glycosylation of proteins is an important biological process that promotes protein stability, proper protein folding and cell adhesion. Glycosylation consists of the addition of N -glycans to the nitrogen of asparagine or arginine of the proteins and occurs in the lumen of the ER. During the N -glycosylation reaction, mannose is converted to mannose-guanosine diphosphate (GDP), an important intermediate in glycan synthesis.Glucose participates in this process because glucose-6-P can be converted to mannose-6-phosphate and then to mannose-GDP. 2-DG is structurally similar to mannose and leads to the formation of 2-DG-GDP, which competes with mannose-GDP in the formation of oligosaccharide chains. Thus, the abnormal glycoproteins formed from 2-DG disrupt the N -glycosylation process and prevent normal protein folding. An accumulation of unfolded/misfolded proteins results in the activation of the unfolded-protein response, which acts to prevent ER stress. On the one hand, it inhibits protein synthesis, while on the other hand, it decreases the degradation of abnormal proteins. Treatment with 2-DG induces ER stress and the expression of ER-stress specific markers, including the C/EBP homologous (CHOP) protein, which plays an important role in ER-stress-induced cell death. Many studies suggest that the toxicity of 2-DG can be attributed to the inhibition of glycosylation. Indeed, addition of exogenous mannose can rescue cells from 2-DG-induced cell death but does not reverse the decrease in ATP. 48,49

2-DG induces an energetic stress

The inhibition of glycolysis annihilates the two ATP-producing reactions in glycolysis: (1) the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate into 3-phosphoglycerate, which generates two molecules of ATP from two molecules of ADP; and (2) the transformation of phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate by pyruvate kinase, which leads to the formation of two molecules of ATP. Ultimately, the net production of ATP by glycolysis is two molecules of ATP because HK and phosphofructokinase-1 both require one molecule of ATP. Importantly, blocking glycolysis decreases the concentration of pyruvate, the precursor of acetyl-CoA and citrate, which integrate into the TCA to ultimately produce ATP. Therefore, the inhibition of glycolysis affects OXPHOS via a reduction in TCA flux.

These actions lead to a decrease in intracellular ATP concentration, cell cycle blockade, inhibition of cell growth and cell death.

### Beyond glucose and warburg: finding the sweet spot in cancer metabolism models [^812b7a4f]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease.. (2024). Medium credibility.

Mitochondria play critical roles as an energetic and biosynthetic hub in cancer. Pyruvate entry into the mitochondria fuels the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a series of enzymatic reactions that generate reduced electron carriers that enter the electron transport chain and generate energy in the form of ATP. Mitochondria also generate numerous biosynthetic intermediatesand contribute to intracellular signaling via the generation of reactive oxygen species, all of which play key roles in supporting the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. Yet, questions about the function and necessity of mitochondria in cancer persist. For instance, why do tumor cells use glycolysis, a pathway that produces less ATP to support proliferation? Several noteworthy investigations offer some insight. First, an advantage of glycolytic metabolism is its speed, estimated to be 10–100× the rate of oxidative phosphorylation. Second, glucose can support several biosynthetic pathways, including the pentose phosphate pathway, producing the sugar backbones for DNA and RNA; hexosamine biosynthesis, producing uridine diphosphate N-acetyl glucosamine, which is used for glycosylation; or serine biosynthesis, which supports one-carbon metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and other processes. Thus, a key advantage of glycolytic reprogramming in cancer is increased biosynthetic capacity (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 
Central carbon metabolism fuels energy and biosynthesis.

Glucose metabolism fuels several biosynthetic and energy-generating pathways (red). Glycolytic intermediates can be re-directed from glycolysis to other biosynthetic pathways, supporting DNA and RNA synthesis (pentose phosphate pathway), glycan generation (hexosamine biosynthesis), or one-carbon metabolism (serine biosynthesis). Pyruvate entry to the TCA cycle results in both high levels of ATP generation and biosynthesis pathways such as fatty acid synthesis. OAA oxaloacetate, α-KG alpha-ketoglutarate.

It is a testament to the importance of Warburg’s discovery that cancer metabolism remains a key area of interest. His findings have inspired generations of scientists to investigate how and why metabolism is reprogrammed in cancer. It is now appreciated that cancer metabolism is highly heterogeneous and adaptable, with distinct metabolic features between and within cancer types. Nutrient use, enzyme activity, and overall metabolic pathway engagement can be significantly altered depending on the model system and growth conditions used to investigate the cancer cells. This review highlights recent advances in metabolic reprogramming in cancer, focusing on bridging the gap between in vivo and in vitro studies of cancer metabolism.

(A) Chemicals structures of lactic acid and lactate acid-base pair. (B) Chemicals structures of acid lactic enantiomere

In physiological and aerobic conditions, cells continuously generate lactate through the enzymatic conversion of pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, by cytosolic lactate dehydrogenase (cLDH) (Fig. 2 A). Production of lactate is therefore essential for the continuous oxidation of glucose, because it allows the regeneration of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +) from its oxidized form NADH, thereby sustaining glycolytic flux. This argues for the importance of lactate generation in normal cell functioning. At rest, the production of lactate is approximately 0.8 mmol/kg/hr for an adult and increases rapidly during exercise. During exercise, the energy required for cellular function is supplied by adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules through the utilization of glucose or glycogen in glycolysis or glycogenolysis. Consequently, during these glycolytic activities, one glucose molecule produces 2 ATP molecules and 2 pyruvate molecules. The pyruvate, in turn, can be oxidized to generate more ATP molecules in the mitochondria. This highlights the central role of lactate as linking oxidative and glycolytic metabolism in organisms, allowing the optimization of glucose utilization. During sustained exercise, excess pyruvate is generated through glycolysis and is partially reduced by lactate dehydrogenase to form lactate, regenerating NAD⁺ required for continued glycolytic flux (Fig. 2 A). At equilibrium, the lactate/pyruvate ratio is 10 to 1. When energy expenditure reaches the maximal capacities of mitochondria to oxidize glucose, pyruvate accumulates and lactate production rises. This limits is historically names the anaerobic threshold, and varies among individuals.

### Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative [^3574e0ce]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Path D differs from the natural pathway in that it converts G3P directly to 3-PG without the production of ATP, via EC 1.2.1.9. This large exorgonic initial step gives path D a favourable thermodynamic profile and results in the two ATP-generating steps being the final two reactions, catalysed by PEP carboxykinase EC 4.1.1.49 and pyruvate carboxylase EC 6.4.1.1. These two enzymes are usually associated with a gluconeogenic role in animals and their feasibility in the glycolytic direction is sensitive to the intracellular pH; it becomes increasingly thermodynamically favourable to produce two ATP molecules from PEP with decreasing pH (see Supplementary Note 2 for details).

Path E is identical to Path A with the exception that the final step generates ATP from AMP and pyrophosphate (via pyruvate phosphate dikinase, EC 2.7.9.1) rather than from ADP and Pi—that is, it is the exact reverse of the natural ppdk gluconeogenic pathway. This may result in an effectively greater energetic yield than the natural glycolytic pathway, as an ATP is recovered from an AMP directly, rather than through the action of the adenylate kinase enzyme (EC 2.7.4.3), which involves the consumption of another ATP molecule. This pathway actually corresponds to a glycolytic variant observed in some anaerobic eukaryotes, in which glycolysis is the primary mode of ATP production. Its flux and feasibility will depend on the cellular [AMP] and [PPi] concentrations, which is not the case for the natural glycolytic pathway (which does not involve AMP or PPi).

Finally, Path F represents a pathway of length 4 that produces two ATP molecules. It converts 3-PG to glycerate with the production of ATP, via glycerate 3-kinase, EC 2.7.1.31. Although the final reaction of this pathway is not present in the KEGG database, this putative reaction is chemically rather simple—involving the dehydration of glycerate to enolpyruvate followed by a spontaneous tautomerization to pyruvate—and so it seems plausible that it might be catalysed by the uncharacterized, non-primary action of an existing enzyme.

The Role ofin Cellular Metabolism

Under normal physiological conditions, pyruvate is generated from glucose by glycolysis and enters the citric acid cycle in the mitochondria where it is oxidatively decarboxylated to form acetyl‐CoA, which is used to fuel oxidative phosphorylation, theoretically generating 36 net adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per molecule of glucose. However, when oxygen becomes scarce, cells are unable to use oxidative phosphorylation to efficiently generate ATP. In this scenario, glycolysis becomes the main generator of ATP, producing 2 net ATP per molecule of glucose. However, NAD + is required to enable the sixth step of glycolysis as glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) uses NAD + to convert glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate (GADP) to D‐1,3‐bisphosphoglycerate (1,3BPG). NAD + is usually regenerated through oxidative phosphorylation by the electron transport chain, so when the oxygen supply is restricted, NAD + is regenerated from NADH by LDHA in order to maintain glycolysis, generating lactate as a by‐product; this is known as anaerobic glycolysis (Figure 4). Although it is less efficient, anaerobic glycolysis is 100 times faster than oxidative phosphorylation, enabling it to fulfill the short‐term energy requirements in the absence of sufficient oxygen at the expense of a greater consumption of glucose.

Figure 4 
Anaerobic glycolysis. Lactate dehydrogenase A is required to maintain glycolysis andproduction in the absence of sufficient oxygen by regenerating + form. Lactate is generated as the end by‐product of this reaction. The reaction consumes 2but creates 4, generating 2 netper molecule of glucose.

Different tissues in the body have different metabolic rates, energy requirements and functions, which are often reflected in their LDHA : LDHB ratio. For example, approximately 40% of lactate in the circulation is released by skeletal muscle, whereas the liver and kidneys predominantly absorb lactate from the circulation and oxidize it to synthesize glucose 1. Brain metabolism is clearly complex as it responds dynamically to changes in blood glucose and lactate concentrations. A study of six normal physically active men found that at rest, the brain oxidizes approximately 10% of blood L‐lactate, fueling 8% of cerebral energy requirements, but still releases a small amount of net L‐lactate 129. However, in response to physical exertion and hyperlactatemia, the brain takes up net L‐lactate 94, 129, which contributes up to 60% of brain metabolism with cerebral lactate oxidation thought to use 33% of lactate 1, 94.

Fig. 1 
Cellular energy metabolism: Linkage of OXPHOS to catabolic pathways for glucose, fatty acids, and glutamine.

Cells use OXPHOS to generate ATP, through the interlinkage of TCA cycle and electron transport chain (ETC). TCA cycle supplies NADH and FADH 2 to the ETC. Electrons are donated by NADH to complex I and by FADH 2 to complex II, then transferred to coenzyme Q, to complex III, to cytochrome c and finally to complex IV. This electron transport allows a series of oxidation and reduction reactions within complexes I, II and IV, which in turns allows these complexes to transfer hydrogen protons from inside the mitochondria to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. The accumulation of protons in this space creates a difference in the charge between the inner mitochondria and its intermembrane space. This mitochondrial potential allows protons to flow back into the mitochondria through complex V, providing the energy to bond an inorganic phosphate to a molecule of ADP, producing ATP. Glycolysis is the metabolic process in which glucose is converted into pyruvate, which can then convert pyruvate into acetyl-CoA used in TCA cycle, hence in OXPHOS. One molecule of fructose-6P yields two glyceraldehyde 3-P, thus, one molecule of glucose can yield two molecules of pyruvate. Fatty acid metabolism can also supply the TCA cycle with acetyl-CoA through the fatty acid β-oxidation. Glutamine metabolism is the process in which glutaminase (GLS) converts glutamine to glutamate, which can then be passed into the mitochondrion through the glutamate shuttle and can be converted into α-ketoglutarate, further supplying TCA cycle and enhance OXPHOS activity. (GLS: glutaminase; IDH2: isocitrate dehydrogenase: Lactate DH: lactate dehydrogenase; PFK: phosphofructokinase).

### The influence of circadian rhythms and aerobic glycolysis in autism spectrum disorder [^bd388456]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Aerobic glycolysis

In mammalian cells, glucose is the main source of energy. All tissues need ATP to function normally. Cells produce ATP by a careful drop in oxidation state from energy-rich molecules like glucose, through the cell respiration process, down to product CO 2 at the end. This process occurs in an aerobic or anaerobic manner, depending on whether oxygen is available. Glycolysis is the first step in glucose metabolism signaling and occurs in the cytosol of all cells. The presence of O 2 is important because of oxidation of glucose under aerobic conditions results in ~32 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. Under anaerobic conditions, only two molecules of ATP can be produced. Aerobic glycolysis can occur in these two stages. The first occurs in the cytosol and involves the conversion of glucose to pyruvate resulting in NADH production and generating two molecules of ATP. In normal conditions, when oxygen is available, the energy contained in NADH is further released via re-oxidization of the mitochondrial chain and leads to the release of 30 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose. Pyruvate is reduced to lactate, instead of re-oxidized, under aerobic glycolysis. Thus, glucose is metabolized in order to produce ATP, by a cytosolic glycolysis and oxygen-dependent mitochondrial physiological mechanism. Glucose entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is modulated by pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH). Pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl-coA in mitochondria by the PDH. Acetyl-coA translocates to the TCA cycle for oxidation. Under aerobic glycolysis, pyruvate is converted into lactate in the cytosol by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A). Moreover, aerobic glycolysis is caused by the involvement of hexokinase 2 (HK2) instead of HK1 and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) instead of PKM1 (ref.). This phenomenon is called aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect.

T Cell Metabolism

Quiescent T cells mainly use catabolic processes, while activated cells rely on anabolic processes to support protein production and proliferation. Cells need to activate a critical serine/threonine kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), to induce anabolic pathways. While driving growth and proliferation, mTOR also upregulates glucose transport and glycolysis. Glycolysis is one of the main pathways to generate energy. Although it is not energetically efficient — only 2 adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules can be generated from one glucose molecule — it generates energy very rapidly, which is of use for active and proliferating T cells. Processing of glucose yields ATP, NADH, and pyruvate. Pyruvate is then converted to lactate and exported as lactic acid in the case of glycolysis or otherwise transported to mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).

OXPHOS is a much more efficient bioenergetic pathway, producing 36 ATP molecules from every glucose molecule. In this case, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA and enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), which is coupled to the electron transport chain (TCA) through electron donors NADH and FADH2. TCA cycle can be replenished by amino acids and oxidation of fatty acids. Fatty acid oxidation (FAO) is mainly used by cells with low energy demands and plays a critical role in CD8 + memory and CD4 + Treg development. Activated T cells upregulate their glutamine uptake and perform glutaminolysis to yield α-ketoglutarate, which enters the TCA cycle.

### Switching to the cyclic pentose phosphate pathway powers the oxidative burst in activated neutrophils [^fd91a8d8]. Nature Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

Neutrophils are cells at the frontline of innate immunity that can quickly activate effector functions to eliminate pathogens upon stimulation. However, little is known about the metabolic adaptations that power these functions. Here we show rapid metabolic alterations in neutrophils upon activation, particularly drastic reconfiguration around the pentose phosphate pathway, which is specifically and quantitatively coupled to an oxidative burst. During this oxidative burst, neutrophils switch from glycolysis-dominant metabolism to a unique metabolic mode termed 'pentose cycle', where all glucose-6-phosphate is diverted into oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and net flux through upper glycolysis is reversed to allow substantial recycling of pentose phosphates. This reconfiguration maximizes NADPH yield to fuel superoxide production via NADPH oxidase. Disruptions of pentose cycle greatly suppress oxidative burst, the release of neutrophil extracellular traps and pathogen killing by neutrophils. Together, these results demonstrate the remarkable metabolic flexibility of neutrophils, which is essential for their functions as the first responders in innate immunity.

### Regulation of blood flow and volume exchange across the microcirculation [^6462cf01]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Equation 1: net energy output of metabolizing 1 molecule of blood glucose via aerobic glycolysiswhere ADP = adenosine diphosphate, CO 2 = carbon dioxide; P = phosphate, H 2 O = water. This equation holds true allowing that the 2 molecules of GTP initially formed in the citrate cycle per molecule of glucose are converted to ATP (see Ganong).

Equation 2: net energy output of metabolizing 1 molecule of blood glucose via anaerobic glycolysiswhere NAD + / NADH = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidized/reduced, H + = proton.

While the waste products of aerobic glycolysis are normally not too much of a problem, accumulation of lactic acid under anaerobic conditions leads to metabolic acidosis, accentuating negative side effects as encountered in hypoxic tissue. These include loss of cardiac contractility, loss of circulatory resistance regulation, a delayed and disturbed tissue healing process in the traumatized and critically ill patient, and, ultimately, death. Poorer cardiac contractility and loss of peripheral arterial resistance generally develop in acidotic settings, be these of respiratory or metabolic genesis. The decisive issue is the perturbation of the H + ion concentration. In particular, increase of H + attenuates glycolytic enzymes and causes hyperkalemia. These effects alone lead to a fall in cardiac force development. However, there may be some difference between metabolic and respiratory acidosis. The difference is not one of a general nature, but is quantitative. For instance, nonrespiratory acidosis causes an increase in external K + of 0.6 mmol/l per change of pH by 0.1 unit; the corresponding value for respiratory acidosis is only 0.1 mmol/l per 0.1 pH unit. Also, quantitative effects will probably differ between acute and chronic acidosis. Lactate is chiefly a marker of the condition, but, as an osmotically active particle, interstitial lactate adds to vascular dilatation via transient receptor potential-operated channels of the smooth muscle cells that respond to osmotic concentration (see below).

Obviously, anaerobic glycolysis is not really a suitable alternative to the aerobic version of generating metabolic energy. Unfortunately, the latter requires oxygen.

### Glycolytic control proteins in urinary extracellular vesicles are elevated during kidney transplant T cell-mediated rejection [^0894035e]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Experimental evidence has associated kidney injury with changes in kidney energy metabolism, but the metabolic changes during kidney transplant rejection are not well understood. Tubular cells along the nephron generate energy from various substrates in order to maintain complex homeostatic functions. However, metabolic preference is not uniform and depends on the cell type. The proximal tubule derives adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation of fatty acids and has limited capacity to perform glycolysis. By contrast, distal segments preferentially utilise glycolysis due to low oxygen tension in the inner medulla.

Glycolysis is a series of ten chemical reactions that metabolise glucose to pyruvate with the net release of two ATP molecules. There are three rate-limiting enzymes– hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) and pyruvate kinase (PK). Hexokinase catalyses the first step of glycolysis to trap glucose inside the cell. PFK-1 catalyses the ATP-dependent conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, promoting the forward reaction of glycolysis. Phosphofructokinase-liver (PFK-L) is the dominant isoform of PFK-1 in the kidney. The most potent activator of PFK-1 is the level of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate, which is controlled by a family of enzymes with bifunctional actions, called 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFB). The four isoenzymes PFKFB1-4 differ in relative kinase:phosphatase ratios. They also differ in tissue distribution and specifically regulate the formation and degradation of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate in response to cellular requirements. PFKFB1 is not expressed in the kidney, whereas PFKFB2-4 are distributed throughout the nephron. Pyruvate kinase catalyses the last step of glycolysis to form pyruvate. In aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria and undergoes oxidative phosphorylation. In the anaerobic state, it is converted to lactate. Aerobic glycolysis (the conversion of pyruvate to lactate under normoxic condition) can occur as an adaptive or pathological response.

### Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative [^f729e83d]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

To overcome this issue and to investigate in more detail, we analysed which of our candidate pathways achieved the highest flux at different points in the parameter space. This allows us to understand how the performance of a given pathway depends on the intracellular environment. Our results show that different candidate pathways perform best in different regions of the parameter space. In particular, pathway performance is very sensitive to the cellular energy state, as measured by the ratio of the ATP and ADP concentrations ([ATP]/[ADP]), and redox state, represented by the ratio [NAD][Pi]/[NADH] (Fig. 2c,e). Focusing on the glycolytic pathways (Fig. 2b) we see that, remarkably, the natural trunk pathway (black dots) outperforms all the alternatives in the region of parameter space close to that found in living cells (red box). This suggests that the glycolytic trunk pathway represents a maximal flux solution for the conversion of G3P to pyruvate, under typical intracellular conditions. Similarly, for the gluconeogenic pathways (Fig. 2d), the pps pathway found in nature (red dots) outperforms the alternatives under typical physiological conditions (red box).

Alternative flux calculations

The flux calculation used above makes the simplifying assumption that all enzymes are perfect catalystsand thus it neglects the important physical feature of substrate saturation. Any attempt at applying a generic choice of kinetic equations to a system of reactions is problematic, and more complicated forms give rise to a greater number of parameters that must be specified. However, one can test the effect that using alternative forms has on the overall outcome, and we find that the above results still hold when two forms of reversible Michaelis–Menten kinetics are assumed (Supplementary Figs 3, 4 and Methods), capturing the behaviour of substrate and product inhibition. Thus, our results are not dependent on the detailed assumptions made in modelling the enzyme kinetics.

### The warburg effect revisited through blood and electron flow [^578fbb5d]. Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The Warburg effect describes the propensity of many cancers to consume glucose avidly and convert it to lactate in the presence of oxygen. The benefit of the Warburg effect on cancer cells remains enigmatic, particularly because extracellular disposal of incompletely oxidized lactate is wasteful. However, lactate is not discarded from the body, but rather recycled as pyruvate for metabolism through the tricarboxylic acid cycle in oxidative tissues and cells. Hence, tissue and interorgan metabolism play important roles in tumor metabolism. The production of tumor lactate to be recycled elsewhere parallels the Cori cycle, in which lactate produced by muscle activity is shuttled to the liver, where it is converted to pyruvate and subsequently stored as glucose moieties in glycogen. This perspective will consider this organismal contextwhile discussing how glucose is used in tumors. We highlight several key articles published decades ago in Cancer Research that are foundational to our current understanding of cancer biology and metabolism.

### Causes and consequences of increased glucose metabolism of cancers [^ca20eabb]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In this review we examine the mechanisms (causes) underlying the increased glucose consumption observed in tumors within a teleological context (consequences). In other words, we will ask not only "How do cancers have high glycolysis?" but also, "Why?" We believe that the insights gained from answering the latter question support the conclusion that elevated glucose consumption is a necessary component of carcinogenesis. Specifically we propose that glycolysis is elevated because it produces acid, which provides an evolutionary advantage to cancer cells vis-à-vis normal parenchyma into which they invade.

Results

A network of all possible biochemical reactions

We used a computer program to generate the network of all possible biochemically feasible pathways between G3P and pyruvate.

Metabolites

Our program first systematically generates all possible relevant internal metabolites, that is, molecules intermediate between G3P and pyruvate, including those that are not found in nature (see Methods for details). Central carbon metabolism consists exclusively of reactions between ‘CHOPN' molecules: those composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and nitrogen atoms, with phosphorus being present only in phosphate groups. Moreover, the trunk pathway contains only unbranched aliphatic 3-carbon CHOP molecules. For completeness, we therefore include in our analysis all possible unbranched aliphatic CHOPN molecules containing up to four carbon atoms. We consider only molecules that are negatively charged (that is, include carboxyl or phosphate groups). This condition is motivated by the need to avoid leakage through the negatively charged phospho-lipid membrane, and is satisfied by almost all molecules in core metabolism. Applying these criteria results in almost 1,500 different molecules, including all the internal metabolites in the real trunk pathway. We computed the free energy of formation Δ f G for all our internal metabolites, using existing experimental data where possibleor, in the absence of such data, using a variant of the group contribution method(see Methods for details).

Reactions

Our program generates all possible reactions among our set of internal metabolites, based on the 20 Enzyme Commission (EC) reaction classeswhich encompass all the reactions between CHOPN molecules in core metabolism, of length four carbon atoms or less (Table 1). Many of these reactions involve cofactors such as ATP and NAD + ; we refer to these as external metabolites and we assume that they have fixed concentrations, which define the cellular (physiological) conditions. The full set of external metabolites in our reaction network is shown in Supplementary Table 1 and includes the energy currency metabolite ATP, the redox cofactor NAD +, the amino-group donor glutamate, as well as inorganic phosphates and CO 2.

### Engineering new-to-nature biochemical conversions by combining fermentative metabolism with respiratory modules [^07f98709]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In the following, we aimed to test whether the supplementation of biomass precursors from lower metabolism could complement the acetyl-CoA demand. To this end, we supplied the NNmini strain growing on 10 mM glucose with different concentrations of acetate, pyruvate or casamino acids (CAAs). All three supplements improved both the growth rate and the formation of biomass to varying extents (Fig. 4B, C & Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). In case of acetate supplementation, despite the cost of at least 1 ATP for acetyl-CoA formation, growth was significantly improved (maximum OD 600 = 0.8 with 4 mM acetate, max. growth rate = 0.277 h −1). This hints that acetyl-CoA production limits growth of the NNmini strain rather than ATP yields from substrate-level phosphorylation. In case of CAAs, their supplementation yields free amino acids from lower metabolism as they are obtained from acid hydrolysis of casein and contain all amino acids except tryptophan. We therefore expected a reduced dependence on inhibited Pdh in the NNmini strain. Indeed, maximum OD 600 values similar to a wild type growing on 10 mM glucose were observed for CAA supplementation (OD 600 = 1.825, max. growth rate = 0.315 ± 0.014 h −1). In case of pyruvate supplementation, converting the supplied pyruvate to acetyl-CoA via Pdh results in the formation of one NADH. However, converting 1 molecule of pyruvate to 1 molecule of lactate also consumes one NADH. Each additional conversion of supplied pyruvate to lactate should thus lower intracellular NADH levels, thus reducing Pdh inhibition. Then, a fraction of the supplied pyruvate can be used for acetyl-CoA synthesis via Pdh, which should improve growth at higher concentrations of supplied pyruvate. Indeed, biomass yields and growth rates of the NNmini strain supplemented with pyruvate were lower compared to acetate or CAAs (max. OD = 0.47 with 8 mM pyruvate, growth rate = 0.108 ± 0.003 h −1). Taken together, our findings through supplementation with acetate, CAAs or pyruvate are in line with the speculated acetyl-CoA limitations of the NNmini strain due to NADH-dependent Pdh inhibition.

### Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative [^a99acff0]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

The universality of many pathways of core metabolism suggests a strong role for evolutionary selection, but it remains unclear whether existing pathways have been selected from a large or small set of biochemical possibilities. To address this question, we construct in silico all possible biochemically feasible alternatives to the trunk pathway of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, one of the most highly conserved pathways in metabolism. We show that, even though a large number of alternative pathways exist, the alternatives carry lower flux than the real pathway under typical physiological conditions. We also find that if physiological conditions were different, different pathways could outperform those found in nature. Together, our results demonstrate how thermodynamic and biophysical constraints restrict the biochemical alternatives that are open to evolution, and suggest that the existing trunk pathway of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis may represent a maximal flux solution.

### Synergistic substrate cofeeding stimulates reductive metabolism [^cd092e19]. Nature Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Advanced bioproduct synthesis via reductive metabolism requires coordinating carbons, ATP and reducing agents, which are generated with varying efficiencies depending on metabolic pathways. Substrate mixtures with direct access to multiple pathways may optimally satisfy these biosynthetic requirements. However, native regulation favouring preferential use precludes cells from co-metabolizing multiple substrates. Here we explore mixed substrate metabolism and tailor pathway usage to synergistically stimulate carbon reduction. By controlled cofeeding of superior ATP and NADPH generators as 'dopant' substrates to cells primarily using inferior substrates, we circumvent catabolite repression and drive synergy in two divergent organisms. Glucose doping in Moorella thermoacetica stimulates CO 2 reduction (2.3g gCDW -1 h -1 ) into acetate by augmenting ATP synthesis via pyruvate kinase. Gluconate doping in Yarrowia lipolytica accelerates acetate-driven lipogenesis (0.046g gCDW -1 h -1 ) by obligatory NADPH synthesis through the pentose cycle. Together, synergistic cofeeding produces CO 2 -derived lipids with 38% energy yield and demonstrates the potential to convert CO 2 into advanced bioproducts. This work advances the systems-level control of metabolic networks and CO 2 use, the most pressing and difficult reduction challenge.

### Application of isotopic techniques using constant specific activity or enrichment to the study of carbohydrate metabolism [^86333f8a]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

There is no net loss of carbon in glycolysis, and therefore the use of a carbon-labeled tracer in measuring glucose metabolism avoids some of the potential pitfalls associated with the use of hydrogen labeling. Generally, 1- 13 C-glucose, 6- 13 C-glucose, or universally labeled glucose (U- 13 C-glucose) is used. Use of the latter tracer decreases potential problems associated with the other tracers of recycling label that underestimate glucose production. This assumes that the likelihood of two triply labeled 3-carbon precursors (re-)combining to form U- 13 C-glucose during gluconeogenesis is extremely small. Such potential pitfalls and the likely presence of such cycling during the study conditions need to be considered when choosing a tracer for a given study.

### Pyruvate into lactate and back: from the warburg effect to symbiotic energy fuel exchange in cancer cells [^c5ca5495]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Tumor cells fuel their metabolism with glucose and glutamine to meet the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of proliferation. Hypoxia and oncogenic mutations drive glycolysis, with the pyruvate to lactate conversion being promoted by increased expression of lactate dehydrogenase A and inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The NAD+ pool is consecutively regenerated and supports the high glycolytic flux required to produce anabolic intermediates. Glutaminolysis provides metabolic intermediates such as alpha-ketoglutarate to feed and thereby maintain the tricarboxylic acid cycle as a biosynthetic hub. Glycolysis and glutaminolysis share the capacity to generate NADPH, from the pentose phosphate pathway and through the malate conversion into pyruvate, respectively. Both pathways ultimately lead to the secretion of lactate. More than a waste product, lactate was recently identified as a major energy fuel in tumors. Lactate produced by hypoxic tumor cells may indeed diffuse and be taken up by oxygenated tumor cells. Preferential utilization of lactate for oxidative metabolism spares glucose which may in turn reach hypoxic tumor cells. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 regulates the entry of lactate into oxidative tumor cells. Its inhibition favors the switch from lactate-fuelled respiration to glycolysis and consecutively kills hypoxic tumor cells from glucose starvation. Combination with radiotherapy renders remaining cells more sensitive to irradiation, emphasizing how interference with tumor cell metabolism may complement current anticancer modalities.

### Cancer-generated lactic acid: a regulatory, immunosuppressive metabolite? [^91343bf2]. The Journal of Pathology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Deregulated proliferation of cancer cells is generally associated with altered energy metabolism. Glucose is a primary source of energy. Under aerobic conditions, normal cells metabolize glucose to pyruvate via glycolysis in the cytosol, and subsequently convert pyruvate to carbon dioxide in the mitochondria for oxidative phosphorylation; under anaerobic conditions, conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid is favoured with relatively low amounts of pyruvate being diverted to the mitochondria. In contrast, cancer cells primarily derive energy from glucose via glycolysis to lactic acid, even under highly aerobic conditions, a property first observed by Otto Warburg. This ‘aerobic glycolysis’, also known as the ‘Warburg effect’, is much less energy-efficient than the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. It is usually accompanied by marked increases in glucose uptake and consumption, a phenomenon commonly exploited in tumour imaging using 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron electron tomography. In addition, cancer cells derive energy from up-regulated non-glucose-dependent pathways, such as increased glutaminolysis under aerobic conditions,,. Aerobic glycolysis and increased glutaminolysis are collectively regarded as ‘reprogrammed energy metabolism’, a phenomenon now generally accepted as a key metabolic hallmark of cancer,,. Both pathways lead to the production and secretion of lactic acid, markedly contributing to metabolic acidosis commonly found in solid cancers,,. Extracellular pH values in tumours can be as low as pH 6.0–6.5, in contrast to pH 7.5 present in normal cell environments–.

The glycolytic pathway and its regulation

Most mammalian cells use glucose as the primary carbon sources for the production of ATP and synthesis of cellular components, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. They normally take up glucose from extracellular fluid into the cell only when stimulated by extracellular growth factors to growth and divide. For example, the binding of growth factors to receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway to stimulate cellular glucose uptake and glycolysis along with cell growth and survival by enhancing both the transcriptional expression and translocation to the cell surface of glucose transporters (GLUTs). Once in the cell, glucose is phosphorylated by the first enzyme of the glycolytic pathway hexokinase (HK) to form glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), which in turn serves as an allosteric inhibitor of HK (Fig. 1). HK is stimulated following activation of Akt, so that PI3K/Akt signaling not only facilitates the increase in glucose uptake but also enables glucose progression through the glycolytic pathway. G6P has then three possible metabolic fates within the cell. It can be converted into fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) in the glycolytic pathway or can be oxidized by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) or enter the synthesis pathway of glycogen, a storage form of glucose (reviewed in ref.) (Fig. 1). If a cell is instructed to continue glycolysis, F6P is further phosphorylated by the enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) to form fructose 1,6-biphosphate (F1,6BP), which then is cleaved into two triose phosphates, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (Fig. 1). Unlike GAP, which is the substrate for the next reaction in glycolysis, DHAP does not undergo direct glycolysis. It can either be used to generate glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), an important precursor for the synthesis of structural lipids of cell membranes, or can proceed further along the glycolytic pathway via its conversion to GAP by triose phosphate isomerase. As a result, oxidation of one molecule of glucose forms two molecules of GAP, both of which are converted into pyruvate in a sequence of five reactions that generates ATP and NADH (Fig. 1). The final reaction in this sequence is the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, which can then enter into TCA cycle by its conversion to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) or be converted into lactate depending on cell type and availability of oxygen. The conversion of PEP to pyruvate is catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK), a homotetrameric enzyme that exists in mammals as four isoforms (PKL, PKR, PKM1, and PKM2) with different expression patterns and regulatory mechanisms. Unlike PKM1, which is constitutively active and insensitive to allosteric effectors, the PKM2, PKL, and PKR isoforms are subject to allosteric regulation that affects enzyme activity by the direct binding of effectors. For example, the glycolytic intermediate F1,6BP stimulates PKM2 by increasing its affinity for PEP (the catalytic substrate of PK), promoting tetramerization, and stabilizing the tetrameric active conformation of PKM2. Conversely, PKM2 is inhibited by the binding to tyrosine phosphorylated peptides, which induce the release of F1,6BP resulting in the stabilization of the inactive dimeric conformation of PKM2, an event associated with low PK activity. Besides being allosterically regulated by diverse metabolites, PKM2 is also negatively regulated by covalent modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, and oxidation. It is now appreciated that low PKM2 activity in cells allows the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates upstream of the PK reaction that can be used as precursors for the synthesis of nucleotides, amino acids, and fatty acids (Fig. 1) (reviewed in ref.). Therefore, maintaining a low PKM2 activity is particularly important for highly proliferating cells, such as many cancer cells, that require a copious supply of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids for biomass duplication. Paradoxically, the low level of PKM2 activity in rapidly proliferating cells is associated with an increased conversion of pyruvate into lactate with concomitant generation of NAD + from NADH in an enzymatic reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). As NAD + is consumed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in a reaction that generates 1,3-biphosphoglycerate from GAP in glycolysis (Fig. 1), an efficient regeneration of NAD + is required to maintain the continuity of the glycolytic flux. Therefore, it appears that pyruvate is converted into lactate to sustain high glycolytic flux, regenerating NAD +. Interestingly, NAD + is not only required to enable glycolysis but is also needed for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis pathways that branch from glycolysis [,–]. Therefore, during rapid cell proliferation, an efficient enzymatic activity of LDHA provides an advantage to cells by regenerating NAD +.

### Coordinated metabolic transitions during drosophila embryogenesis and the onset of aerobic glycolysis [^31a09ff7]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

The metabolism of proliferating cells must not only generate the energy that maintains cellular physiology but also provide precursors to synthesize the lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides required for rapid growth. This is particularly apparent in cancer cells, which rely on a metabolic program known as the Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis to generate biomass (;). Aerobic glycolysis is characterized by the increased activity of glucose transporters, glycolytic enzymes, the pentose phosphate pathway, and other proteins that promote glycolytic flux. The resulting upregulation of glycolysis, however, is not solely used to produce ATP. Instead, the abundant supplies of glucose-derived metabolites are used to generate the amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids needed for biomass accumulation. Meanwhile, a significant quantity of the pyruvate generated during this process is not oxidized in the mitochondria, but rather is converted into lactate. This hallmark of aerobic glycolysis allows cells to regenerate the electron acceptor NAD +, which is required for maximal glycolytic flux. Interestingly, aerobic glycolysis is not restricted to cancer cells, but appears to be more widely used by proliferating cells, including human embryonic stem cells, lymphoblasts, and yeast grown under ideal culture conditions (;;).

The manner in which cancer cells rely on aerobic glycolysis suggests that exploring the molecular mechanisms that regulate this metabolic program could lead to new clinical therapies. While investigations using cancer cell lines are important for this endeavor, recent studies have demonstrated that tumor metabolism in vivo can differ significantly from these in vitro systems. For example, stable-isotope tracer experiments in transplanted glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors reveal that glycolytic flux is linked with oxidative phosphorylation. Consistent with this finding, oxidative phosphorylation is critical for maintaining GBM cancer stem cells, and a recent survey of gene expression in GBM tumors revealed that genes encoding components of complex I in the electron transport chain (ETC) are among the most highly expressed transcripts in this tumor type. These discrepancies highlight the importance of studying aerobic glycolysis in intact animal models, in which growth and cell proliferation occur in the context of normal physiology.

### Brown-fat-mediated tumour suppression by cold-altered global metabolism [^97e30831]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Main

Metabolic alterations are one of the hallmarks of cancer and malignant cells often reprogram metabolism to promote their growth, proliferation, migration and survival,,,. A distinctive feature of altered metabolism commonly shared by most cancers is the high uptake of glucose that undergoes fermentation metabolism to generate lactate,. Under aerobic conditions, cancer cells use the glucose-fermentation–lactate pathway to harness energy in the form of ATP,. This cancer-associated aerobic glycolysis, that is, the Warburg effect, is an inefficient pathway to generate ATP. Compared with mitochondrial respiration, the Warburg effect is the default pathway for energy production and only two ATP molecules are generated per glucose through aerobic glycolysis,. However, a 10–100-fold accelerated rate of glucose-based aerobic glycolysis occurs in tumour cells relative to that of glucose complete oxidation in the mitochondria of healthy cells. Indeed, over 70% of human cancers show amplified expression of glycolytic genes –.

The Warburg effect: a novel perspective

It has long been known that normal highly proliferating and tumor cells display the Warburg-like metabolic phenotype, which is characterized by high rate of glucose uptake and conversion to lactate under aerobic conditions. One of the most important debates about this metabolic phenotype is that aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient metabolic pathway generating less ATP per single molecule of glucose than that generated through OXPHOS and, plainly, aerobic glycolysis cannot cope with the high cellular demand of energy required during fast cell proliferation. A number of possible explanations have been proposed to account for the Warburg metabolism of proliferating cells. One possible explanation is that aerobic glycolysis essentially generates more ATP by producing it at a faster rate than OXPHOS. Thus it appears that the theoretical inefficiency of energy generation of glycolysis is counterweighed by the rapid production of ATP. Additionally, an increase in glycolytic flux is believed to be advantageous for proliferating cells with high demand for reducing equivalents (such as NADPH) and cellular macromolecules (such as DNA, proteins, and lipids). This is because an accelerated glycolytic flux can lead to an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates, which can be channeled into biosynthetic pathways. For example, G6P, the first glycolytic intermediate, can be oxidized through the PPP to generate the nucleotide precursor ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH, which is used for lipid biosynthesis and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during fast cell proliferation (Fig. 1). Similarly, DHAP and 3PG, other two glycolytic intermediates, can leave the glycolytic flux and participate in the phospholipids and serine biosynthesis pathway, respectively (Fig. 1). It is important to note, however, that these glycolytic intermediates will not accumulate and branch off into their respective biosynthetic pathways unless the final enzymatic reaction in glycolysis (the conversion of PEP into pyruvate) is slowed down. To achieve this, proliferating cells and many cancer cell types predominantly express and use PKM2, which, as discussed above, has a low PK activity and therefore is less efficient in converting PEP to pyruvate than PKM1, thereby allowing for upstream glycolytic intermediates to accumulate and branch off into biosynthetic pathways. As such, PKM2 expression and its low activity is known to promote cancer cell proliferation, although recent studies in mouse cancer models have led to opposing conclusions. For example, absence of PKM2 accelerates tumor formation in a Brca1 -loss-driven model of breast cancer, in a mouse model of medulloblastoma, and results in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in aged mice, indicating that PKM2 negatively regulates tumorigenesis. However, other in vivo studies support the notion that PKM2 has as an oncogenic function in leukemia and soft tissue sarcoma formation. It therefore seems likely that the function of PKM2 in cancer development depends on the cancer type. Taken together, the findings described above support the hypothesis that increased aerobic glycolysis is a metabolic strategy to improve the availability of NADPH and metabolic substrates needed for rapid biomass synthesis during fast cell proliferation. Increases in the rates of glycolysis have also beneficial antioxidant role for cells, generating NADPH essential for protecting cells from oxidative damage driven by increased cell proliferation (Fig. 1).

### Targeting the red cell enzyme pyruvate kinase with a small allosteric molecule AG-348 may correct underlying pathology of a glycolytic enzymopathy [^93d695b9]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Mature red blood cells (RBC) lack a nucleus and mitochondria, relying almost entirely on their own glycolytic degradative processes to generate energy. One of the major reaction pathways in RBC is the Embden-Meyerhof in which a series of enzymes convert glucose anaerobically into usable energy: adenosine triphosphate (ATP).The pathway utilizes two ATP to initiate the reaction, with ultimately two more ATP being produced. This pathway is essential to meeting the energy demands of RBC, including maintenance of red cell membrane flexibility and, therefore, impacting RBC shape.

In the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, a pyruvate kinase (PK) isoform unique to RBC, PK-R, is a rate-limiting enzyme that plays a critical role in the formation of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) with the simultaneous generation of ATP from adenosine diphosphate (ADP)(Figure 1). Among the most common enzyme defects related to the Embden-Meyerhof pathway is an inherited disorder in which homozygote individuals display signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia due to the deficiency of the PK-R enzyme. PK defects have been documented worldwide, although most cases have been identified in people of Northern European ancestry.

This rare hereditary disorder is characterized by changes in RBC metabolism including manifestation of anemia and a compromised energetic profile (ATP production). RBC deficient in PK cannot produce enough energy to maintain normal membrane function. Potassium and water leak from the cell, while calcium concentrations increase. As a result, these cells become rigid, lose flexibility, and are more susceptible to premature hemolysis.

In mammals, two PK genes are expressed depending on anatomical region and cell type: PK muscle (PKM) and PK liver and red blood cell (PKLR). PKLR controls the expression of the red blood cell (PK-R) or liver (PK-L) isoforms from tissue-specific promoters. Mutations in the PKLR gene cause PK deficiency with clinical symptoms apparently confined to RBC. PK-R of RBC is a tetrameric enzyme that exists in equilibrium between a less active T-state and a more active R-state that can be induced by binding to the glycolytic intermediate fructose bisphosphate (FBP). Therefore, intervention strategies designed to counter this condition included the stabilization of the active R state of PK-R, directly restoring PK activity above and beyond the endogenous activation by FBP.

### Inborn disorders of the malate aspartate shuttle [^a72e0a67]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

Metabolic flux through NAD + ‐dependent pathways affects cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD + /NADH ratios. Glycolysis is an important NAD + dependent pathway that both affects and is affected by the cytosolic NAD + /NADH ratio. For glycolysis to continue, a high NAD + /NADH ratio is required for the conversion of glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate into 1,3‐bisphosphoglycerate by glyceraldehyde 3‐phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, EC 1.2.1.12), in which NAD + is converted into NADH.Re‐oxidation of NADH can either be accomplished via the conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, EC 1.1.1.27) or by the conversion of oxaloacetate into malate by MDH1 (Figure 2). Converting glucose into lactate consumes and regenerates an equal amount of NAD +,,and additionally results in the production of 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. However, re‐oxidation of NADH via MDH1, and the subsequent transfer of reducing equivalents to the ETC, coupled with the transfer of pyruvate across the mitochondrial membrane and its subsequent full oxidation to CO 2 and H 2 O, results in the production of 36 ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Therefore, re‐oxidation of NADH via the MAS provides more energy as it supports both glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration.In addition, sufficient NAD + regeneration is also necessary for oxidative synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids, such as serine. The first step of serine biosynthesis is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH, EC 1.1.1.95), another NAD + ‐dependent enzyme. The synthesis of serine from glucose includes two oxidative steps catalyzed by GAPDH and PHGDH, requiring two molecules of NAD +. Therefore, other metabolic pathways that need serine, including synthesis of cysteine, glycine, but also one‐carbon metabolism, indirectly require NAD +.The MAS plays an essential role in redox balance and consequently in the continuation of the metabolic pathways mentioned earlier.

### Metabolites as drivers and targets in rheumatoid arthritis [^83849187]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Figure 1: 
Overview of the main metabolic pathways: Glucose enters the cell via glucose transporters and enters the glycolytic pathway. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) converts glucose into Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Glycolysis generates pyruvate from glucose with the help of Pyruvate Kinase M2 (PKM2). This process generates energy in the form of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP). Pyruvate is then either converted to lactate and secreted out of the cell or decarboxylated by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and converted to Acetyl CoA which enters the Tricarboxylic Acid (TCA) cycle. The TCA cycle generates NADH, FADH2 to feed into the Electron Transport Chain (ETC), which produces 36 molecules of ATP. Glycolysis also feeds into the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) at the level of G6PD to produce ribose, NADPH, and amino acids. Amino acid metabolism can also feed into the TCA cycle to drive ATP production by the ETC, amino acids such as Glutamine can have further downstream effects. TCA intermediate citrate drives fatty acid synthesis while fatty acid oxidation drives TCA cycle further by generating Acetyl CoA. Citrate and Succinate can act as ‘immunometabolites’. Citrate can also be converted to Itaconate via the enzymatic activity of IRG1 (ACOD1). This figure was created using biorender.com.

### Insulin directly stimulates mitochondrial glucose oxidation in the heart [^317053c5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate derived from glucose (glucose oxidation) is a major source of acetyl CoA for the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and reducing equivalents for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in the heart. Insulin plays a crucial role in cardiac energy metabolism by orchestrating the contribution of oxidative substrates, including glucose and fatty acids, to cardiac ATP production. Insulin causes a switch in cardiac energy substrate preference, by stimulating glucose oxidation and inhibiting fatty acid oxidation. Insulin indirectly stimulates glucose oxidation via increasing glucose uptake and subsequent glycolysis that increases pyruvate supply for mitochondrial glucose oxidation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex, the rate-limiting enzyme of glucose oxidation. In the heart, glucose uptake is mainly mediated by the role glucose transporter 1 and 4 (GLUT1 and GLUT4), which behave differently following insulin stimulation. GLUT4 (the insulin sensitive glucose transporter) translocates from the endosome stores to the sarcolemmal membrane for glucose assimilation following insulin stimulation, while GLUT1 is more localized in the cytosol and less dominant in the sarcolemma. GLUT1 is less responsive to insulin but can be activated by 5′AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Increased glucose uptake drives glycolysis to convert glucose to pyruvate. Pyruvate is then taken up by the mitochondria through the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) to be oxidized by PDH. The activity of PDH is largely regulated by its phosphorylation status and it is active when it is dephosphorylated. The PDH complex can be phosphorylated and inhibited by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), while it can be dephosphorylated and activated by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP).

It has also been shown that insulin can directly stimulate glucose oxidation independent of enhancing glucose uptake or glycolysis. The hallmark of this direct stimulation of glucose oxidation by insulin is the dephosphorylation and activation of the mitochondrial PDH complex. However, the exact mechanism through which the insulin signal is transmitted from the cell membrane to the mitochondria to activate the PDH complex has not been previously elucidated. The mouse heart has high glycolytic rates that are almost maximized even in the absence of insulin. Because of this, insulin does not have dramatic effects on glucose uptake and glycolysis in the mouse heart. Despite this, insulin still directly stimulates cardiac glucose oxidation, independent of any change in glucose uptake or glycolysis rates [–,,]. How insulin directly stimulates glucose oxidation in the heart is presently not known. However, because of the high insulin-independent glycolytic rates, the mouse heart provides a valuable tool to examine how insulin stimulates glucose oxidation in the heart independent of pyruvate supply to the mitochondria.

### How does type 1 diabetes develop?: the notion of homicide or β-cell suicide revisited [^006c6ebc]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

FIG. 4. 
The pancreatic β-cell’s “metabolic wiring” is uniquely geared to generate secondary signals. Glucose enters the β-cell by the GLUT2 transporter, where it is phosphorylated by glucokinase and channeled to glycolysis. The combination of GLUT2 and glucokinase (with their Km values in the mmol/L range) sense glucose in the physiologic range that is unique to only a few nutrient-sensing cells in the body. Also relatively unique to β-cells is a negligible amount of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the plasma membrane lactate/pyruvate transporter (MCT), so that the pyruvate resulting from glycolysis is channeled to the trichloroacetic acid cycle in the mitochondria. To counter for this, there is unusually high pyruvate carboxylase (PC) activity in β-cells to accompany pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). To rebalance β-cell redox in the absence of LDH/MCT, there is an increase in mitochondrial shuttle activities, particularly the glycerol-phosphate and malate-aspartate shuttles. Mitochondrial oxidative activity by the trichloroacetic acid cycle and electron transport chain generates [ATP] that is comparable to the glycolytic flux relative to increased circulating glucose. A byproduct of increased mitochondrial oxidative activity is a rise in oxygen radicals that can be converted to H 2 O 2 in mitochondria by superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD2). But β-cells cannot dispose of H 2 O 2 very well because they are uniquely deficient in catalase in their peroxisomes. An increase in ATP production in β-cells leads to a rise in the adenosine 5´-triphosphate (ATP)/adenosine 5´-diphosphate (ADP) ratio that shuts the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, which consists of the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) and Kir6.2 subunits. The consequential decreased efflux of K + results in a depolarization of the β-cell’s plasma membrane, and voltage-sensitive Ca 2+ -channels open, increasing cytosolic [Ca 2 +] i. The rise in [Ca 2+] i is the major trigger to induce insulin secretory granule exocytosis for release of insulin to the circulation. The rise in [Ca 2+] i can also activate Ca 2+ /calmodulin–activated adenylate cyclases (type I, II, or VIII) to increase the cell’s [cAMP] i levels, which is an augmentation signal to potentiate the Ca 2+ -induced insulin secretion.

### Molecular characterization of insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production in vivo [^3172bc7b]. Diabetes (2010). Low credibility.

We estimated net hepatic gluconeogenic (NHGNG) flux by subtracting glycolytic flux from gluconeogenic flux-to-G6P. GNG flux-to-G6P was determined by taking the sum of net hepatic uptake rates of gluconeogenic precursors (alanine, glycine, serine, threonine, glutamine, glutamate, glycerol, lactate, and pyruvate) and dividing by 2 to account for the incorporation of two three-carbon precursors into one six-carbon glucose molecule. Glycolytic flux was estimated by taking the sum of the net hepatic output rates (when present) of the gluconeogenic substrates noted above (in glucose equivalents) and hepatic glucose oxidation (assumed to be 0.2 ± 0.1 mg · kg −1 · min −1). We have verified that glucose oxidation remains at a low and constant rate across wide variations in physiological parameters. Positive NHGNG flux reflects net GNG flux-to-G6P, whereas negative values represent net glycolytic flux to CO 2 or lactate. Net hepatic glycogenolytic flux was estimated by subtracting NHGNG flux from net hepatic glucose balance. Positive net hepatic glycogenolytic flux reflects net glycogen breakdown, and negative values represent net glycogen synthesis.

There are several assumptions required when using the A-V difference technique in assessment of GNG flux-to-G6P. For example, this method assumes that substrate flux is unidirectional at any given point in time. There is negligible production of gluconeogenic amino acids or glycerol by the liver, so for these substrates, the compromise is of little consequence. Predominantly gluconeogenic periportal and glycolytic perivenous hepatocytes could simultaneously take up and release lactate, respectively, which could lead to an underestimation of GNG flux-to-G6P. It must be noted that simultaneous lactate uptake and release would not, however, affect our estimation of NHGNG flux or net hepatic glycogenolytic flux. NHGNG flux and net hepatic glycogenolytic flux estimations are subject to error to the degree that intrahepatic GNG amino acids contribute to the formation of G6P. The method also assumes 100% conversion of the GNG amino acids taken up by the liver into G6P (they are not oxidized or used in the synthesis of proteins). Errors arising from the assumptions are difficult to assess but appear to be minimal, as simultaneous assessment of GNG flux using the A-V difference technique and other independent methods (that are not subject to the same assumptions) yielded similar estimates of GNG flux.

### Disrupting proton dynamics and energy metabolism for cancer therapy [^58a7947c]. Nature Reviews: Cancer (2013). Medium credibility.

Intense interest in the 'Warburg effect' has been revived by the discovery that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) reprogrammes pyruvate oxidation to lactic acid conversion; lactic acid is the end product of fermentative glycolysis. The most aggressive and invasive cancers, which are often hypoxic, rely on exacerbated glycolysis to meet the increased demand for ATP and biosynthetic precursors and also rely on robust pH-regulating systems to combat the excessive generation of lactic and carbonic acids. In this Review, we present the key pH-regulating systems and synthesize recent advances in strategies that combine the disruption of pH control with bioenergetic mechanisms. We discuss the possibility of exploiting, in rapidly growing tumours, acute cell death by 'metabolic catastrophe'.

### Don't ‘ forget the krebs cycle': new findings in cancer metabolism (...) [^1d147d30]. ASCO Daily News (2024). Medium credibility.

Key Points:
- The Krebs cycle is an important series of reactions that release the energy stored in nutrients into the form of ATP.
- Although the Krebs cycle has earned a reputation as being abstract and irrelevant to cancer research and clinical practice, recent advances in metabolic science are challenging these ideas and highlighting the significance of cancer metabolism. However, as accelerating science in the past decade has shown, I—like thousands of trainees—was dead wrong. The Krebs cycle—more properly called the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle—refers to a series of reactions that release the energy stored in nutrients into the form of ATP. As scientist Nick Lane states in his elegant book.

In addition to the key process of “cellular respiration, ” the Krebs cycle supplies much of the basic building material needed for the cell, including most amino acids, long-chain lipid molecules important for cell membranes, and even nucleotides. That derangements in metabolism are fundamental to cancer has been known since the beginning of modern biochemistry. Indeed, Hans Krebs’ own mentor, Otto Warburg, showed that cancer cells used glucose to generate lactate via aerobic glycolysis, even in the presence of ample oxygen. This “Warburg effect” is the basis of the widely ordered PET scan, which detects increased consumption of glucose by cancer cells for 1 clinical linkage. A string of recent discoveries has explained underlying causes for the Warburg effect. 2 One well-known explanation is the creation of intermediate products via glycolysis to support synthesis of nucleotides, lipids, and amino acids needed to support the wildfire-like cellular proliferation seen in malignancy.

The tricarboxylic acid cycle also functions as a “key anabolic hub” supporting tumor growth. Furthermore, metabolites can act as signaling molecules and promote tumor growth. Even more fascinating, the metabolism of nonmalignant cells in the tumor microenvironment, including endothelial cells, fibroblasts, various immune cells, and possibly even platelets, can further modulate tumor progression. A recent analysis of the TME in pancreatic cancer—which is very nutrient-deprived and has low vascularity—shows that cancer cells are able to use uridine as a fuel in glucose-deprived conditions.

### Pivotal role of exogenous pyruvate in human natural killer cell metabolism [^62ae2012]. Nature Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Resting natural killer (NK) cells display immediate effector functions after recognizing transformed or infected cells. The environmental nutrients and metabolic requirements to sustain these functions are not fully understood. Here, we show that NK cells rely on the use of extracellular pyruvate to support effector functions, signal transduction and cell viability. Glucose-derived carbons do not generate endogenous pyruvate. Consequently, NK cells import extracellular pyruvate that is reduced to lactate to regenerate glycolytic NAD + and is oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to produce ATP. This supports serine production through phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, a pathway required for optimal proliferation following cytokine stimulation but dispensable for effector functions. In addition, like mouse NK cells, human NK cells rely on a citrate-malate configuration of the TCA cycle that is not fed by glutamine. Moreover, supraphysiologic pyruvate concentrations dose-dependently increase the effector functions of NK cells. Overall, this study highlights the role of exogenous pyruvate in NK cell biology, providing knowledge that could be exploited to boost NK cell potential in therapeutic settings.

### Glutamine deprivation stimulates mTOR-JNK-dependent chemokine secretion [^60780bdd]. Nature Communications (2014). Medium credibility.

Reprogramming of molecular and metabolic pathways involved in intermediate metabolism is now recognized as a hallmark of cancer. Oncogenic signals drive constitutive cell growth and proliferation, and place heavy demands on the pathways responsible for providing the metabolic building blocks needed for the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and other macromolecules. To meet the increased demand for biosynthetic precursors, cancer cells increase uptake of glucose and other nutrients, and shift overall metabolism from bioenergy (ATP) production and cell maintenance activities to anabolic processes that support cell mass accumulation and mitotic cell division.

The shift toward anabolic metabolism is exemplified by the altered catabolism of glucose in tumour tissues. Normal, non-proliferating cells primarily convert glucose to pyruvate via glycolysis. Pyruvate is then imported into the mitochondria, where it is converted into acetyl CoA for entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The glucose-derived carbon is then completely oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and ATP. In contrast, tumour cells reduce pyruvate to lactate for export from the cells. The glycolytic breakdown of glucose to lactate in oxygenated tumour tissues is termed the Warburg effect. In addition to lactate, glycolysis generates intermediates that fuel anabolic metabolism via the pentose-phosphate and serine biosynthesis pathways. Similarly, the TCA cycle is involved in both energy production and in the generation of building blocks for protein and lipid biosynthesis. The diversion of glucose-derived carbon away from the mitochondria, together with the withdrawal of TCA cycle intermediates for biosynthetic reactions, creates a carbon deficit in the TCA cycle that must be corrected by entry of carbon from other sources, a process termed anaplerosis. These and other alterations in nutrient uptake and utilization in transformed cells have spawned considerable interest in cancer metabolism as a promising area for the discovery of novel antitumour agents.

### Lower glycolysis carries a higher flux than any biochemically possible alternative [^348fb275]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Flux calculation

We used the method mentioned in ref.to calculate the flux carried by a linear pathway. This method assumes that the flux through reaction i is given by

where k d is the diffusion-controlled rate constant, [E i] is the enzyme concentration, [S i −1] and [S i] represent substrate and product concentrations and q i is the thermodynamic constant. This expression assumes that the enzyme acts as a perfect catalyst, and is used to derive an expression for pathway flux and metabolite concentrations (see Supplementary Methods for details). We then use Powell's methodto find the set of enzyme concentrations that maximize the flux subject to the constraints that (i) all steady-state intermediate concentrations are within the prescribed range and (ii) the total enzyme concentration is fixed. We also repeat our analysis using reversible Michaelis–Menten kinetics, see Supplementary Methods for details of calculation.

Sampling the parameter space

We randomly selected 10,000 points from the parameter space corresponding to the concentrations of 11 external metabolites and the G3P and pyruvate concentrations. Each parameter was sampled logarithmically over a range covering several orders of magnitude above and below its typical physiological concentrations (see Supplementary Table 4 for details). For each of these points, we calculated the optimized flux J i of each candidate pathway as detailed above, and computed the CF of path i as CF i = J i /max{ J k }, by dividing its flux by the highest flux obtained across all pathways at the given point in parameter space.

Robustness of our results to small free energy changes

Using the group contribution method, the typical error in our calculation of the free energy of formation Δ f G for a given molecule is a few kJ mol −1 (see Supplementary Methods for details). To check the robustness of our results to such errors, our entire analysis was repeated using Δ f G values computed using different sets of training molecules, consisting of 80% of the molecules from the original training set, chosen at random. The qualitative results using such networks were identical from those obtained from the full set of training compounds. For example, the top 25 glycolytic pathways obtained from the reduced set contained 23 out of the 25 pathways from the original analysis.

### Q-flux: a method to assess hepatic mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, and glutaminase fluxes in vivo [^2228ee2e]. Cell Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The mammalian succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex has recently been shown as capable of operating bidirectionally. Here, we develop a method (Q-Flux) capable of measuring absolute rates of both forward (V SDH(F) ) and reverse (V SDH(R) ) flux through SDH in vivo while also deconvoluting the amount of glucose derived from four discreet carbon sources in the liver. In validation studies, a mitochondrial uncoupler increased net SDH flux by >100% in awake rodents but also increased SDH cycling. During hyperglucagonemia, attenuated pyruvate cycling enhances phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase efficiency to drive increased gluconeogenesis, which is complemented by increased glutaminase (GLS) flux, methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT) flux, and glycerol conversion to glucose. During hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, both pyruvate carboxylase and GLS are suppressed, while V SDH(R) is increased. Unstimulated MUT is a minor anaplerotic reaction but is readily induced by small amounts of propionate, which elicits glucagon-like metabolic rewiring. Taken together, Q-Flux yields a comprehensive picture of hepatic mitochondrial metabolism and should be broadly useful to researchers.

### Glycolysis-derived alanine from glia fuels neuronal mitochondria for memory in drosophila [^06cc3ac0]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain; however, it remains controversial whether, upon neuronal activation, glucose is primarily used by neurons for ATP production or if it is partially oxidized in astrocytes, as proposed by the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle model for glutamatergic neurons. Thus, an in vivo picture of glucose metabolism during cognitive processes is missing. Here, we uncover in Drosophilamelanogaster a glia-to-neuron alanine transfer involving alanine aminotransferase that sustains memory formation. Following associative conditioning, glycolysis in glial cells produces alanine, which is back-converted into pyruvate in cholinergic neurons of the olfactory memory center to uphold their increased mitochondrial needs. Alanine, as a mediator of glia-neuron coupling, could be an alternative to lactate in cholinergic systems. In parallel, a dedicated glial glucose transporter imports glucose specifically for long-term memory, by directly transferring it to neurons for use by the pentose phosphate pathway. Our results demonstrate in vivo the compartmentalization of glucose metabolism between neurons and glial cells during memory formation.

### Bone metabolism-an underappreciated player [^e6414e04]. Npj Metabolic Health and Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

Bone cells and energy metabolism

Bone cells use various metabolic pathways, such as carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and amino acid metabolism, to obtain energy for their survival, differentiation, and function (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2 
Energy metabolism.

In bone cells, energy is generated by interconnected metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), glutaminolysis, and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Glucose is the primary energy and carbon source for bone growth and development. The transportation of glucose by glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins occurs spontaneously along a concentration gradient, without the need for energy. Once inside the cell, glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) by hexokinase, which can then be used to generate glycogen or enter the glycolytic pathway to generate pyruvate. Glycolysis coupled with lactic acid fermentation and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the most important high-energy chemical in the body. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can also convert glucose to lactate independently of oxygen through aerobic glycolysis. The glucose 6-phosphate, produced early in glycolysis, can be directed towards the pentose phosphate pathway, leading to nucleotide synthesis, or it can contribute to the serine synthesis pathway, which is important for amino acid production. The serine biosynthetic pathway, which generates methyl groups for DNA and histone methylation, is also vital for one-carbon metabolism. OXPHOS occurs in the mitochondria and is the final metabolic pathway for all oxidative steps in carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acid catabolism. The electron carriers NAD+ and NADP+ drive the ETC for oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in the production of ATP. The Krebs cycle, also known as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), is the primary metabolic pathway that produces energy in cells and provides reduced co-factors and metabolic intermediates. Acetyl CoA, derived from pyruvate, is also supplied by the TCA cycle and acts as a central hub to promote intracellular lipid synthesis. Parallel to these processes, glutamine is metabolized through glutaminolysis, contributing to the pool of substrates necessary for energy production and biosynthesis in bone cells.

### Effects of hypoglycaemia on neuronal metabolism in the adult brain: role of alternative substrates to glucose [^c63902d6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2013). Low credibility.

Hypoglycaemia is characterized by decreased blood glucose levels and is associated with different pathologies (e.g. diabetes, inborn errors of metabolism). Depending on its severity, it might affect cognitive functions, including impaired judgment and decreased memory capacity, which have been linked to alterations of brain energy metabolism. Glucose is the major cerebral energy substrate in the adult brain and supports the complex metabolic interactions between neurons and astrocytes, which are essential for synaptic activity. Therefore, hypoglycaemia disturbs cerebral metabolism and, consequently, neuronal function. Despite the high vulnerability of neurons to hypoglycaemia, important neurochemical changes enabling these cells to prolong their resistance to hypoglycaemia have been described. This review aims at providing an overview over the main metabolic effects of hypoglycaemia on neurons, covering in vitro and in vivo findings. Recent studies provided evidence that non-glucose substrates including pyruvate, glycogen, ketone bodies, glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate, are metabolized by neurons in the absence of glucose and contribute to prolong neuronal function and delay ATP depletion during hypoglycaemia. One of the pathways likely implicated in the process is the pyruvate recycling pathway, which allows for the full oxidation of glutamate and glutamine. The operation of this pathway in neurons, particularly after hypoglycaemia, has been re-confirmed recently using metabolic modelling tools (i.e. Metabolic Flux Analysis), which allow for a detailed investigation of cellular metabolism in cultured cells. Overall, the knowledge summarized herein might be used for the development of potential therapies targeting neuronal protection in patients vulnerable to hypoglycaemic episodes.

### Metabolic flexibility as an adaptation to energy resources and requirements in health and disease [^afa23014]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

The metabolic reprogramming that underlies increased glucose consumption for use in glycolysis, as opposed to OXPHOS, is known as the Warburg effect. In 1924, Otto Warburg discovered that cancer cells metabolize glucose differently than cells of normal tissues: that even in conditions of sufficient oxygen availability, cancer cells convert glucose into lactate instead of using glucose for OXPHOS. Warburg hypothesized that cancer cells have mitochondrial defects and impaired aerobic respiration that forces them to rely on glycolysis. Today, we understand that mitochondrial respiration is not impaired but that cancer cells place emphasis on acquisition and generation of building blocks necessary for cell division. They do so by enhancing biosynthetic metabolism using glycolytic intermediates. Increased glucose uptake and metabolism is very often mediated by the oncogenic signaling protein Ras, which activates the PI3K/Akt pathway. PI3K/Akt signaling increases the expression of GLUT1 and its translocation to the cell surface, and enhances HK and phosphofructokinase activity, thus capturing glucose and increasing glycolytic flux. Interestingly, glucose catabolism in cancer cells is partially uncoupled from the TCA cycle and OXPHOS because increased activity of PDK dampens glucose metabolism through negative feedback on PDH. A glycolytic switch involving differential expression of pyruvate kinase isoforms and stabilization of HIF1 α upregulates rate-limiting enzymes within branching pathways of glycolysis, ensuring that glycolytic intermediates are free to take part in diverse biosynthetic reactions that are essential for increased proliferation. These alternative pathways include the PPP using glucose-6-phosphate, hexosamine biosynthesis using fructose-6-phosphate, phospholipid biosynthesis using dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and glycine and serine biosynthesis using 3-phosphoglycerate. The PPP is chiefly used for NADPH and ribose synthesis to produce nucleotides. Of particular significance is serine production because it is a major substrate for the folate/one-carbon cycle whose metabolites contribute to various cellular biosynthetic and regulatory processes. Lactate, produced from glycolysis, is excreted from the cell or used in biosynthetic reactions such as aspartate synthesis. Aspartate is used to support protein and nucleotide synthesis in proliferating cells and sustains proliferation in the face of OXPHOS impairment. Even TCA cycle intermediates are not solely used to produce NADH for mitochondrial respiration, but intermediates can also be used to form nonessential amino acids and fatty acids, which facilitate protein synthesis, membrane construction and cholesterol synthesis.

### Metabolic and transcriptomic reprogramming during contact inhibition-induced quiescence is mediated by YAP-dependent and YAP-independent mechanisms [^ec0ab872]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Glucose, a major nutrient of most mammalian cells, is metabolized in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the hexosamine pathway, and subsequently in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Glycolysis converts glucose into precursor metabolites for amino acid and fatty acid synthesis and generates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). In glycolysis, 2 ATP and 2 NAD + are consumed, with the production of 4 ATP, 2 NADH, and 2 pyruvates per molecule of glucose. As glycolysis requires NAD +, the recycling of NADH back into NAD + is pivotal for optimum glycolytic flux. The PPP utilizes glucose for the production of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), which are required for redox homeostasis and fatty acid and nucleotide synthesis, respectively. Pyruvate is further oxidized in the TCA cycle and generates additional NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH 2), which in turn generate more ATP in the electron transport chain (ETC) in mitochondria. Mitochondrial NADH is oxidized upon donating its electrons to complex I (NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the ETC, and mitochondrial NAD + is generated. As both glycolysis and the TCA cycle are oxidative pathways, the oxidized form, NAD +, serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in these pathways, and NADH is produced. Then, NADH produced by the TCA cycle links it to cellular energy generation, carrying electrons to the ETC on the inner mitochondrial membrane. As the TCA cycle and ETC require NAD + and NADH, respectively, an optimal NAD + /NADH ratio is needed for efficient mitochondrial metabolism.

### Non-canonical control of neuronal energy status by the naPump [^2c774bfc]. Cell Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurons have limited intracellular energy stores but experience acute and unpredictable increases in energy demand. To better understand how these cells repeatedly transit from a resting to active state without undergoing metabolic stress, we monitored their early metabolic response to neurotransmission using ion-sensitive probes and FRET sensors in vitro and in vivo. A short theta burst triggered immediate Na + entry, followed by a delayed stimulation of the Na + /K + ATPase pump. Unexpectedly, cytosolic ATP and ADP levels were unperturbed across a wide range of physiological workloads, revealing strict flux coupling between the Na + pump and mitochondria. Metabolic flux measurements revealed a "priming" phase of mitochondrial energization by pyruvate, whereas glucose consumption coincided with delayed Na + pump stimulation. Experiments revealed that the Na + pump plays a permissive role for mitochondrial ATP production and glycolysis. We conclude that neuronal energy homeostasis is not mediated by adenine nucleotides or by Ca 2+ , but by a mechanism commanded by the Na + pump.

Hyperglycolysis and glutaminolysis: a response to impaired oxidative glucose metabolism.

Created with BioRender.com 1. Impaired glucose metabolism in neurons necessitates the recruitment of an alternative fuel source for the TCA cycle. 2. In astrocytes, glycolysis metabolizes glucose to form pyruvate. 3. Pyruvate is carboxylated by the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase to form oxaloacetate in a process known as anaplerosis. 4. Oxaloacetate is then used in the TCA cycle to eventually form alpha-ketoglutarate. Alpha-ketoglutarate is converted into glutamate by a transaminase reaction. Within astrocytes, glutamate is then converted into glutamine. 5. Glutamine is released from astrocytes and taken up by neurons, where it can be converted back into glutamate. Glutamate is then converted into alpha-ketoglutarate to replenish TCA cycle intermediates and generate ATP in a process called glutaminolysis. Glucose, β-Hydroxybutyric acid, and glutamate may all serve as energy substrates for the TCA cycle via conversion to TCA cycle intermediates. Under conditions of impaired glucose metabolism, β-Hydroxybutyric acid can be used as an alternative fuel source for the TCA cycle, preventing the need for increased glutamate metabolism and avoiding associated excitotoxicity in the brain.

### Metabolic reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma: mechanisms and therapeutic implications [^03bfd3be]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1 
Rewired glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway in HCC.

The significant shift in glucose metabolism within HCC cells, characterized by upregulated expression of key enzymes that enhance glucose uptake and utilization. These changes include increased levels of GLUT1 and HK2, which elevate glucose uptake; PKM2, which increases augments pyruvate formation; and LDH, which facilitates the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, supporting anaerobic glycolysis. The diagram also highlights the activation of the PPP, a crucial metabolic pathway that provides R5P for nucleotide synthesis and NADPH for lipid synthesis and antioxidant defense. In HCC, the PPP is often enhanced, as indicated by increased activity of enzymes such as G6PD and TKT. Enzymes with increased expression in HCC are marked in red, denoting their upregulation and pivotal roles in cancer metabolism.

The GLUT1–4 family of transporters enables the uptake of glucose across the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm. The comparative analysis of GLUT1 (refs. [,) and GLUT2 (ref.) expression in HCC and surrounding tissue reveals a correlation of elevated GLUT1 levels with poor prognosis. Upon entering the cell, glucose undergoes an irreversible conversion to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), resulting in a significant increase in the levels of G6P in HCC tumors compared with the surrounding liver tissue. This conversion is facilitated by a group of enzymes referred to as HKs. HK4 is the HK isoform normally expressed in hepatocytes, but HK2 is often upregulated in HCC and is closely linked to the clinical stage of the disease and the prognosis of patients,. The enhanced ability of HK2 to boost aerobic glycolysis, compared with other HK isoforms, can be attributed to its binding the voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein-1 located in the mitochondrial membrane. This interaction increases access to mitochondrially generated ATP,. Thus, hepatic HK2 deletion inhibits tumorigenesis and increases cell death both in vitro and in vivo,. The last enzyme in glycolysis is PK, which transfers phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP to yield ATP and pyruvate. The M2 isoform of PK (PKM2) is observed mainly in rapidly proliferating cellsand has been correlated with tumor formation in HCC,,. The conversion of pyruvate to lactate is facilitated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and elevated levels of LDHin the bloodstream have been linked to poor progression-free survival in patients with HCC. Indeed, high levels of LDH and secreted lactate are common features of HCC.

Figure 1. 
Schematic representation of the action of AG-348 on the enzyme pyruvate kinase in the final step of the glycolytic degradation of glucose in red blood cells (RBC). Glycolysis, the first step in cellular respiration begins with one glucose molecule (6 carbons) which is subsequently broken down in a series of enzymatic steps via ten enzymes into two pyruvic acid molecules (2 carbons) as well as releasing adenosine triphosphate and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. The schemes on both sides (normal RBC metabolism and in pyruvate kinase deficiency) begin with the formation of 1,3 biphosphoglycerate after several enzymatic steps of phosphorylation and molecular arrangements. 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-BPG), also known as 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (2,3-DPG) (allosteric affecter of hemoglobin), is a three-carbon isomer of the glycolytic intermediate 1,3-BPG. The final critical step in this reaction pathway involves the formation of pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate, a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme pyruvate kinase. The red cell in the center of the figure where these reactions occur is shown with two important receptors, Glut 1 and band 3, which play key roles in glucose transport and metabolism. The small molecule AG-348 penetrates the red cell and activates the enzyme pyruvate kinase.

### Defining a metabolic landscape of tumours: genome meets metabolism [^0eb24675]. British Journal of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Pan-cancer metabolic gene expression data highlight metabolic reprogramming patterns across tissues

Genome instability, mutations and metabolic reprogramming are hallmarks of cancer. However, little is known about how each of these influence one another. One way to delineate this is by understanding the transcriptional outcome. Uniquely positioned, the transcriptional output is directly downstream of genomic instability, mutations and upstream of metabolic pathways. Although transcriptomic data can provide useful insights into metabolic gene expression, it does not reflect metabolic regulation or directionality of metabolic flux. Keeping these limitations of transcriptomic data in mind, it is still possible to identify valuable information about the dysregulation of metabolic pathways in different types of tumours and infer their relationship with tumour-driver mutations.

The availability of large pan-cancer genomic and transcriptomic annotated datasets permits ready comparisons of native tissues and cancer samples. They provide a global view of metabolic remodelling throughout different cancers, as well as how they diverge from native tissue. – RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas across 26 cancer types and normal tissues, and microarray data from 22 primary tumour types and the corresponding normal tissues have revealed differential expression of metabolic genes, confirming a global role of altered metabolism in cellular transformation (see Table 1). Importantly, while metabolic expression patterns differ significantly between normal tissues, they are less marked between tumours from different sites, suggesting some commonality of cancer metabolism. However, strong similarities between tumours and their native tissues also provide evidence for some tissue-specific metabolic hard wiring. This analysis demonstrates that glycolysis is among either the most dysregulatedor frequently and significantly upregulated, pathways in most cancer types (see Table 1). These results are consistent with the increased glucose uptake observed in many tumours, which is extensively used for tumour diagnostics by positron emission tomography (PET) scans.Increased glucose catabolism through glycolysis into lactate even under normal oxygen conditions, termed aerobic glycolysis, has been considered as a general phenomenon of tumours, stemming from the initial observation by Otto Warburg in 1927. However, it is also observed in normal proliferating cells.Aerobic glycolysis yields less ATP than its full oxidation through oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), providing the subject for a long-time discussion about its role in proliferating cells. Metabolic modelling and calculating energy and biosynthetic demands of proliferating cells suggest that when cells need both energy and biomass produced at a fast rate, aerobic glycolysis serves to overcome the limited capacity of mitochondrial OxPhos to oxidise NADH, and uncouples the production of NADH from biosynthetic processes.Pan-cancer studies also consistently demonstrate that together with glycolysis, there are other pathways for macromolecular biosynthesis and biomass build-up, which are frequently and significantly upregulated in many of the cancer samples in comparison with normal tissues, such as purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, and aminoacyl-t-RNA biosynthesis (see Table 1). Interestingly, the expression of the Krebs cycle and OxPhos genes demonstrates heterogenous behaviour between cancer types,, suggesting that the role of OxPhos is not universal across different cancers and can be determined by the environmental cues or tissue-specific functions of genetic and signalling drivers, which are discussed further in this review.

### Glucose metabolism after traumatic brain injury: estimation of pyruvate carboxylase and pyruvate dehydrogenase flux by mass isotopomer analysis [^ac04ba27]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2007). Low credibility.

The metabolism of [1, 2 (13)C(2)] glucose via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle yields a number of key glutamate mass isotopomers whose formation is a function of pyruvate carboxylase (PC) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). Analysis of the isotopomer distribution patterns was used to determine the relative flux of glucose entry into the TCA cycle through anaplerotic and oxidative pathways in the cerebral cortex of both uninjured and traumatically injured adult male rats. In the cerebral cortex of uninjured animals the PC/PDH ratio showed greater metabolism of glucose via pyruvate carboxylase, which is consistent with the notion that the majority of glucose taken up at rest is used as a substrate for anaplerotic processes and not as an energy source. While traumatic brain injury did not change the overall (13)C enrichment of glutamate indicating a continued oxidation of glucose, the PC/PDH ratio was reduced in the injured cortex at 3.5 h after injury. This suggests that glucose metabolism is primarily directed through pathways associated with energy production in the early postinjury period. By 24 h, the anaplerotic flux decreased and the PC/PDH ratio increased in both the injured and non-injured cortex indicating a switch away from energy production to pathways associated with anabolic and/or regenerative processes.

### Probing carbohydrate metabolism using hyperpolarizedC-labeled molecules [^91843ed4]. NMR in Biomedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Glycolysis is a fundamental metabolic process in all organisms. Anomalies in glucose metabolism are linked to various pathological conditions. In particular, elevated aerobic glycolysis is a characteristic feature of rapidly growing cells. Glycolysis and the closely related pentose phosphate pathway can be monitored in real time by hyperpolarized 13 C-labeled metabolic substrates such as 13 C-enriched, deuterated D-glucose derivatives, [2- 13 C]-D-fructose, [2- 13 C] dihydroxyacetone, [1- 13 C]-D-glycerate, [1- 13 C]-D-glucono-δ-lactone and [1- 13 C] pyruvate in healthy and diseased tissues. Elevated glycolysis in tumors (the Warburg effect) was also successfully imaged using hyperpolarized [U- 13 C 6 , U- 2 H 7 ]-D-glucose, while the size of the preexisting lactate pool can be measured by 13 C MRS and/or MRI with hyperpolarized [1- 13 C]pyruvate. This review summarizes the application of various hyperpolarized 13 C-labeled metabolites to the real-time monitoring of glycolysis and related metabolic processes in normal and diseased tissues.

### Is cancer a metabolic disease? [^67a38fc9]. The American Journal of Pathology (2014). Low credibility.

Although cancer has historically been viewed as a disorder of proliferation, recent evidence has suggested that it should also be considered a metabolic disease. Growing tumors rewire their metabolic programs to meet and even exceed the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of continuous cell growth. The metabolic profile observed in cancer cells often includes increased consumption of glucose and glutamine, increased glycolysis, changes in the use of metabolic enzyme isoforms, and increased secretion of lactate. Oncogenes and tumor suppressors have been discovered to have roles in cancer-associated changes in metabolism as well. The metabolic profile of tumor cells has been suggested to reflect the rapid proliferative rate. Cancer-associated metabolic changes may also reveal the importance of protection against reactive oxygen species or a role for secreted lactate in the tumor microenvironment. This article reviews recent research in the field of cancer metabolism, raising the following questions: Why do cancer cells shift their metabolism in this way? Are the changes in metabolism in cancer cells a consequence of the changes in proliferation or a driver of cancer progression? Can cancer metabolism be targeted to benefit patients?

### Aerobic glycolysis fuels platelet activation: small-molecule modulators of platelet metabolism as anti-thrombotic agents [^96e893e9]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Platelets are critical to arterial thrombosis, which underlies myocardial infarction and stroke. Activated platelets, regardless of the nature of their stimulus, initiate energy-intensive processes that sustain thrombus, while adapting to potential adversities of hypoxia and nutrient deprivation within the densely packed thrombotic milieu. We report here that stimulated platelets switch their energy metabolism to aerobic glycolysis by modulating enzymes at key checkpoints in glucose metabolism. We found that aerobic glycolysis, in turn, accelerates flux through the pentose phosphate pathway and supports platelet activation. Hence, reversing metabolic adaptations of platelets could be an effective alternative to conventional anti-platelet approaches, which are crippled by remarkable redundancy in platelet agonists and ensuing signaling pathways. In support of this hypothesis, small-molecule modulators of pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase M2 and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, all of which impede aerobic glycolysis and/or the pentose phosphate pathway, restrained the agonist-induced platelet responses ex vivo These drugs, which include the anti-neoplastic candidate, dichloroacetate, and the Food and Drug Administration-approved dehydroepiandrosterone, profoundly impaired thrombosis in mice, thereby exhibiting potential as anti-thrombotic agents.

### Structure of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier and its inhibition mechanism [^0c5a97c6]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

The mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) governs the entry of pyruvate-a central metabolite that bridges cytosolic glycolysis with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-into the mitochondrial matrix 1-5 . It thus serves as a pivotal metabolic gatekeeper and has fundamental roles in cellular metabolism. Moreover, MPC is a key target for drugs aimed at managing diabetes, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and neurodegenerative diseases 4-6 . However, despite MPC's critical roles in both physiology and medicine, the molecular mechanisms underlying its transport function and how it is inhibited by drugs have remained largely unclear. Here our structural findings on human MPC define the architecture of this vital transporter, delineate its substrate-binding site and translocation pathway, and reveal its major conformational states. Furthermore, we explain the binding and inhibition mechanisms of MPC inhibitors. Our findings provide the molecular basis for understanding MPC's function and pave the way for the development of more-effective therapeutic reagents that target MPC.

Advances in cancer biology have highlighted metabolic reprogramming as an essential aspect of tumorigenesis and progression. However, recent efforts to study tumor metabolism in vivo have identified some disconnects between in vitro and in vivo biology. This is due, at least in part, to the simplified nature of cell culture models and highlights a growing need to utilize more physiologically relevant approaches to more accurately assess tumor metabolism. In this review, we outline the evolution of our understanding of cancer metabolism and discuss some discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo conditions. We describe how the development of physiological media, in combination with advanced culturing methods, can bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo metabolism.

AN OVERVIEW OF INTRINSIC CELLULAR METABOLISM

To face anabolic demands and supply the required energy for homeostasis, cells undergo metabolic reprogramming. Mitochondria play an essential role in this process, by oxidizing glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids and by linking the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 2).

FIGURE 2 
Main intrinsic metabolic pathways. Glucose enters the cell through glucose transporters and is converted into pyruvate through glycolysis. In parallel to glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway generates ribose 5 phosphate for the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids. Pyruvate is either converted into lactate or is oxidized in acetyl coA, fueling the TCA cycle inside the mitochondria and giving rise to NADH and FADH2 that can also be produced by fatty acid oxidation. Fatty acid synthesis produces fatty acids from acetyl coA derived either from glycolysis or from citrate. The TCA cycle can also be fueled by amino acids through glutaminolysis.

### Glucose metabolism in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure [^c8093e7e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Glucose Metabolism in the Heart

The heart is an omnivore, consuming fuel constantly and using any substrate available. 8 The high rates of ATP production and turnover are critical in maintaining cardiac contractility to deliver blood and oxygen to the other organs. Under normal conditions, cardiac ATP is mainly derived from fatty acid (FA) oxidation (FAO), with glucose metabolism contributing less. However, under stress conditions, FAO may be reduced, which is concomitant with increased glucose utilization. 9 Glucose uptake in cardiomyocytes is mediated by glucose transporters (GLUTs), with GLUT1 and GLUT4 as the most abundant isoforms. 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 Whereas GLUT1 is highly expressed in the fetal heart, GLUT4 is predominant in the adult heart. Inside cardiac myocytes, glucose may be first phosphorylated to glucose 6‐phosphate by hexokinase or converted to sorbitol by the polyol pathway. Glucose 6‐phosphate subsequently goes through multiple metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP; Figure 1). 6 Pathological alterations of these pathways in cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic heart disease are associated with impaired signaling transduction, perturbed ion and redox homeostasis, and contractile dysfunction.

Polyol pathway‐derived sorbitol and fructose may be converted tos or fructose 6‐P for glycolytic use. Intracellular glucose can be phosphorylated to glucose 6‐phosphate by hexokinase. Glucose 6‐phosphate is then metabolized bv multiple pathways, including glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, and hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. In the cytosol, pyruvate can be utilized to form alanine or lactate. In mitochondria, pyruvate is converted to acetyl‐CoA for the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

Main

Enhancement of glycolysis

The liver plays a central role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. The body stores glucose in the form of glycogen during periods of surplus and subsequently releases glucose into the circulatory system when blood glucose levels decrease, thereby mediating glucose homeostasis. During periods of fasting or heightened energy requirements, the liver releases glucose via glycogen catabolism. In HCC, there is a marked reliance on glycolysis for energy production, even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. This shift from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis allows HCC cells to efficiently produce energy in oxygen-rich environments, typical of anaerobic metabolism. Key glycolytic genes, including those encoding glucose transporters (GLUTs), hexokinase (HK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), are differentially expressed in HCC, leading to increased glucose uptake and metabolism (Fig. 1).

### Reflections on the application of 13C-MRS to research on brain metabolism [^8c79a75f]. NMR in Biomedicine (2003). Low credibility.

The power of (13)C-MRS lies in its unique chemical specificity, enabling detection and quantification of metabolic intermediates which would not be so readily monitored using conventional radiochemical techniques. Examples from animal studies, by examination of tissue extracts from the whole brain, brain slices and cultured cells, include observation of intermediates such as citrate and triose phosphates which have yielded novel information on neuronal/glial relationships. The use of (13)C-labelled acetate as a specific precursor for glial metabolism provided evidence in support of the view that some of the GABA produced in the brain is derived from glial glutamine. Such studies have also provided direct evidence on the contribution of anaplerotic pathways to intermediary metabolism. Analogous studies are now being performed on the human brain, where (13)C-acetate is used to quantitate the overall contribution of glial cells to intermediary metabolism, and use of (13)C-glucose enables direct calculation of rates of flux through the TCA (F(TCA)) and of the glutamate-glutamine cycle (F(CYC)), leading to the conclusion that the rate of glial recycling of glutamate accounts for some 50% of F(TCA). The rate of 0.74 micromol min(-1) g(-1) for F(TCA) is compatible with PET rates of CMRglc of 0.3-0.4 micromol min(-1) g(-1) (since each glucose molecule yields two molecules of pyruvate entering the TCA). Our brain activation studies showed a 60% increase in F(TCA), which is very similar to the increases in CBF and in CMRglc observed in PET activation studies.

### Sodium pyruvate, inosine, adenine, sodium phosphate, dibasic, and sodium phosphate, monobasic, monohydrate (rejuvesol) [^0f338b66]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

A gradual depletion of red blood cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) occurs with storage of RBC at 1-6 °C.1The level of 2,3-DPG in RBC stored for greater than 14 days is less than 10% of normal1,2,12,17,18. Rejuvenation of RBC with rejuvesol Solution increases the levels of ATP and 2,3-DPG.1-5,8,13,17-22,24, 25

An in vitro loss of red blood cells occurs with the preservation and processing of RBC. Thus, the effectiveness of a transfusion is influenced by both the total number of red blood cells transfused and the number of those cells which remain in circulation. Therefore, the "dose" of a transfusion is defined as the percentage of pre-transfusion recovered red blood cells multiplied by the 24 hour post-transfusion survival value.

Rejuvenation is accomplished by incubating the contents of one 50 mL vial of rejuvesol Solution with one unit of RBC (prepared from up to 550 mL of whole blood) for sixty (60) minutes at 37 °C. Citra recommends that the entire 50 mL of rejuvesol Solution be added to a "smaller than normal" RBC as long as the prerejuvenation net packed cell weight is greater than 110 grams.1,9

### Targeting glucose metabolism: an emerging concept for anticancer therapy [^d2613850]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Mortality from locally advanced and metastatic cancer remains high despite advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease and improved adjuvant therapies. Recently, there has been an increased interest in cancer metabolomics, and in particular, the potential for targeting glucose metabolism, for therapeutic gain. This interest stems from the fact that cancer cells metabolize glucose very differently from normal cells. Cancer cells preferentially switch to aerobic glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation as their means of glucose metabolism. This metabolic switch is believed to enhance cancer cell survival. Several therapeutic agents that target tumor metabolism have shown significant cancer cell cytotoxicity in preclinical studies, and some have progressed to clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the alteration of carbohydrate metabolism seen in cancer cells, the underlying mechanisms, and opportunities for targeting cancer metabolism for therapeutic purposes.

### Aerobic glycolysis fuels platelet activation: small-molecule modulators of platelet metabolism as anti-thrombotic agents [^bd36334a]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

The Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis would require enhanced uptake of glucose by the cells in order to sustain adequate ATP generation by glycolysis. In keeping with this and an earlier report,we observed surface translocation of cytosolic GLUT3, the major glucose transporter, in thrombin-stimulated platelets. As already observed for neuronal cells,GLUT3 externalization in platelets was facilitated by AMPK, whose activity is known to be upregulated by agonist stimulation.Enhanced surface expression of GLUT3 was corroborated by a nearly 2-fold rise in the uptake of glucose in thrombin-activated platelets. In parallel there was enhanced secretion of lactate into medium, which was in line with earlier reports of extracellular acidification induced by agonists. –

The metabolic checkpoint at the level of pyruvate, which is generated by the enzymatic activity of pyruvate kinase, determines whether glucose will be catabolized to lactate (by glycolysis) or through mitochondrial pathways. The enzyme PDH, part of a larger complex, catalyzes conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, which is then channeled into the TCA cycle for further oxidation and generation of ATP. Reactions catalyzed by PDH and pyruvate kinase are thus two critical hubs in the landscape of cellular glucose metabolism. PDH activity is regulated through inhibitory serine-293 phosphorylation by the enzyme PDK.An increase in the activity of PDK and/or reduced PDH activity restricts flux of pyruvate into the TCA cycle and favors aerobic glycolysis. Inhibitory phosphorylation of PDH is known to be induced by AMPK under conditions of nutrient-deprivation.We observed an increase in phosphorylated PDH in agonist-stimulated platelets, which was reversed by inhibition of AMPK activity. Notably, we also discovered that platelets express PKM2, a tissue-specific isoform of pyruvate kinase, which, in low-activity state, facilitates aerobic glycolysis.Phosphorylation of PKM2 at Y105 is associated with sustenance of a dimer state with attenuated catalytic activity.Interestingly, agonist stimulation of platelets also led to increased expression of phosphorylated PKM2, which could be reduced to a basal level by inhibition of Src family kinases. Thus, we show here that metabolism in stimulated platelets switches to aerobic glycolysis through active regulation of PDH and PKM2; this switch leads to accumulation of glycolytic intermediates upstream of pyruvate and facilitates flux through the PPP.Consistent with this we observed significant enrichment in the pool of NADPH, a direct readout of the PPP, in thrombin-stimulated platelets.

### Glucose metabolism and metabolic flexibility in blood platelets [^0a0dfd9e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2018). Low credibility.

Essentials The metabolic integration processes required for platelet activation are unclear. The metabolic plasticity of human platelets were investigated. Activated platelets exhibit a glycolytic phenotype while preserving mitochondrial function. Platelets can switch freely between glucose/glycogen and fatty acids to support aggregation. SUMMARY: Background Platelet activation is an energy-dependent process, but the type and integrated use of metabolic fuels required to drive activation remain unclear. Objective To dissect the metabolic fuel and pathway plasticity required for platelet activation. Methods Platelet oxygen consumption rate and extracellular acidification rate were measured as markers of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis, respectively. Glucose and glycogen were quantified by enzyme-coupled fluorometric assay. Results Blood platelets switched freely between glycolysis and OXPHOS, using either glucose or fatty acids at rest. The transition of platelets from a quiescent to an activated state promoted rapid uptake of exogenous glucose, associated with a shift to a predominantly glycolytic phenotype coupled with a minor rise in mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Consistent with this metabolic plasticity, under nutrient-limiting conditions, platelets utilized glucose, glycogen or fatty acids independently to support activation. Importantly, the glycolytic switch occurred even in the absence of extracellular glucose, originating from endogenous glycogen. Focusing on the relative flexibility of mitochondrial fuel oxidation of glucose and fatty acids, we found that inhibition of oxidation of a single fuel was compensated for by increased oxidation of the other, but, when oxidation was inhibited, glycolysis was upregulated. Glutamine made little contribution to mitochondrial oxygen consumption. Analysis of platelet functional dependency on ATP from different pathways demonstrated that inhibition of both fuel oxidation and glycolysis were required to prevent agonist-driven platelet activation. Conclusion Platelets have significant metabolic fuel and pathway flexibility, but preferentially use glycolysis for ATP generation when activated.

### Application of isotopic techniques using constant specific activity or enrichment to the study of carbohydrate metabolism [^49a6bd4a]. Diabetes (2009). Low credibility.

Tracer choice and its effects on measurement of glucose flux.

An important assumption underling tracer methodology is that the label used in a given tracer does not recycle into the compartment being studied after it leaves the compartment with the tracee. If this is the case, Ra will be progressively underestimated as more and more isotope recycles back into the pool being measured. Glucose tracers typically use a hydrogen isotope on the 2nd, 3rd, or 6th carbon. The label is lost to water at different points during glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, leading to potential differences in Ra measurement depending on the tracer used.

In the case of glucose labeled on the 2nd carbon, the isotope will be lost in the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate (assuming that the isomerase reaction is much more active compared with the formation of glucose-6-phosphate) and reconversion to glucose-6-phosphate. This results in overestimation of glucose utilization. Since the glucose/glucose-6-phosphate cycle results in hydrolysis of ATP but without glucose metabolism, this has been termed futile cycling.

On the other hand, label is lost from the 3rd carbon after cleavage of fructose-6-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G-3P). The label is present on the 1st carbon of DHAP but is then lost after isomerization to G-3P.

In the case of glucose labeled on the 6th carbon, label is lost from the 6th carbon after entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The action of uridine-diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase causes loss of tritium from carbon 6 when uracil-diphosphate (UDP)-glucose reenters glucose metabolism. Another potential mechanism by which the label on the 6th carbon is lost is when glucose is metabolized to fructose biphosphate and then recycles back to glucose. A variety of (in vitro) studies have demonstrated that futile cycling can occur at the fructose-6-phosphate/fructose diphosphate level (–). However, in vivo studies suggest that in postabsorptive humans, futile cycling at this level is insignificant. The use of 6,6- 2 H 2 -glucose as a tracer overcomes some of these problems, as the 6- 2 H 1 -glucose product of recycling can be distinguished from the underlying tracer.

### Intracellular metabolic gradients dictate dependence on exogenous pyruvate [^0df4e65b]. Nature Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

During developmental transitions, cells frequently remodel metabolic networks, including changing reliance on metabolites such as glucose and glutamine to fuel intracellular metabolic pathways. Here we used embryonic stem (ES) cells as a model system to understand how changes in intracellular metabolic networks that characterize cell state transitions affect reliance on exogenous nutrients. We find that ES cells in the naive ground state of pluripotency increase uptake and reliance on exogenous pyruvate through the monocarboxylate transporter MCT1. Naive ES cells, but not their more committed counterparts, rely on exogenous pyruvate even when other sources of pyruvate (glucose, lactate) are abundant. Pyruvate dependence in naive ES cells is a consequence of their elevated mitochondrial pyruvate consumption at the expense of cytosolic NAD + regeneration. Indeed, across a range of cell types, increased mitochondrial pyruvate consumption is sufficient to drive demand for extracellular pyruvate. Accordingly, restoring cytosolic NAD + regeneration allows naive ES cells to tolerate pyruvate depletion in diverse nutrient microenvironments. Together, these data demonstrate that intracellular metabolic gradients dictate uptake and reliance on exogenous pyruvate and highlight mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism as a metabolic vulnerability of naive ES cells.

Tumors are metabolically heterogeneous, and subpopulations of tumorigenic cells have been recently described to rely more on mitochondrial respiration than glycolysis for energy production. In this issue, Sancho et al. (2015) demonstrate that MYC is a master switch regulating metabolic programs in different subpopulations of pancreatic tumor cells.

### SREBP activity is regulated by mTORC1 and contributes to akt-dependent cell growth [^e35c32c6]. Cell Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

The serine/threonine kinase Akt (PKB/c-Akt) promotes cell growth (i.e. accumulation of cell mass) predominantly through activation of complex 1 of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTORC1). mTORC1 is regulated by both nutrients and growth factors and plays a conserved role in cell growth control. Glucose uptake and induction of glycolysis by Akt have been studied in the context of the metabolic effects of insulin signaling on cellular and organismal levels. However, the contribution of anabolic pathways other than protein biosynthesis to cell growth have only been considered recently.

Akt regulates cell metabolism through several downstream targets. Akt stimulates glucose uptake via induction of translocation of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane and by increasing expression of GLUT1. Akt promotes conversion of glucose into pyruvate through the glycolytic pathway by increasing the expression of glycolytic enzymes and by phosphorylating and activating hexokinase 2 (HK2). Pyruvate can either be converted into lactate, or it can enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), where it is fully oxidized to generate ATP. In liver and adipose tissue, glucose is converted via pyruvate and citrate into lipids.

### Therapeutic targeting of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex / pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDC / PDK) axis in cancer [^2f9c3614]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2017). Low credibility.

The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) irreversibly decarboxylates pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A, thereby linking glycolysis to the tricarboxylic acid cycle and defining a critical step in cellular bioenergetics. Inhibition of PDC activity by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK)-mediated phosphorylation has been associated with the pathobiology of many disorders of metabolic integration, including cancer. Consequently, the PDC/PDK axis has long been a therapeutic target. The most common underlying mechanism accounting for PDC inhibition in these conditions is post-transcriptional upregulation of one or more PDK isoforms, leading to phosphorylation of the E1α subunit of PDC. Such perturbations of the PDC/PDK axis induce a "glycolytic shift," whereby affected cells favor adenosine triphosphate production by glycolysis over mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and cellular proliferation over cellular quiescence. Dichloroacetate is the prototypic xenobiotic inhibitor of PDK, thereby maintaining PDC in its unphosphorylated, catalytically active form. However, recent interest in the therapeutic targeting of the PDC/PDK axis for the treatment of cancer has yielded a new generation of small molecule PDK inhibitors. Ongoing investigations of the central role of PDC in cellular energy metabolism and its regulation by pharmacological effectors of PDKs promise to open multiple exciting vistas into the biochemical understanding and treatment of cancer and other diseases.

### Recent developments in the use of pyruvate kinase activators as a new approach for treating sickle cell disease [^003e7617]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pyruvate kinase (PK) is a key enzyme in glycolysis, the sole source of adenosine triphosphate, which is essential for all energy-dependent activities of red blood cells. Activating PK shows great potential for treating a broad range of hemolytic anemias beyond PK deficiency, because they also enhance activity of wild-type PK. Motivated by observations of sickle-cell complications in sickle-trait individuals with concomitant PK deficiency, activating endogenous PK offers a novel and promising approach for treating patients with sickle-cell disease.

### Glycine homeostasis requires reverse SHMT flux [^6b790962]. Cell Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

The folate-dependent enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) reversibly converts serine into glycine and a tetrahydrofolate-bound one-carbon unit. Such one-carbon unit production plays a critical role in development, the immune system, and cancer. Using rodent models, here we show that the whole-body SHMT flux acts to net consume rather than produce glycine. Pharmacological inhibition of whole-body SHMT1/2 and genetic knockout of liver SHMT2 elevated circulating glycine levels up to eight-fold. Stable-isotope tracing revealed that the liver converts glycine to serine, which is then converted by serine dehydratase into pyruvate and burned in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In response to diets deficient in serine and glycine, de novo biosynthetic flux was unaltered, but SHMT2- and serine-dehydratase-mediated catabolic flux was lower. Thus, glucose-derived serine synthesis is largely insensitive to systemic demand. Instead, circulating serine and glycine homeostasis is maintained through variable consumption, with liver SHMT2 a major glycine-consuming enzyme.

### Serine is a natural ligand and allosteric activator of pyruvate kinase M2 [^e9937cd6]. Nature (2012). Excellent credibility.

Cancer cells exhibit several unique metabolic phenotypes that are critical for cell growth and proliferation. Specifically, they overexpress the M2 isoform of the tightly regulated enzyme pyruvate kinase (PKM2), which controls glycolytic flux, and are highly dependent on de novo biosynthesis of serine and glycine. Here we describe a new rheostat-like mechanistic relationship between PKM2 activity and serine biosynthesis. We show that serine can bind to and activate human PKM2, and that PKM2 activity in cells is reduced in response to serine deprivation. This reduction in PKM2 activity shifts cells to a fuel-efficient mode in which more pyruvate is diverted to the mitochondria and more glucose-derived carbon is channelled into serine biosynthesis to support cell proliferation.

### Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications in cancer: from the impacts and mechanisms to the treatment potential [^34ebf5e2]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Glucose metabolism

Glucose is the main source of energy for cell proliferation. Glucose metabolism includes the glycolytic pathway, pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and serine synthesis pathway (SSP) in the cytoplasm, as well as oxidative phosphorylation, that is, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), in mitochondria. Glycolysis is the common process through which glucose is metabolized. Pyruvate, a metabolic product of glycolysis, can be converted to lactate and secreted out of a cell, or it can enter the mitochondria for consumption in the TCA. The intermediate products from glycolysis can enter the PPP pathway and SSP pathway. Warburg first discovered that cancer cells produce lactic acid through glycolysis to provide energy even when the oxygen level is sufficient for oxidative phosphorylation; this metabolic feature of cancer cells is called the “Warburg effect” or “aerobic glycolysis”. This change in the glucose metabolism pathway is the most common and representative phenotype of the glucose metabolism change in cancer cells and constitutes the main driving factor in cancer progression. Research has shown that abnormal metabolism in cancer cells is related to abnormal expression of the proto-oncogenes cMyc, KRAS, and BRAF. cMyc regulates the expression of most glycolytic enzymes, thereby transforming the metabolism of cancer cells from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, and abnormal expression of cMyc drives serine synthesis pathway activation in tumors under nutrient-deficient conditions. Oncogene KRAS mutations alter cancer cell metabolism by inducing upregulated transcription of glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the main regulatory factor in glucose metabolism in the hypoxic microenvironment of tumor cells. HIF-1a enhances hypoxia-related glycolysis in cancer cells by activating the expression of multiple glycolytic enzymes, which is crucial for the growth and proliferation of cancer cells under hypoxic conditions –. In addition, the stability and activity of HIFs are affected by the TCA cycle, electron transport chain components, mitochondrial respiration, and mitochondrion-associated proteins. Activation of HIF is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, including the oxidative capacity in mitochondria, biogenesis, apoptosis, and autophagy. Glycolysis is an important carbon process in cancer cell metabolism, providing nutrients for the unlimited proliferation of cancer cells. The intermediates of glycolysis are consumed to promote the biosynthesis of biomolecules, such as nucleotides, amino acids, and fats. Glycolysis leads to high levels of accumulated lactic acid in the tumor microenvironment. Lactate is a signaling molecule in cancer, regulating inflammation and immune responses in tumors. In addition, enhanced aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells promotes angiogenesis. Abnormal glucose metabolism as a hallmark of cancer has been used in clinical diagnostics and treatment. For example, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) has been widely used in tumor diagnosis, exploiting the difference between glucose metabolism in tumors and normal tissues,. Specifically, glucose metabolism provides preferential targets for cancer therapy. Tumor growth can be limited by inhibiting glycolysis; for example, the ruthenium-based anticancer compound BOLD-100 targets glycolysis and renders cells vulnerable to glucose-deficient metabolism.

### Altered glycolysis triggers impaired mitochondrial metabolism and mTORC1 activation in diabetic β-cells [^8807c402]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Chronic hyperglycaemia causes a dramatic decrease in mitochondrial metabolism and insulin content in pancreatic β-cells. This underlies the progressive decline in β-cell function in diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which hyperglycaemia produces these effects remain unresolved. Using isolated islets and INS-1 cells, we show here that one or more glycolytic metabolites downstream of phosphofructokinase and upstream of GAPDH mediates the effects of chronic hyperglycemia. This metabolite stimulates marked upregulation of mTORC1 and concomitant downregulation of AMPK. Increased mTORC1 activity causes inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase which reduces pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and partially accounts for the hyperglycaemia-induced reduction in oxidative phosphorylation and insulin secretion. In addition, hyperglycaemia (or diabetes) dramatically inhibits GAPDH activity, thereby impairing glucose metabolism. Our data also reveal that restricting glucose metabolism during hyperglycaemia prevents these changes and thus may be of therapeutic benefit. In summary, we have identified a pathway by which chronic hyperglycaemia reduces β-cell function.

### Sources of plasma glucose by automated Bayesian analysis of 2H NMR spectra [^75572511]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Sources of blood glucose can be determined after oral ingestion of (2)H(2)O followed by isolation of plasma glucose and measurement of the relative (2)H enrichments in select positions within the glucose molecule. Typically, (2)H enrichments are obtained by mass spectrometry but (2)H NMR offers an alternative. Here it is demonstrated that the entire analysis may be automated by Bayesian analysis of a (2)H free induction decay signal of monoacetone glucose to obtain a direct readout of the relative contributions of glycogenolysis, glycerol, and phosphoenol pyruvate to plasma glucose production. Furthermore, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of the posterior probability density provide uncertainties in all metabolic parameters from a single patient, thereby allowing comparisons in glucose metabolism from one individual to another. The combined MCMC Bayesian methodology is operationally simple and requires little intervention from the operator.

### Probing human heart TCA cycle metabolism and response to glucose load using hyperpolarized [ 2-C ] pyruvate MRS [^d93bb33b]. NMR in Biomedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The healthy heart has remarkable metabolic flexibility that permits rapid switching between mitochondrial glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation to generate ATP. Loss of metabolic flexibility has been implicated in the genesis of contractile dysfunction seen in cardiomyopathy. Metabolic flexibility has been imaged in experimental models, using hyperpolarized (HP) [2- 13 C]pyruvate MRI, which enables interrogation of metabolites that reflect tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux in cardiac myocytes. This study aimed to develop methods, demonstrate feasibility for [2- 13 C]pyruvate MRI in the human heart for the first time, and assess cardiac metabolic flexibility.

Methods

Good manufacturing practice [2- 13 C]pyruvic acid was polarized in a 5T polarizer for 2.5-3h. Following dissolution, quality control parameters of HP pyruvate met all safety and sterility criteria for pharmacy release, prior to administration to study subjects. Three healthy subjects each received two HP injections and MR scans, first under fasting conditions, followed by oral glucose load. A 5cm axial slab-selective spectroscopy approach was prescribed over the left ventricle and acquired at 3s intervals on a 3T clinical MRI scanner.

Results

The study protocol, which included HP substrate injection, MR scanning, and oral glucose load, was performed safely without adverse events. Key downstream metabolites of [2- 13 C]pyruvate metabolism in cardiac myocytes include the glycolytic derivative [2- 13 C]lactate, TCA-associated metabolite [5- 13 C]glutamate, and [1- 13 C]acetylcarnitine, catalyzed by carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT). After glucose load, 13 C-labeling of lactate, glutamate, and acetylcarnitine from 13 C-pyruvate increased by an average of 39.3%, 29.5%, and 114% respectively in the three subjects, which could result from increases in lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and CAT enzyme activity as well as TCA cycle flux (glucose oxidation).

Conclusions

HP [2- 13 C]pyruvate imaging is safe and permits noninvasive assessment of TCA cycle intermediates and the acetyl buffer, acetylcarnitine, which is not possible using HP [1- 13 C]pyruvate. Cardiac metabolite measurement in the fasting/fed states provides information on cardiac metabolic flexibility and the acetylcarnitine pool.

### Using a synthetic machinery to improve carbon yield with acetylphosphate as the core [^ae3ce7ff]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In microbial cell factory, CO 2 release during acetyl-CoA production from pyruvate significantly decreases the carbon atom economy. Here, we construct and optimize a synthetic carbon conserving pathway named as Sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase Cycle with Trifunctional PhosphoKetolase (SCTPK) in Escherichia coli. This cycle relies on a generalist phosphoketolase Xfspk and converts glucose into the stoichiometric amounts of acetylphosphate (AcP). Furthermore, genetic circuits responding to AcP positively or negatively are created. Together with SCTPK, they constitute a gene-metabolic oscillator that regulates Xfspk and enzymes converting AcP into valuable chemicals in response to intracellular AcP level autonomously, allocating metabolic flux rationally and improving the carbon atom economy of bioconversion process. Using this synthetic machinery, mevalonate is produced with a yield higher than its native theoretical yield, and the highest titer and yield of 3-hydroxypropionate via malonyl-CoA pathway are achieved. This study provides a strategy for improving the carbon yield of microbial cell factories.

### Imaging cancer metabolism: underlying biology and emerging strategies [^3bc34c8c]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

MECHANISMS OF CELLULAR METABOLIC DYSREGULATION

The field of cancer metabolism has been reinvigorated over the past decade with transformative advances in our understanding of the biology underlying altered glucose metabolism. The fundamental role of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in effecting these alterations has been established, with such genetic alterations now known to coordinate a complex rewiring of cellular metabolism. For example, the serine/threonine kinase AKT, activated at the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, promotes localization of the glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) to the cell surface and increases hexokinase activity, both of which support increased glucose metabolism. The oncogenes KRAS and BRAF are known to increase Glut1 transcript expression and protein levels in colorectal cancer cell lines, with a resultant increase in glucose uptake and lactate formation. The c-Myc transcription factor, encoded by the c-Myc oncogene, increases lactate dehydrogenase-A expression through a direct interaction with its promoter. The lactate dehydrogenase-A enzyme converts pyruvate to lactate, providing a molecular mechanism for the final step of the Warburg hypothesis. In addition to genetic mutations, the tumor microenvironment plays an important role in modulating gene expression, emphasizing context-dependent metabolic alterations. In response to low oxygen tension, the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α drives the expression of several target genes involved in glucose transport and glycolysis, including the Glut1 transporter. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 directs pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis, away from the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) through transcriptional activation of lactate dehydrogenase-A and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 inactivates pyruvate dehydrogenase to mitigate the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl–coenzyme A (CoA). These alterations in glucose transport and gene expression exemplify elements of a concerted program of glycolytic flux modulation leading to the generation of lactate and, in turn, suggesting the importance of alternative fuels to maintain other necessary cellular pathways.

### Pyruvate in organ transplantation [^dfd28e56]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2001). Low credibility.

Pyruvate (PY) is a 3-carbon compound present in human tissues and physiologically used by cells as an energetic substrate in anaerobic conditions. In the last few years, we have successfully used PY to protect small bowel (SB), liver, and kidneys from ischemia/reperfusion injury in several experimental models. Although the mechanism of protection is not fully clarified, we have shown increased tissue levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during ischemia. This suggests that providing supra-physiologic concentrations of PY during anaerobic glycolysis might enable the cells to remain viable during prolonged hypoxia. Furthermore, mechanisms such as direct inhibition of oxygen free radical formation, abrogation of neutrophilic infiltration and reduced up-regulation of adhesion molecules have also been documented in these studies. In light of these findings, we evaluated the efficacy of PY in organ preservation and transplantation. We demonstrated a protective effect on intestinal preservation injury and during acute rejection. Oral PY treatment induced immunologic changes in rejecting allograft, inhibiting perforin and granzyme-b expression and leukocytic infiltration. Protection was also documented on livers after prolonged hypothermic preservation using a PY based preservation solution. Additionally, isolated pancreatic islets were cultured in PY enriched media and maintained viable for up to 120 days followed by in vitro testing and transplantation revealing a well preserved function. All these findings suggest that PY is a potentially beneficial nutrient in patients undergoing organ transplantation and that future clinical application of PY in this field should be encouraged.

### Glial glycolysis is essential for neuronal survival in drosophila [^183fceea]. Cell Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Neuronal information processing requires a large amount of energy, indicating that sugars and other metabolites must be efficiently delivered. However, reliable neuronal function also depends on the maintenance of a constant microenvironment in the brain. Therefore, neurons are efficiently separated from circulation by the blood-brain barrier, and their long axons are insulated by glial processes. At the example of the Drosophila brain, we addressed how sugar is shuttled across the barrier to nurture neurons. We show that glial cells of the blood-brain barrier specifically take up sugars and that their metabolism relies on glycolysis, which, surprisingly, is dispensable in neurons. Glial cells secrete alanine and lactate to fuel neuronal mitochondria, and lack of glial glycolysis specifically in the adult brain causes neurodegeneration. Our work implies that a global metabolic compartmentalization and coupling of neurons and glial cells is a conserved, fundamental feature of bilaterian nervous systems independent of their size.

### Uphill production of dihydrogen by enzymatic oxidation of glucose without an external energy source [^e0b7c2ea]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The free enthalpy, or Gibbs energy G, determines whether a chemical reaction can proceed spontaneously or whether an external energy input is needed. If the sum of the free enthalpies of a reaction system is positive, then the reaction can normally only proceed if an external energy source is provided. For instance, an external battery can raise the potential of an electron in an electrochemical process, or light can promote an electron in a reaction to a molecular state with a higher energy. However, for the vast majority of reactions, which proceed in a closed system, that means in the same reaction medium, this is not possible. One might therefore ask the very fundamental question whether energies released in an exergonic reaction can be added up to drive the formation of a higher energy endergonic reaction product of a smaller mole fraction in the one and the same medium. While it is straightforward to multiply the work in mechanical systems to raise the energy of a subsystem, this is far from trivial in a closed chemical system. It is therefore necessary to find means to transform energy from a first reaction and then use it to drive a second reaction where a higher energy product is formed. This is obviously possible if the two reactions occur in physically separated reservoirs, like in the case of a battery acting as a first reaction reservoir, driving an electrochemical reaction in a second reservoir. However, combining both reactions in one-and-the-same environment typically leads to a chemical short-circuit, because both electrochemical systems share the potential of the same electrical ground, with the result that thermodynamics forbids such an uphill reaction. For the same reason it is also not possible to connect several electricity delivering cells in series in the same medium in order to add their individual potential differences to obtain a globally higher value.
