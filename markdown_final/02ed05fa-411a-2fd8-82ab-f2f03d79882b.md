## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of vasospastic angina in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating vasospastic angina in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the first-line drug class and why it is preferred. Then, I should verify dosing ranges for individual calcium channel blockers and how to titrate. Next, I will consider combination therapy with long-acting nitrates and when to add them. After that, I need to check what to avoid, especially beta-blockers. Finally, I will integrate special populations, monitoring, and a practical algorithm, making sure each claim is supported by guidelines or FDA labeling.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: vasospastic angina is best treated with calcium channel blockers as first-line therapy because they suppress coronary smooth muscle calcium influx and prevent spasm, and this is consistently recommended by contemporary ESC and ACC/AHA guidance as well as contemporary reviews, so I should anchor on CCBs before discussing specifics [^71d838b2] [^0a788a14] [^688c04bd].

> I will now examine amlodipine, a dihydropyridine CCB, because it is commonly used and has clear labeling. The FDA-labeled dose for vasospastic angina is 5–10 mg once daily, with most patients requiring 10 mg for adequate effect, and in elderly or hepatically impaired patients it is reasonable to start at 2.5–5 mg and titrate cautiously, which aligns with multiple FDA sources and clinical summaries of the pivotal trial showing about a 4/week reduction in attacks versus placebo [^71c35ce5] [^4394773c] [^578e64b4] [^da052713] [^5bec2483].

> Wait, let me verify nifedipine dosing because formulations differ. For immediate-release nifedipine, the labeled regimen is 10 mg three times daily, titratable to 10–30 mg every 6–8 hours, with a maximum of 120 mg/day, whereas extended-release nifedipine is typically 30–60 mg once daily, also up to 120 mg/day, and both are FDA-indicated for vasospastic angina, so I should specify formulation when giving dosing advice [^3f1e6e3d] [^917c6aa4] [^0ff7e4c5].

> Next, I should review non-dihydropyridine CCBs. Diltiazem immediate-release is commonly dosed 30 mg four times daily with maintenance 180–360 mg/day in divided doses, while extended-release diltiazem can be started at 120–180 mg once daily with maintenance up to 480–540 mg/day, and verapamil is dosed 80–120 mg three times daily, all of which are supported by FDA labeling and guideline use in vasospastic angina, though I should note that non-DHPs carry conduction and negative inotropy risks and may be less suitable in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^2bb029a4] [^4a4dd184] [^d54ae7f0] [^344e2044] [^0cd10df1] [^7d0effbc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about monotherapy sufficiency. I need to check when to add long-acting nitrates. Guidelines recommend adding long-acting nitrates if symptoms persist despite optimized CCB therapy, and although nitrates are effective acutely, chronic nitrate benefit is less certain and tolerance can blunt efficacy, so I should frame nitrates as adjuncts rather than replacements for CCBs [^4b0bc8a2] [^64e7672b] [^101d1185] [^167e7a53].

> I should confirm what to avoid. Beta-blockers can precipitate or worsen coronary spasm in vasospastic angina and are generally contraindicated unless there is a compelling non-vasospastic indication, so I need to ensure we do not substitute a beta-blocker for a CCB in pure vasospastic phenotypes [^bbc8b01c] [^0a788a14] [^167e7a53].

> Let me consider special populations and titration cadence. In older adults or those with hepatic impairment, starting at the lower end of CCB dosing and titrating every 7–14 days is prudent, and in patients with concomitant hypertension, amlodipine or nifedipine may be advantageous, whereas patients with bradycardia or conduction disease may fare better with dihydropyridines than non-DHPs, which I should tailor case-by-case [^71c35ce5] [^ac29f4a0] [^7d0effbc].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. I need to ensure we reassess angina frequency, nitroglycerin use, blood pressure, heart rate, and adverse effects such as edema, flushing, headache, bradycardia, or conduction delays after each titration, and if symptoms persist despite high-dose CCBs, I should reconsider the diagnosis, evaluate adherence, and consider adding a long-acting nitrate or even dual CCB classes in refractory cases, recognizing that a minority will remain symptomatic despite optimal therapy [^167e7a53] [^7fa956dd].

> But wait, what if the presentation is mixed vasospasm with microvascular dysfunction. I should double-check that in mixed phenotypes, CCBs remain first-line and beta-blockers may still be problematic for spasm, while nitrates can be layered carefully, and in truly refractory cases, agents like nicorandil or cilostazol may be considered where available, acknowledging that much of the strongest evidence base is outside the U.S. and that guideline support varies by region [^7fa956dd] [^27d01bdb] [^b8f38a40].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with a CCB, choose amlodipine 5–10 mg daily or an ER nifedipine 30–60 mg daily for convenience and blood pressure benefit, or diltiazem ER 180–360 mg daily or verapamil 240–360 mg/day in divided doses if heart rate control is desired, titrate to effect over 1–2 weeks, add a long-acting nitrate if breakthrough symptoms persist, and avoid beta-blockers unless there is a separate compelling indication, adjusting for comorbidities and tolerability at each step [^71d838b2] [^0a788a14] [^4b0bc8a2] [^71c35ce5] [^917c6aa4] [^2bb029a4] [^344e2044].

> In summary, I should confirm that the core recommendation is calcium channel blockade as first-line, with amlodipine 5–10 mg daily, nifedipine ER 30–60 mg daily, or non-DHPs such as diltiazem ER 180–360 mg/day or verapamil 240–360 mg/day in divided doses, titrating to symptom control and tolerability, adding long-acting nitrates if needed and avoiding beta-blockers in pure vasospastic presentations, which aligns with contemporary ESC and ACC/AHA guidance and FDA labeling for the cited agents [^71d838b2] [^0a788a14] [^4b0bc8a2] [^71c35ce5] [^917c6aa4] [^2bb029a4] [^344e2044].

---

Calcium channel blockers are **first-line therapy** for vasospastic angina, with **amlodipine 5–10 mg once daily** as the preferred agent due to once-daily dosing and strong efficacy [^71d838b2] [^da052713]. If amlodipine is not tolerated or is ineffective, use **diltiazem 180–360 mg/day** in divided doses or **nifedipine ER 30–60 mg once daily** [^2bb029a4] [^917c6aa4]. Add long-acting nitrates (e.g. isosorbide mononitrate 30–60 mg once daily) if symptoms persist despite optimized CCB therapy [^4b0bc8a2] [^101d1185]. Avoid beta-blockers because they may worsen vasospasm [^bbc8b01c]. Titrate to effect and monitor for hypotension, edema, and bradycardia.

---

## First-line therapy: calcium channel blockers (CCBs)

CCBs are the cornerstone of vasospastic angina management because they **reduce coronary vasospasm** and ischemia [^71d838b2]. Both dihydropyridine (e.g. amlodipine, nifedipine) and non-dihydropyridine (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil) agents are effective [^7d0effbc].

| **Medication** | **Recommended dosage** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Amlodipine | 5–10 mg once daily | - Preferred for once-daily dosing <br/> - Titrate to 10 mg if needed [^71c35ce5] [^da052713] |
| Diltiazem | 180–360 mg/day in divided doses | Non-dihydropyridine; monitor for bradycardia and AV block [^2bb029a4] [^4a4dd184] |
| Nifedipine ER | 30–60 mg once daily | Extended-release preferred for adherence [^917c6aa4] [^b35e90f4] |

---

## Second-line therapy: long-acting nitrates

Long-acting nitrates are **added if symptoms persist** despite optimized CCB therapy [^4b0bc8a2]. They provide additional vasodilation and reduce spasm frequency [^101d1185].

- **Isosorbide mononitrate**: 30–60 mg once daily.
- **Isosorbide dinitrate**: 20–40 mg twice daily.

---

## Medications to avoid

Beta-blockers should be **avoided** because they may worsen coronary vasospasm by allowing unopposed alpha-adrenergic vasoconstriction [^bbc8b01c].

---

## Clinical considerations and monitoring

- **Titrate to effect**: Adjust CCB dosing based on symptom control and tolerability.
- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Hypotension, peripheral edema (especially with amlodipine), bradycardia, and AV block (with non-dihydropyridine CCBs).
- **Combination therapy**: Use CCBs with long-acting nitrates for refractory symptoms [^4b0bc8a2] [^101d1185].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **First-line**: Amlodipine 5–10 mg once daily; titrate to 10 mg if needed [^71c35ce5] [^da052713].
- **Alternatives**: Diltiazem 180–360 mg/day in divided doses or nifedipine ER 30–60 mg once daily [^2bb029a4] [^917c6aa4].
- **Second-line**: Add long-acting nitrates if symptoms persist despite optimized CCB therapy [^4b0bc8a2] [^101d1185].
- **Avoid**: Beta-blockers [^bbc8b01c].

---

Amlodipine 5–10 mg once daily is the **preferred first-line therapy** for vasospastic angina, with diltiazem or nifedipine ER as alternatives; add long-acting nitrates if needed and avoid beta-blockers.

### Angina severity and symptom improvement are associated with diagnostic acetylcholine provocation dose in vasospastic angina [^2d674e61]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results provide insight in prognostic stratification of patients with spasm, especially with regard to complaints. Patients with spasm at lower provocation dosage had anginal complaints more frequently at baseline and follow‐up and showed a trend toward lowest proportion of patients with improvement after 1 year. For this reason, more extensive guidance and additional antianginal therapy could be indicated as these patients might respond less to treatment.

Regardless of acetylcholine triggering dose, all patients with spasm have a significant burden of disease with mean SAQ angina frequency scores reflecting weekly angina and summary scores barely reflecting a "fair" health status, which are both worrisome features for this working‐age population.

For future studies, the linear association between diagnostic acetylcholine dose and complaints is of paramount importance. The dose at which spasm is diagnosed and changes hereof when assessed with follow‐up CFT could be used as a trial outcome or as an objective surrogate outcome for anginal complaints. As randomized clinical trial data in patients with ANOCA are sparse, this is an important methodological step for the setup of future trials.

Suggested Maximal Acetylcholine Dose

Because there is still a wide variety of dosage protocols used worldwide, there is no consensus of what acetylcholine incremental dosages to use. It has been suggested that a higher maximal dose does not increase diagnostic yield. However, our results contradict this suggestion with 151/509 (37%) of patients with vasospasm being diagnosed only after provocation with 200 mcg of acetylcholine. Furthermore, acetylcholine testing previously has proven to be safe. Therefore, we encourage keep ing the 200 mcg dose in acetylcholine spasm provocation protocols. Additionally, we show that high triggering dose patients with epicardial spasm have a more favorable profile than middle and low dose groups with regard to baseline complaints as well as improvement at follow‐up. If the favorable profile is truly a triggering dose effect or if other covariates (including use of medication) play a more important role remains to be further investigated.

### Angina severity and symptom improvement are associated with diagnostic acetylcholine provocation dose in vasospastic angina [^5ab3a0c9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Coronary vasomotor dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a cause of symptoms in patients with angina and no obstructive coronary artery disease (ANOCA). Performing an invasive coronary function test (CFT) to assess vasomotor function is recommended by current consensus documents and in the latest European Society of Cardiology guideline on chronic coronary syndromes. A CFT comprises both measurements of microcirculatory function as well as pharmacological spasm provocation, which has been proven to be safe. Furthermore, treatment based on CFT‐confirmed diagnosis has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life.

For the spasm provocation part of a CFT a wide variety of provocation protocols are being used, most frequently with acetylcholine as a pharmacological provocative. Acetylcholine has counteracting mechanisms of action, with a net vasodilating effect in healthy individuals but a potent vasoconstrictive effect in individuals with dysfunctional endothelium or hyperreactive smooth muscle cells. Especially for the maximal dosage of acetylcholine provocation, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal protocol. Although some advise a maximum of 100 mcg or less, others advocate a maximum of 200 mcg. The use of higher maximal dosages increases diagnostic yield, but it has been suggested that a supraphysiological provocation, with higher dosages of acetylcholine, could theoretically elicit coronary vasospasm even in individuals with normal functioning endothelium. Regardless of the diagnostic yield, evidence of severity of symptoms being dependent on provocative acetylcholine dose is lacking, as are data on the influence of triggering dose on treatment response. Assessment of anginal complaints at baseline and follow‐up of patients diagnosed with vasospasm, compared with controls who had a negative spasm provocation test, could provide more insight in the association between triggering dose and severity of complaints. This is especially important for clinical trials in ANOCA, where diagnostic acetylcholine dose might be a risk stratification factor or surrogate outcome for the severity of anginal complaints.

We hypothesize that an association between the diagnostic acetylcholine dose that triggers spasm and the severity of anginal complaints exists, possibly reflected by an increased frequency of anginal complaints, a reduced quality of life, or the experience of more physical limitations due to symptoms. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from patients in the NL‐CFT registry (Netherlands Registry of Invasive Coronary Vasomotor Function Testing) who were diagnosed with epicardial spasm following different acetylcholine triggering dosages. We compared them to patients with microvascular spasm as well as to controls with a normal CFT result, defined as a negative spasm provocation test and normal microvascular function.

### Angina severity and symptom improvement are associated with diagnostic acetylcholine provocation dose in vasospastic angina [^2ca81c86]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

A coronary function test (CFT) is the recommended diagnostic test to identify coronary vasomotor dysfunction as a cause of symptoms in patients with angina and nonobstructive coronary arteries (ANOCA). Acetylcholine is the commonly used pharmacological agent for spasm provocation. We aimed to investigate an association between severity of symptoms and provocative acetylcholine dose.

Methods and Results

We included ANOCA patients undergoing clinically indicated CFT from the Netherlands Registry of Invasive Coronary Vasomotor Function Testing: NL‐CFT. Patients with epicardial spasm (n = 251) were divided according to acetylcholine spasm triggering dose: low (2–20 mcg, EpiLOW), middle (100 mcg, EpiMIDDLE) or high (200 mcg, EpiHIGH). Patients with microvascular spasm (n = 157) were analyzed irrespective of triggering dose. The patient groups were compared to each other and to a control group with negative CFT results (n = 101). We assessed mean Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency and summary scores at baseline and follow‐up and the proportion of patients improving or deteriorating. An inverse relationship between provocation dosage and angina frequency at baseline was found in epicardial spasm: the lower the triggering dose, the more frequently patients experienced angina (EpiLOW 48 ± 20, EpiMIDDLE 53 ± 21, EpiHIGH 57 ± 19, microvascular spasm 61 ± 21, controls 64 ± 21, overall P = 0.003). A trend was seen toward most patients improving in the high triggering dose group, and most patients deteriorating in the low triggering dose group.

Conclusions

A significant dose‐dependent relationship between spasm provocation and anginal complaints exists. Acetylcholine provocation dose could be incorporated as a risk stratification factor or surrogate outcome in future clinical trials.

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (Caduet) [^6b9d01c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CADUET

Dosage of CADUET must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance for each individual component in the treatment of hypertension/angina and hyperlipidemia. Select doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin independently.

CADUET may be substituted for its individually titrated components. Patients may be given the equivalent dose of CADUET or a dose of CADUET with increased amounts of amlodipine, atorvastatin, or both for additional antianginal effects, blood pressure lowering, or lipid-lowering effect.

CADUET may be used to provide additional therapy for patients already on one of its components. CADUET may be used to initiate treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia and either hypertension or angina.

Important Dosage Information

Take CADUET orally once daily at any time of the day, with or without food.

Amlodipine

The usual initial antihypertensive oral dosage of amlodipine is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily.

Pediatric (age > 6 years), small adult, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine to other antihypertensive therapy.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.

Angina The recommended dosage of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5–10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.

Coronary Artery Disease The recommended dosage range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 5–10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Pediatrics The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 6–17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^b2303844]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronary artery vasospasm is an abnormal spasm of coronary arteries that cause transient or complete occlusion without exertion. It causes stable angina to ACS. However, this can be prevented by calcium channel blockers (CCBs) which suppress Ca²⁺ influx into the vascular muscle cells. Nevertheless, several CCBs adverse effects are harmful for these patients. Selecting the right CCBs would give the best clinical practice.

Method

The studies were obtained from four major medical databases by various keywords. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were implemented as adult > 18 years, observational study, English language and drug of interest. Duplicates were eliminated, and the remaining studies were reviewed. Final full-texts assessment was conducted independently by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Revised Cochrane.

Results

The search found 1378 articles. However, six studies were selected after implementing the study criteria. Diltiazem was found to decrease angina and increase quality of life until 12th week of treatment; however, some adverse effects include atrioventricular block and recurrent angina up till 4th week were found. Meanwhile, nifedipine was found to decrease vasospastic angina (VSA) by the fourth and eighth weeks of treatment. Nevertheless, it caused excessive drop in BP and increase heart rate by eighth week. In addition, slow-release preparation of both CCBs were found to increase efficacy and compliance. Lastly amlodipine was also found to decrease VSA by 17% ± 140%and 33% after 6 weeks, but further studies needed.

Conclusion

Diltiazem, nifedipine and amlodipine are potent in decreasing VSA, however, tailoring specific CCBs adverse reactions to patient condition and the drug preparation would be substantially beneficial for the outcome.

### Angina severity and symptom improvement are associated with diagnostic acetylcholine provocation dose in vasospastic angina [^91c2896c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This registry‐based study investigated a dose‐dependent relationship between acetylcholine spasm triggering dose and anginal complaints in the real‐world NL‐CFT population. There are 2 important main findings. First, we found an inverse relationship between provocation dosage and angina frequency for patients with epicardial spasm. Specifically, the lower the triggering dose for epicardial spasm during CFT, the more anginal complaints patients experienced both at baseline and follow‐up. Second, there was a difference between patients with epicardial and microvascular spasm with regard to mean angina frequency scores.

Provocation Dosage and Angina

The association between acetylcholine provocation dose and angina might be representative of a variety of thresholds at which physiological stimuli are capable of triggering spasm, with higher acetylcholine triggering dosages translating to a higher threshold and thereby less frequently causing complaints. We have previously shown that patients with vasospasm show more advanced atherosclerosis than patients with ANOCA without spasm. A lower threshold for vasospasm might be associated with more atherosclerotic disease and consequently more extensive endothelial dysfunction; however, we did not assess the burden of atherosclerosis in the current population by intracoronary imaging.

Furthermore, a trend toward the proportion of patients improving and deteriorating at 1‐year follow‐up regarding angina frequency score and SAQSS associated with acetylcholine spasm triggering dose was found. However, presumably due to small follow‐up sample sizes these differences did not reach statistical significance.

A history of previous (non–)ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction and percutaneous coronary intervention was much more frequent in the patients in the EpiLOW group, suggesting a relationship between a stent and epicardial spasm, possibly provoked by local mechanical stimulation. We hypothesize this stimulation possibly lowers the spasm threshold, thereby causing more severe complaints that respond poorly to therapy.

With regard to changes in angina over time, we demonstrated an inverse association with acetylcholine triggering dose in epicardial spasm. Of note, we did not correct for changes in medication after the CFT. However, medication use at follow‐up was frequently numerically less in groups with higher provocation doses (see Table 2). Nevertheless, although treatment in the low dose group is intensified, they still experience deterioration or no improvement at follow‐up, highlighting the challenge of treating these patients effectively.

### Amlodipine and atorvastatin [^da73c20f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titration may proceed more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently.

Angina The recommended dosage of amlodipine for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect.

Coronary Artery Disease The recommended dosage range of amlodipine for patients with CAD is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [see Clinical Studies (14.4)].

Pediatrics The effective antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine in pediatric patients ages 6 years to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily. Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].

Atorvastatin

Assess LDL-C when clinically appropriate, as early as 4 weeks after initiating atorvastatin, and adjust the dosage if necessary.

Recommended Dosage in Adult Patients

The recommended starting dosage of atorvastatin is 10 mg or 20 mg once daily. Patients who require a large reduction in LDL-C (more than 45%) may be started at 40 mg once daily.

### Management of vasospastic angina [^688c04bd]. Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Vasospastic angina is a well-established cause of chest pain that is caused by coronary artery spasm. It can be clinically diagnosed during a spontaneous episode by documenting nitrate-responsive rest angina with associated transient ischaemic ECG changes but more often requires provocative coronary spasm testing with acetylcholine during coronary angiography. Vasospastic angina may result in recurrent episodes of angina (including nocturnal angina), which can progress on to major adverse cardiac events. Calcium channel blockers are first-line therapy for this condition, given their anti-anginal and cardioprotective benefits. Despite an established diagnostic and therapeutic management pathway for vasospastic angina, this diagnosis is often overlooked in patients presenting with chest pain. Thus, there is need for increased clinical awareness of vasospastic angina to improve outcomes in affected patients.

Questionnaires

After obtaining online informed consent, yearly questionnaires were sent by email. An automated reminder was sent after 7 days. The questionnaires used for this analysis were the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and current use of medication per class. Baseline questionnaires were defined as completed before or on the day of the CFT. All questionnaires completed after that moment were not included in the current baseline analysis of complaints, as potential changes of symptoms after provocation testing might have influenced the results. Follow‐up questionnaires that were completed within 12 ± 6 months after CFT were included in the analysis of anginal complaints at follow‐up.

Assessment of complaints was done by the SAQ, which consists of 19 questions about clinically important domains of health: physical limitation, stability and frequency of complaints, treatment satisfaction, and perceived quality of life. It has been validated in patients with coronary artery disease and is a reproducible, highly sensitive and reliable disease‐specific patient‐reported outcome measure to quantify angina symptoms in that population. The score range is from 0 to 100 for all domains, with lower scores indicating a higher burden of disease. The summary score (SAQSS) aggregates the physical limitation, angina frequency and quality of life domain. The angina frequency score correlates well with daily angina diary entries and sublingual nitroglycerin use and can be categorized follows: 0 to 30 is defined as daily angina, 31 to 60 as weekly, 61 to 99 as monthly, and 100 as no angina. The relationship of Canadian Cardiovascular Society class and SAQSS has also been described previously; a SAQSS of 75 to 100 is equivalent to Canadian Cardiovascular Society class 0 to 1 in 93.6% of patients.

Outcomes

Our main outcomes are the mean angina frequency score at baseline and at follow‐up. Secondary outcomes include the mean SAQSS at baseline and mean change in SAQSS at follow‐up. Additionally, we aimed to assess the proportion of patients improving or deteriorating with regard to clinically important changes in SAQSS, defined as at least 5 points difference on the SAQSS at follow‐up. We also aimed to assess this proportion with regard to angina frequency, for which an increase or decrease of 10 points was considered a relevant change. With these analyses we aim to provide a basis to determine the optimal acetylcholine dosing for a spasm provocation protocol as part of a CFT.

### Angina severity and symptom improvement are associated with diagnostic acetylcholine provocation dose in vasospastic angina [^8e8374ce]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Coronary Function Test

The CFT protocol requires patients to withhold all vasoactive medication for 24 to 48 hours pre‐CFT depending on half‐life time. During CFT, continuous monitoring of hemodynamics and a 12‐lead ECG are ensured. A CFT includes spasm provocation and assessment of microvascular vasodilatory function according to previously described methodology.

For spasm provocation testing acetylcholine (Miochol‐E) is used, which needs to be prepared at the catheterization laboratory and used no more than 6 hours after preparation due to stability after preparation. By dilution of the solution created, 4 different acetylcholine dosages are obtained that are consecutively administered into the left coronary artery in 1 minute each.

A diagnosis of epicardial or microvascular spasm was made by applying the Coronary Vasomotor Disorders International Study Group criteria. In short, it is important to check with the patient if recognizable complaints are present, to assess if ischemic ECG changes have occurred, and to check if angiographic luminal narrowing can be identified by visual estimation after administration of each acetylcholine dose. In patients who fulfilled microvascular spasm criteria at a lower acetylcholine dose, subsequent dosages were still administered in order to complete the epicardial spasm protocol of 2–20–100–200 mcg and to check for concomitant epicardial vasospasm. If epicardial spasm occurred, patients were added to the epicardial spasm group and not the microvascular spasm group. Consequently, concomitant microvascular and epicardial spasm could have been present in patients with epicardial spasm if they demonstrated microvascular spasm at a lower acetylcholine dose.

### Nifedipine [^0ff7e4c5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

I. Vasospastic Angina

Nifedipine extended-release tablets are indicated for the management of vasospastic angina confirmed by any of the following criteria: 1) classical pattern of angina at rest accompanied by ST segment elevation, 2) angina or coronary artery spasm provoked by ergonovine, or 3) angiographically demonstrated coronary artery spasm. In those patients who have had angiography, the presence of significant fixed obstructive disease is not incompatible with the diagnosis of vasospastic angina, provided that the above criteria are satisfied. Nifedipine extended-release tablets may also be used where the clinical presentation suggests a possible vasospastic component, but where vasospasm has not been confirmed, e.g., where pain has a variable threshold on exertion, or in unstable angina where electrocardiographic findings are compatible with intermittent vasospasm, or when angina is refractory to nitrates and/or adequate doses of beta blockers.

II. Chronic Stable Angina (Classical Effort-Associated Angina)

Nifedipine extended-release tablets are indicated for the management of chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina) without evidence of vasospasm in patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate doses of beta blockers and/or organic nitrates or who cannot tolerate those agents.

In chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina), nifedipine has been effective in controlled trials of up to eight weeks duration in reducing angina frequency and increasing exercise tolerance, but confirmation of sustained effectiveness and evaluation of long-term safety in these patients is incomplete.

Controlled studies in small numbers of patients suggest concomitant use of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents may be beneficial in patients with chronic stable angina, but available information is not sufficient to predict with confidence the effects of concurrent treatment, especially in patients with compromised left ventricular function or cardiac conduction abnormalities. When introducing such concomitant therapy, care must be taken to monitor blood pressure closely, since severe hypotension can occur from the combined effects of the drugs (see WARNINGS).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Studies were screened for eligibility based on our inclusion criteria for this current systematic review. Any type of observational study (case–control, nested case–control or cohort study) investigating the potency of CCBs on reducing frequency of symptomatic episodes and serious complications of VSA in adults (> 18 years) were included in this literature search. Animal experimentation, literature reviews, editorials, commentaries, case reports and conference abstracts were excluded in this literature search. Moreover, medications not related to the study, patient with age less than 18 years old, and studies published in language other than English were excluded.

Data extraction

Once the literature search concluded and duplicates were eliminated, the two investigators (AE and MK) reviewed each article independently. Discrepancies in assessment by each investigators were discussed and consulted with the third investigator (JS) until an agreement was achieved by consensus. Full-text articles that met the inclusion criteria and passed the reviews were obtained and all the required information and data were extracted and assessed independently.

Epicardial Versus Microvascular Spasm

The baseline mean angina frequency score of all patients with epicardial spasm combined was 55 ± 20, which significantly differed from the mean score of patients with microvascular spasm (61 ± 21) and controls (64 ± 21), overall P = 0.002. At follow‐up, corrected for baseline scores, mean angina frequency scores were as follows for patients with epicardial spasm, microvascular spasm and controls: 59 ± 27, 70 ± 22, 76 ± 26 respectively, overall P = 0.06. Pairwise comparisons showed a significant difference between patients with epicardial spasm and controls only (P = 0.04).

The baseline mean SAQSS for all patients with epicardial spasm combined was 50 ± 15 and not statistically significanly different from the mean SAQSS of patients with microvascular spasm 53 ± 15 or controls 55 ± 16, overall P = 0.06. Neither was the SAQSS at follow‐up corrected for baseline scores: 57 ± 20, 62 ± 17, 67 ± 19 respectively, overall P = 0.11.

Although the group with microvascular spasm was too small for provocation dose subgroup analyses, we did see a trend towards an inverse relationship between provocation dosage and angina frequency and SAQSS at follow‐up for patients with microvascular spasm.

### Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^7d0effbc]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronary artery vasospasm (CAVS) is described as an abnormal constriction of coronary arteries that may cause complete or transient occlusion of the vessel and is not influenced with exertion. This phenomenon is known as several terms, such as variant angina, Prinzmetal's angina or vasospastic angina (VSA). The mechanical pathophysiology of this vasospastic disease is due to coronary spasm that can cause acute ischaemia and present itself ranging from stable angina to acute coronary syndrome. There are plethora of factors the can influence with the development of the disease such as autonomic nervous system, inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, genetic and lifestyles. Although the prognosis is relatively favourable, sudden death can still be ensued. Based on 'Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients With VSA' by Japanese Circulation Society in 2013, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) that function by suppressing Ca²⁺ influx into vascular smooth muscle cells are proven to effective in preventing VSA.

CCB is considered to be the first choice of drug for the treatment of VSA. The 2014 non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) guidelines recommend either a dihydropyridine (DHP) (eg, amlodipine, nifedipine) or non-DHP (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) alone or in combination with long-acting nitrates. Verapamil, diltiazem or nifedipine are the choices of CCB for initiation for newly diagnosed VSA. The main concerns of using these drugs are the adverse effects. DHP CCBs caused peripheral vasodilating, while non-DHPs have negative chronotropic effects that can cause bradycardia and atrioventricular (AV) conduction delay. Non-DHP can therefore be harmful in patients with history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.

The current systematic review was initiated to determine which CCBs (nifedipine, diltiazem or amlodipine) gives the best clinical outcome in terms of symptoms relief and side effects. This review may aid healthcare workers in choosing which CCBs to be used when faced with patient presented with VSA.

### Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^451700d8]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

It can be concluded that major CCBs such as diltiazem, nifedipine and amlodipine are potent agents to decrease the VSA symptoms. However, the drug adverse reaction and preparation may modify the overall treatment outcome. Patients with elevated heart rate tendency and normal control of blood pressure will benefit the most from diltiazem. Meanwhile, patients with decrease heart rate tendency and elevated blood pressure will benefit the most from nifedipine. In addition, nifedipine CR once daily and diltiazem R two times per day are not only effective in increasing the patient compliance, but also effective in suppressing the early morning VSA symptom. Other CCBs such as amlodipine showed some benefits in suppressing VSA but needs further investigation.

Follow‐Up Angina

In Table 2, follow‐up data of 80/156 (61%) patients with epicardial spasm who completed follow‐up questionnaires at an adequate time point (median 12 months, interquartile range 12–12 months) are shown. With regard to medication, patients with proven epicardial spasm used long‐acting nitrates significantly more often than controls. Other classes of antianginal medication were used in similar frequencies in all groups.

Table 2
Patient reported outcomes at follow‐up

At follow‐up, the mean angina frequency score changed significantly according to triggering acetylcholine dose (P = 0.009). The mean change in angina frequency score differed most between patients in the EpiLOW group compared with controls; with EpiLOW deteriorating and controls improving at follow‐up (−7 ± 11 versus 10 ± 20, P = 0.002). It was also significantly different between patients in the EpiLOW and EpiHIGH categories and those with microvascular spasm (8 ± 23 P = 0.003 and 9 ± 23, P = 0.008, respectively). In EpiLOW group, the mean angina frequency score at follow‐up was 43 ± 22 and in the controls it was 76 ± 26.

There was a trend toward an acetylcholine dose dependency of SAQSS at follow‐up: EpiLOW 46 ± 17, EpiMIDDLE 56 ± 19, EpiHIGH 61 ± 20, microvascular spasm 62 ± 17, and controls 67 ± 19 with overall P = 0.07 but a significant difference between EpiLOW and microvascular spasm patients (P = 0.03) as well as controls (P = 0.02). Numerically, the mean change in SAQSS at follow‐up showed no change in the EpiLOW group (0 ± 9) whereas it did in the controls (9 ± 14); see Figures 2 and 3, 4.

### Beta blockers versus calcium channel blockers for provocation of vasospastic angina after drug-eluting stent implantation: a multicentre prospective randomised trial [^86d276ef]. Open Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker (BB) administration for patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been strongly recommended by American and European guidelinesbased on the results of two large randomised clinical trials, β-Blocker Heart Attack Trialand the Norwegian Multicenter Study Group trial, that demonstrated reductions in infarct size, early mortality and risk of death when continued in the long term. However, its effectiveness has been in doubt over recent years, because many trials supporting the use of BBs were conducted prior to the widespread use of PCI and because the prescription rates of currently accepted optimal medical therapies were significantly lower than in the modern era. A recent observational study from Medicare beneficiaries suggested limited additional benefits of BBs in patients who were prescribed statins and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers for long-term cardiovascular events. Importantly, in the Western population with stable angina, a meta-analysis including results from the TIBETand APSIS trials, found that the effect of BB was equivalent in angina reduction, and that the BB rates of adverse events compared with calcium channel blockers (CCB) or long-acting nitrates lead to different recommendations among the major cardiology societies. Moreover, the risk of BB-induced vasospastic angina (VSA) has been perceived as a potential threat among the VSA-prevalent Japanese population particularly after drug-eluting stent placement. In Japanese society guideline, patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) presenting with coexisting atherosclerosis and VSA are recommended to start on long-acting CCB for VSA prevention and BBs if only CCBs are concurrently prescribed. Lastly, drug-eluting stent-induced VSA (DES-VSA) has emerged as a novel complication in the contemporary era of PCI.

To study this complication, we compared the effect of BBs and CCBs monotherapy in combination with other optimal medical therapy in this prospective, multicentre, open-labelled, randomised trial; we evaluated angiography-confirmed acetylcholine (ACh)-induced VSA at 9 months as a surrogate for DES-VSA; and evaluated major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACE) at 24 months as the secondary endpoint.

14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina

The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).

14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p < 0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement.

### Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^8c8c0dec]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Beside all the common CCBs, a study also observed the adverse reaction of benidipine 4 mg two times per day. However, only half of the study population had improvement, and 21% of the subjects had aggravated anginal attack. In fact, a patient was found to have > 40 attacks on day 11 during the drug treatment. All in all, based on the evidence available, there are not enough benefits to recommend this type of CCB to patients with variant angina.

Subjects' compliance to the CCB therapy for the variant angina is closely associated with the frequency of drug administration. The study by Morikami et al showed that both first generation nifedipine and diltiazem were not able to suppress the early morning symptom of variant angina. However, further development of CCB such as Nifedipine slow release (L) taken two times per day was able to eliminate the morning variant angina symptoms. This was followed with a newer generation CCB, such as nifedipine CR, which is administered once daily. This drug was found to increase compliance especially for chronic variant angina therapy as administered just once daily. This CR preparation was also able to decrease the adverse reaction of nifedipine such as palpitation and increase in heart rate. This is because it causes less stimulation on autonomic nervous system. Following nifedipine, diltiazem has also got a newer generation extended-release preparation termed diltiazem R, however it is still administered two times per day.

Limitation

Several limitations of this systematic review included the number of recent studies which investigated CCBs for variant angina were confined. This is true as there were six studies included after thorough screening of various medical databases. Furthermore, these studies had some risk of bias. This included comparability, deviation of intention, outcome measurement and selection of report result. However, all the papers were randomised and the paper by Park et al was interpreted as a good quality according to NOS.

### A randomised, multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of cilostazol in patients with vasospastic angina [^b8f38a40]. Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

We conducted a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of cilostazol, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3, in patients with vasospastic angina (VSA).

Background

Cilostazol has been shown to induce vascular dilatation, but its efficacy in patients with VSA is unknown.

Methods

Between October 2011 and July 2012, 50 patients with confirmed VSA who had ≥ 1 angina episodes/week despite amlodipine therapy (5mg/day) were randomly assigned to receive either cilostazol (up to 200mg/day) or placebo for 4weeks. All patients were given diaries to record the frequency and severity of chest pain (0–10 grading). The primary endpoint was the relative reduction of the weekly incidence of chest pain.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. Among 49 evaluable patients (25 in the cilostazol group, 24 in the placebo group), the primary endpoint was significantly greater in the cilostazol group compared with the placebo group (-66.5 ± 88.6% vs -17.6 ± 140.1%, respectively, p = 0.009). The secondary endpoints, including a change in the frequency of chest pain (-3.7 ± 0.5 vs -1.9 ± 0.6, respectively, p = 0.029), a change in the chest pain severity scale (-2.8 ± 0.4 vs -1.1 ± 0.4, respectively, p = 0.003), and the proportion of chest pain-free patients (76.0% vs 33.3%, respectively, p = 0.003) also significantly favoured cilostazol. Headache was the most common adverse event in both groups (40.0% vs 20.8%, respectively, p = 0.217).

Conclusions

Cilostazol is an effective therapy for patients with VSA uncontrolled by conventional amlodipine therapy, and has no serious side effects.

### Nifedipine (nifedicalXL) [^54e9c4db]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

I. Vasospastic Angina

Nifedical XL®tablets are indicated for the management of vasospastic angina confirmed by any of the following criteria: 1) classical pattern of angina at rest accompanied by ST segment elevation, 2) angina or coronary artery spasm provoked by ergonovine, or 3) angiographically demonstrated coronary artery spasm. In those patients who have had angiography, the presence of significant fixed obstructive disease is not incompatible with the diagnosis of vasospastic angina, provided that the above criteria are satisfied. Nifedical XL®tablets may also be used where the clinical presentation suggests a possible vasospastic component but where vasospasm has not been confirmed, e.g., where pain has a variable threshold on exertion or in unstable angina where electrocardiographic findings are compatible with intermittent vasospasm, or when angina is refractory to nitrates and/or adequate doses of beta-blockers.

II. Chronic Stable Angina

(Classical Effort-Associated Angina)

Nifedical XL®tablets are indicated for the management of chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina) without evidence of vasospasm in patients who remain symptomatic despite adequate doses of beta-blockers and/or organic nitrates or who cannot tolerate those agents.

In chronic stable angina (effort-associated angina) nifedipine has been effective in controlled trials of up to eight weeks duration in reducing angina frequency and increasing exercise tolerance, but confirmation of sustained effectiveness and evaluation of long-term safety in these patients is incomplete.

Controlled studies in small numbers of patients suggest concomitant use of nifedipine and beta-blocking agents may be beneficial in patients with chronic stable angina, but available information is not sufficient to predict with confidence the effects of concurrent treatment, especially in patients with compromised left ventricular function or cardiac conduction abnormalities. When introducing such concomitant therapy, care must be taken to monitor blood pressure closely since severe hypotension can occur from the combined effects of the drugs (see WARNINGS).

III. Hypertension

Nifedical XL®tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Clinical practice variations in the management of ischemia with No obstructive coronary artery disease [^d17fdd3e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

The overwhelming majority of surveyed cardiologists believe that additional clinical guidance is needed to accurately diagnose and treat patients with INOCA, with over half wanting US‐specific guidelines or expert consensus for diagnosis and management. Presently, most surveyed cardiologists rely on preexisting references, including the AHA/ACC chronic stable angina and the cholesterol clinical practice guidelines. As a result of the knowledge gaps related to an inherently heterogeneous condition, as much 1 of 3 cardiologists in early to mid career report being neutral or lacking confidence in their ability to manage patients with INOCA. To help educate and provide a summary of findings and recommendations for this clinical entity, we refer the audience to other available published resources, including the 2019 European Society of Cardiology Chronic Coronary Syndrome Guidelines, a State of the Art White Paper by Bairey Merz and colleagues, and State of the Art Review articles by lead authors Fordand Mathew. The Japanese Circulation Society has also previously published guidelines for the management of vasospastic angina.

Despite a plethora of data demonstrating increased events in the follow‐up of patients with INOCA, there have been no therapies shown to improve their prognosis. Currently, the management strategy for INOCA remains unclear, but emerging evidence from clinical trials is available. Specifically, the randomized control trial, CorMicA, has recently shown that a stratified medical approach using targeted antianginal medications guided by interventional diagnostic procedure with coronary function testing significantly improves angina and quality of life in patients with INOCA at 1‐year follow‐up. Accordingly, most surveyed respondents are prescribing antianginal medications as patients with INOCA often have persistent angina. The role of aspirin is extrapolated from the AHA/ACC chronic stable angina guidelines, as most patients have at least some evidence of atherosclerosis based on intravascular ultrasound examination. A review of the literature further suggests the potential roles for statins and ACE‐Is to improve coronary endothelial or vascular smooth muscle function in patients with INOCA. Accordingly, 3 of 5 cardiologists are always/often prescribing statins and aspirin. However, we found only 1 of 4 respondents are prescribing ACE‐Is or ARBs to their patients with suspected INOCA, despite expert consensus and support for this recommendation. The frequency for prescribing ACE‐Is or ARBs increases to ≈1 of 3 for respondents who see more patients with suspected INOCA in their practice or who report having more confidence in managing these patients.

### Angina severity and symptom improvement are associated with diagnostic acetylcholine provocation dose in vasospastic angina [^ca26b890]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Baseline Characteristics

For baseline characteristics, refer to Table 1. The EpiLOW group was smallest consisting of 36 patients. There were 96 patients in EpiMIDDLE, 119 patients in EpiHIGH, and 157 in the group with microvascular spasm. Overall, the mean age was 60 ± 9 years, 83% were women and the mean body mass index was 27 ± 5 kg/m 2.

Table 1
Baseline characteristics

There were significantly fewer women in the EpiLOW group (64%) compared with all other groups (overall P = 0.003). In the EpiLOW group, a history of myocardial infarction ((non–)ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction, 39%) as well as percutaneous coronary intervention (53%) were much more prevalent when compared with the other groups (overall P = 0.02 and < 0.001 respectively). The presence of other classical risk factors was not different between the groups. Furthermore at baseline the control group was using long acting nitrates less frequently (22%) than all patient groups, namely 50%, 45%, and 43% for EpiLOW, EpiMIDDLE, and EpiHIGH respectively and 33% for microvascular spasm with an overall P = 0.03.

### Angina: contemporary diagnosis and management [^167e7a53]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Epicardial spasm (vasospastic angina)

The poor nitrate response or tolerance seen in MVA contrasts with patients with vasospastic angina, in whom nitrates are a cornerstone of therapy and BB are relatively contraindicated. Dual pathologies (VSA with underlying microvascular disease) is increasingly recognised. A diagnosis of VSA facilitates treatment using non-dihydropiridine calcium antagonists (eg, diltiazem-controlled release up to 500 mg daily). Overall, CCB are effective in treating over 90% of patients. High doses of calcium antagonists (non-dihydropiridine and dihydropyridine) may be required either alone or in combination. Unfortunately, ankle swelling, constipation and other side effects may render some patients intolerant. In these cases, long-term nitrates may be used with good efficacy in this group. In about 10% of cases, coronary artery spasm may be refractory to optimal vasodilator therapy. Japanese VSA registry data shows nitrates were not associated with MACE reduction in VSA, and importantly when added to Nicorandil were potentially associated with higher rates of adverse cardiac events. Alpha blockers (eg, clonidine) may be helpful in selected patients with persistent vasospasm. In patients with poor nitrate tolerance the K⁺-channel opener nicorandil (5–10 mg two times a day) can be tried. Consider secondary causes in refractory VSA (eg, coronary vasculitis) and in selected patients with ACS presentations, coronary angioplasty may be considered as a bailout option.

### Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^eb6ca2a5]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CCBs have been used as the first line treatment for VSA. They non-competitively block voltage-sensitive L-type calcium ion channels in coronary smooth muscle that cause vasodilation on coronary arteries. They can be categorised based on their mechanism of action: DHP such as amlodipine and nifedipine, phenylalkylamines such as verapamil, and modified benzothiazepines such as diltiazem. Despite knowing CCBs had been documented to relieve and prevent VSA, little was known as to which CCB would provide the most effective relieve while considering the safety as well. This systematic review aimed to expand our understanding about which CCBs would be best suited in patients with VSA and its confounding symptoms. Despite being common and involved in many clinical scenarios like stable angina, acute coronary syndrome and arrhythmia, VSA often times being missed in the diagnosis. This may also be due to provocative tests that were rarely performed. Therefore, the prevalence rate for VSA was highly dependent on which population was being studied as well as the initiative of clinicians in investigating VSA with the provocative tests. Additionally, few recent studies were found to be investigating on the treatment of VSA, which led us having six studies that met the inclusion criteria and all of the studies were conducted in Asian regions only (Korea, Japan, China).

### Amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (Caduet) [^76061ce1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal.

Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy.

Amlodipine may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents.

### Effect of sarpogrelate and high-dose statin on the reduction of coronary spasm in vasospastic angina: a two by two factorial, pilot randomized study [^ad7daa6f]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics according to sarpogrelate

Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics in the sarpogrelate group vs the placebo group are shown in Table 1. Overall, the mean age was 57.4 years, 92% were men, and 78% drank alcohol. Most patients (96.0%) had been prescribed CCBs, and 46% had been prescribed vasodilators after angiographically proven vasospasm. There were no significant differences in general cardiovascular risk factors, alcohol intake, results of laboratory tests, and medication at discharge between the sarpogrelate and placebo groups (Table 1).

Table 1
Baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics in the sarpogrelate vs the placebo groups

Forty‐seven patients showed no fixed stenosis on initial CAG. Fixed stenosis was observed in 53 patients and 67 vessels were involved. Thirty‐six patients had fixed stenosis at left anterior descending artery (LAD) (median percent diameter stenosis [%DS], 30% [range from 20 to 60]), 19 at left circumflex artery (LCX) (median %DS, 30% [range from 20 to 60]), and 12 at right coronary artery (median %DS, 30% [range from 20 to 60]). There was no significant difference of fixed stenosis severity between the sarpogrelate group and the placebo group (Table 1). Coronary vasospasm occurred at the site with fixed stenosis in 44 patients.

Most of the patients showed transient luminal narrowing of an epicardial vessel of 90% or greater. Only one patient showed 75% of transient luminal narrowing with angina and ischemic ECG changes. No patient was diagnosed with microvascular spasm, which was defined as angina symptom with ischemic ECG changes without significant epicardial coronary artery spasm (> 75%). 21 There were two patients with multivessel spasm involving the LAD and the LCX at the same time. Spontaneous spasm was observed in three patients. Forty‐two percent of the coronary spasms were located at LAD, which was followed by the right coronary artery at 35% and LCX at 21%. Fifty‐seven percent of the patients showed distal TIMI 0 flow after intracoronary ergonovine injection. There were no differences in spasm location and grade of distal TIMI flow between the sarpogrelate and placebo groups (Table 1).

14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina

The effectiveness of 5–10 mg/day of amlodipine in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine 5 mg. Amlodipine 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm).

14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p < 0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement.

### Phenotype-based management of coronary microvascular dysfunction [^7fa956dd]. Journal of Nuclear Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Microvascular angina

Although obviously a lot less accurate than the information provided by invasive coronary physiology studies and non-invasive tests such as PET or cardiac MRI perfusion scans, the clinical presentation with predominantly effort-induced angina, rest-angina suggestive of vasospasm or "mixed" effort and rest angina, helps clinicians to at least suspect the prevailing mechanism of angina in a given patient and identify suitable initial antianginal therapies. First line therapy in effort-induced MVA entails a trial of beta-blockers (selective beta-blockers, or combined alpha/beta-blockers) or calcium channel antagonists (dihydropyridine and/or non-dihydropyridine). Long-acting nitrates should be avoided in general, as they are frequently ineffective and may aggravate symptoms due to a 'steal effect'. However, up to 50% of MVA patients find short-acting sublingual nitrates, oral nitrates or skin GTN patches helpful. Nicorandil may be helpful in cases of vasospastic MVA, as it is in patients with variant angina. These therapies aid with vasodilatation as well as reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption.

Renin-angiotensin system blockade is recommended. ACE inhibitors have been demonstrated to improve hyperemic myocardial blood flow, CFR and angina burden in patients with MVA. Statins may have additional benefit in MVA, over and above standard lipid control and plaque modification. Studies suggest anti-inflammatory properties, increase in endothelial nitric oxide release and inhibition of the rho kinase pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells, which leads to vasodilatation.

Ranolazine is mentioned in guidance documents, with potentially better response in patients with low CFR.

Vasospastic angina

Patients with epicardial or microvascular spasm should undergo initial therapy with calcium channel blockade. This encourages vascular smooth muscle relaxation, reduces propensity toward spasm, and potentially reduces myocardial oxygen demand. High doses and/or a combination of non-dihydropyridine (verapamil or diltiazem) with dihydropyridine (amlodipine) calcium blockers may be required. In contrast to MVA, long-acting nitrates are useful adjuncts in epicardial spasm, while beta-blockers are avoided. Nicorandil is also an option.

Mixed (microvascular and vasospastic)

The combination of treatments in this group reflects the mixed pathologies described above. Calcium channel antagonists (dihydropyridine and/or non-dihydropyridine) are considered first line, followed by nicorandil and/or third line agents such as ranolazine or trimetazidine.

Alternative vasomotor testing protocols

While our protocol is a comprehensive assessment of the coronary vasculature, alternative protocols exist in other centres, and although the underlying scientific rationale and vasoactive agents remain the same, there can be differences in the doses of agents being used. These protocols deviate most when it comes to assessing patients' response to ACh. The Women's Ischaemia Syndrome Evaluation group and Mayo clinic group protocols, for example, assess coronary endothelial function by infusing incremental doses of ACh, at 0.182, 1.82 and 18.2 µg/mL over 3 min. On the contrary, the Academic Medical Centreand Japanese Cardiology Societyprotocols provoke coronary vasospasm using incremental infusion of ACh, at 0.86, 8.63, 86.3, 863 µg/mL over 3 min or 100–200 µg boluses of ACh over 20 s, respectively. The lack of uniformity in coronary endothelial function and/or vasospasm assessment has important clinical implications. For example, when assessing for coronary vasospasm, a 200 µg bolus is more likely to lead to multivessel spasm than a 100 µg bolus. Additionally, a 20 s bolus dose is more likely to lead to vasospasm compared with a 3 min infusion of the same dose. This may be because it is the peak blood concentration of ACh, rather than simply the peak dose of ACh, which determines the arterial response to ACh provocation. Furthermore, there remains uncertainty surrounding the optimal dose and infusion rate of ACh that leads to physiological degrees of spasm that is a surrogate for what patients experience during day-to-day life; the caveat being that beyond a certain threshold of dose and infusion rate ACh may provoke spasm in any individual, as evidenced by 97% prevalence of vasospasm with ACh provocation in a recent prospective registry. Additionally, there may be gender-specific differences in responses to incremental doses of ACh.

### Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^b0111350]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

Among the included studies, all of them showed that diltiazem, nifedipine and amlodipine reduced the clinical symptoms and recurrence of VSA significantly. Kook et al evaluated diltiazem through the use Seattle Angina Questionnaire, comparing from baseline to 12 weeks after treatments. Significant improvement was found in the overall study population with changes in the total score by 5.2 ± 8.5 (p = 0.0002). However, no significant difference was found in the frequency of angina attacks (a subscale of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire) when comparing baseline with treatment groups. On the contrary, Park et al showed that treatment with diltiazem presents with just 8.3% recurrent of angina attack within 5 years. A number of studies were in line with what we found that diltiazem is effective in reducing the frequency of angina episodes and increasing exercise tolerance, which is likely due to its potent dilator effect on coronary arteries. This effect is also seen in terms of the artery diameter change in which Kook et al showed the magnitude of improvement in artery diameter change with the use of diltiazem and shown to have the greatest improvement among other intervention groups (nebivolol and low dose combination of nebivolol and diltiazem).

Higuma et al found significant reduction in the frequency of angina baseline value per week with nifedipine continues release (CR) (a long-acting once-daily formulation of nifedipine, with a dose 1×40 mg) and diltiazem R (a sustained-release formulation of diltiazem, with dose 2×100 mg) in a 4th, 8th and 12th weeks of study. Nifedipine (CR 1×40 mg) is also evaluated by Oikawa et al that showed significant decrease in angina frequency per week in the eighth week treatment. There are not many recent articles that discuss nifedipine on VSA. We managed to find an old case report from 1978 that showed nifedipine was effective in managing VSA. Duration of its protective effect was proportional with the dose, and its effect potentiate with the combination use of nitroglycerin. They also observed myocardial infarction could be caused by intense and prolonged coronary vasoconstriction, which was why nifedipine combined with nitroglycerin were necessary to prevent it.

### Angina: contemporary diagnosis and management [^d535d00c]. Heart (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The optimal management of patients with known or suspected angina begins with establishing the correct diagnosis. Around one half of angina patients have no obstructive coronary disease; many of these patients have microvascular and/or vasospastic angina. Non-invasive assessment with CTCA is a sensitive anatomical test for plaque which assists in initial treatment and risk stratification. Anatomical imaging has fundamental limitations to rule in or rule out coronary vasomotion disorders in patients with symptoms and/or signs of ischaemia but no obstructive CAD (INOCA). Women are disproportionately represented in this group with MVA and/or VSA, the two most common causes of diagnoses. A personalised approach to invasive diagnostic testing permits a diagnosis to be made (or excluded) during the patients' index presentation. This approach helps stratify medical therapy leading to improved patient health and quality of life. Physician appraisal of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) should consider all pathophysiology relevant to symptoms, prognosis and treatment to improve health outcomes for our patients. More research is warranted, particularly to develop disease modifying therapy.

Vasospastic angina — diagnostic criteria: Diagnosis considers "Nitrate-responsive angina: during spontaneous episode, with at least 1 of the following" clinical features, plus ECG and angiographic findings. Transient ischemia is supported by "Transient ischemic electrocardiographic changes: during spontaneous episode, including any of the following in at least 2 contiguous leads: ST segment elevation ≥ 0.1 mV; ST segment depression ≥ 0.1 mV; New negative U waves". Coronary spasm is defined as "transient total or subtotal coronary artery occlusion (> 90% constriction) with angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes either spontaneously or in response to a provocative stimulus (typically acetylcholine, ergonovine, or hyperventilation)". "Definitive" vasospastic angina requires nitrate-responsive angina during spontaneous episodes and fulfillment of either transient ischemic ECG changes or coronary spasm criteria, whereas "Suspected" vasospastic angina is when nitrate-responsive angina is present but ischemic ECG changes are equivocal or unavailable and spasm criteria are equivocal.

In patients with angina and nonobstructive CAD (ANOCA), the stratifier is adjunctive use of coronary function tests during coronary angiography to rule in or rule out microvascular angina, vasospastic angina, both, or neither (normal coronary function). The study by Tremmel's group further confirmed the feasibility of invasive physiological testing in a reasonably large, selected population. They noted distinct subgroups of patients with over 75% of the cohort having an occult explanation for their angina.

Microvascular angina is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome, and its pathogenesis is incompletely understood. In CorMicA, we align this endotype with the COVADIS working group definition of MVA. This broad group encompasses various types of coronary microvascular dysfunction in patients with ANOCA. Our protocol for this endotype (Table II) is consistent with MVA guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology based on symptom relief and therapy for underlying coronary microvascular dysfunction. Our protocol is first-line symptomatic relief of MVA with β-blockers. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are recommended where β-blockers are not tolerated or ineffective. Nicorandil or ranolazine can be added; however, nitrates are avoided in MVA without vasospasm owing to potentially deleterious effects on exercise tolerance and lack of efficacy. Where blood pressure and patient preference permit, statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)are recommended as potentially disease -modifying agents targeting underlying coronary microvascular dysfunction.

Vasospastic angina (VSA) is prognostically important and underdiagnosed despite having effective treatment options. In CorMicA, CCBs are first-line therapy with symptomatic and prognostic benefit.β-Blockers which are used first line in MVA should be avoided because they may precipitate spasm. Although nitrates are avoided for those with predominant MVA, they often provide symptomatic benefit for patients with VSA. Smoking cessation and use of statins are encouraged for pleiotropic benefits on endothelial dysfunction.

Noncardiac chest pain with fully normal coronary artery function testing is an important diagnosis for both patients and physicians (Table II). Undiagnosed chest pain is predictive of major adverse cardiac events, whereas quality of life suffers in patients recently diagnosed with ischemic heart disease. Stopping inappropriate antianginal therapy and secondary preventative medications may provide health and economic benefits to the patient and health care system.

### International standardization of diagnostic criteria for vasospastic angina [^a91a70ab]. European Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Coronary Vasomotion Disorders International Study Group diagnostic criteria for vasospastic angina (COVADIS criteria)" for vasospastic angina.

The Coronary Vasomotion Disorders International Study Group diagnostic criteria for vasospastic angina, also known as the COVADIS criteria, is a clinical tool designed for the diagnosis of vasospastic angina. This condition, characterized by coronary artery spasm leading to transient myocardial ischemia, can be challenging to diagnose due to its variable presentation and the need for provocative testing.

The COVADIS criteria incorporate three main components: nitrate-responsive angina, transient ischemic electrocardiogram changes, and evidence of coronary artery spasm. Nitrate-responsive angina is identified by rest angina, particularly between night and early morning, marked diurnal variation in exercise tolerance with reduced tolerance in the morning, the ability of hyperventilation to precipitate an episode, and the suppression of episodes by calcium channel blockers but not beta-blockers. Transient ischemic electrocardiogram changes are identified by ST-segment elevation or depression of at least 0.1 mV or the appearance of new negative U waves. Evidence of coronary artery spasm is determined by transient total or subtotal coronary artery occlusion, with angina and ischemic electrocardiogram changes either spontaneously or in response to a provocative stimulus such as acetylcholine, ergot, or hyperventilation.

The diagnostic criteria are met if there is evidence of nitrate-responsive angina, transient ischemic electrocardiogram changes, and coronary artery spasm. The criteria are not met if these conditions are not fulfilled. This diagnostic tool aids clinicians in identifying patients with vasospastic angina, enabling appropriate management and treatment of this condition.

The Coronary Vasomotion Disorders International Study Group (COVADIS) criteria determine whether an individual meets the diagnostic criteria for vasospastic angina through an evaluation of three key aspects: nitrate-responsive angina, transient ischemic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and coronary artery spasm.

The evaluator chooses one description from each of these three categories:

- **Nitrate-responsive Angina**:
- Rest angina, often occurring between night and early morning
- Marked diurnal variation in exercise tolerance, where tolerance is reduced in the morning
- Hyperventilation triggers an episode
- Episodes are suppressed by calcium channel blockers but not by beta-blockers

- **Transient Ischemic ECG Changes** (during spontaneous episodes, observed in at least two contiguous leads):
- ST-segment elevation of 0.1 mV or more
- ST-segment depression of 0.1 mV or more
- Presence of new negative U waves

- **Coronary Artery Spasm**:
- A transient total or subtotal coronary artery occlusion with more than 90% constriction
- Occurrence of angina and ischemic ECG changes either spontaneously or in reaction to a provocative stimulus, such as acetylcholine, ergot, or hyperventilation

For a diagnosis of vasospastic angina, the assessment requires:

- One or more aspects from nitrate-responsive angina to be true.
- One or more ECG changes to be observed.
- Both coronary artery spasm criteria to be met.

If all these checks pass — meaning there is at least one confirmed symptom from nitrate-responsive angina and transient ischemic ECG changes, alongside both indicators for coronary artery spasm — the diagnostic criteria are considered to be met. If any of these condition checks fail, the diagnostic criteria are not met.

The interpretation is straightforward: presence of all necessary criteria combinations confirms a diagnosis of vasospastic angina; otherwise, the criteria are not satisfied.

### Management of refractory angina: an update [^fbfd15e8]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the use of anti-anginal drugs and/or percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting, the proportion of patients with coronary artery disease who have daily or weekly angina ranges from 2% to 24%. Refractory angina refers to long-lasting symptoms (for > 3months) due to established reversible ischaemia, which cannot be controlled by escalating medical therapy with the use of 2nd- and 3rd-line pharmacological agents, bypass grafting, or stenting. While there is uncertain prognostic benefit, the treatment of refractory angina is important to improve the quality of life of the patients affected. This review focuses on conventional pharmacological approaches to treating refractory angina, including guideline directed drug combination and dosages. The symptomatic and prognostic impact of advanced and novel revascularization strategies such as chronic total occlusion PCI, transmyocardial laser revascularization, coronary sinus occlusion, radiation therapy for recurrent restenosis, and spinal cord stimulation are also covered and recommendations of the 2019 ESC Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Coronary Syndromes discussed. Finally, the potential clinical use of current angiogenetic and stem cell therapies in reducing ischaemia and/or pain is evaluated.

### Comparison of various calcium antagonist on vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^b35e90f4]. Open Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

The efficacy and impact of the different types of CCBs on VSA

Action of various types of CCB on VSA are depicted in online supplemental table 4. The studies' participants varied from 5 to 2741 patients. The studies showed that Diltiazem decrease the frequency of chest pain in VSA patients, and increase the quality of life based on the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. However, in a study which participants consumed Diltiazem for VSA, recurrent angina up till fourth week and asymptomatic AV block were found in a single separate patient.

Studies also found that nifedipine is a potent agent in treating VSA. Its effect in decreasing the frequency of angina was evidently found by the fourth and eighth weeks of treatment. However, it was also noticed to cause excessive drop in blood pressure in a patient, and increased in heart rate by eighth week. Both nifedipine and diltiazem were apparently effective by the fourth weeks of treatment. Nevertheless, diltiazem showed a better tendency in reducing the frequency of VSA in the 12th week. In addition, studies that applied the slow release form of nifedipine once a day and diltiazem twice a day seemed to increase compliance and efficacy to decrease frequency of VSA.

Amlodipine is another CCB which was found to improve symptoms in VSA patients. The study showed that it decreased the mean frequency of weekly chest pain by 17.6% ± 140.1%. The proportion of chest pain free patients after 6 weeks study period was 33%. Several adverse effects which were gathered including headache (20%) as the most common, followed by dizziness (8.3%), palpitation (8.3%), bradycardia (4.2%), chest discomfort (4.2%), GI symptoms (4.2%).

Quality assessment

The quality assessments of the studies were depicted in online supplemental table 1 using NOS format, and online supplemental table 2 using the revised Cochrane format for systematic reviews. Among the two studies assessed by NOS, the study by Park et al was qualified as a good study, and the study by Gao et al was considered poor quality. Furthermore, among the four studies assessed by Revised Cochrane, three studies were considered high risk, and a study by Higuma et al, was assessed as having some concern.

### Allergic vasospastic angina: a systematic review [^6be35278]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Allergic vasospastic angina (also referred to as Kounis syndrome) is an under-recognised subtype of vasospastic angina in which coronary artery spasm is precipitated by an allergen. This study evaluates the clinical characteristics, mechanisms and management of this intriguing angina subtype.

Methods

A systematic review of reported cases of allergic vasospastic angina from 1992 to 2022 was performed using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Each case report was then analysed for patient characteristics, presenting signs/symptoms and both cardiac and allergic investigations.

Results

A systematic review of 393 allergic vasospastic angina case reports revealed a median age of 53 years (64% males), 46% had one or more cardiovascular risk factors with 32% having an atopic history. Most patients presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ST-elevation myocardial infarct in 71%) following exposure to a wide array of precipitating allergens (55% prescription medications), with multiple potential allergic mechanisms including immunoglobulin-E (IgE)-mediated mast cell degranulation, eosinophil-mediated allergic response and other non-IgE mediated mast cell activation pathways.

Conclusion

Allergic vasospastic angina is an important and under-recognised vasospastic angina subtype, often presenting as an acute coronary syndrome. Diagnosis of this disorder is important since management differs to conventional vasospastic angina with the potential of allergen avoidance and use of allergic response modulating therapies.

### Angina severity and symptom improvement are associated with diagnostic acetylcholine provocation dose in vasospastic angina [^ce163580]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Baseline Angina

In 156/251 (62%) of patients with epicardial spasm who completed baseline questionnaires before undergoing CFT, a dose‐dependent decrease in angina frequency was observed with increasing triggering doses at baseline. The scores significantly differed between the 3 epicardial spasm groups, microvascular spasm patients and controls (overall P = 0.003). Compared with controls (64 ± 21), pairwise comparison showed mean angina frequency scores as follows: EpiLOW 48 ± 20 (P = 0.001), EpiMIDDLE 53 ± 21 (P = 0.003), EpiHIGH 57 ± 19 (P = 0.05), and microvascular spasm 61 ± 21 (P = 0.31). In other words, if a lower acetylcholine dose is required to trigger epicardial spasm during CFT, patients experience anginal complaints significantly more frequently at baseline when compared with controls. After excluding CMD from the groups with spasm = results were consistent and differences remained significant with unchanged overall P = 0.003. The mean angina frequency score of patients in EpiLOW group without CMD was 44 ± 18 (P < 0.001 compared with controls, in whom CMD was excluded by definition).

Although overall difference for the SAQSS between the 5 groups was nonsignificant (P = 0.11), there was a significant difference between patients in the EpiLOW group and controls (46 ± 14 versus 55 ± 16, P = 0.02) after pairwise comparison with least significant difference correction.

Similar to with angina frequency scores, excluding patients with concomitant CMD from the groups with spasm did not change results, the mean SAQSS differences were consistently nonsignificant overall (P = 0.06). However, the mean SAQSS of patients in the EpiLOW group was significantly different from all other groups by pairwise comparison, with the largest difference between EpiLOW and controls (43 ± 11 versus 55 ± 16, P = 0.003).

Amlodipine also showed similar results given by Shin et al, with a change of 17.6% in the frequency of weekly chest pain. Nifedpine is well known to have strong vasodilatory and antihypertensive effects with little influence on myocardial contraction. Amlodipine has an excellent blood pressure lowering effect and should be used as the first choice in the treatment of VSA who need blood pressure control. The long-acting effect also gives an advantage to facilitate patient's compliance in adhering to the treatment without the trouble of multiple daily doses. Peripheral oedema was the only adverse event often seen in patients treated with amlodipine. Once daily dose (adjustable from 5 to 15 mg) was found to be both safe and effective.

Various studies of CCB on angina showed unique adverse reactions and confounding results of the drugs. Studies of nifedipine CR 40 mg by Higuma et al found that significant heart rate increment in the eighth week of treatment, which might be beneficial in the bradycardia patients. Meanwhile, it was also found to cause excessive drop in blood pressure in a study by Oikawa et al, which would be beneficial in anginal patients with hypertension.

Diltiazem which comes from the non-DHP group showed several other unique adverse reactions. The study by Park et al and Higuma et al showed that incidence of AV block was significantly increase in diltiazem usage, and another study found an asymptomatic advanced AV block. However, this incidence could be decreased by combination with nitrate therapy significantly as depicted in the study by Park et al. This drug is thought to be beneficial for pounding palpitation, tachycardia and rhythm control patient with predisposing anginal attack.

Amlodipine which was previously discussed to have limited recent studies of its efficacy on anginal attack, was found to cause several adverse reactions. The most common symptoms were headache by 20% followed with dizziness by 8.3%. However, the overall adherence of amlodipine treatment in anginal attack was good, only a single subject had the adherence of less than 80% in the study by Shin et al. In addition, amlodipine was also found to decrease the glyceryl trinitrate consumption in the study.

Clinical history and symptoms suggest that coronary spasms may be the cause. Therefore, while waiting for CMR to be done, intracoronary functional tests (acetylcholine/ergonovine) may be performed. Intracoronary imaging with intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography (OCT) may also be helpful for the detection of unrecognized plaque ruptures, erosions, or spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD).

Q34. Your fellow is writing the discharge summary of a 70-year-old woman admitted for recurrent chest pain, positive hs-cTn I (peak value of 550 ng/L), and normal echocardiography. Coronary angiography did not show any significant lesion. Invasive imaging (OCT) showed some stable plaques and CMR did not show late gadolinium enhancement. She is not willing to prescribe any drug after discharge. Do you agree?

No. Patients with a final diagnosis of MINOCA of unknown cause may be treated according to secondary prevention guidelines for atherosclerotic disease. Pharmacological therapy with aspirin and statins is recommended and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers (in case vasospasm is suspected) may be considered.

Coronary Angiography and Provocation Test

We retrospectively analyzed an observational registry of patients with VA based on the Guidelines for Diagnosis and Treatment of Patients with VA. 5 An intracoronary ergonovine provocation test was performed according to the clinician's decision in patients who had suspicious symptoms and underwent coronary angiography. Baseline coronary angiography was performed for the right and left coronary arteries. Intracoronary ergonovine was infused for the provocation test. Incremental doses of 20, 40, and 80 μg were injected into the left coronary artery. If coronary spasm was not provoked in the left coronary artery, incremental doses of 10 and 20 μg were injected into the right coronary artery. Once spasm was provoked, intracoronary nitroglycerin was infused. Vasoactive drugs were stopped at least 48 hours before coronary angiography. We classified the definite and intermediate VA according to ergonovine provocation test and defined these as a positive test. Total or subtotal (> 90% luminal diameter narrowing) occlusion accompanied by chest pain or discomfort and/or ECG changes or spontaneous total or subtotal spasm on baseline coronary angiography resolved by intracoronary nitroglycerin was defined as a positive result. Additionally, we defined intermediate constriction as 50% to 90% luminal narrowing with or without ischemic symptoms and/or ECG changes were also defined as a positive result. A negative result was < 50% luminal narrowing without chest pain or discomfort or ECG change. An ECG change during the provocation test was defined as an ST‐segment elevation or depression in at least 2 contiguous leads. A multivessel spasm was defined as a positive spasm in more than 2 major (≥ 2.5 mm) epicardial coronary arteries. 6 The types of spasm were classified as focal or diffuse.

Tailored therapeutic approaches and novel treatment options

Given the pathophysiologic and phenotypic heterogeneity of women with ANOCA, tailored therapeutic strategies are key. Most studies of ANOCA therapies have assessed anti-ischemic medications in relatively small, phenotypically diverse cohorts with short-term follow-up with modest results. However, the mechanistic insights provided by these studies lend themselves to being applied within a stratified framework. These have been described in detail prior reviews and are summarized here (Table 1).

Table 1
Summary of the Current and Novel Therapeutic Strategies Targeting the Primary Endotypes of ANOCA

Anti-vasospastic therapies

CCBs (amlodipine, nifedipine, benidipine) have been shown to improve symptom frequency and prognosis in vasospastic angina (VSA) and are the only drug designated as first-line in these patients. Both vascular smooth muscle selective dihydropyridine CCBs and nondihydropyridine CCBs (diltiazem, verapamil) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of VSA, though the former have been more widely studied. Refractory VSA may warrant a combination of both classes of CCBs. Acute episodes of VSA often respond to short-acting nitrates. Insufficient evidence exists on the symptomatic or prognostic benefit of long-acting nitrates, and concerns of aggravating symptoms due to steal and increased MACE with tolerance from chronic nitrate use have been raised. Statins (fluvastatin) may benefit VSA by suppression of smooth muscle reactivity. Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor, has been shown to improve VSA symptoms in multicenter RCTs. Nicorandil, a nitrate-like cGMP-mediated vasodilator and fasudil, a rho-kinase inhibitor, have been shown to improve VSA symptoms in multiple RCTs, however are not available in the United States. Smoking is a major trigger of VSA and cessation has been associated with a reduction in anginal symptoms and MACE.

### Expert consensus document: A' diamond'approach to personalized treatment of angina [^6a3bbfea]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

In clinical guidelines, drugs for symptomatic angina are classified as being first choice (β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, short-acting nitrates) or second choice (ivabradine, nicorandil, ranolazine, trimetazidine), with the recommendation to reserve second-choice medications for patients who have contraindications to first-choice agents, do not tolerate them, or remain symptomatic. No direct comparisons between first-choice and second-choice treatments have demonstrated the superiority of one group of drugs over the other. Meta-analyses show that all antianginal drugs have similar efficacy in reducing symptoms, but provide no evidence for improvement in survival. The newer, second-choice drugs have more evidence-based clinical data that are more contemporary than is available for traditional first-choice drugs. Considering some drugs, but not others, to be first choice is, therefore, difficult. Moreover, double or triple therapy is often needed to control angina. Patients with angina can have several comorbidities, and symptoms can result from various underlying pathophysiologies. Some agents, in addition to having antianginal effects, have properties that could be useful depending on the comorbidities present and the mechanisms of angina, but the guidelines do not provide recommendations on the optimal combinations of drugs. In this Consensus Statement, we propose an individualized approach to angina treatment, which takes into consideration the patient, their comorbidities, and the underlying mechanism of disease.

### Management of stable angina in the older adult population [^f57036a8]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2023). Medium credibility.

As society ages, the number of older adults with stable ischemic heart disease continues to rise. Older adults exhibit the greatest morbidity and mortality from stable angina. Furthermore, they suffer a higher burden of comorbidity and adverse events from treatment than younger patients. Given that older adults were excluded or underrepresented in most randomized controlled trials of stable ischemic heart disease, evidence for management is limited and hinges on subgroup analyses of trials and observational studies. This review aims to elucidate the current definitions of aging, assess the overall burden and clinical presentations of stable ischemic heart disease in older patients, weigh the available evidence for guideline-recommended treatment options including medical therapy and revascularization, and propose a framework for synthesizing complex treatment decisions in older adults with stable angina. Due to evolving goals of care in older patients, it is paramount to readdress the patient's priorities and preferences when deciding on treatment. Ultimately, the management of stable angina in older adults will need to be informed by dedicated studies in representative populations emphasizing patient-centered end points and person-centered decision-making.
