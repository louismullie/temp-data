## Question

What physical examination tests are used to evaluate a concussion?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which physical examination tests are used to evaluate concussion, how they perform, and how they fit into an evidence-based workflow. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that concussion remains a clinical diagnosis requiring a multimodal assessment. Then, I should categorize the exam elements by domain and summarize key performance metrics. Next, I will synthesize thresholds and reconcile apparent discrepancies across studies. After that, I need to consider special populations, including pediatrics and para athletes, and non-sport contexts. Then, I will address emerging technologies and limitations. Finally, I will outline a pragmatic clinical decision algorithm and conclude with evidence-based recommendations anchored in recent consensus statements and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the fundamental principle so I don't jump to conclusions. Concussion diagnosis is clinical, there is no single definitive biomarker or imaging test, and best practice relies on a multimodal, multi-time-point evaluation spanning symptoms, cognition, balance, and oculomotor-vestibular domains, especially in athletes where standardized tools guide removal and re-evaluation [^112bCcxq] [^114PRxb9] [^112KBEQW].

> I will now organize the physical examination and related bedside tools by domain to keep this systematic. The major clusters are symptom inventories, neurocognitive testing, balance and postural control, ocular-motor and vestibular screening, and integrated batteries such as SCAT and SCOAT, with the understanding that no single test suffices and that combining domains improves sensitivity and clinical safety for return-to-play decisions [^112TypB1] [^112bCcxq] [^111sWRmp].

> Next, I should review symptom assessment scales because they often carry the highest standalone diagnostic yield. Wait, let me verify the performance metrics before I overstate this. In a prospective case-control sideline study, a 3-point increase on a Post-Concussion Symptom Scale yielded 81% sensitivity and 94% specificity with an AUC of 0.95, and a similar threshold for symptom severity showed 91% sensitivity and 81% specificity, underscoring the strong discriminative value despite modest test-retest agreement, while the Rivermead questionnaire is recommended for clinical tracking outside sport settings to structure serial symptom surveillance [^113kzb49] [^115GcEJ3].

> Now I need to check neurocognitive testing and be careful about context and timing. The Standardized Assessment of Concussion has modest standalone sensitivity and should not be used exclusively to diagnose mTBI in pediatric patients aged 6–18 years, yet computerized tools like ImPACT and the Concussion Resolution Index have shown approximately 79% and 79% sensitivity, respectively, within 24 hours in collegiate cohorts, and the CDC allows consideration of validated, age-appropriate computerized testing acutely as a component, not a sole determinant, of diagnosis in children and adolescents [^113kzb49] [^111sWRmp] [^117KtR7E] [^116wHHGJ].

> Hold on, I should verify balance and postural control measures because they often trade sensitivity for specificity. The modified Balance Error Scoring System can demonstrate high specificity but lower sensitivity acutely, for example about 40% sensitivity and 92% specificity at a 5-point change threshold, while more formal posturography shows roughly 62% sensitivity, and tools like PANESS may detect subtle motor signs in adolescents during recovery; importantly, balance testing is recommended to help assess recovery in adolescent athletes with mTBI [^113kzb49] [^111sWRmp] [^116LwAHq] [^114tPFAo].

> Let me consider ocular-motor and vestibular screens next, and I should double-check reliability. The King-Devick rapid number-naming test often shows good reliability and useful accuracy, for example approximately 85% sensitivity and 76% specificity when any time increase is considered, while eye-tracking smooth pursuit metrics demonstrate variable sensitivity and specificity; targeted vestibular and ocular screening such as VOMS is increasingly used to phenotype deficits and guide therapy, adding value beyond symptom checklists alone [^113kzb49] [^112TypB1] [^11687uGt].

> I should confirm the status of integrated batteries because the field updated recently. I almost said SCAT5 is current, but wait, Amsterdam 2022 released SCAT6 and Child SCAT6 and introduced SCOAT6 for office-based follow-up; these batteries integrate symptoms, SAC, balance, coordination, and memory with age-appropriate variants, and CRT6 supports non-medical recognition and removal from play, forming the backbone of standardized multimodal assessment across settings [^112KMH7T] [^112bCcxq].

> Now I will synthesize performance characteristics and practical thresholds, and I should reconcile apparently conflicting findings. In acute collegiate cohorts, symptom scales can achieve very high AUCs near 0.95 and strong sensitivity at small change thresholds, m-BESS provides high specificity, King-Devick adds objective oculomotor information, and SAC alone is modest; when tests are combined in a battery, sensitivity can exceed 90%, which is why consensus emphasizes multimodal assessment rather than reliance on any single measure [^113kzb49] [^111sWRmp]. Hmm, wait a minute, one older dataset suggested computerized neurocognitive testing outperformed symptoms, whereas a newer sideline case-control showed symptoms outperforming cognition; taken together, domain performance likely varies by timing, cohort, baseline availability, and case definition, reinforcing the need for combined, serial testing and cautious interpretation [^111sWRmp] [^113kzb49].

> For pediatrics, I should confirm age-specific cautions and permissible tools. Do not use SAC exclusively in children 6–18 years, consider validated age-appropriate computerized testing as one component of the acute evaluation, include balance testing to track recovery in adolescents, and coordinate return-to-school plans with serial monitoring of symptoms and academic tolerance, all within a clinician-led, individualized plan [^117KtR7E] [^116wHHGJ] [^114tPFAo] [^116Bzuq7].

> For para athletes, hold on, I should verify how to adapt SCAT. The para sport position statement advises using SCAT within the CIPS framework but warns that a normal SCAT does not exclude concussion given baseline variability across impairment groups, emphasizing the importance of individualized baselines, collateral history, and clinician familiarity with the athlete's pre-injury function [^117D6diX] [^113zbRtq].

> In non-sport clinical settings, let me make sure the history and physical are comprehensive and targeted. Guidelines recommend a structured interview, standardized symptom inventories such as Rivermead or SCAT-derived checklists, and focused neurological and musculoskeletal examination including cervical spine, vestibular, and vision screening to identify treatable contributors and phenotype symptom clusters for targeted rehabilitation [^1178T3ej] [^115GcEJ3] [^112KBEQW] [^113TW69m].

> I need to address emerging technologies and key limitations so we don't over-interpret unproven tools. Strong evidence indicates head impact sensors do not provide useful sideline diagnostic information, serum biomarkers should not be used routinely outside research, and comprehensive neuropsychological batteries are generally discouraged in the early post-acute window by VA/DoD guidance, though select computerized cognitive tools may be considered in pediatric acute care as one component, highlighting the importance of timing and context when choosing assessments [^112TypB1] [^115UA9xb] [^112tsz4k] [^116wHHGJ].

> Now, I will outline a pragmatic clinical decision algorithm and verify alignment with consensus. Recognition with CRT6 triggers removal from play, followed by SCAT6 or Child SCAT6 for formal multimodal evaluation; if abnormal or concussion suspected, there is no same-day return and the athlete proceeds to office-based follow-up with SCOAT6, where targeted add-ons such as King-Devick, VOMS, and selected neurocognitive testing are applied based on deficits, with serial reassessment guiding graded return to learning and sport under clinician supervision [^112bCcxq] [^116iiS8q]. Return-to-play requires symptom resolution at rest and with exertion, restoration to baseline across relevant test domains, and adherence to a stepwise progression individualized to the patient's recovery trajectory and context [^117SD9yo] [^1137rUGV].

> To conclude, I need to ensure the recommendations are consistent with high-credibility guidance. No single physical examination test is sufficient to diagnose concussion; standardized multimodal tools such as SCAT6 and Child SCAT6 constitute the minimum standard, symptom tracking anchors diagnostic sensitivity, and objective elements like balance and ocular-motor screening add confirmatory and phenotyping value, with combined batteries achieving superior sensitivity to protect patient safety in return-to-activity decisions [^112bCcxq] [^112TypB1] [^113kzb49] [^111sWRmp].

Physical exam tests for concussion include a **multidomain assessment** of symptoms, cognition, balance, oculomotor/vestibular function, and cervical spine [^112KBEQW]. The SCAT6/Child SCAT6 are the standard tools for sideline and office use [^112bCcxq] [^112KMH7T], with the King-Devick test providing additional oculomotor data [^113kzb49]. No single test is definitive [^112TypB1]; a **multimodal approach** improves diagnostic accuracy [^111sWRmp] and guides safe return-to-play decisions [^114PRxb9].

---

## Symptom assessment

Symptom checklists in SCAT6/Child SCAT6 document **headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, cognitive, emotional, and sleep symptoms** [^112bCcxq] [^111jTkta]. Also screen for **red flag symptoms** — severe headache, repeated vomiting, worsening confusion, seizures, focal deficits, or declining consciousness — which require urgent evaluation [^117D9WHM].

---

## Cognitive assessment

The **Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC)** briefly assesses orientation, immediate memory, concentration, and delayed recall; it is included in SCAT6 [^112bCcxq] [^111jTkta]. Neurocognitive testing tools such as **ImPACT** assess attention, memory, processing speed, and reaction time; these tools are useful for tracking recovery but not for initial diagnosis [^1137rUGV] [^115BtFiY] [^1124gYoL].

---

## Balance and postural stability assessment

- **Balance error scoring system (BESS)**: Evaluates postural stability in double-leg, single-leg, and tandem stances on firm and foam surfaces; included in SCAT6 [^111jTkta] [^112bCcxq] [^114tPFAo].

- **Modified BESS (m-BESS)**: Sideline-friendly version with three stances on firm ground [^113kzb49].

- **Romberg test**: Assesses proprioceptive and vestibular function with eyes closed.

---

## Oculomotor and vestibular assessment

- **Vestibular/ocular motor screening (VOMS)**: Assesses smooth pursuit, saccades, convergence, vestibulo-ocular reflex, and visual motion sensitivity; detects common concussion-related deficits [^11687uGt].

- **King-Devick test**: Rapid number-naming test for saccadic eye movements and attention; moderate sensitivity and specificity [^113kzb49].

- **Near point of convergence (NPC)**: Measures convergence distance; abnormal (> 5 cm) is common after concussion.

---

## Cervical spine assessment

Cervical range of motion and palpation assess **pain, tenderness, or limited range of motion** that may contribute to symptoms [^112KBEQW] [^112SaQBK]. **Spurling's test** screens for cervical radiculopathy, which can mimic or exacerbate concussion symptoms.

---

## Reliability and validity of physical exam tests

| **Metric** | **Symptom checklist** | **SAC** | **BESS** | **King-Devick** | **VOMS** |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | High (81–91%) | Moderate (44%) | Moderate (40%) | Moderate (85%) | Moderate |
| Specificity | Moderate (81–94%) | Moderate (72%) | High (92%) | Moderate (76%) | Moderate |
| Reliability | High | Moderate | Moderate | High | Moderate |

---

Multimodal assessment — combining tests — improves **diagnostic accuracy** [^112TypB1] and reduces **false negatives** [^111sWRmp] [^1179xhUJ].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Subjectivity in symptom reporting and cognitive testing can be influenced by **effort, motivation, and baseline variability** [^112TypB1]. Environmental factors such as noise, distractions, and fatigue can impair balance and cognitive performance [^112VqMDY]. No single definitive test exists; diagnosis relies on clinical judgment and multiple complementary tests [^1133mCG4].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **SCAT6/Child SCAT6**: Standardized tools for sideline and office assessment [^112bCcxq] [^112KMH7T].

- **Immediate removal from play**: Athletes with suspected concussion should not return the same day [^112bCcxq] [^116iiS8q].

- **Gradual return-to-play**: Stepwise progression after symptom resolution and normal exam findings [^112bCcxq] [^117SD9yo] [^1137rUGV].

---

Physical exam tests for concussion span symptoms, cognition, balance, oculomotor/vestibular function, and cervical spine; a **multimodal approach** is essential for accurate diagnosis and safe return-to-play decisions.

### Diagnostic accuracy and reliability of sideline concussion evaluation: A prospective, case-controlled study in college athletes comparing newer tools and established tests [^113kzb49]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

To assess the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of sideline concussion tests in college athletes, a study was conducted using several tools: the Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, Standardised Assessment of Concussion (SAC), modified Balance Error Scoring System (m-BESS), King-Devick test, and EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuits. Testing was initially completed at baseline, then repeated after athletes were acutely diagnosed with a concussion, and compared with a matched teammate without concussion.

Data were collected on 41 concussed athletes and 41 matched controls.

- **Test-retest reliability for symptom score and symptom severity**: Assessed using control athletes, results were 0.09 (-0.70 to 0.88) and 0.08 (-1.00 to 1.00) (unweighted kappa).
- **Intraclass correlations**:
	- **SAC**: 0.33 (-0.02 to 0.61)
	- **m-BESS**: 0.33 (-0.2 to 0.60)
	- **EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit (tangential variability)**: 0.70 (0.50 to 0.83)
	- **EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit (radial variability)**: 0.47 (0.19 to 0.69)
	- **King-Devick test**: 0.71 (0.49 to 0.84)

The maximum identified sensitivity and specificity of each test for predicting clinical concussion diagnosis were as follows:

- **Symptom score**: 81% sensitivity / 94% specificity (3-point increase)
- **Symptom severity score**: 91% sensitivity / 81% specificity (3-point increase)
- **SAC**: 44% sensitivity / 72% specificity (2-point decline)
- **m-BESS**: 40% sensitivity / 92% specificity (5-point increase)
- **King-Devick**: 85% sensitivity / 76% specificity (any time increase)
- **EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit (tangential variability)**: 48% sensitivity / 58% specificity (any increase)
- **EYE-SYNC Smooth Pursuit (radial variability)**: 52% sensitivity / 61% specificity (any increase)

Adjusted area under the curve scores were:

- **Symptom score**: 0.95 (0.89, 0.99)
- **Symptom severity**: 0.95 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.99)
- **SAC**: 0.66 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.79)
- **m-BESS**: 0.71 (0.60, 0.83)
- **King-Devick**: 0.78 (0.69, 0.87)
- **Radial variability**: 0.47 (0.34, 0.59)

### Sensitivity of the concussion assessment battery [^111sWRmp]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Sports medicine clinicians commonly use multiple tests when evaluating patients with concussion. The specific tests vary but often include symptom inventories, posturography, and neurocognitive examinations. The sensitivity of these tests to concussion is vital in reducing the risk for additional injury by prematurely returning an athlete to play. Our study investigated the sensitivity of concussion-related symptoms, a postural control evaluation, and neurocognitive functioning in concussed collegiate athletes.

- **Methods**: From 1998 to 2005, all high-risk athletes completed a baseline concussion-assessment battery that consisted of a self-reported symptom inventory, a postural control evaluation, and a neurocognitive assessment. Postconcussion assessments were administered within 24 hours of injury to 75 athletes who had physician-diagnosed concussion. Individual tests and the complete battery were evaluated for sensitivity to concussion.

- **Results**: The computerized Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing and HeadMinder Concussion Resolution Index (neurocognitive tests) were the most sensitive to concussion (79.2% and 78.6%, respectively). These tests were followed by self-reported symptoms (68.0%), the postural control evaluation (61.9%), and a brief pencil-and-paper assessment of neurocognitive function (43.5%). When the complete battery was assessed, sensitivity exceeded 90%.

- **Conclusion**: Currently recommended concussion-assessment batteries accurately identified decrements in one or more areas in most of the athletes with concussion.

### Consensus statement on concussion in sport: The 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport-Amsterdam, October 2022 [^112bCcxq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

For over two decades, the Concussion in Sport Group has held meetings and developed five international statements on concussion in sport. This sixth statement summarizes the processes and outcomes of the 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport held in Amsterdam on 27–30 October 2022 and should be read in conjunction with the (1) methodology paper that outlines the consensus process in detail and (2) ten systematic reviews that informed the conference outcomes. Over 3½ years, author groups conducted systematic reviews of predetermined priority topics relevant to concussion in sport.

The format of the conference, expert panel meetings, and workshops to revise or develop new clinical assessment tools, as described in the methodology paper, evolved from previous consensus meetings with several new components. Apart from this consensus statement, the conference process yielded revised tools including the Concussion Recognition Tool-6 (CRT6) and Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-6 (SCAT6, Child SCAT6), as well as a new tool, the Sport Concussion Office Assessment Tool-6 (SCOAT6, Child SCOAT6).

This consensus process also integrated new features including a focus on the para athlete, the athlete's perspective, concussion-specific medical ethics, and matters related to both athlete retirement and the potential long-term effects of sport-related concussion, including neurodegenerative disease. This statement summarizes evidence-informed principles of concussion prevention, assessment, and management, and emphasizes those areas requiring more research.

### What are the critical elements of sideline screening that can be used to establish the diagnosis of concussion? A systematic review [^112TypB1]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Sideline detection is the first and most significant step in recognizing a potential concussion and removing an athlete from harm. This systematic review aims to evaluate the critical elements aiding sideline recognition of potential concussions, including screening tools, technologies, and integrated assessment protocols.

- **Data sources**: Bibliographic databases, grey literature repositories, and relevant websites were searched from 1 January 2000 to 30 September 2016. A total of 3,562 articles were identified.

- **Study selection**: Original research studies evaluating a sideline tool, technology, or protocol for sports-related concussion were eligible, of which 27 studies were included.

- **Data extraction**: A standardized form was used to record information. The QUADAS-2 and Newcastle-Ottawa tools were used to rate risk of bias. Strength of evidence was assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group system.

- **Data synthesis**: Studies assessing symptoms, the King-Devick test, and multimodal assessments reported high sensitivity and specificity. Evaluations of balance and cognitive tests described lower sensitivity but higher specificity. However, these studies were at high risk of bias, and the overall strength of evidence examining sideline screening tools was very low. A strong body of evidence demonstrated that head impact sensors did not provide useful sideline concussion information. Low-strength evidence suggested a multimodal, multitime-based concussion evaluation process incorporating video review was important in the re-evaluation process.

### Contemporary diagnosis and management of mild TBI (concussions): What you need to know [^114U6mAc]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents and is a form of mild traumatic brain injury that surgeons will see in their acute care practice. With a rapidly changing evidence base for diagnosis and management, it is crucial to focus on the importance of timely identification and diagnosis, as well as the early initiation of active management of pediatric concussion immediately after injury through recovery. This approach involves applying targeted therapies for specific deficits identified after concussion, addressing the individual pattern of symptoms experienced by patients following concussion.

The review covers what is known about the underlying pathophysiology that drives the clinical manifestations of concussion and the targeted clinical assessments that can aid in the diagnosis of concussion, as well as drive the active rehabilitation of deficits seen after concussion. The standardized approach to the return to activities will also be described, including return to learning and sports.

### Managing sports-related concussions from time of injury through return to play [^111Tb6NU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussions continue to generate widespread interest. A concussion is a complex pathophysiological process, with or without loss of consciousness, that results in a disturbance of brain function. Risk factors include: age under 18 years, female sex, and history of a previous concussion. A sideline physical examination with standardized assessment tools can assist in diagnosis. Management for suspected concussion begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest.

- **Stepwise return-to-play protocol**: A gradual increase in activity, considering state laws, until the athlete can perform full activity without symptoms should be followed. Neuropsychological testing may be used as a tool in management.
- **Prolonged concussion management**: Physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbances may be required.
- **Prevention**: Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in prevention.

The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.

### Sideline concussion assessment: The current state of the art [^11537mX9]. Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

More than 200 million American adults and children participate in organized physical activity. Growing awareness has highlighted that concussion, especially when repeated, may be associated with prolonged neurological, cognitive, and/or neuropsychiatric sequelae. Objective diagnosis of concussion remains challenging, as some symptoms may be apparent even to nonmedical observers. Diagnosis and removal from play for evaluation depend on validated assessment tools and trained, vigilant healthcare personnel. Over the past two decades, sideline concussion measures have undergone significant revision and augmentation to become more comprehensive batteries. These are designed to detect a wide spectrum of symptomatology, including neurocognitive function, post-concussive symptoms, gait/balance, and saccadic eye movements.

- **Sideline concussion measures**: This review summarizes the state-of-the-art concussion evaluation instruments, ranging from the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) to tools that may enhance concussion detection, such as near-term blood-based biomarkers and emerging technology (e.g. head impact sensors, vestibulo-ocular/eye-tracking, and mobile applications). Special focus is directed at the feasibility, utility, generalizability, and challenges to implementation of each measure on-field and on the sidelines.

This review finds that few instruments beyond the SCAT provide guidance for removal from play. Establishing thresholds for concussion detection and removal from play in the qualification/validation of future instruments is of high importance. Integration of emerging sideline concussion evaluation methods continues to evolve.

### Considerations for diagnosis and management of concussion [^11687uGt]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2019). Low credibility.

Concussion is an ongoing concern for health care providers. The incidence rates continue to be high, and the rate of recovery is variable due to potential risk factors. With no valid biomarkers, diagnosis and assessment of concussion remain a clinical challenge. The heterogeneity in presentation following injury provides an additional level of complexity, requiring the screening and evaluation of diverse body systems, including oculomotor, vestibular, autonomic, psychiatric, cervical, and cognitive symptoms.

While a few tools, such as the Vestibular/Ocular Motor Screening and Balance Error Scoring System, have been developed specifically for concussion, the vast majority of tests are adapted from other conditions. Further complicating the process is the overlapping and interactive nature of the multiple domains of post-concussion presentation. This commentary illustrates how clinicians can conceptualize the multiple profiles that present following concussion and describes tools that are available to assist with screening and evaluation of each area. The multifaceted nature of concussion warrants broad clinical screening skills and an interdisciplinary approach to management.

### Selected issues in sport-related concussion (SRC/mild traumatic brain injury) for the team physician: A consensus statement [^116iiS8q]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Obtain a more detailed history and perform a comprehensive physical examination. A distraction-free environment optimizes the evaluation. Assess for cognitive, somatic, and affective signs and symptoms of SRC, with particular attention to the number and severity of symptoms due to their prognostic significance. Perform and repeat neurological assessments, with particular emphasis on cognitive function, cranial nerve, and balance testing until the athlete is stable (e.g. SCAT). Athletes with suspected SRC should be immediately removed from practice or competition.

If no licensed healthcare provider is present to evaluate the athlete with suspected SRC, there is no RTP, even if symptoms resolve. If SRC is confirmed by a licensed healthcare provider, there is no same-day RTP. If evaluated by a licensed healthcare provider who determines an SRC did not occur, same-day RTP is an option. The athlete should not be left unsupervised until a disposition decision is made. Determine disposition for symptomatic and asymptomatic athletes, including serial assessments and post-injury follow-up (options include home with observation or transport to a hospital). Provide post-event instructions to the athlete and others (e.g. medications, driving, alcohol, physical and cognitive exertion, and medical follow-up). The final determination regarding SRC diagnosis and management is a medical decision based on clinical judgment.

- **Essential responsibilities of the team physician**:
	- Know the signs and symptoms of suspected SRC.
	- Recognize red flags (signs and symptoms with a protocol for emergency hospital transport).

### Concussion in para sport: The first position statement of the Concussion in Para Sport (CIPS) Group [^117D6diX]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Medical professionals should continue to use the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (SCAT5) for both 'on' and 'off' field concussion assessment for para athletes. The Concussion in Para Sport appendices can serve as a guide to interpret these results. Para athletes may have a concussion even if their SCAT5 is deemed to be 'normal'; consequently, SCAT5 should not be used by itself to diagnose concussion in para athletes. Given the challenges of diagnosing concussion in para athletes, periodic baseline pre-participation evaluations are essential as a point of reference.

### Diagnostic predictive values for sport-related concussions: A systematic review and diagnostic meta-analysis [^1179xhUJ]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2024). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussions (SRCs) can cause significant neurological symptoms, and approximately 10%-15% of athletes with SRC experience a prolonged recovery. Given the lack of visible injury on brain imaging and their varied presentations, concussions can be difficult to diagnose. A variety of tests and examination methods have been used to elicit a concussion diagnosis; however, the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are variable. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of standardized tests and visible signs like balance and vision changes in the diagnosis of SRC.

- **Methods**: A PRISMA-adherent systematic review of concussion diagnostic examinations was conducted using the PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases on December 1, 2022. Search terms included "concussion", "traumatic brain injury", "diagnosis", "sensitivity", and "specificity". Each method of examination was categorized into larger group-based symptomatologic presentations or standardized tools. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of concussion. Pooled specificity and sensitivity for each method were calculated using a meta-analysis of proportion and were hierarchically ranked using P-scores calculated from a diagnostic frequentist network meta-analysis.

- **Results**: Thirty full-length articles were identified for inclusion, 13 of which evaluated grouped symptomology examinations (balance and overall clinical presentation) and 17 of which evaluated established formalized tools (ImPACT, King-Devick, and others).

The study provides insights into the diagnostic tools used for SRCs and their effectiveness in detecting concussions.

### The new concussion in sport guidelines are here. But how do we get them out there [^114C5fFa]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The 2016 Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport has recently been published in BJSM, serving as the major conduit for informing sports medicine practitioners and clinicians worldwide about the importance of this condition, its assessment, and management. This information dissemination strategy has worked well for previous concussion statements and has certainly raised the profile of the issue in sports medicine circles.

### Current concepts in concussion: Initial evaluation and management [^112VqMDY]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Mild traumatic brain injury, also known as concussion, is common in adults and youth and is a major health concern. Concussion is caused by direct or indirect external trauma to the head, resulting in shear stress to brain tissue from rotational or angular forces. It can affect a variety of clinical domains: physical, cognitive, and emotional or behavioral. Because signs and symptoms are nonspecific, a temporal relationship between an appropriate mechanism of injury and symptom onset must be determined. Headache is the most common symptom.

Initial evaluation involves eliminating concern for cervical spine injury and more serious traumatic brain injury before establishing a diagnosis. Tools to aid diagnosis and monitor recovery include symptom checklists, neuropsychological tests, postural stability tests, and sideline assessment tools. If concussion is suspected in an athlete, the athlete should not return to play until medically cleared. Brief cognitive and physical rest are key components of initial management.

Initial management also involves patient education, reassurance, and symptom management. Individuals recover from concussion differently; therefore, rigid guidelines have been abandoned in favor of an individualized approach. As symptoms resolve, patients may gradually return to activity as tolerated. Those with risk factors, such as more severe symptoms immediately after injury, may require longer recovery periods. There is limited research in the younger population; however, given concern for potential consequences of injury to the developing brain, a cautious approach is advised.

### What are the most appropriate return-to-play guidelines for concussed child athletes [^115hfBKo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

To examine concussion literature for specific guidelines regarding return to play (RTP) following sport-related concussion in child athletes, a literature review was conducted. More than 60 articles and two websites were reviewed based on a literature search using Medline and Embase databases from 1998 to 2008.

There is a paucity of research on sport-related concussion in child athletes, particularly younger children (age 5–12 years). In particular, there is no research on RTP guidelines for child athletes following sport-related concussion. Child athletes take longer to recover from concussions than adults. Concussion symptoms may resolve before cognitive function has completely recovered. Concussion assessment and management in children can be confounded by their growth and development, as well as the lack of trained medical personnel involved with youth sports. There are no child-specific assessment tools for concussion.

RTP decisions in children should be made cautiously and should be individualised. No concussed child athlete should be allowed to RTP the same day. Physical and cognitive rest is very important to allow for the resolution of concussion symptoms. Child athletes should remain symptom-free for several days before starting a medically supervised stepwise exertion protocol. Further research is needed to elucidate the effects of concussion in children.

### Sports medicine update: Concussion [^112JH3Ze]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Low credibility.

A systematic approach is required for patients with a suspected concussion. Although standardized tools can aid in assessment, the diagnosis of concussion remains a clinical one. At the time of diagnosis, patients should be given both verbal and written reviews of the common symptoms of concussion, the expected course of recovery, and strategies to manage symptoms. Most patients benefit from a brief period of rest, followed by a gradual reintroduction of activities and a graduated return-to-sport protocol. Patients with prolonged recovery from a concussion may benefit from exercise, vestibular, and cognitive rehabilitation programs.

### The sports concussion note: Should SCAT become SCOAT [^117KXAJq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Sports concussion research and clinical guidelines have evolved rapidly. The most recent concussion consensus statement and guidelines (Zurich, 2008) provided clinicians with the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool version 2 (SCAT2) as a clinical template for the assessment of acute concussion. However, for the subsequent serial examinations required for the complete assessment of the concussed athlete, SCAT2 may be inadequate. This paper describes the experience and suggestions of South African sports physicians in evolving a more comprehensive clinical evaluation tool and record of patient care, the Sports Concussion Office Assessment Tool.

### Preliminary use of the physical and neurological examination of subtle signs for detecting subtle motor signs in adolescents with sport-related concussion [^116LwAHq]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2018). Low credibility.

Sensitive examination tools are needed to optimize evaluation after sports-related concussion. The Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs was preliminarily examined for sensitivity to motor changes in a pilot cohort of adolescents aged 13–17 years with sports-related concussion. A total of 15 adolescents (5 female) with sports-related concussion were evaluated up to three times: within 2 weeks of injury, approximately 1 month later (mean, 35 days between visits), and for those not recovered at the second visit, again after clinical recovery (mean, 70 days between the first and last visits for all participants). Comparison data were acquired from 20 age- and sex-matched healthy control athletes with no history of concussion who were evaluated twice (mean, 32 days apart). Main effects of group, time, and interaction effects were evaluated with an analysis of covariance, which controlled for socioeconomic status, times tested, and days between testing sessions. Adolescents with concussion had poorer Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs performance than controls at all time points. Performance improved between visits within the concussion group, with no change within the control group. These findings suggest that the Physical and Neurological Examination of Subtle Signs merits additional study in larger cohorts and in combination with other markers of injury to facilitate an enhanced understanding of sports-related concussion and recovery.

### Infographic. The first position statement of the concussion in para sport group [^113zbRtq]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Regular preparticipation and periodic health examinations in para athletes are essential to establish a baseline reference point for concussion symptoms. However, they pose challenges for the interpreting clinician.

Concussion in the para athlete population should be managed according to existing concussion consensus guidelines using the CIPS assessment tools. Paradoxically, while SCAT5 baseline testing cannot be mandated for para athletes, the clinician attending to a para athlete with a suspected concussion has a much greater need to have a comprehensive understanding of the para athlete's pre-injury cognitive function and physical abilities to effectively diagnose and manage the concussion.

Due to the lack of validity of the SCAT5 in general populations and the even greater variability of baseline scores between different disability groups, a para athlete may have a concussion even if his or her SCAT5 is deemed to be 'normal' Despite their limitations, regular preparticipation and periodic health examinations, along with the SCAT5, help guide the assessment of a suspected concussion for each para athlete impairment group.

As part of the overall assessment, an attending medical professional may choose to seek a corroborative history from suitable family members, caregivers, or members of the athlete's entourage who are familiar with the athlete's baseline level of function, if available, to assist in clinical decision-making. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that a team clinician with prior knowledge of the athlete is involved in the assessment process.

### Concussion guidelines in national and international professional and elite sports [^113mjAoi]. Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

The Berlin statement on sport-related concussion was published in 2017 using evidence-based recommendations. We aimed to examine the implementation, distribution, and education based on the Berlin recommendations, as well as the development of sport-specific protocols and guidelines among professional and elite sports. Additionally, we looked at the implementation of guidelines at the community level, their translation into different languages, and related research activities.

Senior medical advisers and chief medical officers from various organizations — including the Australian Football League, All Japan Judo Federation, British Horseracing Authority, Cricket Australia, Fédération Equestre Internationale, Football Association, Gaelic Athletic Association, International Boxing Association, Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, Major League Baseball, National Football League, National Hockey League, National Rugby League, and World Rugby — completed a questionnaire.

The results demonstrated that all 14 sporting organizations have published concussion protocols and guidelines based on the Berlin recommendations. These include aspects such as Recognize, Removal from play, Re-evaluation, Rest, Recovery, and Return to play. There is variable inclusion of prolonged symptoms, prevention and risk reduction, and long-term effects are addressed in the guidelines, rules and regulations, and/or sport-specific research. Educational programs, monitoring compliance with guidelines, and publication in other languages show variability as well. All sporting bodies are actively involved in concussion research.

We conclude that the Berlin recommendations have been included in the concussion protocols and guidelines across various sporting bodies.

### Sport-related concussion in children and adolescents [^1137rUGV]. Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

Regarding the specific circumstances surrounding concussion, particularly in pediatric patients, sport-related concussion management includes evaluating the return to sport. The AAP 2018 guidelines recommend considering neurocognitive testing following a sport-related concussion to assess for recovery. However, it should not be used as the sole determining factor for deciding when returning to play is appropriate. Testing should be conducted by providers trained in the proper conduction and interpretation of these tests.

### Current recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of concussion in sport: a comparison of three new guidelines [^111DZ9wz]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2014). Low credibility.

Currently, there is considerable debate within the sports medicine community about the role of concussion and the risk of chronic neurological sequelae. This concern has led to significant confusion among primary care providers and athletic trainers about how best to identify athletes at risk and how to treat those with concussion. During the first quarter of 2013, several new or updated clinical practice guidelines and position statements were published on the diagnosis, treatment, and management of mild traumatic brain injury/concussion in sports. Three of these guidelines were produced by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the Zurich Consensus working group.

The goal of each group was to clearly define best practices for the definition, diagnosis, and acute and post-acute management of sports-related concussion, including specific recommendations for return to play. In this article, we compare the recommendations of each of the three groups and highlight those topics for which there is consensus regarding the definition of concussion, diagnosis, and acute care of athletes suspected of having a concussion, as well as return-to-play recommendations.

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline on the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury among children [^1114VpnP]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). High credibility.

The guidelines from the CDC in 2018 specifically address circumstances surrounding concussions in pediatric patients. They recommend an active rehabilitation program that includes the progressive reintroduction of non-contact aerobic activities. These activities should not exacerbate symptoms and should follow the successful resumption of a gradual schedule. It is crucial to closely monitor the number and severity of symptoms during this process.

### Sport-related concussion [^115FnDqy]. Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Sport-related concussion is a common injury in children and adolescents. Athletes seldom report concussive symptoms, making diagnosis a challenge. The management of sport-related concussion has changed significantly over recent years. Previously used grading systems and return-to-play guidelines have been abandoned in favor of more individualized assessment and management. Neuropsychological testing is being used more frequently to assist in management. After recovery, it is recommended that an athlete's return-to-play progress in a gradual, stepwise fashion while being monitored by a health care provider. Proper assessment and management of a sport-related concussion is crucial because repeat concussions can result in decreased neurocognitive functioning, increased symptomatology, and, at times, catastrophic outcomes.

### Defining asymptomatic status following sports concussion: fact or fallacy [^115PRhym]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The management of sports concussion involves a return to the baseline 'asymptomatic' status prior to returning to play and training. Unfortunately, although the term 'asymptomatic' is widely used, it has not been operationally defined. This review identifies the need to formally define the term 'asymptomatic' as used in sports concussion, discusses some of the challenges associated with its definition, and offers some possible solutions for further debate. The operational definition of the term 'asymptomatic' may provide the stimulus for further informed discussion at a future meeting of the international Concussion in Sport group and by other peak sports medicine bodies involved in management guideline development.

### Sport-related concussion: Optimizing treatment through evidence-informed practice [^112FZvMU]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Concussion is one of the most common injuries in sport and recreation today. Reports of concussion have increased in recent years, likely due to increased societal awareness and the risk of longer-term sequelae. Presently, treatment includes a period of prescribed rest in the acute period following injury, followed by a protocol of graded exertion. Despite an initial period of rest and attempts at a gradual return to play, up to 30% of individuals may have ongoing symptoms past the acute period. The goal of this viewpoint is to introduce the reader to the most common symptoms of concussion and the need for a new, more active paradigm during treatment.

### Central nervous system trauma management of concussions in athletes [^113ATDsU]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The care of athletes with concussions is challenging because each patient presents with different symptoms. An athlete should never be returned to play until they are completely asymptomatic. Classification systems for concussions are not based on scientific evidence and represent some practitioners' best guesses at what is safe for young athletes. Many experienced team physicians believe they can allow an athlete to play safely if there are no symptoms at rest and when there are no symptoms with increasing exercise intensity.

Abbreviated neuropsychological testing and balance tests show promise for use in the field to increase the sensitivity of our neurological evaluation of injured athletes. Any neuropsychological or balance evaluation is more helpful if baseline data is collected on athletes before they are injured.

### American medical society for sports medicine position statement: concussion in sport [^111ivaas]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

- **Purpose of the statement**: To provide an evidence-based, best practices summary to assist physicians with the evaluation and management of sports concussion. It aims to establish the level of evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and pinpoint areas requiring additional research.

- **Importance of an AMSSM statement**: Sports medicine physicians are frequently involved in the care of patients with sports concussion. They are specifically trained to provide care throughout the continuum of sports concussion, from acute injury to return-to-play (RTP) decisions. The care of athletes with sports concussion is ideally performed by healthcare professionals with specific training and experience in the assessment and management of concussion. Competence should be determined by training and experience, not dictated by specialty. While this statement is directed towards sports medicine physicians, it may also assist other physicians and healthcare professionals in the care of patients with sports concussion.

- **Definition**: Concussion is defined as a traumatically induced transient disturbance of brain function and involves a complex pathophysiological process. It is a subset of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), which is generally self-limited and at the less-severe end of the brain injury spectrum.

- **Pathophysiology**: Animal and human studies support the concept of post-concussive vulnerability, showing that a second blow before the brain has recovered results in worsening metabolic changes within the cell. Experimental evidence suggests the concussed brain is less responsive.

### A simple field-based tool to assess concussion symptom reporting behavior [^117DJ2b6]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Prevention and treatment of sport-related concussions is an important public health issue and has led to increased research on concussion symptom reporting behavior. At the time of writing, there is neither a common understanding of what constitutes concussion symptom reporting behavior nor measures that capture key features of concussion symptom reporting behavior. Concussion symptom reporting behavior can be initiated by an athlete, an athletic trainer, a coach, or a teammate and can occur in competition, practice, or days after symptoms appear. Follow-up diagnostics range from asking athletes initial questions about their symptoms, to conducting rapid standardized sideline assessments, to conducting full comprehensive concussion screens. Currently, for athletes who are not formally diagnosed with a concussion, no information about concussion symptom reporting behavior sources, screening methods, or context is collected.

- **Methods**: Pilot data were collected from four National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I football programs. Athletic trainers recorded data about key concussion symptom reporting behavior features during the 2016 and 2017 football seasons. The 2016 data were analyzed in spring 2017, and the reporting form was adapted for the fall 2017 season. Two programs completed records during the 2017 season, and these records were analyzed in spring 2018.

- **Results**: Concussion symptom reporting behavior is most often initiated by athletes in practice contexts, followed by athletic trainers in game contexts. The 2017 data revealed that, regardless of source, 45% of initial reports…

### Assessing the predictive value of primary evaluation with the immediate post-concussion assessment and cognitive test following head injury [^115fYnTA]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Concussions are a significant public health concern, particularly for high school and college student-athletes. Although the field lacks robust prognostic metrics to accurately quantify concussion severity, the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test (ImPACT) serves as a widely accepted neurocognitive assessment tool for diagnosing and monitoring recovery from concussions. This study evaluates whether initial ImPACT scores, obtained within 48 hours post-injury, can reliably predict concussion persistence at follow-up.

Results from 6,912 ImPACT tests were analyzed, involving 2,161 unique student-athletes aged 12–22 years. The study introduces a novel metric, the Severity Index (SI) — a summation of the number of standard deviations from baseline at the 80% CI for each of the five composite scores reported by ImPACT. Patients were categorized into SI groups (0–3.99, 4–7.99, 8–11.99, 12+), and the relationships between these groups, composite scores, symptom profiles, and recovery times were characterized using one-way and two-way ANOVAs and Kaplan-Meier plots. A logistic regression evaluated the SI's predictive value for concussion outcomes at follow-up.

Patients with a higher SI at diagnosis were significantly more likely to remain concussed at their first follow-up (F3,2300 = 93.06; p < 0.0001). Groups with elevated SI displayed consistently prolonged recovery periods over 42 days and were more likely to report symptoms across all four symptom clusters: migraine, cognition, sleep, and neuropsychiatric. When controlling for sex, age, and other variables, these trends remained consistent.

### Onfield assessment of concussion in the adult athlete [^117H4J16]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The onfield assessment of concussion in the adult athlete is challenging given the elusiveness of injury, the sensitivity and specificity of the sideline assessment tools, and the evolving nature of concussive injury. This paper reviews the evidence related to the onfield assessment and considers questions related to same-day return to play, what to do when no physician is available onsite, as well as the benefit of remote notification of potential concussive events.

- **Objective**: To review the evidence regarding the onfield assessment of concussion in the adult athlete. Additional key issues to consider include same-day return to play for the adult athlete with concussion, what to do in a community setting when no doctor is present, and whether there is any benefit with remote notification of potential concussive events that occur on the playing field.

- **Data sources**: Systematic literature review of concussion assessment and management. PubMed, MEDLINE, Psych Info, and Cochrane Library databases were reviewed using the MeSH keywords concussion and mild traumatic brain injury combined with athletic injuries. Each was refined by adding the keywords 'adult', 'sideline assessment', 'onfield assessment', and 'return to play'.
- **Results**: For the MEDLINE search, using 'concussion' and 'athletic injuries' as keywords, there were 880 results, and refining by 'adult', there were 292 results. When 'traumatic brain injury' and 'athletic injuries' were combined, there were 210 results. When refining by 'adult', there were 89 results. Many of these results overlapped.

### Amsterdam 2022 process: A summary of the methodology for the Amsterdam International Consensus on Concussion in Sport [^112KMH7T]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to summarize the consensus methodology used to inform the International Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport (Amsterdam 2022). Building on a Delphi process to inform the questions and outcomes from the 5th International Conference on Concussion in Sport, the Scientific Committee identified key questions, the answers to which would help encapsulate the science in sport-related concussion and guide clinical practice. Over 3½ years, delayed by 2 years due to the pandemic, author groups conducted systematic reviews on each selected topic.

The 6th International Conference on Concussion in Sport was held in Amsterdam (27–30 October 2022) and consisted of two days of systematic review presentations, panel discussions, question and answer engagement with the 600 attendees, and abstract presentations.

- **Consensus deliberations**: This was followed by a closed third day of consensus deliberations by an expert panel of 29 with observers in attendance.
- **Workshop**: The fourth day, also closed, was dedicated to a workshop to discuss and refine the sports concussion tools (Concussion Recognition Tool 6 (CRT6), Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 6 (SCAT6), Child SCAT6, Sport Concussion Office Assessment Tool 6 (SCOAT6), and Child SCOAT6).

We include a summary of recommendations for methodological improvements for future research that grew out of the systematic reviews.

### Concussion guidelines step 2: Evidence for subtype classification [^114sirfd]. Neurosurgery (2020). Low credibility.

The results of this large, heterogeneous, and generalizable sample of adults and children support trends in the clinical consensus of subtype-oriented concussion diagnosis. This study identified evidence for concussion subtypes within the acute time frame of 3 days following injury, capturing patients that may have shortened courses of symptomatology and impairments following injury and indicating that subtype assessments should begin within the first clinical encounter.

A limited number of studies were included for analysis because many potentially applicable studies failed to report individual outcomes and had wide variability in acute concussion assessment times. Additionally, the lack of literature reporting robust objective assessment in this acute time period limited subtype-specific meta-analysis to largely symptom reports. None of the studies ultimately included for analysis within the reported time frame informed the cervical strain-associated condition, and we could not comment on its prevalence as an associated condition. The number of studies informing the ocular-motor subtype and sleep disturbance were also limited, with these topics representing newer areas of investigation.

For the purposes of this research, and relevant to clinical care, the accurate and timely report of post-concussive symptoms is critical to the reliability and stability of their assessments and these descriptions. This study examined the prevalence of concussion subtypes within the acute time frame to identify the need for targeted diagnostic and management approaches in the acute setting.

### Expert opinion and controversies in sports and musculoskeletal medicine: Concussion in the young athlete [^113jufZq]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2007). Low credibility.

Concussion is a common injury in young athletes and can be very challenging for clinicians to diagnose and manage. Debate exists over not only the incidence of long-term risks of multiple concussions but also the potential for catastrophic outcomes after sports-related head injury. Decisions on returning athletes to competition can be difficult, and there are limited prospective data on which to base these decisions. This has resulted in the existence of a number of published guidelines and consensus statements on the management of concussion in athletes. Athletes sustaining a concussion need appropriate on-field care and structured follow-up. Baseline cognitive assessments can be helpful, but clinicians must be aware that head trauma may result in a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms. The delivery of care and decisions on return to play need to be based on an individual assessment of the affected athlete.

This guidance applies during preparticipation athletic examinations and for patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and their families. Recovery from mTBI might be delayed under certain conditions, including:

- **Premorbid history of mTBI**: Previous experiences with mild traumatic brain injuries may affect recovery time.
- **Lower cognitive ability**: Particularly in patients with an intracranial lesion, cognitive challenges can impact recovery.
- **Neurological or psychiatric disorder**: Existing disorders may contribute to delayed recovery.
- **Learning difficulties**: Consideration should be given to whether learning challenges are present.
- **Increased pre-injury symptoms**: An elevated level of symptoms before the injury plays a role in the recovery process.
- **Family and social stressors**: Environmental and familial pressures can influence the recovery timeline.

### Median time to return to sports after concussion is within 21 days in 80% of published studies [^114aDJFH]. Arthroscopy (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature and evaluate the return to play (RTP) time frame following a concussion diagnosis. Our secondary purpose was to analyze and compare different prognostic variables affecting concussions, including time to return to school, time to symptom resolution of concussive symptoms, and time each patient spent in the RTP protocol.

- **Methods**: A PubMed, Scopus, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library database literature review was performed in August 2022. The studies needed to report, in days, the length of time a patient/athlete was removed from play due to concussion management. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions tool was used for assessing the risk of bias for each study. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria were applied for quality assessment.

- **Results**: Sixty-five studies were included in the systematic review, evaluating a total of 21,966 patients. The RTP time intervals ranged from 1 to 1,820 days, with 80.7% of the median RTP time frames for each study within 21 days. Preconcussion risk factors for prolonged RTP included female sex, younger age, presence of psychiatric disorders, and history of previous concussion. Postconcussion risk factors included severe symptom scores at the initial clinic visit, loss of consciousness, nonelite athletes, and delayed removal from competition. The most common sports resulting in concussion were contact sports, most notably football and soccer. The median time to return to school was between 3 and 23 days, and the median time to symptom resolution ranged from 2 to 11 days.

### Sideline assessment tools for the evaluation of concussion in athletes: A review [^113ioHgD]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Sports-related concussions, which have become more prevalent in the past decade, are an extremely common phenomenon in organized athletics and create a substantial economic burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, they can have devastating impacts on the athletic careers and long-term health of athletes. However, concussion evaluation remains a controversy with respect to diagnosis, management, and return-to-play guidelines for sports-related concussions. This is especially true of the immediate evaluation of sports-related concussion on the sidelines, where decisions must be made quickly and effectively with limited diagnostic resources.

Considerable effort has been directed toward developing reliable and valid sideline assessment modalities for concussion evaluation with the goal of accurately determining whether an athlete requires rapid removal from or is able to return to competition. This paper discusses the role of the concussion specialist on the sidelines during athletic competition and examines the tools and resources available for the sideline assessment of concussion. Additionally, new technologies, including electronic applications for smartphones and tablets, as well as future directions in sideline assessment of concussion, are examined.

### Implementation of the 2017 Berlin concussion in sport group consensus statement in contact and collision sports: A joint position statement from 11 national and international sports organisations [^114PRxb9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The fundamental starting point for the clinician is to make the diagnosis of concussion. Accurate and timely diagnosis may help facilitate earlier recovery, reduce the risk of early complications, and avoid further head and musculoskeletal injuries. Making an accurate diagnosis is both important and challenging because of concussion's varied and sometimes subtle presentation. Symptoms overlap with other musculoskeletal, psychological, and neurological diagnoses, and a lack of definitive investigations or diagnostic markers raises challenges. Because of these issues, concussion remains a clinical diagnosis.

The first step in diagnosing concussion is to identify the potential injury and evaluate the athlete. At all playing levels of all collision sports, a concussion evaluation is triggered when an athlete is identified as having experienced a forceful impact directly or indirectly transmitted to the head that was associated with:

- **Reported symptoms**: Symptom(s) reported by the athlete.
- **Visible signs**: Observable signs indicating potential concussion.
- **Clinical suspicion**: Any suspicion by medical staff.

Match officials may also report possible concussion to team clinicians. Some sports have implemented education programs aimed at training match officials to recognize possible concussion and act by stopping the game and notifying the appropriate team clinicians.

In community-level sport, there may not be adequately trained medical staff present. In this situation, any suspicion by a match official, coach, athletic trainer, first aider, or dedicated observer should result in removal of the athlete from the field.

### Predictors of clinical recovery from concussion: A systematic review [^115H58Vo]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The review protocol was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database for systematic reviews (protocol ID: CRD42016041479). The broad initial review questions provided by the scientific leadership committee of the Concussion in Sport Group were:

- **What are the key modifiers of concussion outcomes?**
- **What factors are associated with a poorer prognosis or future risk following concussion?**
- **How do we best quantify the role of these modifiers?**
- **How many concussions are too many?**
- **How do sex differences impact concussion management?**

Given the breadth of the initial questions, we narrowed the focus of this review to predictors of clinical outcome.

We defined outcome as 'clinical recovery and return to activities and sports'. We examined different types of predictor variables. Effect modification occurs when the magnitude of the effect of concussion on clinical recovery (i.e. the association) differs depending on the level of a third variable (i.e. the effect modifier variable). Intermediary variables are factors involved in the causal pathway between exposure (injury) and outcome (clinical recovery). Confounding variables are factors independently associated with the outcome (clinical recovery), and independently associated with the exposure (concussion), but they are not involved in the causal pathway between exposure and outcome. Confounding variables have a bidirectional association with both the exposure (concussion) and the outcome (clinical recovery).

### Summary of evidence-based guideline update: Evaluation and management of concussion in sports [RETIRED]: Report of the Guideline Development Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1115awNj]. Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

To update the 1997 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter regarding sports concussion, this study focuses on four main questions:

1. **Factors influencing concussion risk**: What factors increase or decrease concussion risk?
2. **Diagnostic tools**: What diagnostic tools identify those with concussion and those at increased risk for severe or prolonged early impairments, neurologic catastrophe, or chronic neurobehavioral impairment?
3. **Clinical risk factors**: What clinical factors identify those at increased risk for severe or prolonged early postconcussion impairments, neurologic catastrophe, reconcussions, or chronic neurobehavioral impairment?
4. **Interventions for recovery**: What interventions enhance recovery, reduce reconcussion risk, or diminish long-term sequelae?

The complete guideline on which this summary is based is available as an online data supplement to this article.

- **Methods**: We systematically reviewed the literature from 1955 to June 2012 for pertinent evidence, assessed the evidence for quality, and synthesized conclusions using a modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process. A modified Delphi process was used to develop recommendations.

- **Results**: Specific risk factors can increase or decrease concussion risk. Diagnostic tools to help identify individuals with concussion include graded symptom checklists, the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, neuropsychological assessments, and the Balance Error Scoring System. Ongoing clinical symptoms, concussion history, and younger age are indicators of risk for postconcussion impairments. Risk factors for reconcussion include a history of multiple concussions and participating in high-risk activities.

This study highlights important diagnostic tools and risk factors crucial for the evaluation and management of concussion in sports.

### Concussions and their consequences: Current diagnosis, management and prevention [^1161pb2o]. CMAJ (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on concussion:

- **Definition**: Concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) induced by direct or indirect biomechanical force transmitted to the head that is characterized by reversible symptoms of dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, and loss of consciousness.

- **Pathophysiology**: Concussion is caused by biomechanical force transmitted to the head in settings such as the work environment, motor vehicle crashes, sports and recreation, and falls at home among the elderly.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include dizziness, headache, nausea, imbalance, loss of consciousness, and on occasions, malignant brain swelling. Repeated concussions may cause post-traumatic epilepsy, post-concussion syndrome, and delayed post-traumatic brain degeneration leading to dementia and movement disorders.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Concussion is associated with increased mortality risk in the elderly, with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16–1.34).
