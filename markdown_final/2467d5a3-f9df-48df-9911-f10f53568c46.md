## Question

How long DAPT after cardiac surgery?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how long dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) should be continued after cardiac surgery, particularly coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and how to individualize the duration based on different clinical scenarios. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the patient had CABG for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) versus stable ischemic heart disease (SIHD). Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend for DAPT after CABG and the strength of evidence. Next, I will examine observational and randomized data on graft patency and clinical outcomes with DAPT versus aspirin alone. After that, I need to consider bleeding risk and perioperative timing, including when to start DAPT post-CABG. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight uncertainties and ongoing research.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. After CABG, DAPT is not universally indicated. Its use is primarily driven by the preoperative indication for revascularization, namely ACS versus SIHD, and by patient-specific ischemic and bleeding risks, so I need to ensure I anchor recommendations to those buckets before assigning a duration [^115mmRwp] [^1135K9Gv].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. For patients with ACS who undergo CABG, contemporary guidance supports DAPT for 12 months to complete the ACS-directed course, typically with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, and then transition to aspirin monotherapy thereafter. This is a Class I recommendation in ESC/ACC/AHA pathways, albeit based largely on extrapolation from non-CABG ACS populations and consensus rather than CABG-specific randomized trials, so I should be transparent about the evidence level [^113SzgGr] [^1145NPMF]. For patients with SIHD undergoing CABG, routine DAPT is not recommended. Aspirin monotherapy remains standard, with DAPT reserved for selected high-ischemic-risk scenarios such as recent stenting, poor graft quality, or off-pump surgery, and even then the evidence is limited to observational data and expert opinion, so I need to be cautious in overgeneralizing [^115mmRwp] [^1135K9Gv].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the strength of evidence. The ACC/AHA focused update and subsequent reviews emphasize that most CABG DAPT recommendations are extrapolated and underpowered, with no large, dedicated randomized trials establishing optimal duration or agent choice post-CABG, which means practice is heterogeneous and individualized by default [^1145NPMF] [^113T5714]. Surveys of cardiac surgeons show substantial variability in DAPT use after CABG, with many reserving it for ACS or high-risk features, reinforcing the lack of a uniform standard beyond the ACS 12-month framework [^111PSraa] [^111bnWmG].

> I will now examine the ischemic rationale. Observational and meta-analytic data suggest DAPT may reduce early vein graft failure and improve patency, particularly in ACS or off-pump contexts, but these are largely nonrandomized and confounded, so I should interpret them as hypothesis-generating rather than definitive [^1135K9Gv] [^1144UHad]. Wait, let me verify clinical outcomes beyond surrogates: large observational cohorts comparing DAPT versus aspirin alone after CABG have not consistently shown improved survival or fewer MACCE, tempering enthusiasm for routine DAPT in SIHD [^114iBzDj] [^116wK7Eo].

> But wait, what if bleeding risk negates any patency benefit? I need to check bleeding signals. Multiple analyses show DAPT after CABG increases major bleeding and transfusion requirements compared with aspirin alone, and bleeding itself is strongly associated with mortality, which can offset ischemic gains; this is especially pertinent in the early postoperative period when surgical hemostasis is critical [^114iBzDj] [^1144UHad]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought DAPT might uniformly reduce early events; however, propensity-matched data show no reduction in death/MI/stroke at 30 days with DAPT after perioperative MI, though rehospitalizations were fewer, underscoring uncertainty and the need for randomized trials in this space [^113sb5Yp].

> Let me consider timing and agent selection. For ACS patients, resuming the P2Y12 inhibitor within about 24–48 hours post-CABG, once chest tube output is acceptable and there is no active bleeding, is reasonable to complete the 12-month ACS course. Clopidogrel is most commonly used, while prasugrel or ticagrelor are less well studied post-CABG and carry higher bleeding risk, so I should prefer clopidogrel unless there is a compelling reason otherwise [^112uN8pn] [^1135K9Gv]. I should double-check perioperative transitions: if the patient arrives on potent P2Y12 therapy, holding it 3–5 days preoperatively and restarting after hemostasis is secured is standard, with aspirin typically continued through the perioperative period unless contraindicated [^112Qmytr] [^112M3gc5].

> Next, I should review special scenarios. In patients with prior coronary stents undergoing CABG, completing the originally indicated DAPT duration for the stent indication is advised, which often aligns with the 12-month ACS course if the stent was placed in that context. In SIHD stent patients, completing at least 6 months of DAPT is typical before de-escalation, though this is extrapolated from PCI data rather than tested in CABG populations [^115mmRwp] [^115eYUqy]. For off-pump CABG or when graft quality is suboptimal, some experts consider a time-limited course of DAPT to mitigate early graft thrombosis, but again this is based on limited evidence and must be balanced against bleeding risk on a case-by-case basis [^1135K9Gv] [^1144UHad].

> I should confirm the bottom line and make it actionable. For ACS patients undergoing CABG, use DAPT for 12 months (aspirin plus clopidogrel preferred), then continue aspirin indefinitely, assuming no bleeding. For SIHD patients undergoing CABG, use aspirin monotherapy and reserve DAPT for selected high-ischemic-risk cases with careful bleeding risk assessment, and if used, consider shorter courses such as 1–3 months before transitioning back to aspirin alone, acknowledging the evidence gap and the need for shared decision-making [^1145NPMF] [^115mmRwp] [^111RhKb7]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary risk stratification: yes, current pathways endorse individualized DAPT decisions after CABG, emphasizing bleeding-ischemia balance and the lack of definitive CABG-specific randomized data, which supports a conservative, selective approach outside ACS [^1135K9Gv] [^113T5714].

> Finally, I need to ensure I communicate uncertainties. The field lacks large, high-quality randomized trials dedicated to post-CABG DAPT duration and agent choice; ongoing studies like TiCAB may clarify the role of ticagrelor after CABG, but until then, practice will remain heterogeneous and should be guided by ACS indication, procedural factors, and patient-specific bleeding and ischemic risks, with routine DAPT avoided in SIHD absent compelling features [^1135K9Gv] [^115mmRwp].

After cardiac surgery, **DAPT is not routinely indicated** [^112oAawZ] unless the patient has an ACS indication or recent stenting. For ACS patients undergoing CABG, **DAPT for 12 months** (aspirin plus clopidogrel) is recommended, then continue aspirin indefinitely [^113SzgGr]. For stable CAD without recent stenting, **aspirin alone is standard**; consider DAPT only in selected high-risk cases (e.g. poor grafts, diabetes) and limit to 1–3 months due to bleeding risk [^111RhKb7]. For recent PCI (< 12 months), complete the indicated DAPT course post-CABG if feasible [^115mmRwp]. Always individualize based on ischemic and bleeding risk, and monitor closely for bleeding complications [^116faPhE].

## Indications for DAPT after cardiac surgery

DAPT is **not routinely indicated after cardiac surgery** [^113V7rrN]; it is reserved for specific clinical scenarios:

- **Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)**: Patients who undergo CABG for ACS [^113SzgGr] should receive DAPT for 12 months postoperatively, then continue aspirin indefinitely.

- **Recent coronary stenting**: If CABG is performed within 12 months of PCI with stent placement, complete the indicated DAPT duration postoperatively if feasible [^115mmRwp].

- **High-risk patients**: In selected stable patients with high ischemic risk (e.g. poor graft quality, diabetes), consider short-term DAPT (1–3 months) [^111RhKb7], balancing bleeding risk.

---

## Recommended duration of DAPT after cardiac surgery

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dapt duration** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| ACS undergoing CABG | 12 months (aspirin + clopidogrel) | Class I recommendation [^1145NPMF] |
| Stable CAD without recent stenting | Aspirin alone; DAPT not routine | Class I recommendation [^notfound] |
| Recent PCI (< 12 months) undergoing CABG | Complete indicated DAPT duration post-CABG if feasible | Class I recommendation [^115mmRwp] |
| High-risk stable patients (e.g. poor grafts, diabetes) | Short-term DAPT (1–3 months) if considered | Expert opinion [^111RhKb7] |

## Risks and benefits of DAPT after cardiac surgery

### Benefits

Benefits include **reduced ischemic events**, as DAPT lowers myocardial infarction and graft failure in ACS patients [^notfound], and **improved graft patency**, with potential early graft patency benefits in high-risk patients [^1135K9Gv].

---

### Risks

Risks include **increased bleeding**, with higher rates of major bleeding, transfusions, and reoperation [^1144UHad], and **no clear mortality benefit**, as DAPT after CABG does not consistently reduce mortality outside ACS indications [^1144UHad].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

- **ACS patients**: DAPT for 12 months post-CABG, then aspirin indefinitely [^113SzgGr].

- **Stable CAD**: Aspirin alone; DAPT not routine [^115mmRwp].

- **Recent PCI**: Complete indicated DAPT post-CABG if feasible [^115mmRwp].

- **High-risk stable patients**: Consider short-term DAPT (1–3 months) if bleeding risk is acceptable [^111RhKb7].

---

## Individualized patient factors influencing DAPT duration

- **Ischemic risk**: ACS, diabetes, poor graft quality, recent stenting [^114Wneuq].

- **Bleeding risk**: Age, renal impairment, prior bleeding, low body weight [^1144UHad].

- **Surgical factors**: Off-pump vs on-pump, completeness of revascularization [^1144UHad].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **regular assessment** for bleeding, adherence, and adverse effects, with **laboratory monitoring** as needed (e.g. platelet function tests) in high-risk patients.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **ACS patients**: DAPT for 12 months post-CABG, then aspirin indefinitely [^113SzgGr].

- **Stable CAD**: Aspirin alone; DAPT not routine [^115mmRwp].

- **Recent PCI**: Complete indicated DAPT post-CABG if feasible [^115mmRwp].

- **High-risk stable patients**: Short-term DAPT (1–3 months) if bleeding risk is acceptable [^111RhKb7].

---

DAPT after cardiac surgery is **not routine** and is reserved for ACS, recent stenting, or selected high-risk stable patients. Duration is individualized based on ischemic and bleeding risk, with close monitoring for complications [^1119LK3L].

Background

Clinical practice guidelines recommend post-operative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) following acute coronary syndromes (ACS).

Objectives

The authors have evaluated DAPT utilization rates and associated outcomes among post-CABG patients with diabetes.

Methods

In a post hoc, nonrandomized analysis from the FREEDOM (Future REvascularization Evaluation in patients with Diabetes mellitus: Optimal management of Multivessel disease) trial, we compared patients receiving DAPT (aspirin plus thienopyridine) and aspirin monotherapy at 30 days post-operatively. The primary outcome was the risk adjusted 5-year FREEDOM composite of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke. Safety outcomes included major bleeding, blood transfusion, and hospitalization for bleeding.

Results

At 30 days post-CABG, 544 (68.4%) patients received DAPT and 251 (31.6%) patients received aspirin alone. The median (25th, 75th percentile) duration of clopidogrel therapy was 0.98 (0.23 to 1.91) years. There was no significant difference in the 5-year primary composite outcome between DAPT- and aspirin-treated patients (12.6% vs. 16.0%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54 to 1.27; p = 0.39). The 5-year primary composite outcomes were similar for patients receiving DAPT versus aspirin monotherapy respectively, in subgroups with pre-CABG ACSs (15.2% vs. 16.5%; HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.53 to 2.10; p = 0.88) and those with stable angina (11.6% vs. 15.8%; HR: 0.82; 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.343; p = 0.42). The composite outcomes of both treatment groups were also similar by SYNTAX score, duration of DAPT therapy, completeness of revascularization, and in off-pump CABG. No treatment-related differences in major bleeding (5.6% vs. 5.7%; HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.99; p = 0.99), blood transfusions (4.8% vs. 4.5%; HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.51 to 2.34; p = 0.82), or hospitalization for bleeding (2.6% vs. 3.3%; HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.34 to 2.17; p = 0.74) were observed between aspirin- and DAPT-treated patients, respectively.

Conclusions

The use of DAPT in patients with diabetes post-CABG in our cohort was high. Compared with aspirin monotherapy, no associated differences were observed in cardiovascular or bleeding outcomes, suggesting that routine use of DAPT may not be clinically warranted.

1 Introduction

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 inhibitor is the cornerstone of medical therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). DAPT reduces recurrent ischemic events, most notably in‐stent thrombosis, the risks of which are markedly elevated following PCI. With appropriate treatment, the risk of ischemic events generally decreases over the 1−3 months after intervention, whereas the risk of bleeding persists and is proportional to the intensity and duration of treatment. The reductions of these ischemic events like, stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction, must be weighed against the increased bleeding risks associated with these DAPT, as both recurrent ischemia and bleeding are associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Weighing these risks, both US and European guidelines currently recommend 6‐ and 12‐month durations of DAPT following PCI with drug‐eluting stents (DES) for stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), respectively, in patients without high bleeding risk, followed by single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) indefinitely.

The risk‐benefit equation of DAPT after PCI has evolved, however, with the development of new medical and interventional therapies, like more potent P2Y12 inhibitors and newer generation DES. Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have brought into question the appropriate duration of DAPT following PCI and suggest it may be shorter than current recommendations. Despite these trials, multiple questions remain unclear, such as the optimal duration of DAPT after PCI, the choice of agent in SAPT, and which specific populations may benefit most from shorter durations of DAPT. To answer these questions, we conducted a meta‐analysis of RCTs examining a shorter duration of DAPT.

Existing Guidelines for the Perioperative Management of Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with a Coronary Artery Stent

A recent systematic review identified 11 clinical practice guidelines for the perioperative management of antiplatelet therapy in patients with a coronary stent who need non-cardiac surgery. These authors applied the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument (with a maximum score of 161) to assess the quality of the identified guidelines, Five of the 11 practice guidelines had an AGREE II score of > 100: American College of Chest Physicians, American College of Cardiology/ American Heart Association (ACC/AHA), Canadian Cardiovascular Society, European Society for Cardiology, and Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons has also published updated guidelines on the management of antiplatelet therapy in cardiac and non-cardiac surgical patients.

However, despite some having AGREE II scores of greater than 100, a paucity of available definitive evidence has resulted in perioperative coronary artery stent guidelines that are divergent and vague on key issues. Recommendations vary regarding the amount of time which must elapse between stent placement and elective surgery in order to have an acceptable risk of acute stent thrombosis when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is discontinued. If DAPT must be interrupted within this critical period due to the risk of bleeding, the recommended timing of aspirin and thienopyridine discontinuation also varies.

These existing guidelines provide well-defined — albeit contradictory — recommendations on how long elective procedures should be delayed following coronary stent placement. However, for patients needing urgent surgery, while still presumably requiring DAPT, the recommendations concerning antiplatelet medications become vague. Most of the guidelines simply advise somehow weighing the risk of stent thrombosis against the risk of bleeding and, if at all possible, continuing the DAPT therapy throughout the perioperative period. The most current ACC/AHA guidelines do thoroughly review many of the risks associated with both stent thrombosis and surgical bleeding, but the incorporation of these risks into the final recommendations is incomplete.

Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

This meta‐analysis of RCTs was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analysesand Cochrane Collaborationrecommendations (Table S1). The protocol was registered with International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, number CRD42023239341. As the present research was a study‐level meta‐analysis of published randomized trials, the requirement for ethics committee approval was waived. The data that support the findings of this meta‐analysis are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases as of January 4, 2024. Details of the Medical Subject Headings terms used for literature search are shown in Table S2. Reference lists of studies, review articles, meta‐analyses, and editorials identified were screened for additional eligible studies. No language or sample size restrictions were considered.

Study Selection

In this meta‐analysis, we included peer‐reviewed publications of RCTs with the following prespecified eligibility criteria (Table S3): (1) patients who underwent PCI with newer‐generation DES, (2) studies with random allocation of different antiplatelet regimens, (3) studies comparing 2 antiplatelet strategies: P2Y 12 inhibitor SAPT following a short course (≤ 3 months) of DAPT versus conventional (6–12 months) DAPT, (4) studies reporting on patient baseline clinical presentation, and (5) studies reporting clinical outcomes. We excluded individual reports of the same trial providing outcome data at different follow‐up periods, as well as observational and unpublished studies due to the inherent risk of bias. For the STOPDAPT‐2 (Short and Optimal Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy 2) trial, we used the results from the prespecified pooled analysisthat combined individual patient data from STOPDAPT‐2and STOPDAPT‐2 ACS trials, thus providing a direct comparison between patients with CCS and ACS included in both studies. Two authors (S.D. Q.C.) independently performed the literature search, reviewed the identified titles and abstracts, and selected studies for inclusion based on the predefined criteria. Disagreements were resolved by consensus and arbitration by a third author (J.F. I.).

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for long-term secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events [^111ZVLvL]. Clinical Therapeutics (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y 12 inhibitor is currently recommended to prevent further ischemic events after percutaneous coronary intervention and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Guidelines currently recommend a minimum of 6 months after elective drug-eluting stent placement and at least 12 months of DAPT after ACS; however, the benefits of prolonged treatment are unclear. The purpose of this review was to conduct a detailed examination of the data refuting or supporting the use of DAPT beyond 1 year in patients with ACS and in patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting.

Methods

A search of PubMed was performed to identify articles published in the last 20 years that addressed the role of DAPT beyond 12 months' duration.

Findings

A number of studies have shown ischemic benefits associated with prolonging DAPT beyond 12 months, but this finding is dependent on the patient population studied and the quality of the study design. Many studies also show that longer duration therapy has been associated with increased bleeding risk. In patients with previous myocardial infarction completing at least 1 year of DAPT, continuing DAPT with a reduced dose of ticagrelor 60 mg BID is a regimen to be considered for these patients; in general ACS patients, a reduced dose of 60 mg BID of ticagrelor after the first year of DAPT should be considered; and in the post-percutaneous coronary intervention patients, DAPT beyond 1 year should be considered after careful evaluation of the patient's thrombotic and bleeding risks.

Implications

The duration of DAPT, and the choice of P2Y 12 inhibitor, should be tailored to the individual patient. To optimize patient outcomes, the benefits and risks associated with prolonging DAPT need to be evaluated, considering comorbidities and the presence of bleeding and ischemic risk factors. Despite some limitations, risk scores, such as the DAPT score, are available to help guide decisions for the best approach for each patient.

Table 2
Clinical Characteristics Benefiting From Extended‐Duration DAPT

In summary, prolonged DAPT appears more beneficial in patients with ACS treated with ticagrelor or prasugrel, with risk factors for recurrent ischemia at a cost of increased bleeding. However, any clinician will also recognize that not all bleeding or ACS events carry the same risk. Indeed, a clinician‐patient shared decision making seems apt when discussing the optimal duration of DAPT. On the other hand, the clinician must also remember that trials evaluating DAPT over 5 years are currently lacking. Therefore, although possibly beneficial, any DAPT beyond this time period has no strong clinical evidence. With the continuous medication and stent advances, the optimal DAPT duration will likely be altered, but until then the current guidelines supporting DAPT duration of 12 months in ACS with further tailoring of therapy based on an individual risk of further ischemic or bleeding events provide an excellent framework to begin. Evolving research will help us further understand the risks and benefits of extended‐duration DAPT, especially with the newer‐generation stents.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^114mnFPG]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend DAPT combining low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day) and a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) during 12 months for patients with ACS managed conservatively (class I). Although the use of ticagrelor over clopidogrel seems reasonable (class IIa), the administration of prasugrel is not recommended (class III). Long-term DAPT may be considered for selected patients who tolerated the DAPT regimen during the first 12 months without bleeding (class IIb)(figure 2).

Notwithstanding, contemporary randomised data on the optimal DAPT strategy for medically managed patients with ACS are scarce. Patients with ACS undergoing conservative management represent a large and highly heterogeneous population, and the generalisation of recommendations on the duration of DAPT for patients with ACS treated with PCI to this specific patient subgroup is questionable in view of the currently available evidence. Future research to determine the optimal antiplatelet regimen and duration in conservatively managed patients with ACS is therefore warranted.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Current perspectives on DAPT after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) emphasize shorter durations and individualized decisions, with editorials stating that "Courses of clopidogrel exceeding 12 months do not contribute favorably to patient outcomes and may in fact be detrimental", that "DAPT may not be necessary beyond the initial 6 months, at least in low-risk patients", and that "With newer-generation DES, 6 months DAPT might be sufficient, and 3 months not completely off the wall in low-risk groups". Additional commentaries concluded that "Shorter DAPT duration seems very reasonable to consider", that "The safest and most effective duration of dual antiplatelet therapy therefore remains uncertain and must be individualized", and that "The net clinical benefit of 30 months over 12 months DAPT overall seems marginal". For PEGASUS, a critique reported ticagrelor was associated with an absolute benefit of 1.1 percentage points (90-mg) and 1.27 percentage points (60-mg) in the primary end points, with absolute increases of 1.54 and 1.24 percentage points for clinically significant bleeding and 1.71 and 1.37 percentage points for transfusion; treating 10000 patients for 1 year with the 60-mg dose would prevent approximately 42 primary end points and produce approximately 31 TIMI major bleeding events, noted as "close to an even proposition" and a reminder of "the fragile balance between efficacy and adverse events".

### Aspirin alone versus dual antiplatelet therapy after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: a systematic review and patient-level meta-analysis [^114E63Z6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this patient‐level meta‐analysis of all available prospective randomized trials, we investigated the effect of aspirin alone compared with DAPT after TAVI on thromboembolic and bleeding complications in patients without an indication for oral anticoagulation. In summary, aspirin alone significantly reduced the rate of the composite of major and life‐threatening bleeding or thromboembolic events (including all‐cause mortality, major and life‐threatening bleeding, stroke, or myocardial infarction), compared with DAPT. The difference was caused by a large increase of major and life‐threatening bleeding complications in patients receiving DAPT as compared with patients receiving aspirin alone. Moreover, aspirin alone after TAVI was not associated with an increased incidence of the composite of thromboembolic complications (including all‐cause mortality, stroke, or myocardial infarction). Also, the individual incidences of all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction outcome were comparable between both groups.

Even decades after its introduction, the ideal antithrombotic strategy following TAVI is not completely determined yet. In order to minimize both the thromboembolic risk and the bleeding risk, an optimal balance in antithrombotic therapy should be pursued. The current guidelines on antithrombotic therapy following TAVI in patients without a long‐term indication for oral anticoagulation recommend DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel for the first 3 to 6 months, followed by aspirin alone. 7, 8 However, these statements rely on expert consensus, rather than prospective randomized evidence. Antiplatelet therapy in addition to aspirin is considered to reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications in the first period after TAVI, as was observed in patients undergoing coronary artery stenting. 16 After this initial period, the thromboembolic risk is thought to return to that of the general elderly population and therefore does not need strong antithrombotic therapy. 17

### Dual antiplatelet therapy up to the time of non-elective coronary artery bypass grafting with prophylactic platelet transfusion: is it safe? [^112SYoWE]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines suggest that patients discontinue Clopidogrel at least 5 days prior to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) are at high risk for myocardial infarction (MI) if not treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). We sought to assess pre and post-operative outcomes of patients maintained on Clopidogrel and aspirin up to the time of surgery and compare them with those on aspirin alone.

Methods

From the cardiac surgery database, 240 patients were retrospectively registered between January and May 2017. There were 126 patients with ACS who underwent CABG on DAPT (Clopidogrel group [CG]) and 114 patients who underwent elective CABG on aspirin alone (control). The CG received intraoperative prophylactic platelet transfusion (PPT). Demographics, comorbidities, and laboratory data were prospectively entered at the time of surgery and were subsequently retrieved for analysis. Per and postoperative findings were identified and compared between both groups.

Results

The cohort consisted of 240 patients (mean age 61 years, 81.3% were male, SD ± 9.58). Patients in the CG were younger (Median 57 vs. 63, P -value 0.001), and with male predominance (86% versus 75%, P -value 0.028). In addition, they had less prevalence for diabetes and renal failure as compared to control (P -values 0.003, and 0.005, respectively). There were no significant differences between both groups in number of vessels grafts, duration of on-pump and aortic clamp. Hematologic laboratory data had also similar baseline values. The CG had similar bleeding rate, redo surgery and in-hospital death (P -values non-significant), however more infection and total hospital stay as compared to control (p -values 0.048 and 0.001).

Conclusion

Patients who are at increased risk for MI can be maintained on DAPT up to the time of CABG because surgery is safe when patients are offered PPT.

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for stented patients: an update for the clinician [^111FkS5w]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Determining the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following percutaneous coronary intervention is a complex decision. Randomized controlled trials have shown that while shorter durations of DAPT may lower the risk of bleeding, longer durations of DAPT can reduce the risk of late stent thrombosis and ischemia-related events. In this review article, we will discuss the current guidelines, review contemporary trial data that have evaluated short and extended durations of DAPT, and address common clinical questions. Ultimately, the determination of the optimal duration of DAPT is an individualized decision that requires clinicians to assess each patient's risk for bleeding and recurrent ischemic events.

### Comparison of midterm outcomes associated with aspirin and ticagrelor vs aspirin monotherapy after coronary artery bypass grafting for acute coronary syndrome [^113SzgGr]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and a P2Y 12 inhibitor reduces ischemic events and death in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and is recommended in the current guidelines for all ACS patients without contraindications, including those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). The recommended duration of DAPT for patients with ACS undergoing CABG is 12 months, and the use of a more potent P2Y 12 inhibitor (eg, ticagrelor or prasugrel) is recommended over clopidogrel.

The guidelines for DAPT for patients with ACS undergoing CABG recommended by both the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and European Society of Cardiology, are based on limited evidence (level C) mainly derived from non-CABG populations, subgroup analyses of ACS trials, and meta-analyses of small randomized trials with surrogate end points. No randomized trials with sufficient statistical power or large observational studies with clinical outcome data supporting the current DAPT guidelines for patients undergoing CABG have been published, and the adherence to DAPT recommendations has consistently been reported to be low.,

In this nationwide cohort study of Swedish adults, we investigated whether the adjusted risk of ischemic events and major bleeding after CABG differed between patients with ACS treated with ASA and ticagrelor compared with ASA alone. A secondary aim was to describe the use of DAPT over time in patients with ACS undergoing CABG.

### Oral dual antiplatelet therapy: what have we learnt from recent trials? [^111nHAYx]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

International guidelines recommend the use of aspirin treatment immediately and indefinitely in coronary patients. The optimal time to start and the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor) have not been clearly established. Recent clinical trials have provided important new information allowing for evidence-based decisions regarding timing of initiation and duration of DAPT. The benefit-to-risk ratio of DAPT pre-treatment appears to depend on the type of acute coronary syndrome, the time until angiography, and the onset of action of the drug. In stable patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with the latest generation drug-eluting stents, patients should be treated for at least ∼6 months. Shorter courses of therapy may be necessary when special conditions occur (e.g. surgery; oral anticoagulation). Longer courses of therapy may be reasonable in patients at low bleeding risk who are tolerating DAPT well. For patients with ACS, prolonged DAPT is beneficial and therefore reasonable as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy. Individualized management of DAPT must be seen as a dynamic prescription with regular re-evaluations of the risk-benefit to the patient according to changes in his/her clinical profile.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) remains uncertain. Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.

Aim

Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.

Methods

We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are > 1 year past an MI?

Results

We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer: A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT > 1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). A meta-analysis and a post hoc analysis of an RCT in patients with stable cardiovascular disease produced similar findings.

Conclusions

The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.

### Impact of dual antiplatelet therapy on outcomes among aspirin-resistant patients following coronary artery bypass grafting [^1117P8vB]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting is pivotal in the contemporary management of complex coronary artery disease. Interpatient variability to antiplatelet agents, however, harbors the potential to compromise the revascularization benefit by increasing the incidence of adverse events. This study was designed to define the impact of dual antiplatelet therapy (dAPT) on clinical outcomes among aspirin-resistant patients who underwent coronary artery surgery. We randomly assigned 219 aspirin-resistant patients according to multiple electrode aggregometry to receive clopidogrel (75 mg) plus aspirin (300 mg) or aspirin-monotherapy (300 mg). The primary end point was a composite outcome of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular hospitalization assessed at 6 months postoperatively. The primary end point occurred in 6% of patients assigned to dAPT and 10% of patients randomized to aspirin-monotherapy (relative risk 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.25 to 1.51, p = 0.33). No significant treatment effect was noted in the occurrence of the safety end point. The total incidence of bleeding events was 25% and 19% in the dAPT and aspirin-monotherapy groups, respectively (relative risk 1.34, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 2.23, p = 0.33). In the subgroup analysis, dAPT led to lower rates of adverse events in patients with a body mass index > 30 kg/m(2) (0% vs 18%, p < 0.01) and those < 65 years (0% vs 10%, p = 0.02). In conclusion, the addition of clopidogrel in patients found to be aspirin resistant after coronary artery bypass grafting did not reduce the incidence of adverse events, nor did it increase the number of recorded bleeding events. dAPT did, however, lower the incidence of the primary end point in obese patients and those < 65 years.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation: conceptual evolution based on emerging evidence [^114FS3Ku]. European Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this article is to review the contemporary literature on optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. Relevant studies were searched through MEDLINE, the Cochrane database, and the EMBASE database. Of the 6852 publications retrieved, 23 were considered relevant, including 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 12 meta-analyses. Initially prescribed for 3–6 months after first-generation DES, the recommended duration of DAPT was subsequently prolonged to at least 1 year, a response to reports of late stent thrombosis after DAPT discontinuation. Seven RCTs subsequently suggested that 1-year DAPT may not be necessary after DES implantation, and that a 6-month or even a 3-month course of DAPT may be as effective and safer. In contrast, four RCTs examining the benefit of DAPT beyond 1 year reached conflicting conclusions. In the DAPT trial, 30-month compared with 12-month DAPT after DES resulted in reduced rates of stent thrombosis and major adverse cardiovascular events, but greater rates of major bleeding with increased non-cardiac mortality. Several meta-analyses have subsequently been performed collectively demonstrating increased rates of all-cause mortality with prolonged DAPT compared with shorter DAPT after DES, due to greater non-cardiovascular mortality with prolonged DAPT not offset by a concomitant reduction in cardiac mortality. The benefit-risk ratio of prolonged DAPT appears to be better in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) than in those without prior MI. On the basis of these findings, a personalized approach is advisable when deciding upon the optimal duration of DAPT after DES, wherein the individualized risks of ischaemic vs. bleeding events are carefully considered for each patient.

### Comparison of aspirin monotherapy versus dual antiplatelet therapy following coronary artery bypass grafting [^114iBzDj]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Aspirin remains the gold standard antiplatelet regimen following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), however, there is growing support for dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). This study compares outcomes of aspirin monotherapy versus DAPT following CABG. This was a propensity-matched retrospective study from a large, multi-hospital healthcare system. It included patients who received either aspirin monotherapy or DAPT following isolated CABG between 2011 and 2018. Patients prescribed aspirin monotherapy were started on 81 mg aspirin daily, and patients on DAPT were prescribed 81 mg aspirin daily and 75 mg clopidogrel daily. Patients received alternative drug dosing or antiplatelet agents other than clopidogrel only if this was prescribed for another diagnosis or they had a preexisting contraindication. Primary outcomes included overall survival and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), defined as a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization. Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test were used to compare survival and cumulative incidence curves and Gray's test were used to compare MACCE. A total of 3,562 propensity-matched patients were included, 1,242 (34.9%) receiving aspirin monotherapy and 2,320 (65.1%) receiving DAPT. Groups were well-matched with respect to age, baseline comorbidity, indication for CABG, and completeness of revascularization. Median follow-up was 4.90 years (IQR 3.30 to 6.90 years). DAPT was associated with higher rate of postoperative transfusion (30.7% vs 25.4%, p = 0.001). Overall survival was comparable between groups (1-year aspirin 95.9% versus DAPT 97.2% and 5-years aspirin 86.3% versus DAPT 87.8%; log-rank p = 0.194). Rates of MACCE were also similar (1-year aspirin 9.4% versus DAPT 8.7% and 5-years aspirin 26.7% versus DAPT 24.7%; p = 0.798). In this propensity-matched analysis, DAPT did not confer any advantage in terms of improved survival or freedom from MACCE compared to aspirin monotherapy following isolated CABG, and was associated with a higher postoperative transfusion rate.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA systematic review on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) and after myocardial infarction (MI) summarizes randomized evidence and tradeoffs. Evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling 33 051 patients found that use of DAPT for 12 months versus 3 to 6 months showed no significant differences in death, major hemorrhage, MI, or stent thrombosis with reported odds ratios and confidence intervals, and Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. For extended therapy, use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months yielded no difference in all-cause death but increased major hemorrhage, decreased MI, and decreased stent thrombosis; a risk-benefit analysis estimated 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. In patients with prior MI, use of DAPT > 1 year reduced the composite of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). Conclusions state that prolonged DAPT after newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage, and in prior MI settings reduced cardiovascular events occurred at the expense of increased bleeding.

### Use of aspirin and clopidogrel after coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^112oAawZ]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the evidence for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Data Sources

Literature was accessed through PubMed (1950-November 2011), EMBASE (1976-November 2011), and the Cochrane databases using the terms clopidogrel and coronary artery bypass graft. Citations from available articles were used for additional references and ClinicalTrials.gov was accessed for abstracts of ongoing studies.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Peer-reviewed studies that evaluated DAPT use after CABG surgery in adult humans were assessed for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Four randomized clinical trials evaluating surrogate end points and 9 studies (3 subgroup analyses, 6 observational) evaluating clinical outcomes were reviewed. Three clinical trials assessing surrogate end points failed to demonstrate an improvement in graft patency with DAPT use, while 1 clinical trial found an increase in graft patency. As for clinical outcomes, 1 subgroup analysis demonstrated that the benefit of DAPT post-CABG after a non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome diminished following surgery, while an observational study demonstrated a trend toward decreased mortality. In post-CABG patients who did not experience acute coronary syndrome, 2 subgroup analyses proved inconclusive and an observational study found DAPT use to be associated with reducing in-hospital mortality, while another observational study was not associated with reduced long-term mortality. Three observational studies in off-pump CABG patients showed that DAPT use was feasible.

Conclusions

Evidence for DAPT use following CABG is limited to subgroup analyses, observational studies, and trials with surrogate end points. The majority of clinical trials have failed to demonstrate an improvement in graft patency with DAPT. Current evidence does not support the use of DAPT to improve graft patency, and more evidence from randomized controlled trials assessing clinical outcomes is necessary to make definitive recommendations.

Long-term use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after myocardial infarction (MI) — Activation of platelets with resultant thrombosis occurs not only after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation but also as part of atherosclerosis, patients with a recent atherothrombotic coronary event are at high risk of recurrent events, several trials have shown DAPT reduces recurrent MI in the year after an acute MI, and "current guidelines recommend that DAPT should be continued for up to 12 months after MI". Findings from analyses highlight the potential benefit of DAPT among patients with high atherothrombotic risk.

Overview of the net clinical benefit of dual antiplatelet therapy

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), the combination of ASA with a P2Y 12 inhibitor, namely clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor (Table 1), has become the cornerstone of antiplatelet treatment before, during and after PCI, with significant reductions of stent thrombosis and ischaemic events compared with either aspirin alone or aspirin and anticoagulant drugs. – This combination increases the risk of major bleeding to an extent that appears to be associated with the degree of P2Y 12 inhibition achieved and all Phase 3 studies of P2Y 12 inhibitors vs. placebo or vs. clopidogrel, have excluded patients at high risk of bleeding. In the absence of contraindications, DAPT is currently recommended for 9–12 months following ACS based on evidence of enduring benefit over this time course in studies of clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. – There is no clear evidence for defining the optimal duration of DAPT after elective stenting. Indeed, none of the randomized trials were powered for ischaemic endpoints; all were open label and the time from stenting to randomization varied. – Therefore, weighing the quality of available evidence is difficult and these inferences need to be confirmed by ongoing mega trials. Usually, it is recommended to continue DAPT for 1 month after BMS implantation in stable angina,6–12 months after DES implantation in all patients, and up to one 1 year in all patients after ACS, irrespective of revascularisation strategy.

### Coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients on ticagrelor therapy is not associated with adverse perioperative outcomes [^112Qmytr]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent systematic review summarized the updated guidelines for perioperative DAPT treatment in patients who are candidates for CABG surgery. The guidelines discussed provide differing recommendations, which may lead to a lack of standardization in clinical practice. Overall, the authors classify their recommendations based on the urgency of surgery performed.

For elective patients, most guidelines recommend that aspirin be continued while clopidogrel and ticagrelor should be discontinued at least 5 days before surgery, and prasagruel 1 week prior. A few recent sources advise stopping ticagrelor 3 days prior to surgery, which was supported by a patient cohort that demonstrated no increase in major bleeding complications. In regards to the urgent CABG, various guidelines recommend discontinuing dual antiplatelet therapy between 24 and 72 h prior to surgery. However, ESC 2015 and TSC 2018 propose that the urgent CABG could be performed regardless of their continuation. Therefore, the consequences of delaying an urgent surgery due to an increased risk of bleeding compared to early discontinuation of DAPT is still under debate. Following CABG, antiplatelet therapy is recommended in post-stent patients to help prevent graft occlusion and stent thrombosis for 12 months or 1–12 months depending on risk of thrombosis. Overall, due to the discrepancy between guideline recommendations, more evidence is required to standardize the perioperative management of DAPT in CABG patients.

In this study, we observed whether patients undergoing CABG under continued preoperative use of ticagrelor+ASA differs from patients under ASA alone. Patients treated with ASA + ticagrelor were 3 years younger, were more currently smoking and had twice as many had coronary stents in situ compared to patients treated with ASA alone prior to surgery, probably establishing the reason for DAPT in these patients. However, pre-operative left ventricular systolic function and risk scores were comparable in both groups, as were the surgical interventions added to CABG.

Since concomitant CABG and valvular surgery may pose a higher risk of bleeding, we performed a subgroup analysis of patients with CABG surgery alone who did not undergo valvular surgery. The subgroup analysis confirmed that the primary end-point composite of major bleeding complications, chest drainage volumes and the infused blood products were not significantly different.

### Patient management following percutaneous coronary intervention [^115x5QHQ]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

When determining type and duration of antiplatelet therapy post-PCI, secondary prevention of ischemic events should be balanced with bleeding risk. Recommendations for achieving this differ between patients with stable CAD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Among patients with stable CAD, recent evidence supports prescription of short duration (1–3 months) dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor, eg, clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) followed by single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT). In patients treated with second-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), a meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials found that short duration (1–3 months) DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitor SAPT led to reduced bleeding events at 12 months post-PCI compared to 12 months of DAPT. There was no difference in stent thrombosis, all-cause death, MI, and stroke. An exploratory analysis showed short-duration DAPT followed by aspirin SAPT produced similar results. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends that short duration DAPT (1–3 months) with subsequent transition to P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy is reasonable in select patients post-PCI; recommendations from the 2024 ESC (European Society of Cardiology) Guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes are similar.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^1145NPMF]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

For patients with ACS (NSTE-ACS or STEMI) treated with DAPT and undergoing surgical revascularisation, current guidelines recommend to resume the P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor therapy after CABG to complete the 12-month DAPT duration after ACS (class I)(figure 2). Due to the lack of randomised evidence, the appropriate antiplatelet regimen after CABG remains an area of controversy, and large, multicentre, randomised clinical trials are needed to definitively investigate the role of DAPT in patients with ACS after CABG.

### Early discontinuation of P2YAntagonists and adverse clinical events post-percutaneous coronary intervention: a hospital and primary care linked cohort [^1141PEmZ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Poor medication adherence is often associated with adverse patient events across multiple disease outcomes. This is of particular concern in the setting of modern cardiac intervention with stent implantation for acute coronary syndromes (ACS), where discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy risks both stent stenosis and non‐stent‐related myocardial infarction (MI). As such, the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), aspirin plus a P2Y 12 inhibitor, in patients undergoing coronary revascularization is an established treatment strategy in the prevention of short‐ and long‐term thrombotic complications. 1, 2, 3

Current guidelines recommend a minimum of 12 months of DAPT for patients presenting with ACS undergoing coronary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation, reduced to at least 6 months in the presence of risk factors for bleeding. 4, 5 In patients with stable coronary artery disease, a minimum of 6 months is recommended following drug eluting stents implantation and at least 1 month following a bare metal stent or in those with a high risk of bleeding. The presence of comorbidities, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), may necessitate the need for concomitant anticoagulation and therefore shorter durations of DAPT may be warranted. Likewise, the need to undergo surgery in the future may also mandate shorter durations of DAPT.

A number of observational studies have shown that an increase in major adverse cardiac events is associated with a delay in access to prescriptions for P2Y 12 inhibitors following coronary PCI 6, 7 or premature discontinuation following an MI or stent implantation. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 Rates of discontinuation vary between studies, with some reporting 13% discontinuation within 30 days 10 and others up to 40% to 50% within 1 year. 8, 9 However, these studies have not identified the intended duration of therapy postdischarge or taken account of comorbidities that may warrant shorter durations of DAPT. Furthermore, the study populations were predominantly medically treated ACS 8, 14 or, in the case of the PARIS (Patterns of Non‐Adherence to Antiplatelet Regimens in Stented Patients) registry, predominantly stable angina patients undergoing PCI. 15

Our objectives were to (1) analyze the rate of early discontinuation of clopidogrel following discharge from hospital in a post‐PCI population where the duration of DAPT was specified for 1 year, (2) explore potential factors associated with discontinuation in prescribing, and (3) analyze the risk of death and major cardiovascular events associated with discontinuation.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation — DES LATE extension and PRODIGY randomized trials — In DES LATE, patients were "event free after having been treated with 12 to 18 months of DAPT after DES implantation", and in the extension trial the primary endpoint "occurred in 61 patients treated with 24 months of DAPT and in 57 patients treated with 12 months of DAPT (2.6% versus 2.4%; hazard ratio [HR]: 1.06; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74 to 1.51; P = 0.75)". The original trials "were planned to have an expected event rate of 5% at 2 years but had actual rates of 2.5%". In PRODIGY, a "2 × 4 factorial design" randomized "2013 patients to either 24 or 6 months of DAPT", with antiplatelet strategy randomization "performed 30 days after implantation", and "at 24 months of follow-up, the investigators found no difference in the primary endpoint of death, MI, stroke, or definite stent thrombosis", although "there was an excess of bleeding in patients assigned to 24 months of DAPT".

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how long is too long? [^114Wneuq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

So, what does the future hold for extended‐duration DAPT? It is likely that adverse thrombotic and cardiac events will continue to decrease with the continuously improving polymer and stent technology, including development of ultrathin struts. Indeed, current trials, such as HOST‐IDEA (Harmonizing Optimal Strategy for Treatment of Coronary Artery Stenosis ‐ Coronary Intervention With Next Generation Drug‐Eluting Stent Platforms and Abbreviated Dual Antiplatelet Therapy Trial) (identifier NCT02601157), are recruiting patients to compare 2 ultrathin biodegradable and polymer‐free stents with varying DAPT durations. 12 Even in ACS, the pendulum is swinging toward shorter DAPT durations. A recent randomized trial assessing safety of interruption of DAPT before 12 months in patients with ST‐segment–elevation MI treated with DES reported the noninferiority of a shorter 6‐month DAPT regimen compared with the standard treatment. 13

A meta‐analysis by Udell et al showed that extended DAPT beyond 1 year among stabilized high‐risk patients with previous MI decreased the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events but at the cost of an increased risk of major bleeding. 14 Given patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events are often also at higher risk of fatal bleeding events, determining which patients will benefit from extended DAPT can be challenging. Several clinical scores have been devised to aid clinicians in decision making of whether to continue or discontinue DAPT. 15, 16 Although not perfect, the DAPT score is a validated risk score designed to identify patients for whom anticipated reduction in ischemia with continued DAPT outweighs the anticipated bleeding risk and vice versa. 15 Factors that contribute to a high DAPT score include diabetes mellitus, current cigarette use, prior PCI or prior MI, congestive heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction < 30%, MI at presentation, vein graft PCI, and stent diameter < 3 mm; older age contributes to a lower DAPT score. In addition to the DAPT score, procedural complexity, burden of coronary artery disease, and stent type should also be taken into consideration while deciding on the optimal DAPT duration as extended DAPT reduces events progressively in those with greater procedural complexity. 17 Likewise, several subgroups from the PEGASUS trial, including those with peripheral arterial disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction, had a particularly robust absolute risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events with extended DAPT. 18, 19, 20 Table 2 lists clinical characteristics that may benefit from more extended durations of DAPT.

### Hospital variability drives inconsistency in antiplatelet use after coronary bypass [^111bnWmG]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) after acute myocardial infarction is recommended by current guidelines. We sought to evaluate guideline adherence over time and factors associated with postoperative DAPT within a regional consortium.

Methods

Isolated CABG patients from 2011 to 2017 who had a myocardial infarction within 21 days prior to surgery were included. Patients were stratified by DAPT prescription at discharge and by time period, early (2011–2014) vs late (2015–2017). Hierarchical regressions were then performed to evaluate factors influencing DAPT use after CABG.

Results

A total of 7314 patients were included with an overall rate of DAPT utilization of 31.2% that increased from 29.6% in the early to 33.4% in the late era (P < .01). There was considerable variability in hospital rates of DAPT (range 9.5%-92.1%) and hospital level changes over time (26% increased, 11% decreased, and 63% remained stable). After adjustment for clinical factors, era was not associated with DAPT use but treating hospital remained significantly associated with DAPT use. Other clinical factors associated with increased DAPT utilization included off-pump surgery (odds ratio [OR] 4.48, P < .01) and prior percutaneous coronary intervention (OR 2.02, P < .01), and atrial fibrillation (OR 0.39, P < .01) was associated with decreased utilization.

Conclusions

Dual antiplatelet use has increased between 2011 and 2017, driven primarily by evolving patient demographics. Significant hospital-level variability drives inconsistency in DAPT utilization. Efforts to promote DAPT use for patients treated with CABG after myocardial infarction in concordance with current guidelines should be targeted at the hospital level.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy duration after percutaneous coronary intervention using drug eluting stents in high bleeding risk patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117KoDT9]. American Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration in patients at high bleeding risk (HBR) is not fully defined. We aimed to compare the safety and effectiveness of short-term DAPT (S-DAPT) with longer duration DAPT (L-DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug eluting stents (DES) in patients at HBR.

Methods

We searched for studies comparing S-DAPT (≤ 3 months) followed by aspirin or P2Y 12 inhibitor monotherapy against L-DAPT (6–12 months) after PCI in HBR patients. Primary end points of interest were major bleeding and myocardial infarction (MI). Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to calculate odds ratios with 95% CIs.

Results

Six randomized trials and 3 propensity-matched studies (n = 16,848) were included in the primary analysis. Compared with L-DAPT (n = 8,422), major bleeding was lower with S-DAPT (n = 8,426) [OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.51–0.89] whereas MI did not differ significantly between the 2 groups [1.16; 0.94–1.44]. There were no significant differences in risks of death, stroke or stent thrombosis (ST) between S-DAPT and L-DAPT groups. These findings were consistent when propensity-matched studies were analysed separately. Finally, there was a numerically higher, albeit statistically non-significant, ST in the S-DAPT arm of patients without an indication for OAC [1.98; 0.86–4.58].

Conclusions

Among HBR patients undergoing current generation DES implantation, S-DAPT reduces bleeding without an increased risk of death or MI compared with L-DAPT. More research is needed to (1) evaluate risks of late ST after 1 to 3 months DAPT among patients with high ischemic and bleeding risks, (2) defining the SAPT of choice after 1 to 3 months DAPT.

### Shorter dual antiplatelet therapy for older adults after percutaneous coronary intervention: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113hmqiq]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Our study was focused on ascertaining the optimal duration of DAPT; the optimal choice of subsequent SAPT remains a matter of debate. The included RCTs differed on the agent used for SAPT; thus, the choice of agent for post-DAPT SAPT remains a source of heterogeneity. A meta-analysis showed that compared with DAPT, both aspirin monotherapy and P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy reduced major bleeding to a similar degree, but patients receiving post-DAPT aspirin monotherapy had a higher risk of MI compared with patients receiving post-DAPT P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy. A recent scientific statement from the American Heart Association endorsed clopidogrel as the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor for older patients with ACS due to clopidogrel's lower bleeding profile compared with ticagrelor or prasugrel, while leaving ticagrelor for those patients with the highest ischemic risk. Further studies will be required to confirm the optimal SAPT for older adults.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^111NzvnR]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Despite a large body of randomized evidence, the optimal regimen and duration of DAPT for secondary prevention of patients with CAD remains a matter of intense debate. Future studies are needed to better identify patients who may derive benefit from either shortened or prolonged DAPT durations to improve outcomes while minimising bleeding risks. Until more evidence becomes available, the optimal DAPT regimen and duration for patients with CAD requires a tailored approach based on the patient clinical presentation, baseline risk profile and management strategy (figure 4). Several ongoing large-scale randomised trials are currently investigating novel antiplatelet strategies and will contribute to refining the optimal regimen and duration of DAPT for secondary prevention of patients with CAD in the near future.

### Perioperative management of dual-antiplatelet therapy in patients with new-generation drug-eluting metallic stents and bioresorbable vascular scaffolds undergoing elective noncardiac surgery [^116gHQMH]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is considered mandatory after new-generation drug-eluting coronary stent implantation to reduce ischemic complications such as stent thrombosis, but the need for DAPT makes the timing of elective surgery difficult. Interrupting DAPT places patients at risk for stent thrombosis, and surgery in the setting of DAPT may lead to bleeding. The 2016 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline recommends delaying elective noncardiac surgery for a minimum 6-month period to reduce ischemic risks after the implantation of a second-generation metallic drug-eluting stent (DES). However, the guideline fails to appropriately stratify surgical patients based on the indication for second-generation metallic DES implantation and other patient characteristics. The Absorb bioresorbable vascular scaffold (Abbott Vascular, Abbott Park, IL), which has a higher propensity for stent thrombosis compared with second-generation metallic DES, also produces DAPT management challenges in patients presenting for elective noncardiac surgery. Due to the novelty of bioresorbable vascular scaffold therapy, there are no guidelines available for the management of patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery. This review addresses DAPT management in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery less than 12 months after new-generation metallic DES or bioresorbable vascular scaffold implantation and provides further guidance for anesthesiologists who encounter these challenging cases.

In SECURITY, enrollment "was stopped after enrollment of 1399 of 2140 planned patients", with the primary endpoint "3.7% in patients treated with 12 months of DAPT and 4.5% in patients treated with 6 months of DAPT (risk difference: 0.8%; 95% CI: −2.4% to 1.7%)", and "the trial appeared to meet its noninferiority hypothesis". In ITALIC, the study "was stopped early after 2031 of 2475 planned patients were enrolled" and showed "small differences in the primary endpoint between the 2 groups (risk difference: 0.11%; 95% CI: −1.04% to 1.26%)", and "the trial also appeared to meet its noninferiority hypothesis". In ISAR-SAFE, the trial "was stopped early after enrolling 4050 of 6000 planned patients" with "lower event rates than planned in 4000 evaluable patients (observed 1.5% versus expected 10.0%), the trial appeared to meet its noninferiority hypothesis". The DAPT trial "was the largest RCT and randomly assigned 9961 patients to receive 30 months of DAPT or 12 months of DAPT", and "Prolonged DAPT reduced the rate of stent thrombosis".

### Dual-antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stenting in ACS… [^1152fzJ1]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Question What is the optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents. Findings. In this systematic review and bayesian network meta-analysis including 15 randomized clinical trials and 35 326 patients, several DAPT strategies were compared for safety and efficacy in patients with ACS. Results showed that 1 month of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with a reduction in major bleeding without increasing recurrent ischemic events; 3 months of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was ranked the best option to reduce MACCE, although statistical significance was not achieved. Meaning These results may inform clinical care toward a shorter duration of DAPT after PCI in patients with ACS.

Importance The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention remains under debate. Objectives To analyze the efficacy and safety of DAPT strategies in patients with ACS using a bayesian network meta-analysis. Compared with 12 months of DAPT, 1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors reduced major bleeding with no difference in MACCE. No significant differences were observed in MACCE incidence between strategies, although CrIs were wide. SUCRA ranked 1 month of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors as the best for reducing major bleeding and 3 months of DAPT followed by P2Y12 inhibitors as optimal for reducing MACCE.

Conclusion and Relevance Results of this systematic review and network meta-analysis reveal that, in patients with ACS undergoing PCI with DES, 1 month of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was associated with a reduction in major bleeding without increasing MACCE when compared with 12 months of DAPT. However, an increased risk of MACCE cannot be excluded, and 3 months of DAPT followed by potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy was ranked as the best option to reduce MACCE.

### One-year outcomes of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy following percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113i9Z5j]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, both US and European societies recommend a 6 month duration of DAPT for PCI of chronic coronary disease and a 12 month duration for those presenting with ACS and without high risk of bleeding, with exceptions made for those with increased risk of bleeding. Previous meta‐analyses have focused on shorter durations of DAPT after PCI in patients with ACS, older adults, patients with high risk of bleeding, and those who receive P2Y12 monotherapy and have demonstrated similar outcomes as this analysis. It is a nearly ubiquitous conclusion that decreasing the duration of DAPT decreases significant bleeding events without negatively impacting ischemic outcomes like stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. Some analyses have even suggested a mortality benefit to shorter DAPT, though this has not been consistently demonstrated. This analysis is consistent with these previous works, though it is unique in its size and scope, with several clinically impactful findings. First, in both the entire cohort and the ACS subgroup, a 3‐month duration of DAPT showed favorable outcomes over traditional durations in nearly all measures. Second, amongst monotherapy agents following short DAPT, high potency P2Y12 inhibitors outperformed other monotherapy classes and demonstrated an overall mortality benefit in both the entire and ACS cohort. It is important to note that these results are limited to 1 year following PCI, and this analysis does not attempt to characterize events after this time. More long‐term studies are necessary to characterize this and determine optimal monotherapy after 1 year.

### Mortality in patients treated with extended duration dual antiplatelet therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation: a pairwise and Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomised trials [^113Gefev]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Background

Despite recent studies, the optimum duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after coronary drug-eluting stent placement remains uncertain. We performed a meta-analysis with several analytical approaches to investigate mortality and other clinical outcomes with different DAPT strategies.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane databases, and proceedings of international meetings on Nov 20, 2014, for randomised controlled trials comparing different DAPT durations after drug-eluting stent implantation. We extracted study design, inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample characteristics, and clinical outcomes. DAPT duration was categorised in each study as shorter versus longer, and as 6 months or shorter versus 1 year versus longer than 1 year. Analyses were done by both frequentist and Bayesian approaches.

Findings

We identified ten trials published between Dec 16, 2011, and Nov 16, 2014, including 31,666 randomly assigned patients. By frequentist pairwise meta-analysis, shorter DAPT was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality compared with longer DAPT (HR 0·82, 95% CI 0·69–0·98; p = 0·02; number needed to treat [NNT] = 325), with no significant heterogeneity apparent across trials. The reduced mortality with shorter compared with longer DAPT was attributable to lower non-cardiac mortality (0·67, 0·51–0·89; p = 0·006; NNT = 347), with similar cardiac mortality (0·93, 0·73–1·17; p = 0.52). Shorter DAPT was also associated with a lower risk of major bleeding, but a higher risk of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. We noted similar results in a Bayesian framework with non-informative priors. By network meta-analysis, patients treated with 6-month or shorter DAPT and 1-year DAPT had higher risk of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis but lower risk of mortality compared with patients treated with DAPT for longer than 1 year. Patients treated with DAPT for 6 months or shorter had similar rates of mortality, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis, but lower rates of major bleeding than did patients treated with 1-year DAPT.

Interpretation

Although treatment with DAPT beyond 1 year after drug-eluting stent implantation reduces myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis, it is associated with increased mortality because of an increased risk of non-cardiovascular mortality not offset by a reduction in cardiac mortality.

Funding

None.

### Expert position paper on the management of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^1135K9Gv]. European Heart Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatet therapy after Coronary artery bypass grafting surgery

Observational studies have demonstrated the safety of early postoperative clopidogrel use following CABG but a meta-analysis of studies reporting on safety/efficacy of clopidogrel use with or without aspirin did not show a clear clinical benefit of clopidogrel when given in addition to aspirin after CABG. Several randomized trials have compared the effect of DAPT vs. aspirin on graft patency with diverging results. – Two meta-analyses of observational studies and RCTs showed that the use of DAPT reduced early vein graft occlusion. The meta-analysis by Deo et al. also showed, in the ASA-clopidogrel group, a decrease in hospital or 30-day mortality (0.8 vs. 1.9%, P < 0.0001) compared with ASA alone and this effect was more pronounced in off-pump patients.

The effects of prasugrel have not yet been studied following CABG surgery but the mortality data from TRITON is supportive of resuming prasugrel following CABG surgery (adj OR: 0.26; 95% CI: 0.08–0.85; P = 0.025). In the PLATO study, it was intended that study medication with ticagrelor or clopidogrel should be started as soon as possible after CABG surgery and prior to hospital discharge. Thirty-six percent of CABG patients in the study restarted study medication within 7 days of surgery, 37% did not restart study medication and the rest restarted study medication 7 or more days later. Postoperative mortality was lower in the ticagrelor group compared with the clopidogrel group (HR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.32–0.77). It is uncertain how much of the benefit of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel related to preoperative compared with postoperative treatment and further studies will provide more evidence in this area.

Conclusions

Antiplatelet therapy plays a major role in the treatment of CAD and is therefore implicated throughout the CABG pathway. Management of single and DAPT in patients undergoing CABG for ACS, previous PCI, or stable angina impacts on early and late outcomes. Risk stratification for bleeding and recurrent ischaemic events, heart team decision making for temporary interruption of antiplatelet therapy and bridging strategies, the use of platelet function monitoring, and blood sparing management strategies are the key steps to further improve clinical outcome in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Gaps in knowledge remain, especially with respect to identification of the optimal bleeding-thrombotic risk balance before and after surgery. Specific studies for patients undergoing CABG are mandatory.

### Predictors of secondary revascularization after coronary artery bypass graft surgery and role of dual antiplatelet therapy [^113dGx6R]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This is a retrospective observational study evaluating the incidence, trends, and predictors of revascularization after CABG surgery at one of the large-volume open heart surgery centers in the United States. The focus was on assessing the impact of antiplatelet therapy, particularly DAPT, on revascularization rates. This study was approved by the hospital's executive medical committee and Institutional Review Board.

Participants

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:

Inclusion criteria were:

Undergoing CABG surgery between 2012 and 2015.
Receiving either aspirin alone or aspirin in combination with P2Y12 antagonist referred to as DAPT at discharge.

Exclusion criteria were:

3 Death within the first 48 h post-surgery.
4 Requirement of anticoagulation therapy post-surgery.
5 Concomitant valve surgery.
6 Lost to follow up.

Group assignment

Patients who underwent CABG were included and assigned to the following two groups based on the antiplatelet therapy received at discharge: (1) AMT), or (2) DAPT. DAPT was defined as patients receiving a combination of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist post-CABG. The DAPT group (all durations) was compared to the AMT group, and a detailed subset analysis was performed for patients who received DAPT for six or more months, compared to those on AMT. The overall incidence of revascularization and secondary outcomes were evaluated in both groups using standard statistical methods.

Data collection

Data was manually collected from electronic medical records. Information was cross-checked by one of the investigators to ensure accuracy. Medical records from other hospitals and clinics were also reviewed thoroughly, and phone follow-ups were conducted to gather any missing information or clarify ambiguous clinical notes.

The data collected included patient demographics, comorbidities, surgical details, medication history, and post-CABG outcomes such as revascularization events and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) incidents.

Outcome measures

Primary Outcome:

The primary outcome was the incidence of revascularization post-CABG, defined as any instance of PCI with or without stent placement, or redo CABG.

Secondary outcomes:

Survival rate.
Major adverse cardiovascular events.
Post-CABG ACS.

Event Identification: Revascularization events and ACS were identified using appropriate ICD codes, confirmed by EKG findings, and laboratory values. These events were systematically recorded and analyzed within each treatment group. MACE was composite of CV death, post-CABG ACS and CVA.

Limitations of the analyses — Heterogeneity in bleeding definitions and lack of individual-level data for a common definition (e.g. TIMI major or minor) may limit interpretation; RCTs in DES recipients generally enrolled low-risk patients with 8 of 11 trials reporting lower than expected event rates, resulting in imprecise MI and bleeding estimates with wide confidence intervals; although follow-up rates were 92% to 95%, these must be considered alongside bleeding and mortality rates of 1% to 4% over the trials.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is the cornerstone of pharmacological treatment aimed at preventing the atherothrombotic complications in patients with a variety of coronary artery disease (CAD) manifestations. Prescribers of DAPT are confronted with a number of challenges that include selecting the appropriate P2Y 12 inhibitor and determining the optimal duration of DAPT with the scope of minimizing the risk of ischemic and bleeding complications in light of each patient's clinical characteristic and circumstance. Recently, a guideline writing committee from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and a task force from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) released their respective focused update recommendations on "Duration of DAPT in Patients with CAD" (ACC/AHA) and "DAPT in CAD" (ESC). This paper aims to review the ACC/AHA and ESC updates for DAPT to delineate common domains, consistent messages, and differences in recommended management strategies across the Atlantic.

Circulation (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after implantation of newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES) remains uncertain. Similarly, questions remain about the role of DAPT in long-term therapy of stable post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients.

Aim

Our objective was to compare the incidence of death, major hemorrhage, MI, stent thrombosis, and major adverse cardiac events in patients randomized to prolonged or short-course DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES and in secondary prevention after MI.

Methods

We used traditional frequentist statistical and Bayesian approaches to address the following questions: Q1) What is the minimum duration of DAPT required after DES implantation? Q2) What is the clinical benefit of prolonging DAPT up to 18 to 48 months? Q3) What is the clinical effect of DAPT in stable patients who are > 1 year past an MI?

Results

We reviewed evidence from 11 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled 33051 patients who received predominantly newer-generation DES to answer: A1) Use of DAPT for 12 months, as compared with use for 3 to 6 months, resulted in no significant differences in incidence of death (odds ratio [OR]: 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), or stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55). Bayesian models confirmed the primary analysis. A2) Use of DAPT for 18 to 48 months, compared with use for 6 to 12 months, was associated with no difference in incidence of all-cause death (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.42) but was associated with increased major hemorrhage (OR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.09), decreased MI (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.95), and decreased stent thrombosis (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.74). A risk-benefit analysis found 3 fewer stent thromboses (95% CI: 2 to 5) and 6 fewer MIs (95% CI: 2 to 11) but 5 more major bleeds (95% CI: 3 to 9) per 1000 patients treated with prolonged DAPT per year. Post hoc analyses provided weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT. We reviewed evidence from 1 RCT of 21162 patients and a post hoc analysis of 1 RCT of 15603 patients to answer: A3): Use of DAPT > 1 year after MI reduced the composite risk of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke (hazard ratio: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74 to 0.95) but increased major bleeding (hazard ratio: 2.32; 95% CI: 1.68 to 3.21). A meta-analysis and a post hoc analysis of an RCT in patients with stable cardiovascular disease produced similar findings.

Conclusions

The primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence that prolonged DAPT after implantation of newer-generation DES entails a tradeoff between reductions in stent thrombosis and MI and increases in major hemorrhage. Secondary analyses provide weak evidence of increased mortality with prolonged DAPT after DES implantation. In patients whose coronary thrombotic risk was defined by a prior MI rather than by DES implantation, the primary analysis provides moderately strong evidence of reduced cardiovascular events at the expense of increased bleeding.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy duration: a review of current available evidence [^114BB244]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Multiple regimens of antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapy have been used in the past in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Later trials of PCI stenting demonstrated the efficacy of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in reducing stent- and non-stent-related thrombotic events in this specific population. Nonetheless, the required duration of DAPT has not yet been elucidated. In this article we sought to identify various randomized clinical trials (RCTs), pooled analyses, meta-analyses, and data pertaining to the optimal duration of DAPT and attempt some recommendations based on patients' clinical and procedural profiles.

Methods

We performed an extensive search using MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Internet sources for abstracts, manuscripts, and conference reports without any language or date restrictions. In our review we included all available evidence from RCTs, meta-analyses, observational studies, and abstracts pertaining to our topic. Search results that were deemed irrelevant or that would not serve the goal or topic of our review were excluded.

Results

Our search yielded 10 RCTs directly comparing different durations of DAPT, 3 meta-analyses amassing the evidence resulting from randomized data, and numerous observational studies that served the aim of our review. The observational studies included in the manuscript are directly related to instances in which RCTs could not be performed or introduce important concepts related to the duration of DAPT.

Implications

There is no conclusive evidence that determines the mandatory DAPT duration after PCI. In addition, there are distinct patient populations that need specific treatment regimens, such as diabetic patients or those on long-term oral anticoagulation. Therefore, clinical judgement and meticulous examination of all pertaining risk factors are required for each individual. These factors include those related to a patient's characteristics, treatment procedures, lesion complexity, and stent type. Currently ongoing studies are anticipated to further elucidate and integrate our understanding with regard to DAPT.

### Different antithrombotic strategies after coronary artery bypass grafting to prevent adverse events: a retrospective analysis [^1144UHad]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Antiplatelet therapy is a major strategy to prevent post-CABG failure and adverse events. While aspirin therapy after CABG has been proven to be a safe approach to improve vein graft patency and reduce adverse events, there have been no dedicated large-scale studies in the CABG population to support postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy. Continuation of DAPT before the surgery increases the risk of excessive perioperative bleeding, transfusions, and re-exploration for bleeding, which suggests the likelihood of a high risk of bleeding in postoperative DAPT patients. In a meta-analysis of 20,315 patients, DAPT (as compared to single antiplatelet therapy) was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in observational studies, but not in randomized trials or in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Additionally, DAPT was correlated with an increased risk for major bleeding in that study. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline Focused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease issued recommendations to utilize DAPT over SAPT in patients following CABG in 2016. Another meta-analysis showed increased vein graft patency with DAPT, but increased postoperative bleeding was also noted. Current guidelines recommend postoperative DAPT based upon the stability of coronary artery disease prior to CABG. In 2017, F. Biancari et al. proposed a Will-Bleed score to evaluate the risk of severe bleeding after CABG. Seven parameters with different weights were included in this model: preoperative anemia, female gender, eGFR, potent antiplatelet drugs discontinued less than five days, critical preoperative state, ACS, and use of LMWH/fondaparinux/unfractionated heparin. This risk score simplified the evaluating process and showed optimistic ability for prediction.

Mortality endpoint measurement — The "hard" endpoint of mortality rate was judged more precise than other endpoints because death ascertainment was unlikely to be influenced by lack of blinding during endpoint adjudication, so the Evidence Review Committee placed more emphasis on the primacy of mortality rate from a clinical and statistical point of view than for other endpoints.

2 Methods

2.1 Study Design

This meta‐analysis was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Cochrane's Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (Supporting Information S1: S1). The study was exempt from institutional review board approval since only published, publicly available data was used. This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO, an international systematic review registry (ID 1065336).

2.2 Data Sources and Search Strategy

A literature search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Collaboration Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted from inception until March 2025 for RCTs comparing different durations of DAPT following PCI. The search strategy is shown in Supporting Information S1: S2. Two authors independently screened articles for inclusion, retrieved potentially relevant studies, and determined their eligibility. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. No restrictions were set on language.

2.3 Eligibility Criteria and End Points

Studies were considered if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) are published or presented RCTs; (2) enrolled patients who underwent PCI with DES; (3) compared different durations of DAPT with one arm receiving a short course (≤ 3 months) DAPT and another arm receiving guideline‐based (6−12 months) durations; and (4) reported outcomes of interest. We set no restrictions for date or language. The HOST‐BR trial, presented at the 2025 American College of Cardiology meeting, was included for completeness.

Data was extracted from publicly available records using a standardized data collection software. Information such as study year, author, protocol, and other general information was collected. Patient demographic and relevant comorbidity data were collected. When outcome data were not available from the original published article, other publications based on the same trial were queried.

The co‐primary endpoints were (1) major adverse cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and (2) net adverse clinical events (NACE). MACCE was generally defined as a composite of mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. NACE was a composite of MACCE and major bleeding events. MACCE and NACE were decided on a case‐by‐case basis if these specific endpoints varied when reported by included studies. The endpoints were examined at 1 year following PCI. Secondary endpoints measured in this analysis included: all‐cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, definite or probable stent thrombosis, bleeding, and target vessel revascularization. We considered only Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) types 3 or 5 when available.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^111RhKb7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

In our study, most of the events of interest occurred within 30 days after CABG, which is similar to previous analysesand indicates that combined antiplatelet therapy may be most beneficial in the early post‐CABG phase when thrombosis plays a predominant role in graft failure. Use of DAPT for 1 to 3 or 6 months followed by conversion to monotherapy with P2Y 12 inhibitors or aspirin, which have been proven safe in patients with ACS and coronary stent implantation, might also be a clinically feasible strategy to avoid potential excess bleeding in the CABG population. However, no specific study has examined the optimal treatment duration of DAPT after CABG, although an arbitrary 1‐year treatment has been suggested for ACS and off‐pump patients. The optimal dose of DAPT and the appropriate postoperative initiation time require further investigation.

Several limitations of our analysis should be considered. First, as an observational study, the analyses are subject to selection bias, and residual unmeasured confounding may persist despite adjustment for a variety of known patient variables using propensity scores to approximate randomization. Second, our study was based on the experience of a single high‐volume center. The conclusions may be influenced by patient referral patterns and local medical management, and therefore may not generalize to the larger CABG population. Third, detailed data on discontinuation time and on‐treatment duration were unavailable for the present analyses, which were based on the intention‐to‐treat principle, and we were unable to conduct time‐dependent Cox regression analyses to account for the impact of the variation in DAPT exposure over time on the association of interest. Instead, we delineated the proportion of "on‐treatment" participants in the 2 groups at discharge and at 6 months. We observed a high rate of DAPT discontinuation, but the reasons were not documented in patient records. Nevertheless, noncompliance should favor a type II error, which cannot explain the findings of the present study. Fourth, the 6‐month event rates in our analysis were lower than those in previous studies. One potential explanation is that our study population tended to be younger and had fewer coexisting conditions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of underreporting, although this is unlikely because a standardized case report form was used for the adjudication of all events and careful study oversight of outcomes; we anticipate that any problems would have impacted both groups equally. Fifth, low clopidogrel responsiveness has been reported in up to 30% of patients, but we were unable to consider this information in our study because of lack of data on the platelet function test and CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. Finally, novel P2Y 12 inhibitors (eg, ticagrelor) were not widely prescribed for patients with CABG in our center during the study period; therefore, the results of this study cannot be translated to patients given these agents.

Antiplatelet drugs

Antiplatelet drugs are used in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. They may be taken individually or as dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), usually following acute coronary syndromes or after coronary artery stenting. Aspirin inhibits the production of thromboxane. If taken alone it should be continued for most procedures until the day before surgery as most evidence suggests it does not increase bleeding, except for surgeries with a particularly high bleeding risk or surgery in a confined space (brain, posterior chamber of the eye, medullary canal) where it should be discontinued 5 days before the procedure. Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor (P2Y12) antagonists (including clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor) are thienopyridines. They should be discontinued 5–7 days pre‐operatively. Consideration should be given to the use of haemadsorption filters if urgent or emergency cardiopulmonary bypass is undertaken in patients with P2Y12 inhibitors.

Antiplatelet drugs in patients with coronary stents having non‐cardiac surgery

The management of these drugs in patients with coronary stents in situ is more challenging. Dual antiplatelet therapy is recommended for at least 4 weeks after the insertion of a bare metal stent and for 12 months after a drug‐eluting stent. The risk of peri‐operative adverse cardiac events reduces as time passes following the insertion of the stent. Very low bleeding‐risk procedures can be undertaken without stopping DAPT. Low bleeding‐risk procedures in patients with low thrombotic risk may be undertaken with discontinuation of the ADP‐receptor antagonist (5–7 days pre‐operatively) with aspirin continuing.

Ideally, elective surgery in patients deemed to be at high thrombotic risk (within 6 months of stent insertion) should be deferred until they are lower risk. If this is not possible it should proceed on aspirin with temporary discontinuation of the ADP‐receptor antagonist. Bridging with a parenteral short‐acting glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, such as tirofiban or eptifibatide, during the period of ADP receptor antagonist withdrawal can also be considered in conjunction with cardiology input.

For emergency surgery, management depends on the antiplatelet agent and when the last dose was taken. Platelet transfusions have been proven to improve haemostasis. Platelet function testing may be helpful to determine the degree of platelet inhibition. Neuraxial anaesthesia should be avoided when ADP antagonists have been taken within 7 days, although aspirin is generally thought to be safe to continue.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary stent implantation [^1177Vkax]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet pharmacotherapy reduces ischemic events at the cost of excess bleeding in patients who underwent coronary stenting. The currently recommended treatment period is based on trials held some 20 years ago and not relevant to current clinical practice. In recent years, numerous clinical trials have tried to answer the question of what is the optimal duration of therapy to maximize clinical benefit. These trials showed 2 seemingly conflicting answers-on one hand, shorter treatment duration seems to be safer in reducing bleeding while not increasing ischemic events, and on the other hand, longer duration is superior in terms of preventing ischemic events albeit at the cost of increased bleeding rates. In this review, we summarize the evidence favoring each approach, highlight the limitations of the various pivotal clinical trials in this field, review future directions of research and changes in practice that may influence the duration of antiplatelet therapy, and attempt to propose a personalized approach to achieve maximal benefit for the individual patient.

We conducted a sensitivity analysis including only 4 RCTs. Pooled analyses demonstrated that when compared with the SAPT group, the rates of major or life‐threatening bleeding were significantly higher in the 3‐month DAPT group (RR [95% CI] = 2.13 [1.33–3.40], P = 0.016) with no difference among other comparisons (Figure S3). P‐scores were 82.5% (SAPT), 53.7% (6‐month DAPT), and 13.7% (3‐month DAPT). There was no significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 0%, P = 0.65); Q value was 0.83. The rates of stroke were similar among the groups (Figure S4). P‐scores were 72.9% (6‐month DAPT), 46.9% (SAPT), and 30.2% (3‐month DAPT). Similarly, there were no significant differences in all‐cause mortality (Figure S5). P‐scores were 51.9% (3‐month DAPT), 49.6% (6‐month DAPT), and 48.6% (SAPT). There was no significant heterogeneity in both the above analyses (I 2 = 0%, P = 0.54; I² = 0%, P = 0.57, respectively); Q values were 1.22 and 1.11.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy post percutaneous coronary intervention in acute coronary syndrome [^1165PqXt]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), with aspirin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor agent, is the cornerstone treatment after percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome. Based on randomized clinical trial using aspirin and clopidogrel, a DAPT duration of 12 months has been recommended after an acute coronary syndrome. Despite the development of more potent antiplatelet agents (i.e. prasugrel and ticagrelor) and the reduction in ischemic recurrences after acute coronary syndrome, 12 months DAPT currently remains the gold standard. However, a significant proportion of patients experience recurrent ischemic events beyond the first 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome. Meanwhile, with more effective antiplatelet agent, bleeding has become a major safety concern on DAPT. Therefore, the ischemic and bleeding risk balance is central considering the duration of DAPT after an acute coronary syndrome. This review aims to report the evidence for an optimization and individualization of DAPT duration after an acute coronary syndrome.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Bayesian analysis of mortality with prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) found that across 11 randomized controlled trials, mortality was nonsignificantly higher after 18 to 48 months versus 3 to 12 months (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.98 to 1.37); in the DAPT trial the borderline increase was OR: 1.31 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.77) and smaller RCTs showed a mortality signal (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.90 to 1.34), yielding a credible increase in mortality rate (OR: 1.16; 95% BCI: 0.98 to 1.37) with probabilities of 4.3% for no mortality difference, < 0.2% for a 10% mortality reduction, and 95.7% for increased mortality; probabilities that prolonged DAPT increased mortality by thresholds of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% were 72.7%, 33.9%, 9.8%, and 1.3%, respectively.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative medical therapy — data gaps include limited high-quality data regarding dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) management after elective noncardiac surgery following balloon angioplasty alone without stent placement, after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), or after transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER), and uncertainty about the efficacy and safety of shorter DAPT durations after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Large randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the role of perioperative statin initiation, and no data currently exist regarding the perioperative role of sacubitril/valsartan; trials are also needed to determine preoperative management of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors for patients planned for noncardiac surgery. Evidence is needed on omission, continuation, or initiation of calcium channel blockers; perioperative continuation of chronic alpha-2 receptor agonist therapy has not been addressed in trials; and there are no established data for glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitors as a bridging strategy. The optimal approach to beta-blocker initiation remains unknown. For diabetes care, challenges include selecting markers of glucose control that predict outcomes, methods to control perioperative glucose, managing older and newer agents, and determining optimal glucose levels and timing of reinstitution of sodium–glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors after surgery. Further research is needed, but advisories suggest GLP-1 agonists should be held for 1 dose before elective noncardiac surgery to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents at the time of surgery.

Stent type subgroup in the DAPT trial — everolimus-eluting stents (EES) versus mixed stents shows safety and efficacy differences: Investigators noted concerns about prolonged DAPT after EES implantation, stating EES are "the most prevalent stents implanted in current practice", and in "4703 patients who underwent EES implantation" mortality was higher "after 30 months of DAPT than after 12 months of therapy (2.1% versus 1.1%, P = 0.02)". For stent thrombosis, in the mixed-stent population prolonged DAPT reduced risk "from 1.4% to 0.4%, corresponding to a NNTB of 100", whereas in the EES subgroup it fell "from 0.7% to 0.3%, corresponding to a NNTB of 250". For major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), the mixed-stent population decreased "from 5.9% to 4.3%, corresponding to a NNTB of 38", while the EES subgroup decreased "from 4.5% to 4.3%, corresponding to a NNTB of 500".

### Bleeding-related deaths in relation to the duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after coronary stenting [^111pDJEh]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses have suggested that prolonged dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) may be associated with increased mortality, the mechanistic underpinnings of this association remain unclear.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to analyze the associations among bleeding, mortality, and DAPT duration after drug-eluting stent implantation in a meta-analysis of RCTs.

Methods

RCTs comparing different DAPT durations after drug-eluting stent placement were sought through the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases and the proceedings of international meetings. Deaths were considered possibly bleeding related if occurring within 1 year of the episodes of bleeding. Primary analysis was by intention-to-treat. Secondary analysis was performed in a modified intention-to-treat population in which events occurring when all patients were on DAPT were excluded.

Results

Individual patient data were obtained for 6 RCTs, and aggregate data were available for 12 RCTs. Patients with bleeding had significantly higher rates of mortality compared with those without, and in a time-adjusted multivariate analysis, bleeding was an independent predictor of mortality occurring within 1 year of the bleeding episode (hazard ratio: 6.93; 95% confidence interval: 4.53 to 10.60; p < 0.0001). Shorter DAPT was associated with lower rates of all-cause death compared with longer DAPT (hazard ratio: 0.85; 95% confidence interval: 0.73 to 1.00; p = 0.05), which was driven by lower rates of bleeding-related deaths with shorter DAPT compared with prolonged DAPT (hazard ratio: 0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.43 to 0.99; p = 0.04). Mortality unrelated to bleeding was comparable between the 2 groups. Similar results were apparent in the modified intention-to-treat population.

Conclusions

Bleeding was strongly associated with the occurrence of mortality within 1 year after the bleeding event. Shorter compared with longer DAPT was associated with lower risk for bleeding-related death, a finding that may underlie the lower all-cause mortality with shorter DAPT in the RCTs of different DAPT durations after DES.

### Use of antiplatelet therapy / DAPT for Post-PCI patients undergoing noncardiac surgery [^112fmPAR]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is prescribed to millions of patients worldwide following coronary stenting. DAPT is indicated to lower the risk of ischemic events, such as myocardial infarction, including stent thrombosis, ischemic stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. A significant number of these patients undergo noncardiac surgery and may require DAPT interruption. This poses a significant clinical dilemma because DAPT interruption exposes patients to the potential risk of stent thrombosis, perioperative myocardial infarction, or both. Conversely, continuing DAPT may be associated with excess bleeding complications. Observational data in this area are conflicting, and there are no randomized clinical trials to guide practitioner decision making. On the basis of predominantly consensus recommendations, various strategies for managing DAPT during the perioperative period have been proposed. This review presents 3 commonly encountered clinical scenarios that lead into an evidence-based discussion of practical strategies for managing perioperative antiplatelet therapy in patients following percutaneous coronary intervention.

### Optimizing monotherapy selection, aspirin versus P2Y12 inhibitors, following percutaneous coronary intervention [^11272XsT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) reduces ischemic and thrombotic events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Initial reports of higher myocardial infarction and mortality rates prompted guideline committees to choose 12-month duration of DAPT after PCI. However, higher bleeding rates with DAPT remain a major concern. Since these guidelines were published, there have been improvements in stent design, deployment techniques, and antiplatelet therapies, which have reduced ischemic events. To address bleeding concerns, trials were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of short-duration DAPT. Two main strategies were employed: (1) aspirin monotherapy after a short-duration DAPT, and (2) P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy after a short-duration DAPT. In this review, we outline all the major trials on short-duration DAPT that have examined the previously mentioned strategies and propose a new individualized treatment algorithm for which monotherapy to choose or remove after PCI. In conclusion, while removing the P2Y12 inhibitor after a short DAPT appears to be safe in the low-risk population, removing aspirin and continuing the P2Y12 inhibitor as monotherapy would be the preferred strategy in intermediate- to high-risk patients to mitigate the bleeding risk.

### An appraisal of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin for prevention of cardiovascular events [^117QbVX5]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Combination antiplatelet therapy, typically with clopidogrel and aspirin, is commonly used for the prevention of cardiovascular events. When used for appropriate indications and duration, its benefits clearly outweigh its risks. However, it is not uncommon for the combination to be used outside of recommended indications or for longer than recommended durations. In these circumstances data are at best unclear and, at worst, indicative of harm. Furthermore, use for one of its indications-prevention of cardiac events after deployment of a coronary stent-is complicated by the type of stent used.

### 2020 ACC expert consensus decision pathway for anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention or with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^117H8jBo]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Cerebrovascular disease with prior antiplatelet therapy (APT) and new atrial fibrillation — among patients appropriate for an oral anticoagulant (OAC) and currently receiving APT, the pathway separates three categories. For prior transient ischemic attack (TIA) or cerebrovascular accident, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from the perspective of hemorrhagic transformation, typically between 2 and 14 days following an acute event, and an OAC can typically be initiated immediately when TIA is the diagnosis without infarct or hemorrhage on imaging. For recent carotid endarterectomy, the pathway recommends stopping all APT and treating with an OAC alone (DOAC preferred) when considered safe from risk of post-operative bleeding, typically 3 to 14 days after surgery. For carotid stenting within the previous 1 to 3 months, our recommendation for most patients would be to stop aspirin, continue the P2Y12i (clopidogrel preferred), and start an OAC (DOAC preferred); if the standard duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after carotid stenting has ended (usually 1 to 3 months), all APT may be stopped.

### Efficacy and safety of DAPT after PCI in patients with peripheral arterial disease… [^117KcjfH]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Kaplan-Meier curves are shown for the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or cerebrovascular accident and for Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding. DAPT indicates dual antiplatelet therapy; PAD, peripheral arterial disease; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention. Prolonged DAPT refers to 24 months and short DAPT, 6 months or less. © 2025 Question What is the ideal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after coronary stenting in patients with concomitant coronary and peripheral arterial disease. Findings In this subanalysis of a randomized clinical trial, peripheral arterial disease emerged as a treatment modifier in terms of DAPT duration in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, with a prolonged regimen associated with a significantly lower risk of death and atherothrombotic events and unaffected risk of bleeding.

Prolonged vs short DAPT conveyed a lower risk of the primary efficacy end point in patients with PAD but not in patients without PAD, with positive interaction. The salient findings of the present analysis are as follows. First, in patients undergoing PCI, concomitant PAD was associated with a 2-fold increased risk of ischemic events, whereas the risk of bleeding was unaffected. Second, prolonged DAPT duration of 24 months after PCI reduced the risk of the primary efficacy end point of death, MI, or CVA compared with short DAPT of 6 months or less in patients with PAD. The improved efficacy of prolonged DAPT in patients with PAD was not offset by an increased risk of actionable bleeding episodes. The coexistence of PAD and CAD conveyed higher risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients undergoing PCI.

A prolonged DAPT duration resulted in a lower risk of atherothrombotic events, including a mortality benefit, than short DAPT. The apparent neutral effect of longer DAPT on bleeding risk of patients with PAD requires further evaluation in adequately powered studies.

### 2024 AHA / ACC / ACS / ASNC / HRS / SCA / SCCT / SCMR / SVM guideline for perioperative cardiovascular management for noncardiac surgery: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^112hH146]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative timing — elective noncardiac surgery (NCS) after PCI: Elective NCS should not be performed < 30 days after PCI, and due to a prothrombotic milieu "surgery should be delayed after PCI". Observational data show those undergoing NCS at < 35 days from PCI had a 2-fold higher risk of complications versus > 90 days, and NCS < 1 month post-PCI had higher MI (7.2% versus 0.5%), cardiac death (5% versus 0.4%), and all-cause mortality (9% versus 2.1%). Elective NCS after PCI with bare-metal stent (BMS) can proceed after ≥ 30 days of uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy and stability of coronary heart disease: a 60 000-patient meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113T5714]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Our systemic review and meta-analysis highlight the paucity of randomised controlled trial evidence to guide DAPT in patients with ACS who are managed without percutaneous coronary intervention such as those receiving medical therapy only or those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Patients with ACS who are managed with medical therapy only are often at the extremes of risk with either an event attributable to minor coronary artery disease or multiple comorbidity and a contraindication to invasive coronary angiography. Registry data suggest between 20% and 40% of all admissions for non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarctions are managed medically and recurrent events can be as much as three times more likely to occur in this population. The balance of bleeding and ischaemic risk is clearly challenging in these situations. For patients who are treated with coronary artery bypass graft surgery, DAPT is only offered to those with ACS, and following a brief interruption for surgery, are usually maintained on therapy for 12 months. Bleeding and ischaemic risk in these patients are likely to be affected by the surgical procedure itself and therefore they represent a group that is distinct from other patients with acute or chronic coronary syndromes. While meta-analyses show DAPT prevents graft occlusion, none have robustly assessed the optimum duration of therapy.

It is important to acknowledge that randomised controlled trials rightly have strict entry and exclusion criteria for their study participants. Patients with bleeding risks have been systematically excluded from these randomised controlled trials which report lower rates of bleeding and non-cardiovascular mortality than the general population. However, in real-world practice, clinicians make individual decisions with their patients on whether to initiate DAPT and this may include those who would otherwise not have been entered into clinical trials because of a history of bleeding. There is, therefore, a real concern that bleeding risk may be under appreciated and bleeding events may be disproportionately greater with the wider use of DAPT in clinical practice. As such, we believe that there is a clear and pressing need to address what the optimum duration of DAPT is in a broad and unselected cohort of patients suffering ACS. Major randomised controlled trials, such as Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Acute Coronary Syndrome (DUAL-ACS2), may help answer this question (NCT03252249).

### Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy: a systematic review for the 2016 ACC / AHA guideline focused update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery disease: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines [^111V1HRt]. Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration — 12 months versus 3 to 6 months after predominantly newer-generation drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation — showed no differences across key outcomes in 12 078 patients: death (OR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.85 to 1.63), major hemorrhage (OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 0.97 to 2.82), MI (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.18), stent thrombosis (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.55), and the primary endpoint (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.16); Bayesian analyses were consistent, including death (posterior median OR: 1.22; 95% BCI: 0.90 to 1.70) and primary endpoints (OR: 0.96; 95% BCI: 0.76 to 1.20).

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^112uN8pn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Management

Patients were managed in accordance with local practice guidelines, and all procedures were performed using standard bypass techniques (Data S1). The choice between on‐pump and off‐pump CABG was at the discretion of the principal surgeon. Whenever possible, the internal thoracic artery was preferentially used for revascularization of the left anterior descending artery. The perioperative antiplatelet therapy was also left to the individual surgeon's evaluation and decision, though clopidogrel should have been discontinued at least 5 days before surgery if clinically feasible. Local guidelines and regulatory authorities do not specify rules or restrictions for the selection of patients who receive post‐CABG DAPT administration. Routinely, aspirin was started within 24 hours (ideally within 6 hours) after CABG in a daily dose of 100 mg and recommended to continue indefinitely. For patients who received DAPT, 75 mg of clopidogrel was added to 100 mg of aspirin daily without a loading dose, preferably within 48 hours after CABG, but when clinical stability was ensured and chest tube output was < 30 mL/hour for at least 2 hours. The duration of DAPT was determined by the treating physician, with the treatment typically maintained for a minimum of 1 month. Additional secondary prevention therapies (eg, statins, β‐blockers, or renin‐angiotensin system blockade) were recommended for all patients, if indicated, following clinical guidelines.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the first occurrence of MACCE, defined as a composite of all‐cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization within 6 months after CABG. Secondary outcomes included individual components of the primary outcome and major bleeding, which was defined as a composite of in‐hospital reoperation because of bleeding and hospitalization for bleeding after discharge. All outcome measures were prespecified, rigorously verified, and adjudicated by independent clinicians. Detailed definitions of the outcomes are provided in Data S1.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and aspirin versus aspirin monotherapy in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^116wK7Eo]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been established as an effective treatment for patients with extensive coronary artery disease. Aspirin is recommended as a fundamental secondary prevention medication for patients with CABG to maintain the benefits of revascularization and prevent major adverse cardiovascular events. However, patients treated with CABG still have a notable risk of subsequent major ischemic cardiac and cerebrovascular events, which may exceed 10% in the first 6 to 12 months after the surgery. Reduced postoperative responsiveness to aspirin, platelet activation, and thrombosis results in systemic hypercoagulability and early graft failure. These have been identified as vital contributing factors in this context.,

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus a P2Y 12 receptor antagonist (eg, clopidogrel or ticagrelor) to enhance the antiplatelet effect, has been reported to slow down native coronary stenosis progressionand increase graft patency, in patients who underwent CABG as well as prevent recurrent stroke in patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. However, the question of whether the benefits associated with DAPT, especially the potential improvement in graft patency, translate into better clinical outcomes remains inadequately investigated with mixed results, and DAPT may increase the risk of bleeding. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that DAPT may be considered for selected patients who are at high risk of recurrent ischemic events, including those who presented with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or received coronary stent implantation within 1 year before CABG, or underwent off‐pump CABG. However, they also acknowledge the need for more evidence in this area because these recommendations are merely based on expert consensus or underpowered secondary data (level C of evidence). There is even less evidence available on the efficacy and safety of DAPT in specific patient populations, such as patients with stable angina who constitute the majority of CABG procedures and those who underwent on‐pump CABG.

Therefore, the present study examined the association between post‐CABG DAPT with clopidogrel plus aspirin and clinical outcomes in a large all‐comer clinical practice registry. We hypothesized that DAPT may be associated with reduced risk of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) when compared with aspirin monotherapy.

### Extended duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention: how long is too long? [^115eYUqy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on duration of dual‐antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug‐eluting stents (DESs) give a class I recommendation to continue DAPT for at least 12 months after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and at least 6 months after revascularization in the setting of stable ischemic heart disease. 1 These guidelines also give a class IIb recommendation for continuation of DAPT beyond 6 and 12 months in patients with stable ischemic heart disease and ACS, respectively, if these patients have tolerated DAPT without a bleeding event and are at low risk for bleeding in the future. 1 However, they do not provide any guidance with respect to how long DAPT should be continued and leave it to the clinician to discuss the risks versus benefits with the patient and individualize antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, in clinical practice, we often see patients on DAPT several years after a PCI as they are instructed by their providers to never discontinue them. In fact, given how much the importance of taking DAPT in the early period after PCI is emphasized, patients at times are uncomfortable stopping the second antiplatelet agent at any time. The lack of a clear recommendation is not surprising, despite multiple recent randomized controlled trials 2, 3, 4, 5 evaluating differing durations of extended DAPT given several evolving factors and the overall risk/benefits of DAPT.

Guidelines commenting on DAPT duration have largely included trials using clopidogrel and early‐generation stents. The advent of more potent P2Y 12 inhibitors, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor, has reduced major adverse cardiovascular events, but at the cost of increased bleeding. 6, 7 On the other hand, the newer‐generation DESs, with their thinner stent struts, a more biocompatible polymer, and favorable drug‐eluting characteristics, have considerably decreased the risk of stent thrombosis, particularly late stent thrombosis. 8 Although extended DAPT duration has been associated with reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiovascular death, there are statistically significant increases in major bleeding events. 2, 5 With the increased recognition of bleeding events and advancements in DES technology, it has been hypothesized that shorter durations of DAPT may be more appropriate. The European and American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines have already reduced the minimum absolutely required duration of DAPT by incorporating short DAPT into their recommendations. 1, 9 However, the question about the value of extended DAPT duration in selected patients still remains to be answered.

### Dual-antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting: a survey of UK cardiac surgeons [^111PSraa]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is important in postoperative medical management. Although cardiac surgeons are well-versed in the guidelines regarding discontinuation of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin and a P2Y12 antagonist) before CABG to minimize bleeding risk, there is considerable variability in DAPT dosing after CABG. The objective of this study was to explore the current trends in DAPT after CABG in the UK to improve understanding of the existing practice.

Design

This study used an online survey with 9 questions about the use of DAPT after CABG. An invitation to participate was sent to all adult cardiac surgeons currently in practice in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Setting

The study was conducted in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Participants

Participants in this study were adult cardiac surgeons currently in practice in the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Interventions

There were no interventions in this study.

Measurements and Main Results

Responses were received from across the UK (85.4% UK; 4% each from Scotland and Northern Ireland, 1.3% from Wales) and 5.3% from the Republic of Ireland. Fifty-seven percent of the respondents performed between 50 and 100 CABGs per year. Ninety-one percent of the respondents prescribe DAPT postoperatively, but the choice of which patients receive it varied. Most responding surgeons used DAPT for selective patient cohorts, such as those with acute coronary syndrome (51%), diffuse coronary artery disease (42%), perioperative myocardial infarction (36%), coronary endarterectomy (31%), or when bypassing a stented coronary artery (23%). Thirty-eight percent of the respondents began all their patients with CABGs on DAPT. The most preferred P2Y12 antagonist was clopidogrel, used by 75% of respondents and introduced on day 1 after surgical revascularization (71%). The routine duration for DAPT is 12 months, which 78% of the respondents preferred. The main reason for not starting DAPT in those surveyed was the bleeding risk associated with DAPT (72%).

Conclusions

The survey uncovered variation in the use of DAPT after CABG. However, DAPT remains the preferred strategy after CABG in the UK. The study highlighted the need to develop standardized protocols for DAPT after CABG.

### Predictors of secondary revascularization after coronary artery bypass graft surgery and role of dual antiplatelet therapy [^114ZTRhc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite advancements in surgical techniques, interventional procedures, novel pharmacotherapies, and other contemporary treatments, patients after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) remain at risk for graft failure and progression of native vessel disease progression. Consequently, secondary revascularization is often required.

Methods

This is a retrospective observational study evaluating the incidence, trends, and predictors of revascularization after CABG surgery.

Results

Of 2,476 patients followed in this post-CABG study, 1458 patients received dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) compared to 1005 patients received aspirin monotherapy (AMT). The overall incidence of revascularization was significantly higher in the DAPT group (14.54%, 212 out of 1458) compared to the AMT group (7.07%, 71 out of 1005), with an odds ratio (OR) of 2.24 (95% CI: 1.69–2.97, p < 0.001). 770 patients who received DAPT for six months or more after surgery were compared in sub-analysis and were noted to have significantly higher incidence of revascularization compared to AMT (22.08% vs. 6.96%; OR = 3.157, 95% CI: 2.734–4.940; p < 0.001). The binary regression model revealed that younger patients (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.964, 95% CI: 0.95–0.97; p < 0.001), diabetics (HR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.12–2.00, p = 0.007), patients who had fewer internal mammary artery grafts (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.36–0.81, p = 0.003), and patients receiving DAPT of any duration after CABG (HR = 3.47, 95% CI: 2.55–4.72, p < 0.001) were more likely to receive revascularization after CABG. The model, comprising these four predictors, was able to explain 12.8% of the variance in post-CABG revascularization (Nagelkerke R² = 0.128; p < 0.001). The survival rates were 96.5% for the DAPT group and 92.0% for AMT (odds ratio (OR) = 0.421, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.269–0.658; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Diabetes mellitus, younger age, fewer Internal mammary artery grafts, and the use of DAPT after CABG were strong predictors of the need for secondary revascularization.

### Clopidogrel vs DAPT in acute coronary syndromes and high ischemic / bleeding risk… [^111qPtiz]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance Among birisk patients with ACS who completed 9 to 12 months of DAPT after drug-eluting stent implantation and were free from adverse events for at least 6 months before randomization, an extended 9-month clopidogrel monotherapy regimen was superior to continuing DAPT with clopidogrel in reducing clinically relevant bleeding without increasing ischemic events. dual antiplatelet therapy in patients at increased ischemic risk, such as those with ACS. 1–5 Conversely, patients at increased bleeding risk warrant less intensive therapy. 1–5 In real-world practice, many patients are at increased risk for both ischemic and bleeding events; the optimal antithrombotic treatment regimen in such patients is unknown.
6. DAPT for guideline-recommended durations in high ischemic-risk settings, particularly when using a P2Y12 inhibitor with modest platelet inhibitory effects such as clopidogrel.

1–4 Following this time frame, although a strategy of clopidogrel monotherapy is an attractive option, particularly for patients at both high ischemic and bleeding risk, this has never been tested.
12. The present trial enrolled a unique difficult-to-treat patient population with criteria for not only increased ischemic risk but also increased bleeding risk who were maintained on standard DAPT by their treating physicians for at least 9 months and not more than 12 months before randomization without major adverse events. All patients are at an ongoing risk of major adverse cardiovascular events beyond the first year after stent implantation, a period when aspirin monotherapy is typically used. 28 Based on existing evidence, 16, 29, 30 current guidelines recommend considering extending DAPT beyond 1 year after PCI in patients at high ischemic risk to minimize the long-term rate of thrombotic events.

1–4 However, extended DAPT is associated with increased bleeding compared with aspirin alone30, 31 and is especially harmful in patients at high bleeding risk. This lower reduction may be explained by the study protocol requiring that patients had survived after 9 to 12 months of DAPT and were free from major ischemic and bleeding events for at least 6 months before randomization. Similarly, the observed MACCE rates were also less than anticipated, perhaps in part due to improvements in stent design and technique, making noninferiority for this key secondary end point easier to be achieved.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with safer, newer-generation drug-eluting stents (DES), patients may be treated with a minimum DAPT duration of 3 to 6 months to prevent early and largely stent-related thrombotic events, but extension beyond 12 months entails a tradeoff; the declining risk of late stent thrombosis and inability to predict life-threatening bleeding limit the appeal of 18 to 48 months versus 6 to 12 months of therapy. In contrast, patients with prior MI at high risk of atherothrombosis experience fewer ischemic events with prolonged DAPT at a cost of increased bleeding events.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^115mmRwp]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

For patients treated with DAPT after PCI who subsequently undergo CABG, P2Y 12 receptor antagonist therapy should be resumed postoperatively to complete the recommended DAPT duration (class I). In patients with stable CAD undergoing CABG, DAPT with clopidogrel (initiated early in the postoperative period) for 12 months may be considered to improve vein graft patency (class IIb)(figure 1). Due to the lack of clinical evidence in patients with stable CAD, the use of potent P2Y 12 receptor inhibitors (prasugrel or ticagrelor) is currently not recommended. Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of an intensified platelet inhibition using ticagrelor after CABG are currently investigated in the Ticagrelor in CABG (TiCAB) trial (NCT01755520), an ongoing, multicentre, double-blind, double-dummy, randomised trial that will compare ticagrelor with aspirin for the prevention of MACE within 12 months after CABG. The study will randomise 3850 patients undergoing CABG in a 1:1 fashion to either ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily or aspirin 100 mg once daily. Of note, the study medication will be started within 24 hours after surgery and maintained for 12 months. The primary endpoint will be a composite of CV death, MI, stroke and repeat revascularisation at 12 months after CABG.

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) duration — mortality signal and stent thrombosis lethality is described as follows: In completed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), "the 21% increase in mortality rate with prolonged DAPT" is reported, with additional analyses showing "a significant 19% increase", "a significant 22% increase", "a significant 30% increase", and "a borderline 26% increase in mortality rate". Stent thrombosis lethality varies by timing, with "mortality rates approaching 50%" for acute and subacute events and "approximately 10%" for late and very late events; registry data show "a mortality rate of 39%" within 30 days versus "mortality rates of 12% (P < 0.001)" for 30 days to 1 year and > 1 year. Given these time-dependent risks, "extension of DAPT beyond 12 months may simultaneously reduce MI and stent thrombosis without influencing mortality rate".

Circulation (2016). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after stent implantation — guideline recommendations and P2Y12 options: The 2011 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guideline "recommended a minimum DAPT duration of at least 12 months after drug-eluting stents (DES) implantation, irrespective of clinical presentation". The duration "should generally be as follows": for patients receiving a stent during PCI for acute coronary syndrome, "P2Y12 inhibitor therapy should be given for at least 12 months. Options include clopidogrel 75 mg daily, prasugrel 10 mg daily, and ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. (Class I, Level of Evidence: B)". For DES placed for a non–acute coronary syndrome indication, "clopidogrel 75 mg daily should be given for at least 12 months if patients are not at high risk of bleeding. (Class I, Level of Evidence: B)".

### Rationale and design of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary multi-vessel disease (DAPT-MVD): a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial [^116smyqQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the era of PCI with significant progress, the gap in clinical outcomes between PCI and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has narrowed over time. Accordingly, it is reported that the number of PCIs performed for MVD increased by 56% per year between 2001 and 2006; moreover, the number of CABG surgeries declined by 24% and subsequently fell at an annual rate of 5%. After MI and/or PCI, DAPT with a P2Y12 inhibitor and aspirin is the mainstay to prevent thrombosis. However, owing to the presence of high plaque load and extensive ischemia risk, a heightened risk of adverse events remains in MVD patients after administration of contemporary treatment therapies, with a 3.1% cumulative risk of all‐cause death, 1.9% cumulative risk of MI and 0.7% cumulative risk of stroke. Moreover, whether prolonged DAPT based on 12 months of treatment after PCI is beneficial remains debatable. Despite the high prevalence and mortality of MVD, a paucity of evidence‐based medicine evidence exists regarding optimal DAPT management among particular patients. The MASTER DAPT study, a multicenter randomized controlled trial led by Marco Valgimigli et al. was designed to compare the NACEs in patients at higher risk of bleeding after implantation of biodegradable polymer‐coated sirolimus‐eluting stents with a shorter duration of dual antiplatelet therapy. The study showed that 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy was non‐inferior to the continuation of treatment for at least two additional months with regard to the occurrence of net adverse clinical events and major adverse cardiac or cerebral events; abbreviated therapy also resulted in a lower incidence of major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding. This suggests that future research should focus on individualized antiplatelet therapy. Few prospective studies are concentrated on antiplatelet therapy after revascularization in MVD patients. Thus, it becomes increasingly urgent to answer the ultimate question, "What is the ideal duration of DAPT for patients with MVD following DES implantation?" and further, "How can the duration of DAPT be adjusted after PCI with MVD based on the patient's bleeding‐ischemia risk to reduce future ischemic events with less nonfatal bleeding while obtaining greater clinical benefits?"

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy management for prior PCI undergoing noncardiac surgery (NCS): In patients with prior PCI with coronary stent placement undergoing NCS, aspirin use was associated with lower rates of death and nonfatal MI (absolute risk reduction, 5.5%) with comparable major and life-threatening bleeding. Although bleeding risks are higher with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) than aspirin alone, a meta-analysis of 46 studies including > 3000 patients found both single and double antiplatelet therapy had a modest increased bleeding risk without additional thrombotic risk versus placebo or interruption. Evidence is limited to support either continuation or discontinuation of DAPT before NCS, and if DAPT must be interrupted, "aspirin monotherapy should be continued whenever possible".

### Guideline update on duration of dual antiplatelet therapy for CAD… [^1119LK3L]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

The combination of aspirin and platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor therapy reduces the risk of recurrent ischemia following ACS and reduces risk of stent thrombosis following coronary stenting regardless of clinical presentation, yet it increases the risk of bleeding. Until recently, there have been few randomized controlled trials assessing the duration of treatment. The ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines issued this focused update1, which was subject to the same level of rigor as their full guidelines, and was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC/AHA.

It was developed in collaboration with the American Association for Thoracic Surgery, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and was endorsed by Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association and the Society for Vascular Surgery.

### Coronary artery bypass graft surgery in patients on ticagrelor therapy is not associated with adverse perioperative outcomes [^1154D3bS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) guidelines recommend that most patients receive dual antiplatelet therapy at the time of presentation to prevent recurrent ischemic events. Approximately 10% of ACS patients require coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG). Excessive bleeding after cardiac surgery is associated with transfusion of blood products, which is associated with increased morbidity, mortality and high costs. One important factor resulting in impaired hemostasis is preoperative use of antithrombotic medications such as platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants. Discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy for a time frame prior to surgery to allow recovery of platelet function is warranted.

However, premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in these settings has been associated with an increase in ischemic complications and a reported mortality rate of 25–40%. Indeed, ischemic events occur as high as 35.4% if antiplatelets are discontinued less than 30 days after placement of a coronary drug eluting stent, and decline to 11.7% if discontinued later but within the first 6 months, with a reported mortality rate of 25–40%. Ticagrelor is an oral, reversibly binding and directly acting P2Y12 receptor antagonist that rapidly peaks within 1.5–3 h, has a rapid onset of antiplatelet effects, and half-life of 7 to 8 h. Furthermore, this reversibility may offer great flexibility for surgical procedures. The optimal discontinuation time of P2Y12 antagonists before CABG is still poorly defined. Data regarding the true incidence of bleeding with shorter discontinuation periods of P2Y12 antagonists are lacking. Continuing ticagrelor to less than 2 days prior to surgery or at time of surgery was associated with a 3.5 times higher risk of platelet transfusions compared to patients receiving aspirin alone, while an increased rate of severe bleeding was noted in patients receiving ticagrelor 1 day before or just before surgery. Hansson et al. reported data from the SWEDEHEART registry on CABG-related bleeding complications in ACS patients on dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT). The authors demonstrated that in contrast to clopidogrel, discontinuation of ticagrelor 3 days before surgery, as opposed to 5 days, did not increase the incidence of major bleeding. In the PLATO trial, ticagrelor treatment was recommended to be withheld for 1–3 days before CABG. Current guidelines recommend that dual antiplatelet therapy be withheld at least 3 days prior to surgery.

### Optimal duration of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug eluting stents: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^116znPXi]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

The apparently discordant finding of similar ischaemic risks in trials comparing a short term versus 12 month duration of dual antiplatelet therapy — as opposed to an ischaemic protection conferred by an extended versus 12 month duration — may reflect differences in the selection of patient populations included in the studies. In trials randomising patients to a 12 month versus short term regimen, those at high bleeding risk were not excluded, and randomisation occurred relatively early after stent implantation (that is, immediately, or after one, three, or six months). Studies comparing 12 month with extended regimens randomised patients only after several months of dual antiplatelet therapy provided that no major bleeding episodes had occurred in the preceding months. These studies most likely selected, by design, a patient population at relatively lower risk of bleeding while receiving therapy.

In view of the possible association between bleeding and subsequent ischaemic and fatal events, it may be hypothesised that in less carefully selected populations (such as those patients included in short term v 12 month studies), the detrimental effect of bleeding on ischaemic endpoints and death would have counterbalanced the ischaemic protection potentially offered by dual antiplatelet therapy. On the other hand, prolonging therapy in the long term in patients at relatively lower bleeding risk (that is, those who tolerate this therapy for at least 12 months) could result in a more favourable reduction of ischaemic events, at the cost of some major haemorrhagic complications.

From an individual patient's perspective, the results of this article suggest that the 12 month cut-off for dual antiplatelet therapy should not necessarily be considered as the optimal standard of care choice. Rather, durations shorter or longer than 12 months should be calibrated, taking into consideration the patient's bleeding and ischaemic risk profile, in addition to procedural variables and acuity of presentation. Further, well powered trials are warranted to test the clinical effect of tailored dual antiplatelet therapy. A practical approach for clinicians, given the results of our pooled analysis, would be to offer to many patients, especially those at high bleeding risk, a duration of less than one year after coronary implantation of a drug eluting stent. Prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy beyond one year could represent an option for selected patients who present very high ischaemic and low bleeding risks.

### International patterns of dual antiplatelet therapy duration after acute coronary syndromes [^111iC27b]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusions

International patterns of DAPT duration do not necessarily align with guideline recommendations. Despite contemporary evidence, patients with ACS remained on DAPT longer than 12 months, irrespective of clinical characteristics and ischaemic risk, country being the most important determinant of DAPT duration. This emphasises the importance of postmarketing surveillance to monitor prescription patterns, patient selection and clinical events related to long-term DAPT duration.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for perioperative myocardial infarction following CABG surgery [^113sb5Yp]. American Heart Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) has been associated with adverse outcome. Whether perioperative MI should be treated with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is unknown. We compared the effect of DAPT versus aspirin alone on short-term outcomes among patients with perioperative MI following CABG.

Methods

We used data from 3 clinical trials that enrolled patients undergoing isolated CABG: PREVENT IV (2002–2003), MEND-CABG II (2004–2005), and RED-CABG (2009–2010) (n = 9117). Perioperative MI was defined as CK-MB > 5 times the upper limit of normal within 24 h of surgery (n = 2052). DAPT was defined as DAPT given after surgery and prior to discharge. A Cox regression model was used to assess the association between DAPT and 30-day nonfatal MI, stroke, or mortality after adjustment for baseline covariates.

Results

DAPT (n = 527) and aspirin alone (n = 1525) cohorts were similar in baseline comorbidities. Off pump bypass was used in 5.2% (n = 106) of patients. There was no difference in the 30-day composite of death, MI or stroke between patients receiving DAPT versus aspirin alone, nor in any of the individual components. There were fewer all-cause re-hospitalizations at 30 days following surgery among patients in the DAPT group (adjusted HR 0.71, CI 0.52–0.97, P = 0.033).

Conclusion

One-quarter of CABG patients who had perioperative MI were treated with DAPT. DAPT was not associated with a difference in MI, stroke, or mortality at 30 days, but was associated with fewer re-hospitalizations. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal antiplatelet regimen following perioperative MI. What is already known about this subject? Perioperative myocardial infarction portends poor outcome but optimal management is currently unclear. While dual antiplatelet therapy is standard of care for acute coronary syndrome, its role in perioperative myocardial infarction is unknown. What does this study add? Dual antiplatelet therapy use during perioperative myocardial infarction was not associated with a difference in myocardial infarction, stroke or mortality at 30 days. It was, however, associated with fewer re-hospitalizations at 30 days. How might this impact on clinical practice? Dual antiplatelet therapy may be a potential treatment option for perioperative myocardial infarction after CABG surgery. Further studies are needed to better understand treatment for this disease process.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Synopsis — perioperative risk windows and postponement guidance: The risk of perioperative stent thrombosis is greatest in the first 4 to 6 weeks post-PCI, with excess risks that decline over time but persist to 6 months. For most patients with CCD, DAPT is recommended for 6 months, followed by single antiplatelet therapy (either with aspirin or P2Y12 inhibitor). Selected patients may be eligible for shorter durations of DAPT (28–31 days or 90 days) post-PCI based on recent data. Patients with PCI performed for MI have nearly 3-fold higher risks of postoperative MACE versus those with CCD as the indication for PCI. Ideally, NCS should be postponed ≥ 1 year after PCI for ACS, although NCS can be considered ≥ 6 months after DES placement for CCD and after 3 months for time-sensitive NCS if the benefits of surgery outweigh the risk of MACE. If a patient requires urgent NCS requiring interruption of DAPT, balloon angioplasty without stent may be considered, with NCS delayed for a minimum of 14 days due to higher perioperative MACE risk very early after PCI.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

High-risk windows after PCI and perioperative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT): The risk of stent thrombosis is highest in the first 4 to 6 weeks after PCI with bare-metal stent (BMS) and in the first 3 months after drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation; registry data show NCS within 1 month of PCI-DES had a 13-fold higher risk of cardiac death and a 4-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality. When time-sensitive NCS is necessary within 30 days of BMS-PCI or within 3 months of DES-PCI, "DAPT should be continued in the perioperative period, if feasible, from a surgical bleeding perspective".
