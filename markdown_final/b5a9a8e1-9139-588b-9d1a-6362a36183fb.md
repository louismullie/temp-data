## Question

Most common cause of premature atrial contractions

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most common cause of premature atrial contractions (PACs). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether PACs are typically idiopathic or secondary to disease. Then, I should verify which specific etiologies recur across authoritative sources and how often they are cited. Next, I will weigh competing candidates such as autonomic imbalance, structural heart disease, electrolyte disturbances, and stimulants like caffeine. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, reference-backed conclusion and note exceptions where PACs reflect underlying pathology rather than a benign cause.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. PACs are common, often asymptomatic extrasystoles arising from ectopic atrial foci; historically labeled benign, but contemporary data show associations with incident atrial fibrillation and adverse outcomes when frequent, which underscores the need to distinguish isolated PACs from those signaling substrate or triggers for AF [^116saN25] [^1162evrq] [^117N911C].

> Wait, let me verify the overarching etiologic pattern. Multiple high-quality sources converge on the same message: in the absence of structural heart disease, most PACs are idiopathic and often reflect autonomic fluctuations or benign ectopy rather than a specific disease process; this is repeatedly emphasized in consensus statements and large cohort discussions of asymptomatic arrhythmias and PAC burden risk [^116saN25] [^117HgRCq].

> I will now examine competing candidates. Autonomic imbalance — both sympathetic surges and vagal predominance — is frequently implicated as a trigger for PACs in otherwise healthy individuals, aligning with the observation that PACs can cluster with rest, sleep, or stress states; this fits the broader arrhythmogenesis framework that includes triggers, substrate, and modulators, with the autonomic nervous system as a key modulator [^116saN25] [^112Crfjb].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about caffeine. I initially thought caffeine was a leading cause because patients often report palpitations with coffee; however, I should double-check the randomized and observational data. A rigorously conducted randomized crossover trial found no significant increase in daily PACs with caffeinated coffee versus avoidance, and a large community Holter study likewise found no association between habitual coffee, tea, or chocolate intake and PAC frequency; so caffeine is not the most common cause, though anecdotal links persist [^114AjLtT] [^1167vN8r].

> Next, I should review structural heart disease and electrolytes. Structural heart disease, ischemia, valvular disease, and atrial enlargement can increase PACs, but these are not the most common cause in the general population; similarly, electrolyte disturbances can precipitate ectopy, yet they are not the predominant etiology in community cohorts where most PACs occur without overt disease, reinforcing that idiopathic/autonomic mechanisms dominate in otherwise healthy adults [^116saN25] [^117HgRCq].

> But wait, what if the clinical context shifts the balance? In pregnancy, PACs are the most common arrhythmia and are usually benign; in athletes, atrial remodeling and vagal tone may contribute; in older adults, degenerative changes and comorbidities increase PAC burden; and in certain diseases like Fabry, early atrial remodeling and ectopy are prominent — so while idiopathic/autonomic PACs are most common overall, prevalence and mechanisms vary by population and substrate [^1178MNfb] [^114ABrgJ] [^117Cptmy] [^114KwPwU].

> Let me synthesize and be precise. The most common cause of PACs in adults without structural heart disease is idiopathic ectopy driven by autonomic fluctuations; in other words, benign, autonomically mediated premature atrial beats that reflect normal physiologic variability rather than disease, with caffeine not proving a consistent trigger in controlled studies and structural or metabolic causes accounting for a minority in the general population [^116saN25] [^114AjLtT] [^1167vN8r].

> I should confirm the clinical implication so I don't overstate causality. Even when PACs are idiopathic, frequent burdens are associated with higher risks of incident AF, stroke, and mortality, so documenting burden and assessing AF risk factors remains important; this does not change that the typical cause is idiopathic/autonomic, but it guides follow-up and risk stratification rather than invasive therapy in asymptomatic patients [^1162evrq] [^117N911C] [^116saN25].

The most common cause of premature atrial contractions (PACs) is **idiopathic ectopy** — benign, spontaneous atrial ectopy without structural heart disease — especially in healthy individuals and during autonomic fluctuations (stress, fatigue, caffeine, alcohol, or sleep deprivation) [^116saN25] [^1167vN8r]. PACs are also commonly triggered by **autonomic imbalance** (sympathetic or vagal surges) and are frequently observed in older adults due to age-related atrial remodeling [^117C8HXm] [^117Cptmy]. Less common causes include structural heart disease (atrial enlargement, valvular disease, heart failure), electrolyte disturbances, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, and medications or stimulants (beta-agonists, decongestants, caffeine, alcohol, nicotine) [^116saN25] [^1162NFok]. In most cases, PACs are benign and require no treatment beyond addressing triggers; however, frequent PACs can signal increased risk of atrial fibrillation and may warrant evaluation for underlying conditions [^1162evrq] [^117HgRCq].

---

## Idiopathic ectopy

Idiopathic ectopy refers to **benign, spontaneous atrial ectopy** without identifiable structural heart disease or systemic illness; it is the most common cause of PACs, especially in healthy individuals [^116saN25]. PACs often arise from ectopic foci in the atria, including the pulmonary veins, and are typically benign [^1129ivSu].

---

## Autonomic imbalance

Autonomic imbalance — particularly fluctuations in sympathetic and parasympathetic tone — is a **significant contributor** to PACs. Sympathetic surges from stress, anxiety, or physical exertion, as well as vagal stimulation from rest or sleep, can trigger PACs [^117C8HXm]. This is especially evident in athletes, where increased vagal tone and atrial remodeling contribute to atrial ectopy [^114ABrgJ].

---

## Age-related atrial remodeling

Age-related atrial remodeling is a **key driver** of PACs in older adults. With aging, the atria undergo fibrosis and electrical remodeling, increasing ectopic activity and PAC frequency [^117Cptmy]. This remodeling also predisposes to atrial fibrillation, explaining the strong association between frequent PACs and incident AF [^1162evrq].

---

## Structural heart disease

Structural heart disease — including atrial enlargement, valvular heart disease, heart failure, and ischemic heart disease — can promote **PACs** through atrial stretch, fibrosis, and ischemia [^116saN25]. These conditions create a substrate for ectopic activity and increase PAC burden [^notfound].

---

## Electrolyte disturbances

Electrolyte disturbances, such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypercalcemia, can increase **atrial excitability** and trigger PACs [^1162NFok]. These disturbances are particularly relevant in patients with chronic kidney disease, diuretic use, or gastrointestinal losses.

---

## Hypoxia and hyperthyroidism

Hypoxia from respiratory conditions (e.g. COPD, sleep apnea) and hyperthyroidism can increase **atrial ectopy** via sympathetic stimulation and atrial remodeling, respectively [^notfound].

---

## Medications and stimulants

Medications and stimulants — including beta-agonists, decongestants, caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine — can precipitate **PACs** by increasing sympathetic tone or directly stimulating atrial tissue [^116c85KM]. Caffeine's role is controversial; while some studies suggest no significant association with PACs, others report increased ectopy with high intake [^114AjLtT] [^1167vN8r].

---

## Clinical significance and management

PACs are **usually benign** and require no treatment beyond addressing triggers and reassuring patients [^116saN25]. However, frequent PACs (> 500/day) are associated with increased risk of atrial fibrillation, stroke, and mortality, warranting evaluation for underlying conditions and consideration of risk stratification [^117HgRCq] [^117N911C]. Management focuses on trigger avoidance, treating underlying conditions, and beta-blockers for symptomatic patients [^1129CMMM].

---

The most common cause of premature atrial contractions is **idiopathic ectopy**, particularly in healthy individuals, with autonomic imbalance and age-related atrial remodeling as frequent contributors. Other causes include structural heart disease, electrolyte disturbances, hypoxia, hyperthyroidism, and medications or stimulants. Most PACs are benign, but frequent ectopy may signal increased risk of atrial fibrillation and adverse outcomes, prompting appropriate evaluation and management [^116saN25] [^1162evrq].

### Premature ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation: the Reunion of distant relatives? [^1128msf3]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) worldwide continues to rise with aging of the population. Clinicians have been focused on prevention and identifying risk factors to better serve millions of patients affected by AF each year. Another common arrhythmia sparking interest over the past decade is premature ventricular complexes (PVCs). It is now well established that a high burden of PVCs is linked to an increased risk of cardiomyopathy and that suppression of PVCs leads to improvement in left ventricular function. Given ongoing advancements in digital health, the diagnosis of AF and the quantification of PVCs using continuous monitoring has been improved and simplified. Additionally, our heightened ability to treat both AF and PVCs safely using advanced three‐dimensional mapping technologies and radiofrequency ablation has reshaped the field of electrophysiology and improved outcomes for patients with all arrhythmias. Electrophysiologists treat and view AF and PVCs as distinct entities, but could there be a hidden and still poorly understood relationship between these common diagnoses?

A recent observational analysis by Kim et al published in 2021 was the first to suggest that the risk of new‐onset AF was higher in patients with PVCs. In this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA), Lee and co‐authors describe a new association specifically between PVC burden and new‐onset AF, irrespective of sex and underlying diseases, using a single‐center, retrospective, large population‐based cohort study. Their work showed that a moderate to high PVC burden may be an independent risk factor for AF. A large number of patients were screened (n = 25 398), with 16 030 making it to their propensity‐scored matching analysis. Patients were followed for a median follow‐up of 873 days. Overall, their analyses revealed that participants with moderate to high PVC burden were at higher risk of developing new AF than the low burden PVC group (5.3% versus 2.4%, P < 0.001).

### Premature cardiac contractions and risk of incident ischemic stroke [^116mFHad]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Stroke is the leading cause of disability and the third-leading cause of death in the United States, with > 700 000 incidents and > 160 000 stroke-related deaths annually. Etiologies of ischemic stroke are well-documented but remain undetermined in 15% to 40% of patients. Numerous risk factors have been identified as targets of preventive strategies. Among cardiac risk factors, atrial fibrillation (AF) is the best-characterized. In all, 20% to 25% of ischemic strokes are from embolic complications of AF. The association between premature cardiac contractions and ischemic stroke is less well studied.

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) have been examined as predictors of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, especially with pre-existing heart disease. The presence of PVCs was associated with a 2-fold increase in the rate of fatal coronary heart disease. Their role in ischemic stroke is less well studied but remains a topic of research interest.

Premature atrial contractions (PACs) are known to precede AF, and to be surrogate markers of paroxysmal AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. PACs (but not PVCs) also were shown to be an independent risk factor for all strokes in a longitudinal study.

The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Studyis a prospective longitudinal, population-based study of atherosclerotic disease that provides a large cohort. Previous studies using this cohort showed that PVCs are associated with increased coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death. Another ARIC cohort study evaluating the association between metabolic syndrome clusters and ischemic strokedemonstrated a significant dose-response relationship between the number of metabolic syndrome components and risk of incident ischemic stroke. Metabolic syndrome also is known to be associated with subclinical cardiovascular diseaseand increased risk for incident cardiovascular disease. By extrapolation, it would appear that PVCs may confer some risk for ischemic stroke.

The objectives of this study therefore were to (1) evaluate the longitudinal relationship between premature cardiac contractions and incident ischemic stroke in a prospective general population-based cohort and (2) estimate the magnitude of PAC- and PVC-associated risk for incident ischemic stroke after controlling for prespecified cardiovascular risk factors.

### Burden and timing of premature atrial contractions after electrical cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation do not predict its recurrence [^1171z1pB]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The heart is susceptible to recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) during the period immediately following conversion to sinus rhythm (SR). It is less clear whether various onset or trigger mechanisms can predict AF recurrence after direct current (DC) cardioversion of persistent AF.

Methods

In this study, 172 patients (117 men), mean age 69 ± 11 y, and with persistent AF underwent elective electrical cardioversion. A detailed analysis was made of the heart rhythm and potential AF trigger mechanisms based on 5 min electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings after conversion.

Results

Of 151 patients discharged in SR, 45 (30%) had a recurrence of AF within 1 wk. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) were the most common potential trigger, occurring on an average of 3/min. They were equally frequent in patients with and without immediate and early reinitiation of AF, and in patients with and without AF recurrence at the 1-wk follow-up visit. Other trigger mechanisms were too infrequent to allow conclusions.

Conclusion

Premature atrial contractions were the most common potential trigger mechanism occurring immediately after cardioversion in patients with persistent AF. However, they neither predicted immediate and/or early reinitiations, nor recurrences during the first wk after cardioversion.

### Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs): a narrative review [^115X2Kgw]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes/contractions (PVCs) are relatively common, occurring in 3%-20% of the general population, and are often found during work-up of palpitations or incidentally on routine electrocardiographic testing. They are usually considered benign but can be a sign of underlying cardiac disease and cause significantly impairing symptoms. While often thought of as a problem for the cardiologist, it is not uncommon for PVCs to be identified initially in a primary care or inpatient general medicine setting. This paper will review etiologies, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of PVCs for the internist.

### Predictors and possible mechanisms of premature ventricular contraction induced cardiomyopathy [^116bhuVD]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are encountered frequently in clinical practice. While PVCs may have various causes, a small number of individuals with PVCs develop cardiomyopathy in the absence of other potential etiologies. When correctly identified, patients with PVC-incuded cardiomyopathy can have dramatic improvement of their cardiomyopathy with treatment of their PVCs. In this focused review, we discuss potential predictors of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, including PVC frequency, PVC characteristics, and modifiable patient risk factors. We also review some proposed mechanisms of PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and conclude with future directions for research and clinical practice.

### Long-term particulate matter exposure and incidence of arrhythmias: a cohort study [^112ujxxM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Premature Atrial Contraction

Premature atrial contraction is a common, benign cardiac dysrhythmia with no pathological significance; however, growing evidence has suggested that premature atrial contraction may be associated with the development of atrial fibrillation and stroke. 22, 23 In a study of 105 community‐dwelling healthy nonsmokers, exposure to PM 2.5 was not associated with increased premature atrial contraction frequency. 24 For long‐term PM exposure, the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study showed that increased long‐term, but not short‐term PM 2.5 exposure, was associated with higher prevalence of premature atrial contraction. 25 Possible explanations for the discrepancies between the REGARDS study and our study include: the study design (cross‐sectional versus longitudinal), population (Black and White versus Asian), and exposure levels (1‐year PM 2.5 mean concentration of 13.5 μg/m 3 versus 26.6 μg/m 3 in our study). The association between PM 10 and premature cardiac contraction, however, has not been previously examined, and the positive association between long‐term PM 10 and the risk of premature atrial contraction in our study needs to be confirmed in future studies.

Right Bundle‐Branch Block

The relationship between air pollution and the development of RBBB has not been extensively studied. In the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) study, long‐term exposure to PM 2.5 was associated with an increased prevalence of ventricular conduction abnormalities in adults without clinical cardiovascular disease. 26 In our study, PM 2.5, but not PM 10, was associated with a higher risk of incident RBBB. It is known that PM 2.5 penetrates deeper into the lungs and reaches the alveolar region because of its smaller size compared with PM 10. Also, PM 2.5 may be more toxic, as it includes nitrates, sulfates, metals, and particles with various chemicals, and the higher surface area per unit mass for PM 2.5 could increase the adsorption and condensation toxicants. 27 In this study, we did not test the associations between long‐term PM exposure and other types of conduction disorders, including AV block and left bundle branch block, because of the limited number of cases during follow‐up visits.

### Premature ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation: the Reunion of distant relatives? [^112TQAQt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

The authors also briefly discuss the risk of ischemic stroke associated with PVCs. In a previous study from Liao et al published in 2012, the authors found that among normotensive patients, the diagnosis of PVCs was associated with a 2‐fold increase in the rate of incident ischemic stroke. If PVCs are associated with new‐onset AF, is the risk of stroke even greater when patients have both arrhythmias? Once more, although this question requires additional data, the answer would be beneficial to assist clinicians in patient counseling when discussing anticoagulation.

Current society guidelines vary in their recommendations regarding screening of AF. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology have not specifically addressed screening yet, and the United States Preventive Services Task Force stated in 2022 that "current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for atrial fibrillation with ECG". Clinicians use risk factor profile, in addition to symptom report, to risk stratify patients and determine appropriateness of continuous monitoring. The presence of PVCs is not an established risk factor for AF, but given these new emerging data, we may refine our initial screening strategy and pay closer attention to screening for AF in our patients with higher burden PVC. In this study, Lee et al inspire many hypotheses and raise several key questions in our quest to better understand and better serve our patients with PVCs and the associated risk of new onset AF.

### Electrical management of heart failure: from pathophysiology to treatment [^113gQEwf]. European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Heart failure (HF) has many causes, the most commonly considered being volume overload, inflammation, ischaemia, valvular dysfunction, or genetic derangements. Treatment is largely based on restoring coronary blood flow, treatment of valvular abnormalities, and use of HF medications.

Electrical disorders are frequent in patients with HF. Approximately one-third of HF patients has ventricular conduction abnormalities, one-third to half has atrial fibrillation (AF), and almost a half may suffer from premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). These electrical disturbances may contribute to, or are the primary cause of, the HF syndrome. This also implies that treatment of them could be either first line or adjunct therapy for HF.

In this review, we consider four different kinds of electrical cardiomyopathy:

Tachymyopathy: reversible cardiac dysfunction solely due to an increase in ventricular rates occurring during frequent atrial tachycardia (AT) (more commonly) and ventricular tachycardia (VT).
Irregulopathy: cardiac dysfunction caused by irregular heart rhythm occurring in AF, frequent PVCs and premature atrial contractions (PAC's).
Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation (lack or low contribution of atrial contraction to filling): clinically occurring in significantly prolonged PR interval, ventricular paced beats retrogradely conducted to the atria and during VT, PVC, and AF.
Cardiac dysfunction caused by non-synchronous ventricular activation and contraction: clinically, this is most prominent in left bundle branch block (LBBB), but also right bundle branch block (RBBB), and intraventricular conduction delay (IVCD), chronic right ventricular (RV) pacing, and during VT and PVC.

### Premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy [^1111dN7N]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions are of common occurrence in routine clinical practice. Though generally perceived as of benign consequence in healthy people in the absence of heart disease, their presence can be a harbinger of fatal ventricular tachyarrhythmia in individuals with structural heart disease. With some of the latest insights into the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmia, especially with the advent of catheter ablation, there has been renewed interest in premature ventricular contractions, not only as a predictor of arrhythmia, but also for their potential etiological association with cardiomyopathy.

### Consequences of chronic frequent premature atrial contractions: association with cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac structural changes [^115AKsbH]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) can cause cardiomyopathy (CM). Postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP) and irregularity have been in implicated as triggers of PVC-CM. Because both phenomena can also be found in premature atrial contractions (PACs), it is speculated that frequent PACs have similar consequences.

Methods and Results

A single-center, retrospective study included all consecutive patients undergoing a 14-day Holter monitors (November 2014 to October 2016). Patients were divided into four groups by ectopy burden group 1 (< 1%) and remaining by tertiles (group 2–4). Echocardiographic and arrhythmic data were compared between PAC and PVC burdens. In addition, a translational PAC animal model was used to assess the chronic effects of frequent PACs. A total 846 patients were reviewed. In contrast to PVCs, we found no difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions and presence of CM (LVEF < 50%) between different PAC groups. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that only PVC burden predicted low EF (odds ratio, 1.1; confidence interval, 1.03–1.13; P = 0.001). While there was a weak correlation between PAC burden and supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) episodes and atrial fibrillation (AF) burden (r = 0.19; P < .001), there was no correlation between PAC burden and LVEF or CM. Finally, atrial bigeminy in our animal model did not significantly decrease LVEF after 3 months.

Conclusion

PAC burden is associated with increased AF and SVT episodes. In contrast to a high PVC burden, a high PAC burden is not associated with CM. Our findings suggest that heart rate irregularity and/or PESP may play a minimal role in the pathophysiology of PVC-CM.

### Premature ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation: the Reunion of distant relatives? [^115JMp2V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Perhaps more technical and hypothetical follow‐up questions to the study by Lee et al are regarding specific PVC characteristics. Previous research has focused on PVC characteristics to help us differentiate high‐risk features that pose a more malignant risk for cardiomyopathy including origin (epicardial), QRS width, and coupling interval. Is there an association between a PVC anatomical location and new‐onset AF? Did participants with new AF and moderate to high burden of PVCs have monomorphic, or polymorphic PVCs? May there be a similar relationship with AF incidence? Although PVC anatomical location can be a point of debate among electrophysiologists, establishing a relationship between the risk of AF and PVC anatomical location would further risk stratify patients and may support screening decisions.

The authors looked at a cohort in the highest PVC burden group (defined as > 10 000 a day) that received successful catheter ablation, compared them with the index study cohort with the highest PVC burden, and found a trend in lower development of AF (not statistically significant). This raises the following important key question: Could PVCs be a modifiable risk factor for AF? The authors speculate that PVC ablation may be a possible adjuvant strategy for AF ablation, which could eliminate all potential AF triggers. Without a doubt, this statement begs further data and analysis. Yet, it may influence our use of continuous monitoring post AF ablation to screen for PVCs and may represent one missing piece of the AF ablation recurrence puzzle.

Fetal arrhythmia detection and monitoring — irregular rhythms and premature atrial contractions (PACs): Irregular or rapid heart rate in the fetus may signify arrhythmia and be associated with congenital heart disease or poor function, fetal echocardiography helps determine etiology, and in a series of 595 cases of fetal irregular rhythms, 2.4% presented with hemodynamically significant arrhythmias; PACs are common and usually benign, but serial weekly fetal doppler auscultation can identify intermittent SVT seen in 1–3% of fetuses and monitoring may be discontinued 1–2 weeks after arrhythmia resolution or until delivery.

### Ectopy on a single 12-lead ECG, incident cardiac myopathy, and death in the community [^1177L7kM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation and heart failure are 2 of the most common diseases, yet ready means to identify individuals at risk are lacking. The 12-lead ECG is one of the most accessible tests in medicine. Our objective was to determine whether a premature atrial contraction observed on a standard 12-lead ECG would predict atrial fibrillation and mortality and whether a premature ventricular contraction would predict heart failure and mortality.

Methods and Results

We utilized the CHS (Cardiovascular Health) Study, which followed 5577 participants for a median of 12 years, as the primary cohort. The ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), the replication cohort, captured data from 15 792 participants over a median of 22 years. In the CHS, multivariable analyses revealed that a baseline 12-lead ECG premature atrial contraction predicted a 60% increased risk of atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3–2.0; P < 0.001) and a premature ventricular contraction predicted a 30% increased risk of heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0–1.6; P = 0.021). In the negative control analyses, neither predicted incident myocardial infarction. A premature atrial contraction was associated with a 30% increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1–1.5; P = 0.008) and a premature ventricular contraction was associated with a 20% increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.3; P = 0.044). Similarly statistically significant results for each analysis were also observed in ARIC.

Conclusions

Based on a single standard ECG, a premature atrial contraction predicted incident atrial fibrillation and death and a premature ventricular contraction predicted incident heart failure and death, suggesting that this commonly used test may predict future disease.

### Relation of premature atrial complexes with stroke and death: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117N911C]. Clinical Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Frequent premature atrial complexes (PACs) are universal in the general population; however, their clinical significance is unclear. We hypothesize that frequent PACs are associated with increased risk of stroke and death. The PubMed (from 1966 to April 2017) and Embase (from 1974 to April 2017) databases were searched for longitudinal studies that reported the relation of PACs with incidence of stroke and death with various etiologies. Study quality was evaluated, and the relative risks (RR) of unfavorable outcomes in subjects with frequent PACs vs those without were calculated. Eleven studies with overall high quality were eligible according to inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis demonstrated that frequent PACs were associated with an increased risk of stroke (unadjusted RR: 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.79–2.70; adjusted RR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.25–1.60) and death from all causes (unadjusted RR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.80–2.63; adjusted RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.13–1.41), cardiovascular diseases (unadjusted RR: 2.89, 95% CI: 2.20–3.79; adjusted RR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.24–1.54), and coronary artery disease (unadjusted RR: 2.74, 95% CI: 1.64–4.58; adjusted RR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.27–2.37). No significant publication bias was detected. The association was robust in sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis, and pooled analysis of estimates adjusting for confounding factors. Frequent PACs are not benign phenomena; they are associated with higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. Further research on the optimal management of subjects with frequent PACs is urgently required.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^114Nbqvq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Premature cardiac contractions, otherwise known as atrial and ventricular ectopy, are common throughout the general population. 1, 2 Previously, these ectopic beats were believed to be harmless in the absence of known cardiovascular disease or symptoms; however, there is now evidence to indicate that premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. PACs are known to initiate paroxysms of atrial fibrillation (AF), and targeted ablation of ectopic foci in the atria can eliminate or significantly reduce AF recurrence. 3 In addition, we previously showed that the PAC count is a particularly useful predictor of incident AF in older adults, 4 and others have demonstrated that increased PACs in apparently healthy individuals are associated with incident AF, stroke, and death. 5 With regard to PVCs, the presence of even one PVC during a 2‐minute ECG has been associated with an increased risk of incident congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD) events, and CAD‐related death. 6, 7 Additionally, our group has previously demonstrated that a higher frequency of PVCs is associated with an increase in incident CHF and with increased mortality. 8 Furthermore, recent evidence from the electrophysiology laboratory has shown that eradication of PVCs via radiofrequency ablation among patients with idiopathic systolic heart failure can normalize ventricular function, suggesting that PVCs alone are sufficient to result in heart failure. 9

Triggers of AF — The atria of patients with AF tend to have both shorter effective refractory periods and slower conduction, which enhances dispersion of repolarization and favor reentry, and this substrate is sensitive to AF initiation frequently after premature atrial contractions (PACs); in a study of 100 patients undergoing PV isolation, PACs induced 41 episodes of AF in 22 patients, with most episodes originating in the PVs, and earlier studies reported an LA gradient of background potassium currents resulting in shorter LA than right atrial effective refractory period in patients with AF.

The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between residual premature atrial contractions (PACs) originating from non-pulmonary veins (PVs), which do not initiate atrial fibrillation (AF), and AF recurrence after ablation.

Background

Residual atrial ectopic beats that trigger AF from non-PVs (non-PV AF triggers) after catheter ablation are among the major causes of AF recurrence. However, little is known about the impact of non-PV PACs on AF recurrence.

Methods

This retrospective study included 565 consecutive patients who underwent first-time AF ablation at our institution. After PV isolation, we infused isoproterenol to provoke non-PV AF triggers and/or non-PV PACs. We excluded 26 patients with non-PV AF triggers and 3 patients who underwent ablation of non-PV PACs, and finally analyzed 536 patients. Non-PV PACs were defined as ectopic beats that were constantly observed with the same intra-atrial activation patterns from non-PVs.

Results

Residual non-PV PACs during the procedure were observed in 112 patients (21%). There was no significant difference in the AF recurrence rate between patients with non-PV PACs (35 of 112, 31%) and those without (145 of 424, 34%; log-rank p = 0.69), during a median follow-up of 670 days. Age- and sex-adjusted hazards for AF recurrence were also similar between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

The similar AF recurrence rate in patients with and without non-PV PACs suggests that the additional ablation of non-PV PACs has limited effect on AF recurrence.

### Ectopy on a single 12-lead ECG, incident cardiac myopathy, and death in the community [^115E9qd6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation and heart failure are 2 of the most common diseases, yet ready means to identify individuals at risk are lacking. The 12‐leadis one of the most accessible tests in medicine. Our objective was to determine whether a premature atrial contraction observed on a standard 12‐leadwould predict atrial fibrillation and mortality and whether a premature ventricular contraction would predict heart failure and mortality.

Methods and Results

We utilized the CHS (Cardiovascular Health) Study, which followed 5577 participants for a median of 12 years, as the primary cohort. The ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study), the replication cohort, captured data from 15 792 participants over a median of 22 years. In the, multivariable analyses revealed that a baseline 12‐leadpremature atrial contraction predicted a 60% increased risk of atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio, 1.6; 95%1.3–2.0; P < 0.001) and a premature ventricular contraction predicted a 30% increased risk of heart failure (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95%, 1.0–1.6; P = 0.021). In the negative control analyses, neither predicted incident myocardial infarction. A premature atrial contraction was associated with a 30% increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.3; 95%1.1–1.5; P = 0.008) and a premature ventricular contraction was associated with a 20% increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95%1.0–1.3; P = 0.044). Similarly statistically significant results for each analysis were also observed in.

Conclusions

Based on a single standard, a premature atrial contraction predicted incident atrial fibrillation and death and a premature ventricular contraction predicted incident heart failure and death, suggesting that this commonly used test may predict future disease.

### Ectopy on a single 12-lead ECG, incident cardiac myopathy, and death in the community [^117834mm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) remain 2 of the most common cardiovascular diseases, each affecting millions of individuals and contributing to significant morbidity and mortality, 1 yet available treatments remain suboptimal. 1, 2 Identification of high‐risk groups and strategies to facilitate primary prevention of AF and HF using widely accessible methods are critical. 3, 4

Recent studies using wearable continuous Holter monitoring have shown that frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) are associated with AF, stroke, and mortality. 5, 6 Similarly, frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) quantified by Holter studies are associated with incident HF and mortality. 7, 8 Given evidence that successful ablation of PACs can eradicate AF 9 and that successful ablation of frequent PVCs can normalize systolic dysfunction, 10, 11 experts in the field now refer to ectopy as a cause of myopathy. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

The standard 12‐lead ECG is the most widely used cardiac diagnostic test and is less expensive and burdensome for patients than wearable recording devices. Previous studies investigating the association between ectopic beats and incident disease have relied on quantifying the number of ectopic beats using long‐term ECG monitoring. 5, 6, 7, 17 We sought to investigate whether atrial or ventricular ectopy on a single, standard 10‐second 12‐lead ECG is associated with an increased risk of incident AF, HF, and mortality in 2 large, prospective cohort studies.

### Diagnostic evaluation of patients with palpitations… [^1161S74t]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Heart palpitations are often described by patients in a variety of ways, including sensations of "flip-flopping" or a rapid "fluttering" in the chest. Some people report a "pounding" in the neck. This sensation is most typical of a reentrant supraventricular arrhythmia. Idiopathic ventricular tachycardias occur during periods of catecholamine excess, such as during exercise or emotional stress. This disorder often presents during the second or third decades of life as palpitations, dizziness or syncope. In patients with atrioventricular nodal tachycardia, the onset of symptoms may occur when they stand up straight after bending over, and symptoms often end when they lie down. Patients who experience dizziness, presyncope or true syncope often have a supraventricular arrhythmia. Their symptoms are caused by acute vasodilation, a rapid heart rate with low cardiac output, or both.

The physician may ask the patient to tap out the rhythm with his or her fingers, as it is critical that the patient give a detailed description of the symptoms. Providing examples of various cardiac rhythms to the patient is sometimes helpful. Palpitations described as abrupt in onset and termination are often caused by ventricular or supraventricular tachycardias. It is unlikely that the physician will examine a patient during an episode of palpitations. Consequently, the cardiac examination should focus on detecting abnormalities such as the midsystolic click of mitral valve prolapse. Virtually every type of arrhythmia has been described with this disorder, and many patients have premature atrial or ventricular contractions. A holosystolic murmur heard along the left sternal border that increases when the Valsalva maneuver is performed suggests hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Atrial fibrillation is a common cause of palpitations in patients with this disorder.

The authors have found that most outpatients evaluated for palpitations have a benign cause and will not require an extensive evaluation or medical treatment. In the few patients who need pharmacotherapy, the preferred treatment options are beta blockers or calcium channel blockers. Other antiarrhythmic medications are usually avoided because of the associated risks of proarrhythmia. Most patients found to have a supraventricular arrhythmia can be cured with radio-frequency ablation.

### Premature cardiac contractions and risk of incident ischemic stroke [^117162nJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The etiologies of ischemic stroke remain undetermined in 15% to 40% of patients. Apart from atrial fibrillation, other arrhythmias are less well-characterized as risk factors. Premature cardiac contractions are known to confer long-term cardiovascular risks, like myocardial infarction. Ischemic stroke as cardiovascular risk outcome remains a topic of interest. We examined the prospective relationships in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, to determine whether premature atrial (PAC) or ventricular (PVC) contractions are associated with increased risk for incident ischemic stroke.

Methods and Results

We analyzed 14 493 baseline stroke-free middle-aged individuals in the ARIC public-use data. The presence of PAC or PVC at baseline was assessed from 2-minute electrocardiogram. A physician-panel confirmed and classified all stroke cases. Average follow-up time was 13 years. Proportional hazards models assessed associations between premature contractions and incident stroke. PACs and PVCs were identified in 717 (4.9%) and 793 (5.5%) participants, respectively. In all, 509(3.5%) participants developed ischemic stroke. The hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) associated with PVC was 1.77 (1.30, 2.41), attenuated to 1.25 (0.91, 1.71) after adjusting for baseline stroke risk factors. The interaction between PVC and baseline hypertension was marginally significant (P = 0.08). Among normotensives, having PVCs was associated with nearly 2-fold increase in the rate of incident ischemic stroke (HR 1.69; 95% CI 1.02, 2.78), adjusting for stroke risk factors. The adjusted risk of ischemic stroke associated with PACs was 1.30 (95% CI 0.92, 1.83).

Conclusions

Presence of PVCs may indicate an increased risk of ischemic stroke, especially in normotensives. This risk approximates risk of stroke from being black, male, or obese in normotensives from this cohort.

### Premature ventricular contractions and atrial fibrillation: the Reunion of distant relatives? [^111R9KeC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Although the authors should be commended for their work, there are some important limitations and with most studies showing intriguing results, some important hypothesis‐generating questions.

The authors chose to define their PVC burden as low PVC burden as < 1000/d and moderate‐to‐high PVC burden as > 1000/d. Quantification of PVCs was evaluated with 24‐hour Holter 3‐channel ECG monitoring, and the indications for monitoring were report of palpitations, a clinical diagnosis of any arrhythmia, or transient loss of consciousness. First, previous literature has shown notable daily variation in PVC burden and demonstrated that up to 6 days of continuous monitoring is more accurate than the traditional 24‐hour Holter monitor. Additionally, continuous monitoring allows clinicians to establish the percentage of PVCs over the total sinus beats during a given timeline. Second, by dichotomizing the PVC groups, the authors categorize the moderate and high group as > 1000, which correlates with ≥ 1% burden. In fact, the overall mean burden was 4.6% (highest seen was 11.2%) in the moderate/high burden group and almost zero PVCs in the low burden group with a range of 1 to 30 PVCs seen and a mean burden of 0.01%. This would suggest that the low group was an "extremely low‐almost zero" PVCs group and the moderate to high group was a more "intermediate" group as most "high" PVCs are usually defined > 15 000 to 20 000 in the literature. This level of PVC burden would be much lower than the perceived risk of developing cardiomyopathy (24+%) and most falling in the < 10% burden, which rarely leads to cardiomyopathy. This would suggest that the number of PVCs needed to increase the risk of AF is a more intermediate range and needs to be prospectively validated in a new cohort. Correspondingly, alternative explanations need to be entertained regarding the potential mechanisms by which PVCs increase the risk of AF. As described in previous literature, one would not expect many patients with this PVC burden range to develop a cardiomyopathy. Additionally, more research into the pro‐arrhythmogenic retrograde activation of the atria, a phenomenon rarely discussed in electrophysiology articles, as well as confounding genetic influences leading to increased risk in both arrhythmias, is needed to better understand the mechanism between PVCs and AF.

### Evaluation and management of premature ventricular complexes [^113zYsFi]. Circulation (2020). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are extremely common, found in the majority of individuals undergoing long-term ambulatory monitoring. Increasing age, a taller height, a higher blood pressure, a history of heart disease, performance of less physical activity, and smoking each predict a greater PVC frequency. Although the fundamental causes of PVCs remain largely unknown, potential mechanisms for any given PVC include triggered activity, automaticity, and reentry. PVCs are commonly asymptomatic but can also result in palpitations, dyspnea, presyncope, and fatigue. The history, physical examination, and 12-lead ECG are each critical to the diagnosis and evaluation of a PVC. An echocardiogram is indicated in the presence of symptoms or particularly frequent PVCs, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is helpful when the evaluation suggests the presence of associated structural heart disease. Ambulatory monitoring is required to assess PVC frequency. The prognosis of those with PVCs is variable, with ongoing uncertainty regarding the most informative predictors of adverse outcomes. An increased PVC frequency may be a risk factor for heart failure and death, and the resolution of systolic dysfunction after successful catheter ablation of PVCs demonstrates that a causal relationship can be present. Patients with no or mild symptoms, a low PVC burden, and normal ventricular function may be best served with simple reassurance. Either medical treatment or catheter ablation are considered first-line therapies in most patients with PVCs associated with symptoms or a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, and patient preference plays a role in determining which to try first. If medical treatment is selected, either β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reasonable drugs in patients with normal ventricular systolic function. Other antiarrhythmic drugs should be considered if those initial drugs fail and ablation has been declined, has been unsuccessful, or has been deemed inappropriate. Catheter ablation is the most efficacious approach to eradicate PVCs but may confer increased upfront risks. Original research remains necessary to identify individuals at risk for PVC-induced cardiomyopathy and to identify preventative and therapeutic approaches targeting the root causes of PVCs to maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk.

### Arrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy: JACC state-of-the-art review [^111wdK2k]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmias frequently accompany heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction. Tachycardias, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions can induce a reversible form of dilated cardiomyopathy (CM) known as arrhythmia-induced CM (AiCM). The intriguing question is why certain individuals are more susceptible to AiCM, despite similar arrhythmia burdens. The primary challenge is determining the extent of arrhythmias' contribution to left ventricular systolic dysfunction. AiCM should be considered in patients with a mean heart rate of > 100 beats/min, atrial fibrillation, or a PVC burden of > 10%. Confirmation of AiCM occurs when CM reverses upon eliminating the responsible arrhythmia. Therapy choice depends on the specific arrhythmia, patient comorbidities, and preferences. After left ventricular function is restored, ongoing follow-up is essential if an abnormal myocardial substrate persists. Accurate diagnosis and treatment of AiCM have the potential to enhance patients' quality of life, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce hospital admissions and overall health care costs.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Premature atrial contractions (PACs) and non‑sustained atrial tachyarrhythmias — symptom burden and prognosis: PACs are common and may be completely unrecognized, and the proportion with symptoms is unknown; most trials assessed PAC burden rather than symptom status, and some individuals (including after AF and SVT ablations) may have heightened awareness. The formerly common view that PACs are benign has changed; frequent PACs or short runs may predict development of atrial tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (AF). In the Copenhagen Holter Study of healthy middle aged adults with 48‑h Holter data, 15% had excessive supraventricular ectopy defined as 30 PACs or more per hour, and after a median 6.3 years this was associated with increased risk of death or stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03–2.60; P < 0.036) and admissions for AF (HR 2.78, 95% CI 1.08–6.99; P < 0.033).

### High burden of premature ventricular complex increases the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation [^111JwV1G]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Possible Mechanisms of Premature Ventricular Complex‐Induced Atrial Fibrillations

We postulated several mechanisms that can lead to a PVC‐induced AF. First, a high PVC burden has been shown to contribute to PVC‐induced cardiomyopathy, and HF causes AF. AF is the most common type of arrhythmia in patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. The prevalence of AF increased as the severity of HF increased, reaching 49.8% in patients with severe HF with reduced ejection fraction with a New York Heart Association functional class IV. Common structural changes in HF, including pressure and volume overload, result in tissue stretch with a shorter atrial refractory period and longer atrial conduction time, leading to atrial chamber enlargement and arrhythmogenesis in the atrium and predisposition to the development of AF. In addition, neurohormonal activation in HF also affects the synthesis and degradation of the atrial extracellular matrix, resulting in atrial tissue fibrosis, which leads to the development and maintenance of AF. Second, evidence and mechanism of PVC‐induced AF can be directly observed in intracardiac tracing. PVC‐associated atrial activation by either retrograde atrioventricular nodal or accessory pathway conduction has been reported to trigger AF. In patients with an implantable device, retrograde atrial activation induced by PVC during the postventricular atrial refractory period and subsequent atrial pacing also resulted in a long–short sequence and induced AF. Thus, PVC ablation may be a possible adjuvant strategy for AF ablation that could eliminate all potential AF triggers. Based on the evidence provided here, it is reasonable to suggest that patients with a high PVC burden may have a higher risk of new‐onset AF.

### Device-based longitudinal monitoring of premature atrial contractions before atrial fibrillation onset [^111iKp1M]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Frequent premature atrial complexes (PACs) are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF); however, the temporal PAC frequency pattern preceding AF onset remains unclear.

Objective

To evaluate whether PAC frequency increases before AF onset using long-term monitoring data from cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).

Methods

This retrospective study had two phases. Phase 1: A total of 101 patients with Boston Scientific CIEDs (mean follow-up 5.2 years) were divided into two groups: 48 who developed AF (age 68 ± 15 years) and 53 who did not (age 65 ± 15 years). AF was defined as any episode lasting > 5.5 minutes. Daily PAC counts were derived from remote monitoring and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis identified a threshold predictive of AF onset. Phase 2: In patients who developed AF, PAC frequency was compared across three time points: 1year before AF onset, at onset, and 1year after onset.

Results

In Phase 1, median PAC count was significantly higher in AF group than in non-AF group (172.5 vs. 21.1 PACs/day; p < 0.0001). A threshold of 31.8 PACs/day effectively ruled out AF presence (area under the curve 0.828; positive predictive value 71%, negative predictive value 97%). In Phase 2, PAC frequency increased by 63% in the year preceding AF onset (105.7 to 172.5/day; p = 0.04) and remained elevated in the following year (p = 0.52).

Conclusions

In our population of patients with CIEDs, those who developed AF had higher PAC frequencies, with a marked increase in the year before onset. A PAC burden below 31.8 PACs/day was rarely associated with future AF.

### Large-scale screening studies for atrial fibrillation-is it worth the effort? [^115p1cSb]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Distribution of screening yield in a population of 1000 individuals, a undetected disease prevalence of 5% and a sensitivity and specificity of both 95%.

One could speculate that many of the patients being falsely diagnosed with AF during screening, particularly when using one‐lead ECG recordings, have an excess of premature atrial contractions (PACs) and/or short runs of PACs. Excess of PACs and runs of PACs are associated with an increased risk for incident AF, stroke and mortality [39, 40, 41. Thus, one could further speculate that individuals falsely diagnosed with AF due to supraventricular activity could have some benefit from OAC treatment, but there are no prospective trials yet on the benefit of OAC on this indication.

The diagnostic performance of several newer ECG recording devices has been reported [37]. However, these validation studies are mostly performed in an office setting – compared to the gold standard of 12‐lead ECG. In most cases, this setting does not resemble the actual screening setting in which participants are expected to record multiple intermittent ECG recordings or a continuous ECG recording in an ambulatory setting. Furthermore, patients diagnosed with AF in screening studies using long‐term ECG often have multiple paroxysmal AF episodes [3, 42, which should increase the diagnostic accuracy. The true diagnostic performance of newer ECG devices during ambulatory use is therefore partly unknown, as most detected cases of AF are paroxysmal and comparison with the gold standard of 12‐lead ECG in this setting is not possible.

### Outpatient approach to palpitations [^114D8G6o]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common problem seen in family medicine; most are of cardiac origin, although an underlying psychiatric disorder, such as anxiety, is also common. Even if a psychiatric comorbidity does exist, it should not be assumed that palpitations are of a noncardiac etiology. Discerning cardiac from noncardiac causes is important given the potential risk of sudden death in those with an underlying cardiac etiology. History and physical examination followed by targeted diagnostic testing are necessary to distinguish a cardiac cause from other causes of palpitations. Standard 12-lead electrocardiography is an essential initial diagnostic test. Cardiac imaging is recommended if history, physical examination, or electrocardiography suggests structural heart disease. An intermittent event (loop) monitor is preferred for documenting cardiac arrhythmias, particularly when they occur infrequently. Ventricular and atrial premature contractions are common cardiac causes of palpitations; prognostic significance is dictated by the extent of underlying structural heart disease. Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia resulting in hospitalization; such patients are at increased risk of stroke. Patients with supraventricular tachycardia, long QT syndrome, ventricular tachycardia, or palpitations associated with syncope should be referred to a cardiologist.

### Prevalence of frequent premature ventricular contractions and left-ventricular systolic dysfunction in patients receiving holter monitoring [^111pCkdk]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

Arrhythmias (i.e. PVCs, atrial fibrillation, and PVCs) have emerged as a frequent cause of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and heart failure.PVC‐CM is primarily characterized by LV systolic dysfunction, LV dilatation, eccentric hypertrophy, electrophysiological remodeling and interstitial fibrosis. Oftentimes, frequent, or high burden PVCs are either underdiagnosed or disregarded as the culprit of cardiomyopathy. In this context, understanding the prevalence and coexistence of these two conditions (frequent/high PVC burden and LV systolic dysfunction) in patients receiving ambulatory Holter monitors would help clinicians to understand the potential relevance and promote their detection and further work‐up. Moreover, it provides the needed background to launch further clinical trials of PVCs with and without LV dysfunction.

Our study found that frequent (> 5%) and high‐burden (> 10%) PVCs are often present in patients (9% and 5%, respectively; Table 1) undergoing ambulatory ECG monitoring and those with LV systolic dysfunction (26% and 16%, respectively; Table 2). Males have a higher prevalence of frequent PVCs (> 5% burden) than females, even among those with LV systolic dysfunction. Nonetheless, 15% of males and 21% of females in our study did not have LVEF assessment to rule out PVC‐CM despite a documented high‐burden PVCs (> 10%). While the mechanism(s) of PVC‐CM are being elucidated, the diagnosis of PVC‐CM can be confirmed only when PVC suppression is achieved and LV function restored.

### Reasons for loss of cardiac resynchronization therapy pacing: insights from 32 844 patients [^1135gP5p]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is associated with the amount of CRT pacing delivered. The specific causes of CRT pacing loss and their relative frequencies remain poorly defined.

Methods and Results

CRT patients who transmitted device data from 2006 to 2011 were screened for inclusion. Device diagnostics were analyzed using an automated algorithm to categorize CRT loss into 10 different causes. The algorithm was validated against manual adjudications using a portion of the entire cohort. There were 80 768 patients analyzed with a median time of 594 (interquartile range, 294–1003) days from implant to time of analysis. In this cohort, 40.7% of patients had < 98% pacing, and 11.5% of patients had < 90% pacing. For patients with < 98% pacing, device diagnostics explained 55.8% of pacing loss: 30.6% atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation; 16.6% premature ventricular contractions; and 8.6% captured as episodes with at least 10 consecutive beats of CRT loss (ventricular sensing episodes). Inappropriately programmed sensed and paced atrioventricular (AV) intervals (SAV/PAV) accounted for 34.5% of all ventricular sensing episodes. As the severity of CRT loss increased, the contribution of atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation and SAV/PAV to the loss increased. Atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation accounted for > 50% and premature ventricular contractions accounted for < 10% of CRT loss in those with < 90% CRT pacing.

Conclusions

CRT pacing < 98% was observed in 40.7% of patients. Among those with suboptimal pacing, atrial tachycardia/atrial fibrillation was the most common reason for CRT pacing loss. Inappropriately programmed SAV/PAV intervals was the most common reason for episodes of sustained loss of CRT pacing. This information can help in defining more effective treatments to improve CRT delivery.

### Evaluation and management of arrhythmia in the athletic patient [^117NF1B7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Athletes may present with palpitations, syncope, or arrest resulting in the diagnosis of arrhythmia, or screening may result in diagnosis of conditions with predisposition to arrhythmia. This chapter focuses on 3 common arrhythmic conditions in athletes-atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), and the athlete with an implanted device. (1) Atrial fibrillation: most studies show that atrial fibrillation is more common in competitive athletes, particularly those participating in long-term endurance sports. Postulated mechanisms include morphologic changes such as atrial dilatation, autonomic changes such as increased vagal tone, or inflammatory changes due to sports participation. Treatment options include long-term antiarrhythmic agents, "pill in the pocket" medications, or radiofrequency ablation, a highly successful procedure in athletes. (2) Premature ventricular contractions: data conflict on whether the incidence of PVCs is increased in highly trained individuals. Very frequent PVCs in athletes, however, can be a manifestation of underlying heart disease, and athletes presenting with PVCs should undergo evaluation. In the absence of underlying heart disease, PVCs do not carry a poor prognosis, and US guidelines do not recommend restriction from sports. (3) Implanted devices: the safety of sports for the athlete with an implanted device is unknown, and current guidelines recommend against participation in vigorous competitive sports, based on postulated risks including failure to defibrillate and risk of injury. Many athletes with defibrillators and pacemakers do participate in sports. Ongoing research will better delineate the risks of sports for the athlete with an implanted device.

### Characteristics of ectopic triggers associated with paroxysmal and persistent atrial fibrillation: evidence for a changing role [^117C8HXm]. Heart Rhythm (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial premature contractions (APCs) are well described to precede the initiation of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (pAF). However, whether APC characteristics alter with progression of the arrhythmia is unknown.

Objective

To determine the APC characteristics in terms of burden and relative coupling interval with progression of the AF disease process.

Methods

Fifty consecutive patients with pAF, 50 consecutive patients with persistent AF (perAF), and 25 age-matched controls underwent clinical review, transthoracic echocardiography, and ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring. After excluding 29 patients who had AF for the entire recording (n = 24) or unreliable recordings (n = 5), we analyzed data from 49 patients with pAF, 24 patients with perAF, and 23 healthy controls. All normal morphology R-R intervals with a > 25% decrease in R-R coupling compared with the previous R-R interval (coupling interval index) were deemed APCs (n = 95,873).

Results

The median APC burden was higher in patients with pAF (2 [1–22] APCs/h; P = 0.004) and perAF (3 [1–6] APCs/h; P = 0.04) than in controls (1 [0–1] APCs/h) but was not different (P = 0.66) between the AF subgroups. Patients with pAF had a distinct increase in ectopy burden after 7 PM and elevation throughout the night (P = 0.002) in comparison with a blunted and complementary temporal response in the perAF cohort (P = 0.01). Patients with pAF demonstrated a greater proportion of shortly coupled APCs (29% [13–45]; P = 0.04) compared with persistent arrhythmia (17% [5–29]).

Conclusions

"Real-life" atrial trigger statistics of APC burden, timing, and diurnal rhythms track the transition from a trigger-based, autonomically sensitive paroxysmal arrhythmia to a more substrate-based persistent disease.

Atrial arrhythmias in pregnancy — evaluation and common types are described: Atrial arrhythmias that cause palpitations are a common indication for cardiac evaluation during pregnancy, and any pregnant woman who presents with an arrhythmia should undergo evaluation to assess the cause and the possibility of underlying structural heart disease. The most common arrhythmias during pregnancy are premature atrial beats and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, usually atrioventricular-nodal reentrant tachycardia that can be successfully treated with medication. Atrial fibrillation and flutter during pregnancy often occur in women with structural heart disease, and management is individualized depending on the effect of the arrhythmia and the presence of underlying cardiac disease.

### Practice advisory update summary: patent foramen ovale and secondary stroke prevention: report of the guideline subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1141qquq]. Neurology (2020). High credibility.

Practice recommendations — Recommendation 1 rationale (workup and competing causes): The randomized PFO closure trials mandated thorough pre-enrollment assessments including CT angiography (CTA) or MR angiography (MRA) of the head and neck, hypercoagulable screening in many, and required transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to characterize the PFO and ensure it was the most likely etiology for the index event. There is accumulating evidence that occult atrial fibrillation accounts for a meaningful portion of cryptogenic stroke; none of the PFO closure trials required prolonged monitoring before enrollment, and atrial fibrillation is strongly correlated with increasing age and is unlikely to occur in patients aged < 60 years. Clinical factors that may increase suspicion for atrial fibrillation include systemic hypertension, diabetes, alcohol abuse, cigarette smoking, elevated NT-proBNP, frequent premature atrial contractions, and increased P-wave dispersion on ECG. PFO is highly prevalent, found in approximately 25% of the general adult population on agitated saline TEE and cadaver studies.

The low frequency of spontaneous premature atrial contractions (PACs) may be an impediment to mapping and ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF). It has been shown that PACs following external or internal cardioversion of AF can initiate AF. If this method could reproducibly induce PACs from the same location as spontaneous PACs, it would be clinically significant. High-resolution noncontact mapping can map a single beat, should help identify the sites of spontaneously occurring PACs and PACs induced following cardioversion of spontaneous or induced AF, and could help correlate the trigger sites for AF induction.

Methods and Results

Twelve patients (8 men and 4 women; mean age 49 ± 10 years) with spontaneous PACs were included in the study. In all patients, AF was induced and subsequently cardioverted to assess and map isolated PACs or PACs that induced AF. Using the EnSite 3000 noncontact mapping system, mapping was performed of spontaneously occurring isolated PACs and PACs that induced AF and PACs (both with and without AF) that occurred on at least two different occasions following cardioversion. The locations of the spontaneous and the induced PACs were similar; 97% of induced PACs came from the same locations as those of spontaneous PACs (P = 0.5). Radiofrequency lesions guided by this mapping technique were delivered at 14 pulmonary vein sites. Following a single ablation attempt during a mean follow-up of 19 ± 4 weeks, 42% of the patients were in sinus rhythm and drug-free, whereas an additional 24% of patients could be maintained in sinus rhythm on drugs that had failed before.

Conclusion

There is a high degree of correlation between spontaneous and induced PACs as the trigger sites for AF initiation. Cardioversion of spontaneous or induced AF could be used as an electrophysiologic parameter for guiding therapy.

### Guidelines and recommendations for performance of the fetal echocardiogram: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography [^114AGv7U]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2023). High credibility.

Fetal echocardiography — premature atrial contractions (PACs) produce irregular rhythms with conducted and nonconducted forms identifiable on Doppler; umbilical artery/vein tracings may show conducted and nonconducted PACs in the same patient, with normal atrioventricular (AV) conduction where a premature atrial event is followed by a related premature ventricular event, and with premature PACs failing to conduct across a refractory AV node leading to no ventricular activation, temporary venous flow reversal due to atrial contraction against a closed tricuspid valve, and a long pause due to lack of conduction. In frequent PACs, umbilical artery Doppler can show an irregular rhythm with an average rate of about 120 beats/min, and left ventricular (LV) inflow–outflow Doppler can demonstrate frequent conducted PACs alternating with normal sinus beats in a pattern of bigeminy.

PACs and the Need for Cardiac Pacing

To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the relationship between PACs and risk of PPM implantation. This study is the first to report that an elevated PAC burden is associated with an increment in the incidence of PPM implantation after adjusting for potential confounding factors. In the subgroup analysis, the presence of frequent PACs was significantly associated with PPM implantation for sick sinus syndrome involving long pause and tachy-brady syndrome, as well as high-degree atrioventricular block. However, the mechanism for the association between PACs and cardiac conduction system dysfunction was unclear. Frequent atrial stimulation might cause atrial substrate remodeling near the sinus nodal area, causing dysfunction of the sinus node.–AF could cause profound electrophysiological and structural remodeling of the atrioventricular node. These findings suggest that frequent PACs might mimic, at least in part, the pathophysiology of AF in the human heart and contribute to sinus and, possibly, atrioventricular node dysfunction.–

Patients with symptomatic PACs were more likely to receive β-blockers for symptom control. β-blockade could slow the heart rate and disturb cardiac conduction, thereby increasing the risk of sick sinus syndrome and heart block. A complex and cyclic relationship could exist between frequent PACs and cardiac conduction disturbance. For example, isolated atrioventricular block has been associated with the development of ectopic beats and tachyarrhythmia, whereas symptomatic sinus node dysfunction has been associated with abnormal atrioventricular node conduction. This crosstalk could potentially explain the deterioration of cardiac conduction in patients with frequent PACs.

PACS: A Marker of the General Conduction?

In our study, patients with frequent PACs were generally older. Cardiac arrhythmia and cardiac rhythm disturbances are frequently found in elderly people as a result of degenerative changes and/or comorbidities. Although we tried to show significant differences in prevalence for most comorbidities, our study could be underpowered to disclose all possible comorbidities. Frequent PACs might be a marker of an underdiagnosed physical condition that can lead to adverse outcomes, including mortality, hospitalization, and PPM implantation. Furthermore, in the elderly, arrhythmias are a significant cause of falls, physical disability, and frequent hospital visits, which would make subsequent hospitalization, sinus and atrioventricular node dysfunction, and AF episodes easier to detect than in younger (healthier) subjects.

### Association of premature ventricular complexes and risk of ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111JJVhz]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The current study is the first systematic review and meta‐analysis that summarized data from all available studies on the risk of ischemic stroke among patients with PVCs and found about 30% excess risk compared to individuals without PVCs. There are possible mechanisms to explain this observed increased risk.

The first possible explanation is that PVCs are associated with the development of ventricular cardiomyopathy. 21 PVCs can lead to reduced expression of calcium channel, voltage‐dependent, L‐type, alpha 1C subunit (Cav1.2), density of L‐type calcium (I CaL) current, and relocated Cav1.2 away from t‐tubules in the ventricular myocardium which would subsequently lead to abnormal calcium‐induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. 22 In the event of long‐term frequent PVCs, this process may eventually lead to cardiac remodelings such as apoptosis of myocardial cells and fibrosis, resulting in permanent structural changes of the ventricle. 16, 23, 24 One of the frequent structural changes seen in patients with ventricular cardiomyopathy is ventricular dilatation, which is known to provoke the stasis of blood flow, increased risk of thrombus formation, and embolism. 25, 26 Due to the unique hemodynamic changes occurring in patients with PVCs, irregular ventricular rhythm as well as variable coupling intervals can also cause stasis of blood flow and promote thrombus formation in the left atrial appendage. 27 Moreover, the ventricular contraction from PVCs could not provide an effective cardiac output as a result of mechanical ventricular dyssynchrony. This leads to a transient decline in arterial blood pressure which could deteriorate the regionally and globally cerebral circulation. 28, 29, 30

The second explanation is the increased risk of subsequent AF, the prime predisposing of thromboembolic events. 7, 17, 26, 31 Frequent PVCs may not only lead to ventricular cardiomyopathy but also atrial cardiomyopathy as well. This could be from an indirect consequence of ventricular dysfunction as it could increase atrial pressure and volume overload. This ultimately results in myocardial stretching and development of fibrosis in the atrial walls. 32 Therefore, atrial fibrosis resulting from atrial remodeling can lead to conduction abnormalities to sustain AF. 33 However, this hypothesis is somewhat speculative as most studies did not provide any information on the timing of the onset of AF. Thus, it could not draw the exact association between PVCs, AF, and ischemic stroke. On the other hand, most studies just reported the incidence of new‐onset AF at the end of follow‐up. 7, 17, 26, 31

### Cardiovascular function and treatment in β-thalassemia major: a consensus statement from the American Heart Association [^111FgfyW]. Circulation (2013). Medium credibility.

β-thalassemia major — arrhythmias and management — atrial iron cannot be measured by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), but atrial arrhythmia risk correlates with ventricular T2✱ estimates, and intra‑atrial reentrant tachycardia and atrial fibrillation (AF) are the most common serious rhythm disturbances; amiodarone is often successful in controlling atrial arrhythmias and therapy can often be terminated successfully after 6 to 12 months; ablation should be reserved for patients who have undergone successful removal of cardiac iron (documented by CMR); ventricular arrhythmias are more specific for iron cardiotoxicity, and while frequent premature ventricular contractions alone are not specific, couplets, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or mixtures of frequent atrial and ventricular premature contractions should raise clinical suspicion; historically, sudden death accounts for ≈5% of cardiac deaths in TM; for severe cardiac iron burdens, device therapy should be avoided if possible and a defibrillation vest may represent a viable therapeutic bridge during intensive iron chelation therapy.

Premature atrial contraction (PAC) burden — observational risk and monitoring thresholds indicate that in a cohort with a median follow-up of 14.4 years, excessive atrial ectopic activity was associated with a two-fold increase in the adjusted risk of stroke, and less than 15% had prior atrial fibrillation (AF); in those with excessive atrial ectopic activity and CHA2DS2-VASc ≥ 2, annual stroke risk was 2.4% per year. In Holter data from 1260 people without previously known AF, doubling the hourly PAC count was associated with a 17% increase in AF risk (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.13–1.22) and a 6% increase in overall mortality (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03–1.09). For burden assessment, a 24-h Holter monitor is the 'gold standard'; excessive ectopic activity has been defined as > 500 PACs/day, and the probability of AF increased from less than 9% with PACs burden < 100/24 h to over 40% with PACs burden > 1500/24 h.

### Atrial ectopy as a mediator of the association between race and atrial fibrillation [^111vwJDT]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Blacks have a lower risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) despite having more AF risk factors, but the mechanism remains unknown. Premature atrial contraction (PAC) burden is a recently identified risk factor for AF.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the burden of PACs explains racial differences in AF risk.

Methods

PAC burden (number per hour) was assessed by 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring in a randomly selected subset of patients in the Cardiovascular Health Study. Participants were followed prospectively for the development of AF, diagnosed by study ECG and hospital admission records.

Results

Among 938 participants (median age 73 years; 34% black; 58% female), 206 (22%) developed AF over a median follow-up of 11.0 years (interquartile range 6.1–13.4). After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, coronary disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and study site, black race was associated with a 42% lower risk of AF (hazard ratio 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40–0.85; P = 0.005). The baseline PAC burden was 2.10 times (95% CI 1.57–2.83; P < .001) higher in whites than blacks. There was no detectable difference in premature ventricular contraction (PVC) burden by race. PAC burden mediated 19.5% (95% CI 6.3–52.5) of the adjusted association between race and AF.

Conclusion

On average, whites exhibited more PACs than blacks, and this difference statistically explains a modest proportion of the differential risk of AF by race. The differential PAC burden, without differences in PVCs, by race suggests that identifiable common exposures or genetic influences might be important to atrial pathophysiology.

### Guidelines for reporting articles on psychiatry and heart rate variability (GRAPH): recommendations to advance research communication [^112qVMWi]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Although even one misidentified beat can have a considerable influence on HRV calculation, there is no consensus or absolute criteria for defining atrial premature contraction or VPCs via algorithm. Accordingly, manual inspection of the ECG trace is needed for non-sinus beat identification. Many software packages attempt to make their own corrections from R–R intervals, not from identifying incorrect ECG signals. Atrial premature contractions and VPCs are relatively common; a few percent in a healthy population, a higher percentage in an athletic population, and higher still in some cardiac conditions. However, many papers do not seem to have any corrections or removals at all or omit these details entirely.

Correcting these artifacts assumes only that the directly affected beats are problematic. However, a further concern exists if VPCs are the source of heart rate turbulence, in which a non-sinus beat causes subsequent short-term R–R changes. In healthy people, the compensatory pause after a VPC is followed by brief R–R interval acceleration, and then R–R interval deceleration. This pattern is not observed in high-risk patients, with decreased deceleration speed (that is, turbulence slope) shown to be a powerful predictor of mortality. It is thought that heart rate turbulence has a baroreflex origin, whereby a VPC causes a brief drop in blood pressure, leading to baroreceptor inhibition of vagal input, which leads to a brief increase in heart rate. Careful inspection of the ECG signal can help both identify ectopy, as this can occur without artifact, and any subsequent heart rate turbulence. Visual inspection can also help identify artifacts that can be missed with commonly used filter thresholds. For example, people with extremely high or low HRV can have normal sinus beats misidentified as ectopic beats. Thresholds can also be adapted depending on the population.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG interpretation are described as follows: First-degree atrioventricular block is each P wave conducted with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II, where Mobitz I follows gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG will show group beating due to "dropped" QRS complexes. Atrioventricular block with only 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted without complete loss of atrioventricular conduction, and high-degree atrioventricular block is generally considered to be intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and may be paroxysmal or persistent with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism, and complete atrioventricular block may be imputed in atrial fibrillation (AF) when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the ECG is required because a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may not be present when atrial and ventricular rates are similar (isorhythmic dissociation) or when the atrial rate is slower than the ventricular rate from sinus bradycardia with an accelerated junctional rhythm; in atrial bigeminy premature atrial contractions can lead to an erroneous diagnosis, and in unusual circumstances a vagal etiology may be considered especially when the QRS in narrow.

Data cleaning and analysis

IBI calculation

Identifying IBIs is computationally straightforward; the Pan-Tompkins algorithm, where the raw ECG signal is bandpassed, differentiated, squared, integrated and smoothed to isolate R-waves, was developed over 30 years ago and remains a common and effective processing method. After peak detection is achieved, most frequency domain analysis methods resample the RR series into an evenly sampled time series (typically between 1 and 10 Hz). Different resampling rates may affect equivalent frequency transforms; however, this usually is not profound as long as researchers satisfy the Nyquist criterion.

Several sources of artifact that may affect the frequency bands of interest are common. The main sources of contamination include powerline interference (at 50 or 60Hz depending on the nature of local AC power), muscle contraction or movement artifacts, and baseline drift. The occurrence of one or more of these in any given data set is almost certain, but may be highly variable; therefore, filtering of data for artifacts should be clearly noted in manuscripts along with whether beat detection was visually inspected as some systems (predominately clinically oriented suites) do not provide this facility. To aid future analysis, the raw signal should be recorded without online filtering during data acquisition, if possible.

Non-sinus beat/arrhythmia identification

A central premise of HRV is that IBIs approximate SA node-firing patterns, otherwise known as normal sinus rhythm. Accordingly, a fiducial point that does not originate from the SA node (that is, a non-sinus beat) does not represent the autonomic nervous system input to the SA node. Two common sources of non-sinus beats are the atria and ventricles, which can prompt an atrial premature contraction and ventricular premature contraction (VPC), respectively. As these beats are premature, they lead to a short R–R interval followed by a long compensatory R–R interval (Figure 3). Pathological causes of ectopy include electrolyte abnormalities, ischemia and cardiomyopathy. Ventricular arrhythmias can also be generated from an unmasked ectopic focus in populations with very low HR, such as athletes. More benign causes of ectopy in healthy populations include caffeine or nicotine, which is one reason most researchers ask participants to refrain from such intake before IBI collection. To our knowledge, research is yet to examine the impact of caffeine withdrawal on HRV, which requires future investigation. However, double-blind experiments suggest that abstinence in those that regularly consume caffeine has no effect on heart rate.

### Electrophysiologic predictors of the recurrence of persistent atrial fibrillation within 30 days of cardioversion [^1168d6Sg]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with recurrence of persistent atrial fibrillation within 30 days of cardioversion had slower atrial conduction, a slower sinus rate, no difference in the absolute value of the effective refractory period, greater early reverse remodeling of the effective refractory period, and more premature atrial contractions than those who did not. These findings highlight the role of slow conduction and premature atrial contractions in the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation and suggest a possible proarrhythmic effect of reverse remodeling.

### Electrophysiological characteristics and catheter ablation of symptomatic focal premature atrial contractions originating from pulmonary veins and non-pulmonary veins [^1129ivSu]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

We aimed to explore electrophysiological characteristics of premature atrial contractions (PACs) originating from pulmonary veins (PVs) and non-PVs and to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of catheter ablation for PACs.

Hypothesis

Symptomatic PACs originated from different positions and whether could be ablated.

Methods

Symptomatic, frequent, and drug-refractory PAC patients were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent electrophysiological study and catheter ablation.

Results

A total of 81 patients were enrolled: 45 patients with PACs originating from PVs (group A), 24 patients with PACs originating from non-PVs (group B), and 12 patients with PACs arising from both PVs and non-PVs (group C). Twenty (44.4%) patients in group A, 6 (50.0%) patients in group C, and 3 (12.5%) patients in group B presented paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (P < 0.05). PV isolation was performed in groups A and C. Focal ablation or superior vena cava isolation was performed in groups B and C, depending on patient condition. PACs were abolished in all patients except one patient in group B. During a median follow-up period of 21.3 ± 14.3months, 40 (88.9%) patients in group A, 10 (83.3%) patients in group C, and 21 (87.5%) patients in group B were free of recurrence after initial ablation.

Conclusions

Frequent PACs originating from PVs were associated with increased incidence of atrial fibrillation compared with PACs originating from non-PVs. Catheter ablation yields a satisfactory success rate and could be a good choice for eliminating symptomatic, frequent, and drug-refractory PACs.

### Acute effects of coffee consumption on health among ambulatory adults [^114AjLtT]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2023). Excellent credibility.

Background

Coffee is one of the most commonly consumed beverages in the world, but the acute health effects of coffee consumption remain uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a prospective, randomized, case-crossover trial to examine the effects of caffeinated coffee on cardiac ectopy and arrhythmias, daily step counts, sleep minutes, and serum glucose levels. A total of 100 adults were fitted with a continuously recording electrocardiogram device, a wrist-worn accelerometer, and a continuous glucose monitor. Participants downloaded a smartphone application to collect geolocation data. We used daily text messages, sent over a period of 14 days, to randomly instruct participants to consume caffeinated coffee or avoid caffeine. The primary outcome was the mean number of daily premature atrial contractions. Adherence to the randomization assignment was assessed with the use of real-time indicators recorded by the participants, daily surveys, reimbursements for date-stamped receipts for coffee purchases, and virtual monitoring (geofencing) of coffee-shop visits.

Results

The mean (± SD) age of the participants was 39 ± 13 years; 51% were women, and 51% were non-Hispanic White. Adherence to the random assignments was assessed to be high. The consumption of caffeinated coffee was associated with 58 daily premature atrial contractions as compared with 53 daily events on days when caffeine was avoided (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98 to 1.20; P = 0.10). The consumption of caffeinated coffee as compared with no caffeine consumption was associated with 154 and 102 daily premature ventricular contractions, respectively (rate ratio, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.94); 10,646 and 9665 daily steps (mean difference, 1058; 95% CI, 441 to 1675); 397 and 432 minutes of nightly sleep (mean difference, 36; 95% CI, 25 to 47); and serum glucose levels of 95 mg per deciliter and 96 mg per deciliter (mean difference, -0.41; 95% CI, -5.42 to 4.60).

Conclusions

In this randomized trial, the consumption of caffeinated coffee did not result in significantly more daily premature atrial contractions than the avoidance of caffeine.

### Where there is smoke, there is fire: afib in SCD [^113XgZ1P]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, the authors identified a high prevalence of atrial arrhythmias (26%) in patients with SCD. Although the minority of patients had paroxysmal or persistent afib, many presented with excessive supraventricular ectopic activity (ESVEA), defined as ≥ 720 premature atrial contractions per day or any episode runs of ≥ 20 premature atrial contractions. Although ESVEA exhibits an incident risk of afib in patients without SCD, its predictive value for patients with SCD remains unproven. However, in the present study, there was a strong independent association between ESVEA and a history of stroke, of which 28% were compatible with afib origin. This sizable percentage suggests that atrial arrhythmias, including paroxysmal afib, may play a larger role than previously thought in stroke in patients with SCD, underscoring the importance of early detection and treatment.

With or without SCD, there are several important aspects of care for patients with afib, including stroke risk assessment and prophylaxis, cardiac risk mediation (obesity, tobacco and alcohol usage, hypertension, etc), and symptom management (rate vs rhythm control). Stroke risk is estimated using scoring systems (eg, CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc,), and anticoagulation is recommended if the annual risk of stroke or thromboembolic events is ≥ 2%. Treating or preventing afib is important, because afib can lead to adverse cardiac remodeling, thromboembolic events, and other symptoms. Rhythm control, achieved with antiarrhythmics and/or cardiac ablation, when compared with rate control has been associated with a lower risk of death from cardiovascular causes and stroke. Close follow-up is imperative because afib recurrence is common and up to 90% of episodes are not recognized by the patient.

### Prognostic significance of premature atrial complexes burden in prediction of long-term outcome [^115DK2Qx]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical Perspective

The clinical significances of this study are the following: (1) excessive numbers of PACs may increase the risk of atrial fibrillation, hospitalization, and mortality; (2) frequent PACs might contribute to subclinical heart disease, and could lead to the progression of remodeling. Our study can help increase clinicians' awareness that a more intense follow-up may allow early detection of AF or subclinical heart disease. Advanced treatment of underlying disease could interrupt the progress of cardiac remodeling.

### High burden of premature ventricular complex increases the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation [^117B5mA5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Main Findings

The main findings of our study were as follows: (1) moderate and high PVC burdens led to higher incidences of new‐onset AF compared to that of the low PVC burden group, (2) the younger population with moderate and high PVC burdens had a higher risk of developing new‐onset AF than that of the older population, and (3) the risk of developing new‐onset AF in patients with moderate and high PVC burdens was similar at different follow‐up time intervals.

Premature Ventricular Complex Burden and Cardiovascular Complications

High PVC burden is a predictive factor for long‐term all‐cause mortality. Medically fragile populations, such as those with cancer and frequent PVC, are associated with mortality irrespective of cancer and performance status. Besides the medically fragile population, frequent PVC induced during an exercise test is also an indicator of long‐term cardiovascular mortality in asymptomatic individuals. To stratify the risk of PVC, our previous work demonstrated that moderate (1000–10 000/day) and high PVC burdens (≥ 10 000/day) were associated with cardiovascular mortality. Although PVC‐induced cardiomyopathy is hypothesized to cause the structural changes in the heart, not every cardiovascular death can be explained through frequent PVC‐induced HF. Thus, the question of whether PVC can cause cardiac complications other than HF has become an important research topic. A recent nationwide study found that the risk of new‐onset AF increases in patients with a clinical diagnosis of PVC. Our study further demonstrated that PVC burden is associated with new‐onset AF. Of note, in this study, new‐onset AF may still be underestimated in the moderate and high PVC groups because of the prevalence of antiarrhythmic drug use in this group.

### Premature cardiac contractions and risk of incident ischemic stroke [^116J6YGG]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2012). Low credibility.

PACs have been retrospectively shown to be surrogate markers of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke, but our study failed to show a significant longitudinal relationship between PAC and ischemic stroke. Again, this contrasts with the Swedish study which found that a high frequency of PACs was significantly associated with increased stroke risk, independent of other major risk factors. The prevalence of PACs in that study was 19% compared to 4.9% in our study, while the stroke rate was 14% compared to 3.5% in our study. The frequency and prevalence of PACs are known to increase with age. As with PVCs, differences in study populations (older male), detection methods (24-hour monitoring) and outcomes (composite stroke) may explain this discrepancy.

One shortcoming of our study is that it is unclear how many subjects developed AF during follow-up. The ARIC study performed ECGs at baseline only. The observed stroke risk may therefore be due to undetected AF rather than a direct effect of premature cardiac contractions. Potential for misclassification also exists from systematic under-diagnosis of premature contractions based on 2-minute ECGs as opposed to 24 hour monitoring. Mere presence of PVCs on 2-minute ECG is an insensitive predictor of PVCs based on 24 hour monitoring. Baseline prevalence of premature contractions as well as effect sizes may therefore be greater than observed. PACs may therefore actually pose a higher and perhaps significant stroke risk, while PVCs may pose much greater risk than observed in normotensives. While these finding are very preliminary, additional studies using more sensitive instruments to study the risk of pure ischemic stroke in a general population may be warranted. Additionally, the use of antiarrhythmics was not factored into our analysis. While this is a potential limitation, previous studies on implication of the use of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and antiarrhythmics as they relate to cardiovascular events in the ARIC cohortshowed that PVCs were associated with increased risk for future cardiovascular events despite multivariate adjustments for use of these medications.

### State of the art of mobile health technologies use in clinical arrhythmia care [^113coXds]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The rapid growth in mobile health (mHealth) technologies has created tremendous opportunities for consumer-driven health management. Current generations of smartphones and other consumer mobile devices incorporate sensors and components that are either developed for the purpose of health monitoring, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), activity sensors, hand-held ECG systems, or re-purposed for health and activity monitoring, such as cameras, a global positioning system (GPS), accelerometers, gyroscopes, microphones, or a digital compass. Increased affordability of these mobile devices, coupled with improved high-speed internet access, has created an opportunity to democratize healthcare access for patients. Cardiac arrhythmia care is particularly well-suited to benefit from these burgeoning accessible consumer health technologies. These technologies allow for real-time monitoring and early detection of arrhythmias, enabling timely medical intervention and empowering patients to manage their conditions more effectively.

Cardiac arrhythmias encompass a range of conditions where the heart beats irregularly, too quickly, or too slowly, disrupting its ability to pump blood effectively. Common types include atrial fibrillation (AF), characterized by chaotic atrial beats that increase stroke risk; ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF), both serious conditions where rapid beats from the ventricles can lead to cardiac arrest; and bradycardia, where slow heart rates cause fatigue and dizziness. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) involves rapid heart rates originating above the ventricles, while premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra beats disrupting regular rhythm. While a comprehensive review of cardiac arrhythmias is beyond the scope of this article, readers can refer to several excellent reviews available on this topic.

In this review, we outline the practical utility of the available and emerging mHealth technologies related to cardiac arrhythmia care. We review available literature to summarize what is known about the use of these technologies for the prediction, screening, diagnosis, and management of cardiac arrhythmias. We review the benefits, limitations, and potential risks of this digital technological revolution in arrhythmia care; and identify the gaps in knowledge and future directions. Box 1 provides a framework of definitions for digital health, mHealth, and digital medicine to clarify these often interchangeably used terms, and familiarize readers with accepted concepts in healthcare.

### Can we improve outcomes in AF patients by early therapy? [^117HXFhq]. BMC Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Commentary

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and affects at least 1% of the population, amounting to 5.5 to 7 million patients with AF in Europe. AF is characterized by very rapid, irregular electrical activation of the atria (350 to 400 bpm), resulting in 1) loss of coordinated contraction and transport function in the atria and 2) irregular ventricular rate and loss of ventricular rate adaptation to increased demands (arrhythmia absoluta). In an ageing population, the prevalence and incidence of AF will increase dramatically in the next decades. Unlike most other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, atrial fibrillation can usually not be cured. Rather, most patients progress from paroxysmal AF, that is, AF that alternates with periods of sinus rhythm, to sustained forms (Figure 1), even when currently available therapeutic options are applied. This sobering finding is aggravated by the dramatic consequences that AF implies in affected individuals and for society (Table 1).

One of the reasons why AF is so difficult to cure is probably the complex etiology of the arrhythmia as recently outlined in two consensus conferences on AF: AF can be caused by atrial structural damage conferred by cardiac or extracardiac disease and rapid irregular ventricular rate, a sign of natural ageing of the heart, and an electrical accident due to abnormal electrical function of the heart. Furthermore, AF perpetuates itself by altering electrical function of the atria (Figure 2). Unfortunately, all of these mechanisms form vicious circles and are severely aggravated once AF has manifested. Usually, several of these factors have to concur before the arrhythmia develops.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^1167vN8r]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Premature cardiac contractions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Though experts associate premature atrial contractions (PACs) and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) with caffeine, there are no data to support this relationship in the general population. As certain caffeinated products may have cardiovascular benefits, recommendations against them may be detrimental.

Methods and Results

We studied Cardiovascular Health Study participants with a baseline food frequency assessment, 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter) monitoring, and without persistent atrial fibrillation. Frequencies of habitual coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption were assessed using a picture-sort food frequency survey. The main outcomes were PACs/h and PVCs/hour. Among 1388 participants (46% male, mean age 72 years), 840 (61%) consumed ≥ 1 caffeinated product per day. The median numbers of PACs and PVCs/h and interquartile ranges were 3 (1–12) and 1 (0–7), respectively. There were no differences in the number of PACs or PVCs/h across levels of coffee, tea, and chocolate consumption. After adjustment for potential confounders, more frequent consumption of these products was not associated with ectopy. In examining combined dietary intake of coffee, tea, and chocolate as a continuous measure, no relationships were observed after multivariable adjustment: 0.48% fewer PACs/h (95% CI -4.60 to 3.64) and 2.87% fewer PVCs/h (95% CI -8.18 to 2.43) per 1-serving/week increase in consumption.

Conclusions

In the largest study to evaluate dietary patterns and quantify cardiac ectopy using 24-hour Holter monitoring, we found no relationship between chronic consumption of caffeinated products and ectopy.

COR 1, LOE C-LD: In pregnant patients with PACs who either are asymptomatic or have tolerable symptoms, reassurance is recommended with no need for intervention. COR 1, LOE C-LD: In pregnant patients with symptomatic SVT in the absence of preexcitation, metoprolol, propranolol, and/or digoxin should be used as first-line options and verapamil as the second-line option for the chronic oral prophylaxis of SVT. COR 1, LOE C-LD: In pregnant patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and poorly tolerated or frequent episodes of SVT, therapy with oral flecainide or propafenone is recommended for the pharmacological management of SVT. COR 1, LOE C-LD: In pregnant patients with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, aggressive treatment of the tachycardia with beta-blockers as a first-line option and early consultation with an electrophysiologist for escalation of pharmacological therapy and/or ablation are recommended. COR 2a, LOE C-LD: In pregnant patients with symptomatic recurrent SVT refractory or with contraindications to digoxin, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers, alternative antiarrhythmic drugs, including flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol, are reasonable. COR 2a, LOE C-LD: In pregnant patients with recurrent SVT refractory or with contraindications to pharmacological therapies, catheter ablation is reasonable with attention to and techniques for eliminating or minimizing radiation exposure to as low as reasonably achievable. COR 2b, LOE C-LD: In pregnant patients with poorly tolerated SVT refractory or with contraindications to other pharmacological and interventional therapies, therapy with amiodarone may be considered.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Premature ventricular complexes — evaluation considerations: Because some studies have shown an association of PVCs with adverse outcomes, the detection of PVCs, particularly if multifocal and frequent, is generally considered a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and such patients are generally evaluated to ensure they do not have underlying conditions (eg, ischemic heart disease, left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) that warrant further treatment to reduce risk.

### Atrial ectopy as a predictor of incident atrial fibrillation: a cohort study [^1162evrq]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) prediction models have unclear clinical utility given the absence of AF prevention therapies and the immutability of many risk factors. Premature atrial contractions (PACs) play a critical role in AF pathogenesis and may be modifiable.

Objective

To investigate whether PAC count improves model performance for AF risk.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

4 U.S. communities.

Patients

A random subset of 1260 adults without prevalent AF enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study between 1989 and 1990.

Measurements

The PAC count was quantified by 24-hour electrocardiography. Participants were followed for the diagnosis of incident AF or death. The Framingham AF risk algorithm was used as the comparator prediction model.

Results

In adjusted analyses, doubling the hourly PAC count was associated with a significant increase in AF risk (hazard ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.13 to 1.22]; P < 0.001) and overall mortality (hazard ratio, 1.06 [CI, 1.03 to 1.09]; P < 0.001). Compared with the Framingham model, PAC count alone resulted in similar AF risk discrimination at 5 and 10 years of follow-up and superior risk discrimination at 15 years. The addition of PAC count to the Framingham model resulted in significant 10-year AF risk discrimination improvement (c-statistic, 0.65 vs. 0.72; P < 0.001), net reclassification improvement (23.2% [CI, 12.8% to 33.6%]; P < 0.001), and integrated discrimination improvement (5.6% [CI, 4.2% to 7.0%]; P < 0.001). The specificity for predicting AF at 15 years exceeded 90% for PAC counts more than 32 beats/h.

Limitation

This study does not establish a causal link between PACs and AF.

Conclusion

The addition of PAC count to a validated AF risk algorithm provides superior AF risk discrimination and significantly improves risk reclassification. Further study is needed to determine whether PAC modification can prospectively reduce AF risk.

### Palpitations: evaluation in the primary care setting [^115XuSq8]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Palpitations are a common problem in the ambulatory primary care setting, and cardiac causes are the most concerning etiology. Psychiatric illness, adverse effects of prescription and over-the-counter medications, and substance use should also be considered. Distinguishing cardiac from noncardiac causes is important because of the risk of sudden death in those with an underlying cardiac etiology. A thorough history and physical examination, followed by targeted diagnostic testing, can distinguish cardiac conditions from other causes of palpitations. Persons with a history of cardiovascular disease, palpitations at work, or palpitations that affect sleep have an increased risk of a cardiac cause. A history of cardiac symptoms, a family history concerning for cardiac dysrhythmias, or abnormal physical examination or electrocardiography findings should prompt a more in-depth evaluation for heart disease. Ischemic symptoms may signal coronary heart disease and associated ventricular premature contractions that may warrant exercise stress testing. Exertional symptoms accompanied by elevated jugular venous pressure, rales, or lower extremity edema should raise concern for heart failure; imaging may be required to assess for functional and structural heart disease.

Dobutamine stress echocardiography — safety, arrhythmias, and beta‑blocker handling: Achievement of target rate is emphasized, and "consideration should be given to holding beta‑blocker therapy on the day of testing until after the test", although "in a patient with known coronary artery disease (CAD), continuation of beta‑blocker therapy may be preferred". Common cardiovascular side effects are listed, severe hypotension is rare, and arrhythmias are quantified, with "premature atrial or ventricular contractions" in "about 10%" and "supraventricular or ventricular tachycardias" in "about 4%", and serious events estimated at "1 of 2000 studies". The test "can safely be performed" in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, aortic or cerebral aneurysms, and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, and can be performed under registered nurse supervision.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) in asymptomatic individuals — clinical significance and alert features: Isolated and sparse PVCs are a normal occurrence in most individuals, and a few to multiple PVCs can be seen on most 24 h Holter monitors, including those from healthy young individuals. PVCs usually originate from different locations in both right and left ventricles and may result from focal activity or, less likely, micro re-entrant mechanisms. In some individuals a higher number of PVCs may be present, and frequent PVCs may be a marker for underlying abnormal cardiac substrate due to electrical, ischaemic, or structural alterations leading to increased automaticity, triggered activity (e.g. in long QT syndrome (LQTS) or by drugs such as digoxin), or re-entrant mechanisms (e.g. in post-infarction patients). Underlying cardiac disease is a prognostically unfavourable marker in asymptomatic patients with PVCs and requires a special approach to address the potential prognostic impact, and PVC characteristics such as a high burden, more complex presentation (e.g. couplets, triplets, or non-sustained runs), multifocal origin, and/or increasing frequency with exercise should alert to potential underlying electrical, ischaemic, or structural disease.

### High-burden premature atrial contractions predict new-onset atrial fibrillation after surgical septal myectomy [^115XTc9P]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Although increased premature atrial contractions (PACs) reportedly predict atrial fibrillation (AF) in both general and specific (e.g., patients with stroke) populations, early postoperative AF (POAF) risk in patients with increased PAC burden who require cardiac surgery remains unclear. We examined the correlation between different preoperative PAC burdens and POAF in patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (OHCM) who underwent surgical treatment. We analyzed 304 consecutively admitted patients with OHCM without previous AF who underwent isolated septal myectomy between January 2015 and December 2018. All patients underwent preoperative 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram monitoring. PACs were present in 259 patients (85.20%) and absent in 45 patients (14.80%). According to the cut-off PAC number of 100 beats/24 hours, there were 211 patients (69.41%) with low-burden PACs and 48 patients (15.79%) with high-burden PACs. AF after septal myectomy occurred in 73 patients, which consisted of 3/45 in the non-PAC group (6.67%), 47/211 in the low-PAC-burden group (22.27%), and 23/48 in the high PAC burden group (47.92%). POAF incidence was higher in both low- and high-burden patients than in patients without PAC (p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated that high-burden PACs (p = 0.02) and age (p < 0.01) but not low-burden PACs (p = 0.22) independently predicted POAF in patients with OHCM. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for preoperative PACs was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.79, p < 0.01, sensitivity: 68.49%, specificity: 69.26%). In conclusion, POAF incidence was significantly higher in patients with preoperative high-burden PACs and can predict POAF in patients with OHCM.

### 2023 HRS expert consensus statement on the management of arrhythmias during pregnancy [^117BVCVn]. Heart Rhythm (2023). High credibility.

Fetal bradycardia — initial evaluation is by fetal echocardiography and rhythm analysis to classify suspected etiologies as atrial bigeminy with block, sinus or ectopic atrial rhythm, long QT syndrome (LQTS), atrioventricular (AV) block, or other conditions associated with AV block. For atrial bigeminy with block, frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) must be differentiated from second-degree heart block using Doppler velocimetry, motion-mode, or isovolumetric contraction and relaxation times, with weekly assessment of fetal status and development of fetal SVT and acknowledgement that this mechanism is generally benign. For sinus or ectopic atrial rhythm, it is characterized by 1:1 conduction with potential suppression of the sinoatrial node secondary to maternal medications or viral myocarditis, and ectopic atrial mechanisms include displaced atrial activation or absence of the sinoatrial node; management is periodic assessment of fetal status with biophysical profile and ultrasound to exclude fetal hydrops. For LQTS, diagnosis notes ion channel dysfunction and management includes observation of the fetus for ventricular arrhythmias, avoidance of maternal medications that may prolong QT interval, genetic counseling for patient and family, and postnatal evaluation with assessment of QT interval. For AV block, evaluate for isoimmune fetal heart block secondary to anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies and perform periodic assessment of degree of fetal heart block, cardiomyopathy and fetal hydrops; management uses shared decision-making for treatment with fluorinated steroids and shared decision-making for treatment with dual therapy adding intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) for evolving cardiomyopathy and hydrops. For other conditions associated with AV block, etiologies include idiopathic (without structural defect), structural heart disease (SHD), and inherited arrhythmia syndromes (IAS) other than LQTS; management includes monitoring for ventricular arrhythmias and postnatal evaluation and genetic testing.

Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) — factors pointing to worse prognosis: Factors that may point to worse prognosis in patients with PVCs include underlying structural, ischemic or electrical disease; more than 2000 PVC/24 h; complex PVCs (couplets, triplets, and non-sustained VT); increasing number of morphologies; increasing number PVCs with exercise; non-outflow tract PVC (usually monomorphic or only slightly divergent morphologies); short coupling interval of the PVCs (R-on-T); and PVCs with broader QRS complexes (more frequently related to cardiomyopathy). These factors may suggest a poorer prognosis and need a thorough investigation to rule out underlying structural, ischemic, or electrical disease, with additional evaluations individually tailored.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular block — definitions and ECG characteristics include the following: First-degree atrioventricular block is a misnomer with a prolonged PR interval > 200 ms and no true block, more accurately referred to as first-degree atrioventricular delay. Second-degree atrioventricular block is sub-classified into Mobitz I (Wenckebach conduction) and Mobitz II; Mobitz I occurs after gradual PR prolongation and Mobitz II does not, and the ECG shows group beating from "dropped" QRS complexes, while isolated 2:1 block cannot be classified as Mobitz I or II. High-grade, high-degree, or advanced atrioventricular block refers to situations where ≥ 2 consecutive P waves at a normal rate are not conducted; high-degree block is generally intra- or infra-Hisian and treated with pacing, and in unusual circumstances (at night with sinus slowing) a vagal etiology may be considered when the QRS is narrow. Third-degree or complete atrioventricular block implies no conduction at all from atria to ventricles and is usually associated with a junctional or ventricular escape mechanism; in atrial fibrillation, complete block may be imputed when the ventricular response is slow (< 50 bpm) and regular. Careful evaluation of the electrocardiogram (ECG) is required, as a 1:1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes may be absent with isorhythmic dissociation or when sinus bradycardia is coupled with an accelerated junctional rhythm, and atrial bigeminy with repetitive premature atrial contractions can mimic atrioventricular block. Additionally, atrioventricular block within or below the His bundle may progress rapidly and unexpectedly, is associated with a slower and more unpredictable ventricular escape mechanism, and will not respond to atropine but may improve with catecholamines.

### Management of cardiac conduction abnormalities and arrhythmia in aircrew [^112Crfjb]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of loss of flying licence globally, and cardiac arrhythmia is the main disqualifier in a substantial proportion of aircrew. Frequent ventricular ectopic (VE) beats (or premature ventricular contractions (PVC)), non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), and atrial fibrillation (AF) are the most common arrhythmias seen in aircrew.

Aircrew often operate within a demanding physiological environment, that potentially includes exposure to sustained acceleration (usually resulting in a positive gravitational force, from head to feet (+Gz)) in high performance aircraft. As described in Coumel's triangle of arrhythmogenesis, clinical arrhythmias are the result of three factors: the anatomic or electrophysiological substrate, the trigger factor, and the modulation factors, of which the most common is the autonomic nervous system. It has been known for many decades that exposure to +G z leads to an elongation of the heart; additionally, this exposure leads to rapid stimulation/inhibition of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, and so this is a highly arrhythmogenic environment for aircrew, especially those with pre-existing susceptibility. Benign dysrhythmias such as sinus arrhythmia, low degree atrioventricular (AV) block, and premature atrial or ventricular beats are commonly observed as a physiological response to acceleration during centrifuge training. More rarely,+G z is associated with more significant arrhythmias such as AF or recurrent NSVT. This is often in relation to cardiac abnormalities found during subsequent investigation of aircrew, in whom +G z has precipitated these events, that may have flight safety implications. Particularly worrisome complications of arrhythmias in aircrew are incapacitation secondary to pre-syncope or syncope, or distraction due to symptoms such as palpitations or dizziness that may interfere with aircrew duties and negatively impact flight safety.

### Mechanisms for the initiation of human atrial fibrillation [^111PGdyd]. Heart Rhythm (2009). Low credibility.

Understanding of the mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation (AF) remain limited. However, both persistent and paroxysmal AF likely initiate via the interaction of triggers such as premature atrial beats with 'substrate', that includes static components such as fibrosis and scar, as well as dynamic alterations that may include the rate-response of repolarization and conduction, autonomic modulation and stretch. This article attempts to synthesize concepts for AF initiation from in silico, in vitro and in vivo animal data and human studies and apply them to the spectrum of disease processes that comprise clinical AF. Further investigation is urgently needed to translate these discoveries into effective therapy.

### Early atrial remodeling drives arrhythmia in Fabry disease [^114KwPwU]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Fabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by α-Gal A (α-galactosidase A) deficiency, resulting in multiorgan accumulation of sphingolipid, namely globotriaosylceramide. This triggers ventricular myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation, driving arrhythmia and sudden death. Atrial fibrillation is common, yet the cellular mechanisms accounting for this are unknown.

Methods

To address this, we conducted ECG analysis from a large cohort of 115 adults with FD at varying cardiomyopathy stages. ECG P-wave characteristics were compared with non-FD controls. Cellular contractile and electrophysiological function were examined in a novel atrial cellular FD model developed and imputed into in silico atrial models to provide insight into mechanisms of arrhythmia. Induced pluripotent stem cells were genome-edited using Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats-Cas9 to introduce the GLA p. N215S variant and differentiated into induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Contraction, calcium handling, and electrophysiology experiments were conducted. Bi-atrial in silico models were developed with cellular changes as in GLA p. N215S iPSC-CMs.

Results

ECG analysis demonstrated P-wave duration and PQ interval shortening in FD adults before the onset of cardiomyopathy. Patients with FD exhibited a higher incidence of premature atrial contractions and increased risk of atrial fibrillation compared with healthy controls. GLA p. N215S iPSC-CMs were deficient in α-Gal A and exhibited globotriaosylceramide accumulation. Atrial GLA p. N215S iPSC-CMs demonstrated a more positive diastolic membrane potential, faster action potential upstroke velocity, greater incidence of delayed afterdepolarizations, greater contraction force, and alterations in calcium handling compared with wild-type iPSC-CMs. Simulations with these changes in the in silico models resulted in similar P-wave morphology changes to those seen in early FD cardiomyopathy and increased atrial fibrillation vulnerability.

Conclusions

These findings provide novel insights into underpinning mechanisms for atrial arrhythmia and a rationale for early P-wave changes in FD. These may be targeted to develop therapeutic strategies to reduce the arrhythmic burden in FD.

### Approach to a patient with asymptomatic pre-excitation [^113AkR5W]. Heart (2023). Medium credibility.

The overall incidence of SCD in asymptomatic individuals with pre-excitation is quite low. A meta-analysis of 20 studies, including 1869 asymptomatic adults with pre-excitation, estimated the risk of 0.13%/yearand may be higher in children in the first two decades of life. Clinicians should keep in mind that this risk is small and is only slightly higher than the background risk of premature death in an average US adult, just below 0.1%/year. However, SCD in a patient with pre-excitation is a significant event that cannot be ignored. Since ablation of most APs is curative and carries a low risk of complications, a question remains whether APs should be ablated in asymptomatic individuals to eliminate the small risk of SCD.

### Consumption of caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy [^116c85KM]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Although a causal relationship between PACs and AF or PVCs and heart failure cannot be determined by these large epidemiologic studies, extrapolation from data already available from the electrophysiology laboratory has raised interest in the theoretical benefit of prophylactic PAC and PVC ablation. 4, 10 However, little is known about modifiable exposures that may reduce or prevent frequent PACs or PVCs.

Patients often associate the symptoms of premature cardiac contractions with emotional stress, physical activity, dietary factors, and caffeine or other stimulant use. 11 Though there is little data to support the role of behavioral modifications or trigger avoidance in reducing or preventing premature cardiac contractions, clinicians often instruct patients with any arrhythmia to avoid caffeine intake. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of supraventricular arrhythmias state that if a patient's history is consistent with premature extra beats, one should review and eliminate potential exacerbating factors, such as caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine. 12 Prominent online medical resources for clinicians, such as UpToDate and Medscape, feature similar recommendations for the management of premature beats. 13, 14 While none of these sources explicitly refer to the acute versus chronic effects of caffeine on ectopy, they focus on general avoidance in order to avoid triggering arrhythmias. Caffeine is of particular interest because of its known sympathomimetic effects, leading to increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels 15 and, as a result, possibly increasing ectopy. While most observational and experimental studies examining the effect of caffeine intake on arrhythmogenesis have been negative, the majority of them focus on populations known to have increased premature cardiac contractions, arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT), or other heart disease. 16, 17, 18, 19 In addition, most of the interventional trials investigating the effects of caffeine or other lifestyle modifications on arrhythmias were performed several decades ago 11 and frequently did not use premature cardiac contractions as a primary outcome. 18

Recent and growing evidence points to the potential beneficial cardiovascular effects of several common caffeinated products, including coffee, 20 chocolate, 21 and tea. 22 There may therefore be uncertainty in counseling patients regarding consumption of these products, and many patients may reduce their exposure in order to avoid the presumed arrhythmogenic effect at the expense of possible benefits. We thus sought to study the relationship between chronic consumption of these potentially healthy caffeinated products and cardiac ectopy in a community‐based cohort.

### Guidelines for the echocardiographic assessment of the right heart in adults and special considerations in pulmonary hypertension: recommendations from the American Society of Echocardiography [^1132Hhw4]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2025). High credibility.

Right heart hemodynamic assessment — common error sources and CW Doppler tricuspid regurgitation (TR) pitfalls are listed, and specific acquisition practices are directed. Common sources of error include significant RV failure and contractile dysfunction; TR jet signal over-gaining; high output or hyperkinetic RV; atrial fibrillation and velocity after a premature contraction or pause, if a higher velocity is used; pulmonic stenosis; and an unfavorable Theta angle > 20 degrees (angle between ultrasound beam and direction of blood velocity). Measure the densest primary edge of the CW Doppler signal ("chin") and not the faint aspects ("beard"); UEA, blood-saline contrast, and agitated saline can be used to augment the Doppler signal. Position the ultrasound beam parallel to the direction of blood flow, ideally < 20° Θ angle to minimize any error in velocity measurement. If there is significant TR, the shape of the CW Doppler signal can help guide accuracy of RVSP estimates; a triangular CW Doppler contour will underestimate RVSP, while accuracy is improved with a parabolic Doppler contour. Do not consider a velocity following a pause or premature contraction, and consider the mean velocity across 5–10 beats in patients with arrhythmia. Both right atrial pressure estimates and inadequate TR signals can lead to overestimation or underestimation in hemodynamic assessments.

3.1 Patients Characteristics and Primary Outcomes

After applying the selection criteria in Figure 1, 692 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 45 had AVB proven on the 12‐lead ECG (7%). None of the discrepancies in the two cardiologists' reports involved AVB patients. Table 1 demonstrates the demographics of the study cohort. Males comprised 52% of the cohort, with a median age of 60 (IQR: 54−67 years). Compared to the rest of the patients, AVB patients were older (76 vs. 54 years; p < 0.001), had more IHD patients (62% vs. 14%; p < 0.01) and more diabetes mellitus (DM) patients (56% vs. 21%; p = 0.01).

Demographics and characteristics of patients stratified by 12‐lead electrocardiogram results.

The ECG findings and patients' presenting complaints are shown in Figure 2. ECG was normal in 279 (40%). The most common ECG abnormality was sinus tachycardia in 95 patients (14%), followed by frequent atrial or ventricular ectopy in 47 patients (7%) and bundle branch block in 66 patients (10%). The most common presenting complaints were trauma in 304 patients (44%), followed by respiratory complaints in 84 patients (12%) and chest pain/syncope in 49 (7%). In patients with AVB, the most common presenting complaint was shortness of breath in 23 patients (51%), followed by trauma in 18 patients (40%) and syncope in 4 patients (9%). Of the AVB patients, 49% were first‐degree, 4% were Mobitz I, 27% were Mobitz II, and 20% were third‐degree blocks. The last two were referred to another nearby center to have pacemakers implanted.

PVCs disrupt AVS, since atrial contraction typically occurs in ventricular systole (Table 3, Figure 4). Of note, one subject with 1:1 AVC, where 100% AVS would be expected, had an AVS of 63.4% due to a PVC burden of 35.8%. Since rate smoothing is not applied on sensed ventricular beats, including PVCs, the compensatory pause following the PVC allows additional time for atrial sensing and to re‐establish AV synchronization (Figure 4A). However, in some cases, depending upon the relative timing between the PVC and sinus beat, it may take more than one beat to re‐establish AVS (Figure 4B).

Example behavior during PVCs. (A) shows minimal disruption in atrial sensing after a PVCs (arrow). (B) shows multiple beats are needed to re‐establish AV synchrony since sinus beat occurred after ventricular pace beats.

The atrial sensing behavior during PACs depends upon the coupling interval of the PACs. If the coupling interval is long, then the PAC may be tracked (example shown in Figure 5), without any loss of AVS. If the coupling interval is short, then the atrial contraction will not be tracked if it occurs during post ventricular atrial blanking, but it could be tracked during the A3 window (i.e. before VE marker) if the PAC contraction combines with the A3 passive filling signal and crosses the A3 threshold.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF) triggered by premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) — mechanisms, ablation approach, and cautions. Idiopathic VF may be initiated by PVCs that arise from the outflow tracts or the His-Purkinje system within either the right ventricle or left ventricle, and the PVCs usually have a consistent QRS morphology and a short coupling interval and can be targeted for ablation to control the arrhythmia. To maximize the probability of successful ablation, the procedure is best performed during periods of frequent PVCs, and when the PVCs can be identified, ablation is highly successful, but late recurrences are observed in approximately 10% of patients such that implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is prudent even if ablation is acutely successful. The risks of catheter ablation include bleeding at the site of arterial or venous access and a small risk of pericardial tamponade, and therapy with quinidine acutely and chronically can suppress recurrent VF episodes in some patients.

First versus next-generation BTK inhibitors

There was no difference in the indications for or duration of rhythm monitoring by generation of BTKi therapy (10.4 days for next-generation vs.13.1 days for ibrutinib; Supplemental Tables 3 and 7A). Arrhythmia of any kind was seen in 73.7% of next-generation users and 71.7% of ibrutinib users (Fig. 1). AF was seen in 13.2% of next-generation users and 30.0% of ibrutinib users. Of those without history of AF, incident AF was less common in next-generation users than ibrutinib users (6.9% vs 25.5%, P = 0.039). There was no difference in the mean burden of AF (8.5% ibrutinib vs. 8.3% next-generation BTKi's, Fig. 2).

### Prognostic significance of premature atrial complexes burden in prediction of long-term outcome [^1173aE3n]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The prognostic significance of premature atrial complex (PAC) burden is not fully elucidated. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the burden of PACs and long-term outcome.

Methods and Results

We investigated the clinical characteristics of 5371 consecutive patients without atrial fibrillation (AF) or a permanent pacemaker (PPM) at baseline who underwent 24-hour electrocardiography monitoring between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2004. Clinical event data were retrieved from the Bureau of National Health Insurance of Taiwan. During a mean follow-up duration of 10 ± 1 years, there were 1209 deaths, 1166 cardiovascular-related hospitalizations, 3104 hospitalizations for any reason, 418 cases of new-onset AF, and 132 PPM implantations. The optimal cut-off of PAC burden for predicting mortality was 76 beats per day, with a sensitivity of 63.1% and a specificity of 63.5%. In multivariate analysis, a PAC burden > 76 beats per day was an independent predictor of mortality (hazard ratio: 1.384, 95% CI: 1.230 to 1.558), cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio: 1.284, 95% CI: 1.137 to 1.451), new-onset AF (hazard ratio: 1.757, 95% CI: 1.427 to 2.163), and PPM implantation (hazard ratio: 2.821, 95% CI: 1.898 to 4.192). Patients with frequent PAC had increased risk of mortality attributable to myocardial infarction, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Frequent PACs increased risk of PPM implantation owing to sick sinus syndrome, high-degree atrioventricular block, and/or AF.

Conclusions

The burden of PACs is independently associated with mortality, cardiovascular hospitalization, new-onset AF, and PPM implantation in the long term.

### Association of non-sustained atrial tachycardia and its duration in 24-h holter monitoring with embolic stroke of unknown source [^115jF6f2]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Although supraventricular ectopic beats (SVE), including premature atrial contractions (PACs) and non-sustained atrial tachycardia (NSAT), are frequent in the general population, some study results indicate that they are pathologic. SVE may predict undiagnosed atrial fibrillation or be associated with the embolic pattern of ischemic stroke. The aim of this study was to identify the indicators most associated with embolic stroke among the parameters that suggest the burden of SVE.

Methods

A total of 1920 consecutive acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients were enrolled from two university hospitals. We defined embolic stroke of unknown source (ESUS) and small vessel occlusion (SVO) etiologies using stricter criteria than the existing conventional criteria.

Results

We enrolled 426 (SVO: 310 vs. ESUS: 116) patients who met the inclusion criteria. In the 24-h Holter monitoring parameters, total number of PACs and PAC-to-total beat ratio were not significantly different between the two groups. However, NSATs were more frequent, and the duration of the longest NSAT was longer in the ESUS group. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that high brain natriuretic peptide levels, presence of NSAT, history of previous stroke, and the longest NSAT duration significantly correlated with the ESUS etiology.

Conclusion

The presence of NSAT and its duration are more important indicators of embolic stroke than the frequency of PACs is. Therefore, considering secondary prevention in AIS patients with ESUS, 24-h Holter monitoring parameters, such as the presence of NSAT and its duration, could be considered as potential sources of cardio-embolism.

### Atrial remodeling and ectopic burden in recreational athletes: implications for risk of atrial fibrillation [^114ABrgJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial remodeling, vagal tone, and atrial ectopic triggers are suggested to contribute to increased incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in endurance athletes. How these parameters change with increased lifetime training hours is debated.

Hypothesis

Atrial remodeling occurs in proportion to total training history, thus contributing to elevated risk of AF.

Methods

We recruited 99 recreational endurance athletes, subsequently grouped according to lifetime training hours, to undergo evaluation of atrial size, autonomic modulation, and atrial ectopy. Athletes were grouped by self-reported lifetime training hours: low (< 3000h), medium (3000-6000h), and high (> 6000h). Left atrial (LA) volume, left ventricular (LV) dimensions, and LV systolic and diastolic function were assessed by echocardiography. We used 48-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring to determine heart rate, heart rate variability, premature atrial contractions, and premature ventricular contractions.

Results

LA volume was significantly greater in the high (+5.1mL/m 2, 95% CI: 1.3–8.9) and medium (+4.2mL/m 2, 95% CI: 0.2–8.1) groups, compared with the low group. LA dilation was observed in 19.4%, 12.9%, and 0% of the high, medium, and low groups, respectively (P = 0.05). No differences were observed between groups for measures of LV dimensions or function. Minimum heart rate, parasympathetic tone expressed using heart rate variability indices, and premature atrial contraction and premature ventricular contraction frequencies did not differ between groups.

Conclusions

In recreational endurance athletes, increased lifetime training is associated with LA dilation in the absence of increased vagal parameters or atrial ectopy, which may promote incidence of AF in this cohort.

### Mechanisms of atrial fibrillation [^114xjxRz]. Heart (2019). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia, currently affecting over 33 million individuals worldwide, and its prevalence is expected to more than double over the next 40 years. AF is associated with a twofold increase in premature mortality, and important major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart failure, severe stroke and myocardial infarction. Significant effort has been made over a number of years to define the underlying cellular, molecular and electrophysiological changes that predispose to the induction and maintenance of AF in patients. Progress has been limited by the realisation that AF is a complex arrhythmia that can be the end result of various different pathophysiological processes, with significant heterogeneity between individual patients (and between species). In this focused Review article, we aim to succinctly summarise for the non-specialist the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of AF. We address all aspects of pathophysiology, including the basic electrophysiological and structural changes within the left atrium, the genetics of AF and the links to comorbidities and wider systemic and metabolic perturbations that may be upstream contributors to development of AF. Finally, we outline the translational implications for current and future rhythm control strategies in patients with AF.

### PACES / HRS expert consensus statement on the recognition and management of arrhythmias in adult congenital heart disease: developed in partnership between the Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES) and the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS). Endorsed by the governing bodies of PACES, HRS, the American college of cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA), the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society (CHRS), and the international society for adult congenital heart disease (ISACHD) [^114S1usf]. Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Atrial tachyarrhythmias — mechanistic considerations in adults with congenital heart disease — describe atrial damage from surgery and postoperative pressure/volume overload causing impaired conduction; electrophysiologic studies after Fontan and Mustard repairs show prolongation of atrial refractoriness and intra-atrial conduction delay; combined electro-pathologic alterations and premature beats render patients vulnerable; the most common mechanism is macroreentry within the atrial musculature (intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia); reentrant boundaries often include scar tissue, long suture lines, anastomosis sites, or prosthetic materials; ectopic atrial tachycardias are less common but not infrequently observed.

### Ectopy on a single 12-lead ECG, incident cardiac myopathy, and death in the community [^1146pHuJ]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Even if no causal relationship between PACs and AF exists in many patients, the ability to identify PACs may yet be important for prediction. 5 Specifically, useful predictors may help identify the best candidates for preventive therapies, and/or identify patients who will benefit the most from more‐careful monitoring (such as with continuous or implantable monitors) to determine appropriate candidacy for stroke prevention using anticoagulation. 2, 25 If a causal relationship between either PACs and AF or PVCs and HF does indeed exist, ultimately these findings may also help inform trials investigating prophylactic interventions, such as catheter ablation, to prevent AF and/or HF or pharmacological therapy, such as with beta‐blockers, to prevent systolic dysfunction.

In addition to demonstrating replication in our replication analyses, our findings are consistent with previous literature describing a different population: In a secondary analysis of an important recent study of over 60 000 Japanese individuals participating in annual health exams, Murakoshi et al demonstrated a greater risk of AF in those with a supraventricular premature contraction on baseline, standard resting 12‐lead ECG. 26 These findings complement ours well. Additionally, our analyses benefit from a longer length of follow‐up (11.7 and 22.4 years compared to 5.8 years), more‐thorough incident AF ascertainment and ascertainment of covariates, a more‐diverse population, and mediation analyses related to mortality.

### Digoxin [^115ACyRb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Digoxin Toxicity

Signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes and cardiac arrhythmias [first-degree, second-degree (Wenckebach), or third-degree heart block (including asystole); atrial tachycardia with block; AV dissociation; accelerated junctional (nodal) rhythm; unifocal or multiform ventricular premature contractions (especially bigeminy or trigeminy); ventricular tachycardia; and ventricular fibrillation]. Toxicity is usually associated with digoxin levels greater than 2 ng/ml although symptoms may also occur at lower levels. Low body weight, advanced age or impaired renal function, hypokalemia, hypercalcemia, or hypomagnesemia may predispose to digoxin toxicity. Obtain serum digoxin levels in patients with signs or symptoms of digoxin therapy and interrupt or adjust dose if necessary [see Adverse Reactions (6) and Overdosage (10)]. Assess serum electrolytes and renal function periodically.

The earliest and most frequent manifestation of digoxin toxicity in infants and children is the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia. In children, the use of digoxin may produce any arrhythmia. The most common are conduction disturbances or supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, such as atrial tachycardia (with or without block) and junctional (nodal) tachycardia. Ventricular arrhythmias are less common. Sinus bradycardia may be a sign of impending digoxin intoxication, especially in infants, even in the absence of first-degree heart block. Any arrhythmias or alteration in cardiac conduction that develops in a child taking digoxin should initially be assumed to be a consequence of digoxin intoxication.

Given that adult patients with heart failure have some symptoms in common with digoxin toxicity, it may be difficult to distinguish digoxin toxicity from heart failure. Misidentification of their etiology might lead the clinician to continue or increase digoxin dosing, when dosing should actually be suspended. When the etiology of these signs and symptoms is not clear, measure serum digoxin levels.

5.4 Risk of Ventricular Arrhythmias During Electrical Cardioversion

It may be desirable to reduce the dose of or discontinue digoxin for 1 to 2 days prior to electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to avoid the induction of ventricular arrhythmias, but physicians must consider the consequences of increasing the ventricular response if digoxin is decreased or withdrawn. If digitalis toxicity is suspected, elective cardioversion should be delayed. If it is not prudent to delay cardioversion, the lowest possible energy level should be selected to avoid provoking ventricular arrhythmias.

Performance metrics

AF detection algorithms can be evaluated using several performance metrics. It is common for many studies to report sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Sensitivity is defined as the probability to detect true AF events, while the specificity measures the proportion of actual Non-AF instances correctly identified as such. Accuracy is a balanced metric of sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy of an AF detection algorithm is its ability to differentiate between AF and Non-AF cases. Generally, accuracy is the most common reported metric, along with the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). A ROC for differentiating AF vs Non-AF is generated by plotting sensitivity vs (1-specificity) at different classification thresholds. AUC is a measure of how well AF cases ranked higher than Non-AF cases. Since AF has a low prevalence it is generally required that PPG-based AF detectors show high precision (positive predictive value). Rather than reporting the AUC, the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is an alternative metric suitable for highly imbalanced data (i.e. low prevalence). In general, any reported performance metric should take into account the low prevalence of AF and be evaluated on an independent test dataset.
