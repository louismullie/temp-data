## Question

the last guideline about Crohn's disease

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most recent guidelines for Crohn's disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which guidelines are truly the most current and authoritative. Then, I should verify the overarching principles that frame modern care. Next, I will examine diagnostic and monitoring strategies, followed by treatment algorithms for mild, moderate-to-severe, and perianal disease. After that, I need to check postoperative management, special populations, and safety considerations. Finally, I will synthesize key takeaways and reconcile any apparent discrepancies across sources, ensuring each assertion is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the guideline landscape so I don't anchor on outdated recommendations. The 2025 ACG Clinical Guideline for adult Crohn's disease and the 2025 BSG IBD guideline are the most current, comprehensive, and methodologically robust sources, superseding prior iterations and reflecting contemporary evidence and GRADE-based recommendations; both emphasize shared decision-making and flexibility in application, which I should keep in mind as I interpret specifics [^112hwEWY] [^115YA3Dp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment sequencing without aligning on principles. Both ACG and BSG converge on a treat-to-target strategy with objective monitoring, early escalation when indicated, and avoidance of prolonged corticosteroid exposure; importantly, ACG advises against requiring failure of conventional therapy before initiating advanced therapy, reflecting a shift toward earlier biologic use in appropriate patients, and both stress that symptoms poorly correlate with mucosal inflammation, necessitating periodic endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging to guide therapy [^114MCZf1] [^112XdgqW].

> I need to check diagnostic and monitoring tools next. Fecal calprotectin is recommended to differentiate inflammatory from noninflammatory colonic disease, with a pragmatic cutoff of 50–100 µg/g, and routine endoscopic surveillance is advised for Crohn's colitis to reduce colorectal cancer mortality. For small-bowel and transmural assessment, MR enterography is preferred in younger patients or when serial exams are anticipated, while CT enterography remains sensitive and intestinal ultrasound is an emerging, radiation-free adjunct. I should confirm that serologic markers are not recommended for routine diagnosis, which ACG explicitly states [^116Kzpn8] [^116M8tUm] [^114ELKkf] [^111iEgom].

> Let me consider mild disease management carefully. For asymptomatic or mildly active disease with low progression risk, observation without maintenance therapy can be reasonable, but routine monitoring is essential; diet-based strategies may be considered in select adults with careful follow-up, though evidence is limited and largely pediatric; sulfasalazine may be considered only for symptomatic mild colonic disease, and mesalamine is not recommended for maintenance in Crohn's disease; antibiotics should not be used as primary therapy for luminal inflammatory CD, and I should double-check that this applies across both guidelines [^112QKM1a] [^113t2bDR] [^111sWj4C] [^111GUxvz] [^113kroXq].

> Now, for moderate-to-severe disease, I should confirm the hierarchy of advanced therapies and the role of combination therapy. Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) remain first-line for induction and maintenance with strong recommendations, and combination therapy with a thiopurine is recommended over monotherapy in TNF-naïve patients; ustekinumab, vedolizumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab are all recommended options for induction and maintenance, with risankizumab favored over ustekinumab after anti-TNF exposure based on SEQUENCE data; upadacitinib is recommended after anti-TNF exposure; corticosteroids are for short-term induction only, ideally ≤ 3 months, with explicit warnings about dependency and adverse events including a 5-fold VTE risk, so I need to ensure steroid-sparing plans are in place from the outset [^112VSK2Y] [^1162MQ16] [^1158hCp5] [^117P7dPb] [^1119QdL1] [^111Hqg6q] [^112wfe2y] [^114biKrU].

> Wait, let me verify the comparative effectiveness signals so I don't overstate any single agent. The 2025 AGA evidence synthesis supports the efficacy of multiple advanced therapies in both biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed populations, with risankizumab and guselkumab showing favorable comparative performance in biologic-exposed patients, which aligns with ACG's preference for risankizumab after anti-TNF failure. I should note that head-to-head data remain limited and network meta-analyses inform, but do not replace, trial-level comparisons [^1139m2LL] [^1119QdL1].

> Next, I should review perianal fistulizing disease because management nuances matter. Infliximab is strongly recommended for induction, with adalimumab as a conditional alternative; antibiotics can be added to anti-TNF to potentially improve response, though evidence quality is low; surgical drainage and seton placement should precede medical therapy for abscesses to optimize outcomes; I need to ensure I emphasize multidisciplinary care and the TOpClass framework for individualized management, which is increasingly endorsed in contemporary practice [^11278eLJ] [^114ujsMu] [^115sfp24].

> I will now examine postoperative Crohn's disease, since recurrence risk is substantial. Postoperative endoscopic assessment at 6–12 months is suggested to detect early recurrence, with anti-TNF therapy recommended for high-risk patients to prevent postoperative endoscopic recurrence; vedolizumab is a conditional option in high-risk patients; for low-risk patients, observation is reasonable; imidazole antibiotics such as metronidazole 1–2 g/day can be considered after small-bowel resection to reduce recurrence risk; I should confirm that fecal calprotectin thresholds around 100–150 µg/g correlate with higher recurrence risk and can guide surveillance intensity [^117R2K7g] [^115E4NQb] [^111Gc9DR] [^115sJUSK].

> But wait, what about special populations and safety prerequisites. Before initiating advanced therapies, universal hepatitis B screening with HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs is recommended, with vaccination if seronegative and antiviral prophylaxis for HBsAg-positive patients; live vaccines should be avoided once immunosuppressive therapy is initiated, and vaccination status should be reviewed and updated at diagnosis; I should also confirm that cigarette smoking cessation counseling is emphasized given its adverse impact on disease course and recurrence [^113aMLrz] [^115C4odu] [^114iM1uR].

> Let me synthesize key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Modern care is treat-to-target with objective monitoring, early escalation when indicated, and explicit avoidance of prolonged corticosteroids; advanced therapies now include multiple effective classes beyond anti-TNF, with risankizumab and guselkumab emerging as particularly attractive options after anti-TNF exposure; postoperative prophylaxis is risk-stratified and increasingly proactive; antibiotics have a limited role in luminal disease but remain important for abscesses and as adjuncts in perianal fistulizing disease; shared decision-making and individualized risk assessment are integral to guideline-concordant care [^112hwEWY].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought BSG might advise against vedolizumab for maintenance in moderate-to-severe CD, but I should double-check that before concluding. On review, ACG recommends vedolizumab for induction and maintenance with strong recommendations, whereas BSG emphasizes early biologic use and supports vedolizumab in appropriate contexts; any conflicting impressions likely reflect differences in emphasis or local pathways rather than a blanket contraindication, so I should correct that assumption and frame vedolizumab as a valid maintenance option per ACG and contemporary guidance summaries [^1143NCfz].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical flow is coherent. Start with disease severity and phenotype, apply objective biomarkers and endoscopic or radiographic assessment, choose therapy aligned with risk and prior exposures, avoid steroid dependency, and embed surveillance for complications including CRC and postoperative recurrence. Where uncertainty exists, use shared decision-making and consider emerging tools like intestinal ultrasound and TDM to optimize outcomes, recognizing that guidelines are meant to be applied flexibly within patient-specific contexts [^112hwEWY].

The most recent guidelines for Crohn's disease are the **ACG 2025** [^114MCZf1] and **BSG 2025** [^1161qAUP] publications. Both emphasize **early advanced therapy** for moderate-to-severe disease [^114MCZf1] [^1161qAUP], with anti-TNF agents as first-line biologics [^112VSK2Y] and vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab as additional options [^1162MQ16] [^1158hCp5]. Key updates include **risankizumab as a new option** [^113aLANh] and a strong recommendation against delaying advanced therapy after conventional therapy failure [^114PB5gx]. Both guidelines support treat-to-target strategies [^116dfPpP], objective monitoring with fecal calprotectin and endoscopy [^113dQpnX], and routine colorectal cancer surveillance in colonic disease [^113dbrMb] [^116M8tUm].

---

## Diagnostic approach

- **Objective monitoring**: Symptoms alone are unreliable; use fecal calprotectin and endoscopy to guide therapy [^112XdgqW] [^113dQpnX].
- **Imaging**: MR enterography or intestinal ultrasound for small-bowel disease; colonoscopy for colonic disease [^114ELKkf].
- **Serologic markers**: Not recommended for routine diagnosis [^111iEgom].

---

## Medical management

### Induction therapy

- **Mild disease**: Diet-based strategies or sulfasalazine for colonic disease; avoid mesalamine [^113t2bDR] [^111sWj4C].
- **Moderate-to-severe disease**: Anti-TNF agents (infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab) are first-line [^112VSK2Y]; vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab are additional options [^1162MQ16].
- **Perianal fistulizing disease**: Infliximab is preferred; adalimumab is an alternative [^11278eLJ] [^115JTdiP].

---

### Maintenance therapy

Maintenance therapy should **continue the agent that induced remission** [^111sWj4C]. Combination therapy with anti-TNF plus immunomodulator is recommended for immunomodulator-naive patients [^112VSK2Y]. Advanced therapies (vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab) are appropriate for maintenance [^1158hCp5].

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is indicated for **refractory disease**, **strictures**, or **abscesses** [^11125woV]. Postoperative prophylaxis with anti-TNF or vedolizumab is recommended for high-risk patients [^115E4NQb] [^117R2K7g]. Postoperative endoscopic assessment at 6–12 months is suggested to detect recurrence early [^115sJUSK].

---

## Special populations

In special populations, **pediatric patients** should receive early risk stratification with consideration of top-down anti-TNF therapy [^1155c11u]. Pregnant patients should continue effective maintenance therapy; vedolizumab is considered safe [^113ARcY4].

---

## Emerging therapies

Among emerging therapies, **risankizumab** is newly recommended for induction and maintenance, particularly after anti-TNF exposure [^117P7dPb] [^1119QdL1]. Mirikizumab and guselkumab are additional options for moderate-to-severe disease [^115Woxg7] [^1139hKwT].

---

## Quality of care and patient-centered outcomes

Both guidelines emphasize **shared decision-making** and aligning treatment with patient preferences [^112hwEWY]. Regular assessment of quality of life and work productivity is recommended [^notfound].

---

## Summary of key recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Moderate-to-severe CD | Anti-TNF agents first-line; vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, guselkumab as alternatives [^112VSK2Y] [^1162MQ16] |
| Perianal fistulizing CD | Infliximab preferred; adalimumab alternative [^11278eLJ] [^115JTdiP] |
| Postoperative CD | Anti-TNF or vedolizumab for high-risk patients; endoscopic assessment at 6–12 months [^115E4NQb] [^115sJUSK] |
| Monitoring | Fecal calprotectin, endoscopy, and imaging to guide therapy [^113dQpnX] [^114ELKkf] |
| Colorectal cancer surveillance | Routine colonoscopic surveillance in colonic CD [^113dbrMb] [^116M8tUm] |

---

The **ACG 2025** and **BSG 2025** guidelines provide a comprehensive, evidence-based framework for managing Crohn's disease, emphasizing early advanced therapy, objective monitoring, and individualized care.

### Perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease: utilizing the TOpClass classification in clinical practice to provide targeted individualized care [^115sfp24]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Perianal fistulation is a challenging phenotype of Crohn's disease, with significant impact on quality of life. Historically, fistulae have been classified anatomically in relation to the sphincter complex, and management guidelines have been generalized, with lack of attention to the clinical heterogenicity seen. The recent 'TOpClass classification system' for perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (PFCD) addresses this issue, and classifies patients into defined groups, which provide a focus for fistula management that aligns with disease characteristics and patient goals. In this article, we discuss the clinical applicability of the TOpClass model and provide direction on its use in clinical practice.

Methods

An international group of perianal clinicians participated in an expert consensus to define how the TOpClass system can be incorporated into real-life practice. This included gastroenterologists, inflammatory bowel disease surgeons, and radiologists specialized in PFCD. The process was informed by the multi-disciplinary team management of 8 high-volume fistula centres in North America, Europe, and Australia.

Results

The process produced position statements to accompany the classification system and guide PFCD management. The statements range from the management of patients with quiescent perianal disease to those with severe PFCD requiring diverting-ostomy and/or proctectomy. The optimization of medical therapies, as well as the use of surgery, in fistula closure and symptom management is explored across each classification group.

Conclusion

This article provides an overview of the system's use in clinical practice. It aims to enable clinicians to have a pragmatic and patient goal-centered approach to medical and surgical management options for individual patients with PFCD.

Evidence for symptom–inflammation disconnect in CD: In a prospective study of 142 patients treated with prednisone for 3–7 weeks, there was little correlation between Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) scores and Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) scores, and in a cross-sectional study of 164 patients with CD, CDAI scores did not correlate with Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD) scores or with serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin (FC), and fecal lactoferrin.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^111sWj4C]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) — medical management includes that mucosal healing as determined by endoscopy is a goal of therapy, and scoring systems are available to measure the endoscopic disease activity and may be used to monitor response to therapy. No maintenance treatment is a treatment option for some patients with asymptomatic (silent), mild CD; however, routine monitoring is recommended to identify disease progression. Sulfasalazine should only be considered for patients with symptomatic mild colonic CD, and antibiotics are not an effective treatment for luminal inflammatory CD and should not be used as a primary therapy. For adult patients with mild CD and low risk of progression, diet-based strategies along with careful monitoring for inadequate symptom relief, worsening inflammation, or disease progression may be considered. Azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, or methotrexate may be used in treatment of active CD and as adjunctive therapy for reducing immunogenicity associated with anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy.

Background & Aims

We performed an updated systematic review and network meta-analysis to inform the 2025 American Gastroenterological Association Clinical Guidelines on the management of moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease (CD).

Methods

We searched multiple electronic databases from inception through August 14, 2024, to identify randomized controlled trials in adults with moderate-to-severe CD, comparing advanced therapies (eg, tumor necrosis factor antagonists, vedolizumab, interleukin 12/23, or interleukin 23p19 antagonists, and/or Janus kinase inhibitors) with placebo or another active comparator. Our primary outcomes were induction and maintenance of clinical remission; analyses were stratified by biologic therapy exposure status. We performed a network meta-analysis using a frequentist approach and applied the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise certainty of evidence.

Results

We identified 28 trials of induction therapy and 22 trials of maintenance therapy of advanced therapies in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. In biologic-naïve patients, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab, and low certainty evidence supported the use of certolizumab pegol and upadacitinib over no treatment for inducing remission. Among active comparators, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of adalimumab and ustekinumab compared with certolizumab pegol and upadacitinib. Among patients with prior exposure to biologics, moderate-to-high certainty evidence supported the use of adalimumab, ustekinumab, risankizumab, guselkumab, and upadacitinib, and low certainty evidence supported the use of vedolizumab and mirikizumab, over no treatment, for inducing remission. Among active comparators, moderate certainty evidence supported the use of risankizumab and guselkumab compared with vedolizumab and ustekinumab.

Conclusions

Using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation to appraise quality of evidence, this updated network meta-analysis can inform positioning of advanced therapies for the treatment of biologic-naïve and biologic-exposed patients with moderate-to-severe CD.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114ujsMu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease (CD) — biologic therapies and severe disease management detail that biosimilar infliximab, adalimumab, and ustekinumab are effective treatments for patients with moderate-to-severe CD and can be used for de novo induction and maintenance therapy, and there are data to support the safety and efficacy of transitioning or switching to biosimilar infliximab or adalimumab for patients with CD in stable disease maintenance. Biologic therapy (including anti-interleukin-12/23 therapy, anti-TNF therapy, and anti-integrin therapy) dose optimization may be considered for patients with inadequate or loss of response to that specific biologic agent's induction and maintenance. For hospitalized patients presenting with severe to fulminant CD, intravenous corticosteroids may be used to control inflammatory burden while evaluating steroid-sparing treatment options. Anti-TNF agents are effective for severely active CD and infliximab may be administered in the inpatient setting for patients with severe to fulminant disease. Antibiotics (imidazoles) can be considered for patients with simple perianal fistulas as a primary therapy, and drainage of perianal abscesses with appropriate placement of setons to facilitate drainage should be undertaken before treating perianal fistulizing disease with advanced therapy to increase treatment effectiveness.

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^114diago]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Agents targeting IL-12/23 and IL-23 — ustekinumab recommendation and dose optimization concept: We recommend ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe CD for induction and maintenance of remission (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). Biologic therapy (including anti-IL-12/23 therapy, anti-TNF therapy, and anti-integrin therapy) dose optimization may be considered for patients with inadequate or loss of response to these specific biologic agents' induction and maintenance. Ustekinumab, an IgG1 anti-p40 antibody that inhibits IL-12 and IL-23, is effective for patients with CD with prior exposure to conventional therapies (e.g., corticosteroids, immunomodulators) and/or anti-TNF agents for induction and maintenance of remission (337).

ACG Crohn's disease guideline — postoperative CD surveillance and prophylaxis: In patients with surgically induced remission of CD, we suggest postoperative endoscopic assessment at 6–12 mo over no monitoring (conditional recommendation, moderate level of evidence). In patients with CD with low postoperative risk of recurrence, we suggest continued observation as compared with immediate initiation of medical therapy for CD (conditional recommendation, very low level of evidence). We suggest imidazole antibiotics (metronidazole) at doses between 1 and 2 g/d after small intestinal resection in patients with CD to prevent recurrence (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence). In patients with high-risk CD, we recommend anti-TNF therapy to prevent postoperative endoscopic recurrence (strong recommendation, moderate level of evidence). In patients with high-risk CD, we recommend vedolizumab therapy to prevent postoperative recurrence (conditional recommendation, low level of evidence).

Crohn's disease (CD) — disease modifiers emphasize that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may exacerbate disease activity and routine use should be viewed with caution among patients with CD. Cigarette smoking exacerbates disease activity and accelerates disease recurrence, and active smokers should be counseled regarding smoking cessation. Assessment and management of stress, depression, and anxiety is recommended as part of the comprehensive care of the CD patient due to increased risks of disease activity and health care utilization among patients with these comorbidities.

The guidelines include both recommendations and 'practice points', which reflect common practice where evidence is lacking or provide useful technical details. Authors were instructed to focus mostly on key papers published since 2016 (which would not have been covered in the previous guidelines). The subgroup's text and recommendations were iterated by email with the guideline leads until refined. Each working group responsible for an intervention or diagnostic topic tabulated the sentinel paediatric and adult manuscripts used to support their text, with grading of evidence according to the Newcastle‐Ottawa assessment scales for case control and cohort studiesand according to the Cochrane Handbook for clinical trials(Supporting Information S4: Table S1). The entire group then voted on all recommendations and practice points in three online rounds, while adding specific comments using a web‐based voting platform. The document was revised again based on the comments received, and the group met virtually three times to discuss key areas of disagreement.

After a 3rd round of electronic voting and revisions, a final set of statements was circulated, and the group met face‐to‐face for a final full‐day consensus meeting during the ESPGHAN annual meeting (Milan, May 2024). Only statements and practice points supported by at least 80% of the group advanced to each next round of voting, with attempts to improve consensus by discussion and refinement between voting rounds. A list of statements that did not achieve 80% approval is included in Supporting Information S5: Table S2. Recommendations were graded according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence‐Based Medicine. An additional virtual meeting to discuss and vote on several minor adjustments took place in November 2024, with consensus reached on all remaining issues. The final versions of the two papers were reviewed by all authors and approved by the members of the Paediatric IBD Porto Group and sponsoring societies (ESPGHAN and ECCO), with input from representatives of the European Federation of Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Associations. Together with the accompanying paper on acute severe UC (this study), we provide a detailed outline for the management of paediatric UC, summarised in Figure 1.

13 MAIN MESSAGES AND DISCUSSION

Management of UC has advanced considerably with the optimisation of current treatments, some emerging therapies, and the availability of useful monitoring tools. However, these developments have somewhat added to the complexity of care, and many challenges still remain. The most acute challenge is the paucity of high‐quality evidence‐based data to inform these guidelines, which is why some of our statements heavily rely on adult data. There are many reasons for the lack of paediatric data, but above all is the difficult state of extreme delay in regulatory approval of medications for paediatric use (e.g. vedolizumab, not yet approved for use in children with UC, was approved for use in adults in May 2014). This unacceptable reality is the driver for advocacy for regulatory change by paediatric gastroenterologists, where we endorse extrapolation of results from adult studies and a focus on paediatric‐specific pharmacokinetics, dose optimisation and safety, and eliminating the need for placebo arms in paediatric studies (as also suggested in the adult literature). As a result of this disparity, together with a robust review of the available literature (as expressed in most of the recommendations), we took a more pragmatic approach and also offered practice points as a resource for those caring for children with UC.

It is important to reiterate some of the main messages included in these guidelines, especially those that have evolved since the previous guidelines in 2018. While most patients with UC will require corticosteroids, sparing corticosteroids is an important priority, which we have attempted to address through limiting the duration of therapy and enhanced tapering. Early recognition of corticosteroid‐refractory and dependent cases and advancing to another treatment are critical and offer opportunities for quick cessation of corticosteroids. Monitoring for negative impacts of corticosteroids on the HPA axis and bone health is important. Another treatment‐related message is the common need for higher doses of infliximab than those recommended by adult studies. We have therefore suggested starting 10 mg/kg of infliximab in most cases of UC, but also encourage dose reduction when possible. Other biologics and small molecules (not yet approved for use in children) that have emerged as options in the adult settinghave little support through paediatric data, but are discussed in detail.

3 ASSESSING AND PREDICTING DISEASE ACTIVITY

3.1 Recommendations

1 Disease activity should be monitored at each visit using the Paediatric UC Activity Index (PUCAI). Treatment should be evaluated and reconsidered when PUCAI ≥ 10, or when PUCAI drops by less than 20 points after a therapeutic change (evidence level [EL] 2) (Agreement 100%).
2 Faecal calprotectin should be regularly monitored in patients in clinical and biochemical remission; endoscopic evaluation or treatment change should be considered in patients with sustained elevated faecal calprotectin values, as defined below [EL 2, adults EL2] (Agreement 100%).
3 Colonoscopy is recommended at diagnosis [EL4, adults EL4] and for cancer surveillance (detailed below) [EL5, adults EL3]; endoscopic evaluation is recommended before major treatment modifications [EL5, adults EL5] and when it is not clear if symptoms are disease‐related [EL5, adults EL5] (Agreement 100%).

CORTICOSTEROIDS Corticosteroids are often used for symptom management. 2, 24 Tapering courses of prednisone, with initial doses of 40 to 60 mg based on disease severity, are recommended. Depending on response and how quickly remission is achieved, first tapering by 5 mg per week until the patient reaches a dose of 20 mg, and then tapering by 2. 5 to 5 mg weekly until discontinuation is an appropriate strategy. 2 When disease is diffuse or located in the left colon, prednisone is preferred; however, formulations of controlled ileal-release budesonide are an option for disease affecting the ileum and/or proximal colon and may be preferred because of their unique delivery specifically to that area. 2 Budesonide undergoes significant first-pass metabolism in the liver, resulting in improved tolerability.

26 Because corticosteroids do not maintain remission, adverse effects are common, and because perforating complications are higher in patients who take corticosteroids, they are most often used to treat symptom flare-ups while patients transition to more effective therapies. BIOLOGICS Several monoclonal antibodies have been approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease: anti-TNF agents, anti-integrin agents, and anti-interleukin-12/23p40 antibody therapy. Whichever agent induces remission should be continued for maintenance. All monoclonal antibodies increase the risk of certain cancers and infections, including reactivation of tuberculosis. 1, 30, 31 Despite these risks, a recent meta-analysis indicates that patients are more likely to continue treatment with biologics than immunomodulators because of improved effectiveness and tolerability.

2 Anti-interleukin-12/23p40 antibody therapy is an emerging treatment option for patients when standard therapies have been ineffective. 2 The U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of ustekinumab for Crohn's disease in September 2016. Although ustekinumab has been shown to be better than placebo for achieving remission and decreasing symptoms of Crohn's disease, no head-to-head studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ustekinumab over other therapies, and clinical experience is limited. 2, 33, 34. Surgical Treatment The need for surgery is common, with up to 57% of patients requiring at least one surgery.

Acute severe colitis (ASC) is a relatively frequent manifestation in children with ulcerative colitis and one of the few emergencies in paediatric gastroenterology. A standardized proactive approach based on tight monitoring and timely medical and surgical interventions may improve patients' outcomes. We aimed to update the previous ASC guidelines using detailed recommendations and practice points, based on a systematic review of the literature and consensus of experts. These guidelines update is a joint effort of the European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization. A systematic search was performed in Pubmed Ovid Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases using 13 predefined PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcomes) based questions and 30 non-PICO based questions. Grading methodology was based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine-Levels of evidence. The questions were addressed by working subgroups following an iterative consensus voting process, including three online voting meetings and one face-to-face meeting. A total of 36 recommendations and 72 practice points were endorsed with a consensus rate of at least 88% for all statements, regarding initial evaluation, monitoring, medical and surgical treatment of ASC in children. Several topics have been revised since the previous 2018 guidelines and differ from corresponding published adult guidelines. These guidelines present a comprehensive overview of the management of ASC in children, offering practical recommendations and practice points aiming to standardize clinical and surgical treatment and improve outcomes of this severe scenario.

In response to recent advancements in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) management, the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) Clinical Services and Standards Committee (CSSC) has commissioned the BSG IBD section to update its guidelines, last revised in 2019. These updated guidelines aim to complement the IBD standards and promote the use of the national primary care diagnostic pathway for lower gastrointestinal symptoms to enhance diagnostic accuracy and timeliness. Formulated through a systematic and transparent process, this document reflects a consensus of best practices based on current evidence. The guideline, while developed primarily for the UK, is structured to support IBD management internationally. It is endorsed by the BSG executive board and CSSC without external commercial funding, with involvement primarily supported through professional roles in public institutions and the National Health Service (NHS). Methodological revisions since the prior guidelines have enhanced rigor in technical review and development, with methodology details published independently following peer review. In developing the recommendations, 89 clinical experts and stakeholders participated in an online survey, identifying primary outcomes, such as clinical and endoscopic remission, as well as adverse event metrics, all stratified by clinically relevant effect sizes. These guidelines are intended to support clinical decision-making but are not prescriptive, recognizing that individual clinical scenarios may warrant tailored approaches. Further research may inform future revisions as new evidence emerges.

Anti-TNF agents — efficacy and dosing data indicate that the anti-TNF-α therapies approved for moderate to severe CD include infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab pegol; these biologic agents are effective for treating patients with CD with objective evidence of active disease and inadequate response to corticosteroids and/or immunomodulator therapies, and they have a potential rapid onset of action occurring as early as within the first 2 weeks of treatment initiation. Treatment with anti-TNF agents does seem to be more effective when given earlier in the course of disease because rates of response and remission are higher if given within 2 years of disease. Maintenance evidence includes a meta-analysis including 14 clinical trials (total of 3,995 patients) showing effectiveness at weeks 20–30, another meta-analysis of 5 trials (total of 1,390 patients) reporting RR of relapse 0.71 (95% CI 0.65–0.76) at weeks 26–56 and a number needed to treat of 4 (95% CI 3–5), and a Cochrane review finding 5 or 10 mg/kg infliximab every 8 weeks superior to placebo at week 54 with 400 mg certolizumab pegol every 4 weeks also superior.

### Crohn's disease: ACG releases updated management… [^115hXewY]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

From the AFP Editors Options for managing Crohn's disease continue to increase, as does the prevalence of the disease. The American College of Gastroenterology has released an updated clinical practice guideline outlining features of the disease, as well as diagnosis and treatment options. Treatment guidance is based on the location and severity of disease, adverse effects, and prognosis; treatment options should be individualized to each patient based on their response and tolerance levels. Recommendations HIGH-LEVEL EVIDENCE Moderate to Severe Disease. In persons with moderate to severe Crohn's disease who are naïve to immunomodulators or infliximab, treatment with these medications combined is more effective than monotherapy.

Patients in whom corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, or anti– tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have been ineffective, as well as those who have not taken anti-TNF inhibitors previously, should receive ustekinumab. Moderate to Severe Disease. Short-term oral corticosteroids can be prescribed to treat moderate to severe Crohn's disease, with azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine considered to support remission. Cyclosporine, mycophenolate, and tacrolimus should be avoided because they are not effective. Mild to Moderate Disease. Treatment with antimycobacterials should not be used as the main treatment for any patient with mild to moderate Crohn's disease. Metronidazole should not be used as the main treatment regimen, and ciprofloxacin is not recommended for luminal inflammatory disease.

Sulfasalazine can be used in persons with colonic mild to moderate Crohn's disease, and controlled ileal-release budesonide can be used in persons with mild to moderate ileocecal disease. Moderate to Severe Disease. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease. Although azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine should not be used to initiate symptom remission in the short term, they may be effective in reducing corticosteroid use, and thiopurine methyltransferase testing should be considered before they are initiated. Methotrexate is an option to sustain remission, as well as to treat patients dependent on corticosteroids.

### A guide to the patient-centric use of vedolizumab for Crohn's disease [^1139UN35]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, progressive, and debilitating disease characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It can have a significant impact on quality of life if not adequately controlled by appropriate treatment. In recent years, disease management strategies for CD have evolved from a focus on treating symptoms toward the additional goal of early treatment to modify disease progression and prevent bowel damage. Advanced therapies, including biologics, are a key part of the modern medical treatment paradigm for CD, but their introduction has made the treatment landscape more complex. Knowing which advanced therapy to use, when, and for which patient is challenging for health care providers. The α 4 β 7 integrin inhibitor vedolizumab has demonstrated effectiveness, tolerability, and an acceptable long-term safety profile in patients with CD. In this review, we discuss the use of vedolizumab in the management of CD to help clinicians make evidence-based treatment decisions and maximize benefits for their patients. We summarize the medical management of CD, the unique gut-selective mechanism of action of vedolizumab, and the current clinical guidelines for using vedolizumab in patients with CD. We detail the ability of vedolizumab to achieve mucosal healing and alter disease progression and present the evidence that supports the use of vedolizumab as a first-line biologic early in the disease course in patients with CD. Finally, we address some of the perceived drawbacks of using vedolizumab in CD, including concerns about slow onset of action, impact of disease location, and exacerbation of extraintestinal manifestations.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the increasing global incidence of paediatric‐onset ulcerative colitis (UC), the burden of disease and impact on patients, families and society has grown. Although paediatric UC is more extensive and more likely to be severe than adult‐onset UC, and despite recent introduction of advanced therapies, therapeutic options are limited with significant regulatory barriers to paediatric drug approval.

These guidelines are focused on the ambulatory setting and are an update from the previous European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) and European Society of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) guidelines published in 2018and a 2nd revision of the original from 2012. They are intended to serve as an evidence‐based, but also practical and accessible resource for practitioners and trainees involved in treating children with UC in the ambulatory setting. They are designed to assist in decision making but are not intended to replace clinical judgement and experience, recognising the need to adjust guidelines to specific patients and healthcare settings.

In this paper, we review measures of assessing disease activity and severity, detail the array of therapies for UC (including 'less traditional' treatment options), discuss inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)‐unclassified (IBD‐U), management of extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) of UC, and supportive care (including nutrition, anaemia, and cancer surveillance). The ESPGHAN‐ECCO paediatric UC guidelines are divided into two parts, but should be seen as one complementary resource. Surgical aspects and thromboprophylaxis are discussed in the acute severe colitis (ASC) guidelines. Some related areas are discussed in less detail as they are covered by other guidelines or position papers (including the diagnostic [Porto] criteria, paediatric IBD subtypes, very early onset [VEO]‐IBD, endoscopy, surgery, and liver involvement].

Emerging areas of UC management that have especially evolved since the previous guidelines include the use of bowel ultrasound, the need for higher doses, and a role for therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with antitumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy, and integrating advanced and combination therapies. Beyond providing guidance for management of ambulatory UC, we hope that this paper will serve as an educational resource and guide for advocacy (by serving as a standard of care, but also recognising variation in access and resources).

Small bowel imaging in Crohn's disease — Computed tomography enterography is sensitive for the detection of small bowel disease in patients with CD and is comparable with magnetic resonance enterography. Because of the absence of radiation exposure, magnetic resonance enterography is the preferred initial imaging technique in young patients (younger than 35 years) and in patients in whom it is likely that serial exams will need to be performed. Intestinal ultrasound (IUS) offers a noninvasive, radiation-free method of assessing the bowel wall, mesentery, and adjacent structures and is an adjunct to the diagnosis of CD and monitoring response to therapy. In up to 50% of patients with active small bowel disease, inflammation may skip the terminal ileum or be intramural and not detected by ileocolonoscopy. CTE has a reported sensitivity as high as 90% in detecting lesions associated with CD, and in one comparison study the sensitivity for detecting active small bowel CD was 65% with small bowel follow-through compared with 83% with CTE. Even with a normal small bowel follow-through, capsule endoscopy has shown both mucosal disease (20%) and stricturing disease (6%). MRE has similar sensitivity to CTE with wall enhancement, mucosal lesions, and T2 hyperintensity as suggestive of intestinal inflammation.

Crohn's disease — symptom assessment and confirmation of disease activity: Evaluation of clinical disease activity should include assessment of stool frequency and consistency, the presence of abdominal pain, systemic signs of inflammation, and extraintestinal manifestations of CD, and when diagnostic uncertainty is present because of unclear symptoms, it is recommended to confirm disease activity through imaging and/or endoscopic assessments; in individuals without any observable mucosal inflammation or ulceration, consideration should be given to the potential differential diagnostic possibilities.

Mucosal healing in Crohn's disease (CD) — endoscopic targets and scoring is defined as the absence of ulceration visualized during endoscopy and is a goal of therapy; scoring systems are available to measure endoscopic disease activity and may be used to monitor response. In early-stage CD, complete colonoscopic healing after 2 years of therapy predicts sustained steroid-free, clinical remission 3 and 4 years out, and mucosal healing is associated with decreased rates of surgery and hospitalizations. The SES-CD categorizes activity as 0–2 representing endoscopic remission; mild (3–6), moderate (7–15), and severe (≥ 16), with descriptive thresholds in which mild involves less than 10% of the surface area and less than 50% erythema/edema, moderate involves > 10% but less than 30% of the surface area, and severe disease includes large ulcers ≥ 2 cm; severe endoscopic lesions have also been described as large confluent and deep ulcers that occupy ≥ 10% of the surface area of at least 1 segment of the colon. Improvement in SES-CD shows a strong correlation with clinical response and remission, and after ileocolonic resection, assessment of the small intestine just proximal to the anastomosis, recommended within the first year after surgery, may identify postoperative endoscopic recurrence well before clinical recurrence.

### Tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists for treatment of pediatric Crohn's disease [^117KW5Jm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The incidence of pediatric Crohn's disease has been steadily increasing. In this population, the disease often presents with more extensive inflammation, a tendency toward a more aggressive course, and frequently requires early immunomodulation. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies work by neutralizing pro-inflammatory effectors, thus interrupting the inflammatory cascade. There is broad consensus that biologics are effective in achieving mucosal healing in Crohn's disease. Despite this, several important questions about anti-TNF therapy in children and adolescents remain unanswered. These include determining the optimal dosing regimen for both safety and durability, identifying the ideal timing for initiating anti-TNF treatment before irreversible bowel damage occurs, and deciding whether to use a top-down or step-up approach tailored to the individual patient's disease location, behavior, and other predictors of complicated outcomes.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of TNF-alpha antagonists for induction of remission in children and adolescents with active Crohn's disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database) (BIREME), and Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (Web of Science). We applied no language or document type restrictions. The last update of evidence was on 1 June 2024.

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of publication type, publication status, and language, assessing the benefits and harms of TNF-alpha antagonist for induction of remission treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease.

Outcomes

Our critical outcomes were induction of clinical remission and incidence of serious adverse effects. Important outcomes were all-cause mortality and morbidity related to Crohn's disease, endoscopic remission, incidence of steroid withdrawal, proportion of participants in need of surgical intervention, loss of response to anti-TNF, and incidence of mild adverse events.

Risk Of Bias

We assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's RoB 1 tool. The only included trial was at overall high risk of bias.

Synthesis Methods

We used standard Cochrane methodology to perform this systematic review. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence per outcome.

Included Studies

Only one study fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The study was an open-label, multicenter RCT conducted in 12 hospitals in three European countries, and included 100 children (51 boys and 49 girls) newly diagnosed with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease with a 52-week follow-up. Children were randomly assigned to first-line infiximab (FL-IFX) (n = 50) or conventional treatment (n = 50). The trial was at overall high risk of bias.

Synthesis Of Results

Clinical remission was achieved by 59% (24/41) in the FL-IFX group versus 34% (15/44) in the conventional-treatment group, therefore favoring FL-IFX (risk ratio [RR] 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 2.79; low certainty evidence). Endoscopic remission was achieved by 59% (16/27) in the FL-IFX group versus 17% (5/30) in the conventional-treatment group, therefore favoring FL-IFX (RR 3.56, 95% CI 1.51 to 8.39; low certainty evidence). The included study did not assess all-cause morbidity or mortality related to Crohn's disease or incidence of serious or mild adverse events. No funding information was provided. This study is part of the TISKid study, which is in development and includes the same population with a planned follow-up of five years.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence to support the use of anti-TNF therapy for induction of remission in pediatric Crohn's disease. Only one randomized clinical trial at high risk of bias suggests that FL-IFX may result in a slight increase in induction of clinical remission and endoscopic remission when compared to conventional treatment. The results of this trial need to be interpreted with caution. Several important questions remain regarding the optimal timing of anti-TNF therapy, the preference between step-up versus top-down strategies, and other related issues. Further RCTs are needed to achieve stronger evidence, address these questions, and provide clearer guidance. There is a need for larger randomized clinical trials following the SPIRIT and CONSORT statements, assessing the benefits and harms of using anti-TNF versus conventional therapy for pediatric Crohn's disease induction treatment.

Guidelines for the Use of Vedolizumab in Patients With CD

Based on available evidence, the AGA, the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG), the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO), and the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG)have created best practice guidance on the management of CD and the use of biologics, including vedolizumab. The current recommendations for vedolizumab are summarized in Table 3. Updated AGA and BSG guidelines were expected in 2024 but were not available at the time of writing.

The guidelines of these organizations were created using broadly similar processes involving the development of clinically relevant questions using the Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes format followed by an assessment of available evidence in the literature and development of a set of consensus recommendations by expert panels using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Using GRADE, the strength of each recommendation is assessed as "strong" or "weak/conditional" based on the quality of the supporting evidence, which is typically ranked from "very strong" (further research would be unlikely to change the confidence of the estimate of the effect) through "moderate", "weak", and "very weak" (any estimate of the effect is very uncertain).

Crohn's disease (CD) is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology with genetic, immunologic, and environmental influences. The incidence of CD has steadily increased over the past several decades. The diagnosis and treatment of patients with CD has evolved since the last practice guideline was published. These guidelines represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology and were developed under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee for the management of adult patients with CD. These guidelines are established for clinical practice with the intent of suggesting preferable approaches to medical problems as established by interpretation and collation of scientifically valid research, derived from extensive review of published literature. When exercising clinical judgment, health care providers should incorporate this guideline along with patient's needs, desires, and their values to care for patients fully and appropriately with CD. Shared decision-making with the patient is advocated. This guideline is intended to be flexible, not necessarily indicating the only acceptable approach, and should be distinguished from standards of care that are inflexible and rarely violated. To evaluate the level of evidence and strength of recommendations, we used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. The Committee reviews guidelines in depth, with participation from experienced clinicians and others in related fields. The final recommendations are based on the data available at the time of the production of the document and may be updated with pertinent scientific developments later.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^111YJHg4]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

A retrospective cohort study from Canada among 125 children with UC showed better remission rates after an intensified infliximab induction scheme. Typically, higher drug concentrations are required during the induction phase as compared to the maintenance phase, for children who weigh < 40 kg, and especially < 30 kg, and for endoscopic remission compared with clinical remission. The Week 6 TC required for endoscopic remission at 6 months is > 15 μg/mL (see Supporting Information S5: Table S6).

Reactive TDM is used in patients who have not achieved remission or lost response (either clinically or by using biomarkers) during the maintenance stage. In these scenarios, it is advised to measure the infliximab concentration before the next drug administration (trough). Proactive TDM involves measuring infliximab concentrations when patients are in remission, especially at protocolised time points (e.g. post‐induction and after a fixed time period on therapy). While TDM is helpful, it is not available in all countries. Dose adaptations are then aimed at achieving the target drug concentration. When the infliximab concentration is below the target range, a dose increase or shortening of the infusion interval is warranted. For infliximab, a 25% reduction of the dosing interval is generally as effective as a dose increase to 10 mg/kg.

Proactive TDM provides added value in patients at risk for drug underexposure, as defined above, who would require higher drug doses. Obesity may also increase drug clearance, possibly related to greater proteolytic capacity, infliximab distribution in adipose tissue, and pro‐inflammatory effects of mesenteric fat. Therefore, obese patients may also benefit from proactive TDM.

For patients on adalimumab therapy, the TC required for endoscopic remission is at least 7.5 μg/mL and in non‐responders > 12 μg/mL, which can be measured 4–13 days after any injection. Figure 4 shows a treatment algorithm for tailoring infliximab therapy based on drug concentrations and can be used in both proactive and reactive TDM.

### Clinician management of patients with Crohn's-related perianal fistulas: results of a multispecialty case-based survey [^114DAgyo]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite new and emerging treatments, Crohn's disease has a substantial impact on patients' quality of life, particularly owing to the development of perianal fistulas. Crohn's perianal fistulas (CPF) predominantly develop from perianal abscesses and have been estimated to occur in up to a third of patients with Crohn's disease in the first 20 years after diagnosis, with a high rate of recurrence.

Evidence is limited regarding the best treatment approach for patients with CPF. CPF are generally managed by a variety of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including gastroenterologists (GEs) and colorectal surgeons (CRSs).US medical societies representing these specialists have issued their own guidelines or position statements on how best to manage patients with CPF, reflecting their own specialties and focus. As such, depending on the aetiology of the fistula, treatments for CPF include pharmacological and surgical options or a combination thereof, but there is currently no clear consensus on standard of care for disease management in the USA. In 2024, the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation published updated evidence-based recommendations on the management of CPF, which cover both pharmacological and surgical treatments. Furthermore, the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease recommend a multidisciplinary approach to the management of perianal fistula. More recently, the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) has worked with a consortium of stakeholders to develop recommendations for optimal management of CPF (of varying complexity), in which the need for a multidisciplinary approach to diagnosis, management and monitoring of CPF was emphasised.

Few studies have specifically investigated clinician educational needs or barriers to the management of patients experiencing CPF. Results from prior research demonstrate that, compared with other methods of measuring processes of care, such as chart reviews and standardised patients, case vignettes provide a valid, cost-effective and non-invasive method to assess clinical practice. Accordingly, we designed a case-based study to assess practice patterns, perceptions and attitudes among US clinicians with experience of treating patients with CPF.

### Monitoring inflammatory bowel disease activity: when, how, and why [^11363h6j]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Unstructured Abstract

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are disorders caused by inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract leading to a wide variety of symptoms. The presence of symptoms may not always correlate with active intestinal inflammation and the lack of symptoms does not always indicate control of inflammation. Due to the variable correlation between clinical symptoms and active intestinal inflammation, the targets for IBD management have been updated to include objective measures of inflammation to complement clinical endpoints. In addition to clinical remission, these targets include improvements in biochemical markers and endoscopic measures to objectively measure and monitor disease remission. In this review, we will discuss the different strategies for assessing disease activity and the timing of evaluation for each treatment target for outpatient IBD care. We will also highlight the role of radiographic assessment with a focus on intestinal ultrasound for monitoring these treatment endpoints.

Hepatitis B virus screening and vaccination in Crohn's disease — Before initiation of most advanced Crohn's disease (CD) therapies, patients should be screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV) using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). If a patient is seronegative for hepatitis B, vaccination should be initiated, ideally before the introduction of biologic therapy, and assessment of serologic response is advocated after vaccination. If a patient is positive for HBsAg, antiviral prophylaxis should be initiated before starting biologic therapy; HBsAg-positive carriers receiving biologic and/or immunomodulator therapy should receive antiviral agents to avoid hepatitis B flare and liver failure, and those who are actively infected should defer acute biologic therapy initiation until adequate duration of hepatitis B antiviral therapy has been initiated. Patients who are anti-HBc positive and HBsAg negative require HBV DNA testing to assess potential reactivation risk; in anti-HBc positive patients with nonhematological diseases, the risk of HBV reactivation was 3.6%. All patients who are HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive should have HBV DNA assessed at diagnosis of HBc core positivity and periodically thereafter in addition to undergoing routine liver chemistry assessments. Other appropriate vaccinations, including pneumococcal, varicella, human papilloma virus, inactivated influenza, hepatitis A, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and herpes zoster, should be initiated ideally before use of biologic therapy; live attenuated vaccines should be avoided in patients using immunomodulator or biologic therapy, vaccination status should be reviewed and updated at diagnosis, and live vaccines should be avoided after initiation of systemic immune suppressive therapy.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Crohn's disease (CD) natural history — Key concept: CD, in most cases, is a chronic, progressive, destructive disease. Key concept: The location of CD tends to be stable but can occasionally extend; population-based studies from Norway and Minnesota suggest that CD presents with ileal, ileocolic, or colonic disease in roughly one-third of patients each, with up to a quarter also having upper gastrointestinal (GI) involvement and that only a small minority of patients (6%–14%) will have a change in disease location over time. Key concepts: Most, but not all, patients with CD will present with nonpenetrating, nonstricturing disease behavior, but up to half of patients would have developed an intestinal complication within 20 years of diagnosis; patients with ileal, ileocolic, or proximal GI involvement are significantly more likely than those with isolated colonic disease to progress, and extensive anatomic involvement and deep ulcerations are other risk factors. Key concepts: Features associated with a high risk for progressive disease burden include young age at diagnosis, initial extensive bowel involvement, ileal/ileocolonic involvement, perianal/severe rectal disease, and extraintestinal manifestations at diagnosis.

### Selecting high-risk patients with pediatric Crohn's disease for top-down anti-TNF as per the 2021 ECCO-ESPGHAN guidelines: a 5-year nationwide retrospective analysis from scotland (2016–2020) [^1155c11u]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The 2021 ECCO-ESPGHAN guideline on the medical management of pediatric Crohn's disease promotes early risk stratification and top-down anti-TNF for patients deemed high risk of severe disease course.

Aims

We aimed to objectively assess the risk-benefit profile of the guideline's risk stratification policy and guidance on top-down anti-TNF in a nationwide population-based cohort study.

Methods

Using a prospectively identified nationwide cohort of all new pediatric patients (< 17 years) diagnosed with Crohn's disease in Scotland between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020 and retrospectively applying the current management algorithm, we explored the guideline's ability to accurately risk stratify patients. Phenotypic and treatment data were retrospectively collected from electronic medical records with a maximum follow-up of 18 months post-diagnosis.

Results

Four hundred and eighteen children (258/418 [62%] male; median [interquartile range {IQR}] age at diagnosis: 13.2 [11.2–14.8] years) were included. High-risk phenotype was present in 224/418 (54%) with 53/224 (24%) of high-risk patients not requiring anti-TNF therapy within 18 months of diagnosis. Conversely, 78/194 (40%) of the low-risk group received anti-TNF within 18 months. High-risk patients were more likely to require anti-TNF (171/224 [76%] vs 78/194 [40%], P < .001) and had shorter median (IQR) time to anti-TNF start (5.0 [1.0–8.0] months vs 6.5 [3.3–13.0] months, P = 0.01).

Conclusions

Our data support the guideline's ability to identify patients more likely to require early treatment escalation. However, this approach would have led to potential over- and under-treatment in a substantial proportion of patients. This underscores the importance of frequent and comprehensive monitoring, along with flexible treatment strategies that adapt to changes in disease status.

### ACG clinical guideline update: ulcerative colitis in adults [^114Yxu3v]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Ulcerative colitis is an idiopathic inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology that seems to be rising in incidence and prevalence throughout the world. These guidelines were developed to indicate the preferred approach to the management of adult patients with ulcerative colitis as established by valid scientific research and represent the official practice recommendations of the American College of Gastroenterology under the auspices of the Practice Parameters Committee. The scientific evidence for the recommendations made in these guidelines was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation process, assessing the quality of the evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low) and assigning a strength of recommendation based on its apparent clinical benefit (strong or conditional). In instances where the available evidence was not appropriate for a formal Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation recommendation, but there was consensus of significant clinical merit, statements were developed using expert consensus (termed key concept statements). These guidelines are meant to be broadly applicable to practitioners regardless of specialty or interest and should be viewed as the preferred, but not only, approach to clinical scenarios. As opposed to standards of care, guidelines are inherently flexible, and physicians should use them as tools in choosing the best course in a specific clinical situation. These guidelines represent the state of the evidence at the time of this publication. As new evidence emerges, these guidelines will be continuously reviewed, and updates will be published as needed to assure continued validity.

Antimicrobial therapy in Crohn's disease — limited role for luminal disease with specific conditional uses: Although widely used in the past, the primary role of antibiotics for the treatment of luminal CD has not been supported by the evidence; metronidazole is not more effective than placebo at inducing remission in patients with CD, ciprofloxacin has not been shown to be more effective than placebo to induce remission in luminal CD, and neither has been shown to heal the mucosa in active luminal CD. For patients with moderately severe disease and evidence of systemic symptoms, including a febrile episode with systemic toxicity, antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones or metronidazole may be considered, and broad-spectrum antibiotics are used for ongoing complications such as intra-abdominal, mesenteric, or perianal abscesses. Anti-MAP therapy should not be used to treat active CD and has not been shown to be effective for induction of remission or mucosal healing, and antibiotics are not an effective treatment for luminal inflammatory CD and should not be used as a primary therapy.

Crohn's disease refractory therapy and precision medicine — nonresponse rates, alternative classes, monitoring, and strategic priorities: Despite existing treatments, approximately 20%–30% of patients experience primary nonresponse to anti-TNF therapies, and 30%–40% lose their response or become intolerant (secondary non-responders) within the first year of treatment. These secondary non-responders often require dose escalation, switching to another anti-TNF agent, or transitioning to a different therapeutic class, such as anti-integrins (vedolizumab), anti-IL-12/23 agents (ustekinumab), anti-IL-23 agents (guselkumab, mirikizumab or risankizumab), JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib), or novel mechanisms. Managing patients with refractory CD poses a considerable challenge because they often cycle through the available advanced therapies, and a therapeutic ceiling effect has been observed in some patients, limiting the efficacy of existing treatments. Routine monitoring of disease activity with biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is recommended. Precision medicine is emerging as a solution for CD, seeking to integrate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into clinical decision-making, and key proposals to improve CD treatment strategies include the following: Disease Classification; Endpoints; and Longitudinal Assessment.

Serious adverse events were lower with risankizumab (10.3% vs 17.9%). As a consequence of the SEQUENCE trial results, we advocate use of risankizumab as opposed to ustekinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe CD and prior exposure to anti-TNF therapy.

Prednisone-equivalent dosing for active disease ranges from 40 to 60 mg/d, and the use of corticosteroids should not exceed 3 continuous months without attempting to introduce corticosteroid-sparing agents. Even short-term use may be accompanied by adverse events including venous thromboembolic events (5-fold increased risk). Despite effectiveness for symptom control, nearly 1 in 4 patients will have prolonged exposure to corticosteroids (greater than 6 months) with approximately 15% of patients becoming steroid-dependent.

### The future of clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease [^112xigFV]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

The medical management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been transformed over the past few decades by the approval of multiple classes of advanced therapies and the integration of more targeted treatment strategies for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. These changes have been driven by an increasing number of pivotal randomized controlled trials, which have grown in size and complexity over time. Several landmark studies that are anticipated to change current IBD management paradigms have recently been completed or are on-going, including the first head-to-head biologic trials, advanced combination treatment trials, therapeutic strategy and treatment target trials, and multiple phase 3 registrational programs of novel compounds. Despite these advances, the future of IBD trials also faces major challenges with respect to cost, feasibility, and recruitment. Accordingly, innovative methods for early and late phase randomized controlled trials must be adopted. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of modern IBD trials, discuss methods for improving trial efficiency in early and late phase development, and provide insights into the interpretation and implications of these data for clinical care.

Adoption of and alternatives to the STRIDE-II consensus

A considerable proportion of participants always (55.5%) or often (30%) referred to the STRIDE-II consensus, but 55.5% also followed other guidelines, such as the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guidelines or European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO) guidelines (Figure 4). More experienced physicians were significantly more likely to refer to other guidelines compared with less experienced physicians (60.1% vs 40.7%, p < 0.05). In China, IBD specialists were also more likely than gastroenterologists to consult international guidelines (65.3% vs 46.5%, p < 0.05). Confidence in the STRIDE-II guidelines was generally high, with 48% of participants expressing high and 42.3% expressing moderate reliance. However, more than half of the Indian respondents reported limited confidence. Regarding the reason for not following the STRIDE-II consensus, 66.1% deemed that the lack of a validated definition of MH was an important factor. Forty percent of respondents stated that if some guidelines conflicted with their own clinical experience, they would intentionally not follow them.

To acquire the latest information on IBD, the majority of respondents favored conferences (92.5%), followed by reading journal articles (76.7%), and web-based learning (74.9%). These approaches were deemed extremely useful (72.7%) for guiding actual clinical practice.

In the practical management of IBD patients, 89.4% of respondents reported that psychological comorbidities posed significant challenges to implement T2T strategies, followed by the challenges of handling loss of response to medical therapy (74.9%), complications associated with penetrating CD (74%), and managing fistulising perianal CD (67.4%; Figure 5). For therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), 69.6% of respondents reported that high out-of-pocket cost was an important barrier, 39.6% admitted to a lack of comprehensive TDM knowledge, 35.2% thought TDM processes were cumbersome and/or time-consuming, and 34.4% reported a lack of TDM use in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract and may result in progressive bowel damage and disability. Published evidence clearly supports that CD has a broad impact on patients and significantly impairs health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Complications and comorbidities associated with CD can also lead to increased healthcare utilization and costs, while also disrupting patients' social, work, and daily activities.

The current therapeutic management of CD prioritizes clinical remission and resolution of objective markers of inflammation. However, restoration of HRQoL and reduction in disability are also considered as important long-term treatment targets that should be regularly assessed in patients with IBD. The 2024 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation guidelines for CD place a significant emphasis on improving patients' HRQoL, reflecting a holistic approach to disease management. This update includes patient involvement in guideline development, highlighting the importance of patient-centered outcomes, such as mental health, daily functionality, and long-term well-being.

Although HRQoL shows some correlations with disease activity, it is a distinct dimension of the disease experience requiring regular clinical assessment in addition to the measurement of objective inflammation markers. In recent years, the Food and Drug Administration has shifted from relying solely on the CD Activity Index to incorporating patient-reported outcomes and objective measures, reflecting a broader emphasis on patient-centric metrics, including HRQoL. Recent CD clinical studies have included measures of HRQoL and work productivity, along with endoscopic and symptomatic assessments.

Mirikizumab, an interleukin-23p19 antibody, demonstrated efficacy and led to significant and clinically important improvement across all domains of HRQoL in patients with moderately to severely active UC. In the phase 2 study of patients with moderately to severely active CD, treatment with mirikizumab was associated with a sustained improvement up to week 104 in disease-specific and generic HRQoL measures. In the phase 3 VIVID-1 (NCT03926130) study, mirikizumab demonstrated the efficacy on symptomatic and endoscopic outcomes in patients with moderately to severely active CD. In this study, we present the effects of mirikizumab vs placebo on HRQoL and work productivity up to 52 weeks in the phase 3 VIVID-1 study.

Although the strength of the recommendation varies, all guidelines recommend vedolizumab for induction of remission in patients with moderate to severe CD whose disease previously did not respond to at least 1 anti-TNFα treatment. As per their guidelines current as of August 2024, the AGA and BSG also recommend the use of vedolizumab for induction in patients who are biologic-naive. Moreover, BSG guidelines specify that for patients with extensive disease or other poor prognostic features, early introduction of biologic treatment should be considered. For maintenance treatment, all guidelines recommend the use of vedolizumab in patients with moderate to severe CD who have achieved clinical remission in response to induction therapy, including with vedolizumab. These treatment guidelines relate to the treatment of adults and may not be suitable for specific populations such as pregnant women or pediatric patients. In pregnant women, the Pregnancy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Neonatal Outcomes (PIANO) study has been ongoing since 2009. In data up to November 2022, 66 women had been exposed to vedolizumab during pregnancy without any observed increased risk in adverse pregnancy or neonatal outcomes versus non-exposed women. Although safety data for use in pregnant women remains limited, available data suggests that vedolizumab can be used without additional concerns regarding pregnancy outcomes. Finally, these guidelines cover adult patients with CD. Vedolizumab is not currently approved for use in pediatric patients, although phase 3 studies are ongoing to establish the efficacy and safety in this population.

### Isolated perianal Crohn's disease: a systematic review and expert consensus proposing novel diagnostic criteria and management advice [^11391bmj]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Perianal fistulae can present a diagnostic challenge when distinguishing perianal Crohn's disease from idiopathic perianal fistulae. This distinction is key, as perianal Crohn's disease requires inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapy, whereas idiopathic perianal fistulae are primarily managed surgically. When luminal inflammation is absent, but Crohn's disease is suspected, the term isolated perianal Crohn's disease is sometimes applied. However, no formal guidance exists for diagnosing or managing isolated perianal Crohn's disease. Furthermore, whereas fistula granuloma might provide specific evidence of Crohn's disease, they are rarely detected in perianal fistulae, so are unlikely to sensitively delineate aetiology. This project aimed to develop an opinion-based framework for isolated perianal Crohn's disease. A systematic review evaluated clinical features suggestive of isolated perianal Crohn's disease and evidence for IBD therapies in patients with perianal fistulae without luminal IBD. The findings of this systematic review informed a multidisciplinary consensus process with IBD specialists, resulting in the formulation of diagnostic criteria and management recommendations for isolated perianal Crohn's disease. We then tested this diagnostic approach in a prospective cohort of 50 patients treated as having idiopathic perianal fistulae at a proctology referral centre, identifying six (12%) individuals as meeting the diagnostic criteria. Our findings underscore the scarcity of evidence guiding isolated perianal Crohn's disease diagnosis and the need for a composite risk-based assessment. The proposed framework provides a tool for clinical practice and research but requires validation and refinement. Clear communication with patients is essential, given the diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainties. Future studies should refine these criteria, explore biological markers for isolated perianal Crohn's disease, and establish evidence-based methods to differentiate isolated perianal Crohn's disease within the perianal fistulae spectrum.

Diet-based strategies for mild Crohn's disease — conditional option with monitoring: For adult patients with mild CD and low risk of progression, diet-based strategies along with careful monitoring for inadequate symptom relief, worsening inflammation, or disease progression may be considered; some studies suggest that elemental, semielemental, and defined diets may be effective for select patients with CD to reduce clinical symptoms and disease activity scores, although most diet-based studies were performed primarily among pediatric patients with CD.

### Management of paediatric ulcerative colitis, part 1: ambulatory care-an updated evidence-based consensus guideline from the European society of paediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition and the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation [^113ATQRC]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Active and close monitoring of disease, using clinical and laboratory‐based parameters, and endoscopy when needed, is essential for optimal care, as summarised in Figures 1 and 3, and very clearly articulated in the STRIDE II initiative. Briefly, it is imperative to adjust the tools, intensity, and frequency of monitoring to the disease stage and status, but this treat‐to‐target approach demonstrates the evolution of this field and the need for guidelines to direct proactive optimisation of outcomes. Proactive management provides benefit to disease monitoring and specifically, the use of TDM is shown to optimise anti‐TNF therapy and outcomes in UC. The role of bowel ultrasound as an emerging, noninvasive tool (especially important in children) for assessing UC activity and response to therapy is also noteworthy. Finally, for assessment, we discuss the importance of cancer surveillance for children with UC, given the devastating impacts of cancer diagnosis at a young age, despite the very low yield of these efforts. It is important to remember that disease control (including subclinical) during childhood is critical for the risk of developing cancer as a young adult. This is especially true for children with PSC, where the risk for both colon cancer and cholangiocarcinoma is dramatically increased.

These comprehensive guidelines attempt to cover most aspects of managing UC in children, but should not be seen as a complete, single authority, but rather a resource with analysis of the relevant literature (which does evolve over time) and a general guide for practitioners. Especially in areas where the evidence is weak, one should research the topic and consult with relevant colleagues. Local factors and resource availability could further impact the ability to apply these guidelines globally, which are written through a lens of relatively 'developed' countries. Regions that are not as well‐resourced may find it difficult to implement some of the recommendations, but we hope that these guidelines could serve as a resource for advocacy aimed at advancing the well‐being of children with UC by promoting health authorities to accept high standards of care. At the same time, recognising diversity in care and resources, the legal relevance of these guidelines would need to be judged based on local criteria and circumstances.

Discussion

Comparative effectiveness of ustekinumab

In the study by Schwartz et al. On vedolizumab therapy for PFCD, 53.6% of patients achieved a ≥ 50% reduction in draining fistulae, and 42.9% achieved complete fistula closure at week 30. The mean (standard deviation) Crohn's Disease Activity Index(CDAI) and PDAI scores decreased by 51.1 (78.3) and 4.1 (3.3), respectively, at week 30. In a multicenter retrospective study by Gu et al. 72.7% of patients on infliximab achieved fistula healing and 27.3% had complete closure; for adalimumab, rates were 77% and 35.4%, respectively. Although anti-TNF therapies are effective for fistula healing in RCTs, results are often reported as post hoc analyses or secondary endpoints. In addition, 10–40% of patients discontinue anti-TNF therapy and switch to other biologics due to reduced efficacy. The 2021 AGA guidelines recommend UST as the preferred second-line biologic for PFCD management.

ACG Crohn's disease — natural history and risk factors indicate progression risks and monitoring needs: Most patients initially present with nonpenetrating, nonstricturing behavior, but up to half develop an intestinal complication within 20 yr of diagnosis, particularly with ileal, ileocolonic, or proximal gastrointestinal involvement, extensive anatomic involvement, or deep ulcerations. High-risk features for progressive burden include young age at diagnosis, initial extensive bowel involvement, ileal/ileocolonic involvement, perianal/severe rectal disease, extraintestinal manifestations at diagnosis, and penetrating or stenosis phenotype. Over long observation, only 20%–30% have a nonprogressive or indolent course. Symptoms do not correlate well with active inflammation and therefore should not be the sole guide for therapy; objective evaluation by endoscopic or cross-sectional imaging should be used periodically. In the absence of immunomodulator or biologic treatment, corticosteroid dependency and/or resistance occurs in up to half of patients.
