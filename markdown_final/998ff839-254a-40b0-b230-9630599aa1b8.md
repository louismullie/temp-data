## Question

What are the symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the symptoms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core features that define EDS as a connective tissue disorder. Then, I should verify subtype-specific manifestations, especially life-threatening vascular signs. Next, I will review musculoskeletal and dermatologic symptoms that are common in routine practice. After that, I need to consider autonomic, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, and neurologic pain phenotypes that often co-occur in hypermobile EDS. Finally, I will synthesize how symptom prevalence and intensity vary by subtype and across the lifespan, noting any red flags that warrant urgent evaluation.

> Let me first confirm the foundational symptom complex. Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are characterized by a triad of joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility; I initially think these core features appear in essentially all patients and serve as the diagnostic backbone, which would suggest near-universality across subtypes, but I should double-check that assumption before anchoring on it.

> Wait, let me verify this universality claim. Hold on, I should verify whether that "100% across subtypes" is accurate, because vascular EDS, for example, may show less pronounced generalized joint hypermobility while having striking skin translucency and vascular fragility; in reality, expression of the triad varies by subtype and severity, so although the triad is defining for the group, not every feature is present in every patient or to the same degree, and clinical weighting shifts by subtype and age [^1123gGQg].

> I will now examine the musculoskeletal domain, since this is the most common clinical entry point. Patients often have generalized joint hypermobility documented by a Beighton score, with recurrent subluxations or dislocations, chronic musculoskeletal pain that can be early and severe, periarticular instability, and a propensity toward early-onset osteoarthritis; I need to ensure I mention that structured assessment with Beighton plus history improves detection in primary care and that pain burden correlates with hypermobility and dislocation frequency [^113xCqDk] [^113SLtb3] [^112Ew8sr].

> Next, I should review the integumentary features. Typical skin findings include hyperextensibility, soft or velvety texture, easy bruising, and poor wound healing with atrophic "cigarette paper" scarring in classical phenotypes; I should confirm that skin fragility and delayed healing are expected to varying degrees across types and that wound care needs are distinct in EDS, with emphasis on protection, low-tension closure, and low-adherence dressings; bleeding manifestations such as easy bruising and hematomas are common and can be quantified with standardized bleeding tools in research settings [^1123gGQg] [^112jcEPo] [^113n1zyt].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without flagging high-risk vascular symptoms. In vascular EDS, thin translucent skin with visible veins, spontaneous arterial dissection or rupture, and organ rupture (uterus, bowel) can occur, often at younger ages, with substantial mortality risk; I need to ensure clinicians recognize sudden severe pain, hematoma, or ischemic symptoms as red flags that mandate urgent vascular evaluation and subtype-specific management pathways [^111LgqCq] [^114zKDLn] [^1123gGQg].

> Let me consider cardiovascular manifestations outside classic vEDS. I should confirm that mitral valve prolapse, mild aortic root dilation, and occasional aneurysmal disease can be reported in non-vascular subtypes, though far less commonly than in vEDS, and clinicians should individualize surveillance when additional vascular features or family history raise concern [^116qrZRT].

> I need to check extra-articular symptoms that cluster in hypermobile EDS and related hypermobility spectrum disorders. Common co-occurring features include chronic pain, fatigue, anxiety, orthostatic intolerance including POTS, functional gastrointestinal symptoms, and pelvic or bladder dysfunction; I should confirm that GI symptom evaluation and management generally follow standard approaches for disorders of gut–brain interaction and motility, with selective testing for gastric motor function or autonomic dysfunction when clinical features suggest POTS, and that testing for mast cell activation is reserved for patients with convincing multisystem episodic symptoms or supportive labs [^1166FkDC] [^1162LRzY] [^111YMHK4] [^111F7ziK] [^111bs4T6].

> I will now examine neuropathic and neuromuscular complaints. Many patients report myalgia, easy fatigability, and distal sensory symptoms, and studies have identified small fiber neuropathy in a substantial subset of hypermobile EDS as well as mixed neurogenic–myopathic patterns and reduced vibration sense across several EDS types; this helps explain neuropathic pain qualities and dysautonomia in clinical presentations [^114JZDce] [^114nRy94].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child or an individual with a rarer subtype — do symptoms differ at onset. In musculocontractural EDS, for example, congenital contractures, distinct craniofacial features, skin fragility, and progressive spinal deformities can dominate from early life, which reminds me that symptom clusters at presentation can be highly subtype specific and age dependent [^116PcatZ].

> I should confirm bleeding and gynecologic symptom patterns. Beyond easy bruising and hematomas, patients may report epistaxis, oral cavity bleeding, menorrhagia, and significant bleeding after procedures, with some experiencing life-threatening hemorrhage; obstetric and gynecologic complaints such as heavy menstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and higher rates of pregnancy complications are also reported and warrant anticipatory guidance and coordinated care [^113n1zyt] [^116s2NSJ].

> Next, I should review how patients describe the most impactful symptoms, to align expectations. Pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance, and musculoskeletal instability consistently emerge as dominant symptom domains, with cluster analyses identifying subgroups such as pain-dominant and high symptom burden phenotypes; this heterogeneity underscores the need for individualized, multidisciplinary assessment and management [^114inx1i] [^113D1dgb].

> Let me reconsider the overall picture to ensure clinical completeness. In summary, the symptoms of EDS span musculoskeletal instability and pain, skin hyperextensibility and fragility with easy bruising, variable cardiovascular involvement with life-threatening vascular events in vEDS, autonomic intolerance and functional GI symptoms in hypermobile EDS, neuropathic pain with small fiber involvement, and gynecologic bleeding and pain, with expression varying widely by subtype and age; recognizing red flags for vascular events and tailoring evaluation to the dominant symptom domains are essential for safe, effective care [^1123gGQg] [^111LgqCq] [^1162LRzY].

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) presents with a triad of joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Symptoms vary by subtype [^1157Cs3K]: hypermobile EDS features chronic joint pain, frequent dislocations, and fatigue [^113dCzsV]; classical EDS shows atrophic scarring and easy bruising [^113dCzsV] [^1173KNmt]; vascular EDS carries life-threatening risks such as arterial or organ rupture [^111LgqCq]. Common systemic symptoms include chronic pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal issues [^113dCzsV], autonomic dysfunction (e.g. POTS) [^111F7ziK], and bleeding tendencies [^113n1zyt]. Management is multidisciplinary, focusing on symptom control, injury prevention, and regular monitoring for complications [^114bNyif] [^1162LRzY].

---

## Musculoskeletal symptoms

- **Joint hypermobility**: Generalized joint laxity, often assessed using the Beighton score [^113xCqDk].
- **Joint instability**: Frequent subluxations and dislocations [^114nfqRv], particularly in hypermobile EDS [^113dCzsV].
- **Chronic musculoskeletal pain**: Persistent pain, often severe and debilitating [^112Ew8sr] [^111X5VPX].
- **Early-onset osteoarthritis**: Degenerative joint changes occurring earlier than typical [^1157Cs3K].
- **Muscle weakness and hypotonia**: Reduced muscle strength and tone, contributing to instability [^114nRy94].

---

## Dermatological symptoms

- **Skin hyperextensibility**: Stretchy, elastic skin that returns to normal when released [^1123gGQg].
- **Skin fragility**: Thin, delicate skin prone to tearing and bruising [^1123gGQg].
- **Atrophic scarring**: Thin, widened scars, particularly in classical EDS [^1173KNmt].
- **Easy bruising**: Frequent bruising with minimal trauma [^113n1zyt].
- **Delayed wound healing**: Prolonged healing times and increased risk of wound complications [^112jcEPo].

---

## Cardiovascular symptoms

In EDS, cardiovascular involvement includes arterial fragility with increased risk of arterial rupture, aneurysms, and dissections [^111LgqCq], particularly in vascular EDS [^113tWVpM]. Mitral valve prolapse is a common cardiac manifestation, and aortic root dilation [^113xMwSD] may occur, potentially leading to aortic regurgitation [^113pTrDS]. Autonomic involvement may present as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) with orthostatic intolerance and tachycardia [^111F7ziK].

---

## Gastrointestinal symptoms

Gastrointestinal symptoms range from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with frequent reflux to **functional gastrointestinal disorders**, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and gastroparesis [^111YMHK4] [^111bs4T6]. Connective tissue weakness predisposes to hernias and organ prolapse [^113dCzsV]. Chronic constipation and diarrhea are common [^1162LRzY].

---

## Neurological symptoms

Neurological symptoms include **chronic headaches and migraines**, which are frequent and often severe; small fiber neuropathy may cause pain, tingling, and numbness [^114JZDce]. Autonomic dysfunction is common, including dysautonomia and orthostatic intolerance [^111F7ziK]. Cognitive impairment — often described as "brain fog" — is also reported.

---

## Psychological symptoms

Psychological symptoms often include **anxiety and depression** [^115gKGDQ], frequently related to chronic pain and disability [^115gzXCs]. Persistent fatigue significantly impacts quality of life [^114inx1i], and sleep disturbances — such as insomnia and poor sleep quality — are also frequently reported [^114inx1i] [^112Ew8sr].

---

## Other systemic symptoms

Other systemic symptoms include **bleeding tendencies**, such as easy bruising, menorrhagia, and bleeding after minor procedures [^113n1zyt]. Some patients report immune system dysfunction with increased susceptibility to infections and autoimmune conditions. Respiratory complications may occur, including spontaneous pneumothorax and diaphragmatic rupture [^114zKDLn].

---

## Subtype-specific symptoms

| **EDS subtype** | **Key symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Hypermobile (hEDS) | Joint hypermobility, chronic pain, fatigue, autonomic dysfunction [^115gKGDQ] |
| Classical (cEDS) | Skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility [^1173KNmt] |
| Vascular (vEDS) | Arterial rupture, organ rupture, thin translucent skin [^111LgqCq] |
| Kyphoscoliotic (kEDS) | Severe scoliosis, muscle hypotonia, ocular fragility [^116gQxfg] |
| Arthrochalasia (aEDS) | Severe joint hypermobility, congenital hip dislocation [^113xMwSD] |
| Dermatosparaxis (dEDS) | Extreme skin fragility, sagging skin [^1123gGQg] |

---

## Impact on daily life

EDS **significantly affects daily life**, causing chronic pain, fatigue, and functional impairment. Patients often face difficulties with employment, social interactions, and mental health, leading to reduced quality of life [^112kBqa4] [^111KEZTo].

---

## Management strategies

Management of EDS is **multidisciplinary**, focusing on symptom control, injury prevention, and routine monitoring for complications [^114bNyif]. Key strategies include:

- **Physical therapy**: Tailored exercises to improve joint stability and strength [^114nfqRv].
- **Pain management**: Medications, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral therapy [^116emBGi] [^114bNyif].
- **Cardiovascular monitoring**: Regular imaging and blood pressure control [^111LgqCq].
- **Gastrointestinal management**: Dietary modifications and medications [^116n3wTw].
- **Psychological support**: Counseling and support groups [^117B6u1v].

---

EDS is characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility, with symptoms varying by subtype. Management requires a **multidisciplinary approach** to address the wide range of symptoms and complications [^113SLtb3].

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113dCzsV]. Nature Reviews. Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:

- **Definition**: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of inherited connective tissue disorders characterized by hyperextensible skin, hypermobile joints, and tissue fragility.

- **Pathophysiology**: EDS results from defects in collagen synthesis or structure, leading to weakened connective tissues. Mutations in genes such as COL5A1, COL5A2, COL3A1, COL1A1, and COL1A2 are implicated in different subtypes, affecting the primary structure and later processing of type I, III, and V collagens.

- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of EDS is believed to be underestimated, ranging from 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 400,000, depending on the subtype.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for EDS include a family history of the disorder, as it may be inherited in some cases depending on the subtype. It may also be associated with other genetic disorders or rheumatological diseases.

- **Disease course**: The syndrome is classified into several subtypes based on clinical presentation and genetic mutations, with the most common being the hypermobile, classical, and vascular types.
	- Common features include joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, and Marfanoid habitus.
	- The vascular type is particularly severe, with risks of arterial rupture, organ rupture, and early mortality.
	- Other complications can include chronic pain, joint dislocations, and early-onset osteoarthritis.
	- Associated systemic findings include anxiety disorders, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction.

### Characterization of bleeding symptoms in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113n1zyt]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2023). High credibility.

Easy bruising is included as a major or minor criterion for the classification of multiple types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). Despite a longstanding recognition of the association between EDS and bleeding, we still lack a definitive understanding of the frequency, severity, and types of bleeding complications in patients with EDS.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate hemorrhagic symptoms using the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis bleeding assessment tool (ISTH-BAT) in a cohort of patients with defined types of EDS.

- **Methods**: We utilized the ISTH-BAT to characterize hemorrhagic symptoms and their severity in a cohort of 52 patients with classical, classical-like, hypermobile, or vascular EDS and a matched group of 52 healthy control subjects.

- **Results**: The mean ISTH-BAT score was 0.1 for healthy subjects and 9.1 for patients with EDS (p < .0001). An abnormal ISTH-BAT score was observed in 32 of 52 (62%) patients with EDS and 0 of 52 healthy controls (p < .0001). The most frequent bleeding symptoms were bruising, muscle hematomas, menorrhagia, epistaxis, bleeding from the oral cavity, and bleeding after tooth extraction. Menorrhagia that was life-threatening or required surgery was reported in 7 of 52 (14%) patients with EDS.

- **Conclusion**: Patients with multiple types of EDS exhibit a wide range of bleeding symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening episodes.

### Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorders [^114bNyif]. American Family Physician (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly concerning general principles, the AAFP 2021 guidelines recommend offering early multidisciplinary treatment, including physical, occupational, and cognitive behavioral therapy in patients with EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders. Consider offering orthotics as well as community and specialty support to optimize outcomes in patients with joint hypermobility symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1166FkDC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, especially in the context of evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for mast cell disorders, including mast cell activation syndrome, in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and disorders of gut-brain interaction. This is particularly relevant for patients presenting with episodic symptoms that suggest a generalized mast cell disorder involving two or more physiological systems. It is advised not to use these tests for routine evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms in all patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders unless there is clinical or laboratory evidence of a primary or secondary mast cell disorder.

### Severe conjunctivochalasis in association with classic type Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^116gQxfg]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by skin hyperextensibility, atrophic scarring, joint hypermobility, and generalized tissue fragility. The classification includes six subtypes based on clinical, biochemical, and molecular characteristics. However, examples of unclassified variants and 'overlap phenotypes' are becoming more common. Kyphoscoliosis type (formerly type VI) and vascular type (formerly type IV) are associated with ophthalmic disease, though less commonly with the latter. Known ophthalmic complications include ocular fragility with increased vulnerability to trauma, high myopia, retinal detachment, and keratoconus. Epicanthic folds, microcornea, blue sclera, ectopia lentis, and angioid streaks have also been associated, though less commonly.

Conjunctivochalasis can cause a spectrum of symptoms, ranging from dry eye to disturbance of tear outflow and exposure problems at the severe stage. It is frequently seen in the older age group as an elevation of the bulbar conjunctiva lying along the lateral or central lower lid margin and is often considered to be a senile degeneration with no reported systemic associations. Studies of the clinical and histopathological characteristics of conjunctivochalasis have suggested the etiology to lie in a variety of local effects such as persistent trauma related to blinking, ultraviolet radiation, or tear stasis. Possible systemic causes were not described.

We present a case of severe conjunctivochalasis in a middle-aged patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

### Proceedings of the 31st European Paediatric Rheumatology Congress: Part 2 [^113d7dxf]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder that affects collagen metabolism, leading to skin hyperextensibility and joint hypermobility. Patients may experience complications involving the cardiovascular system, such as aneurysms and mitral valve prolapse, the gastrointestinal system, including hernias and gastrointestinal diverticulosis, and ocular defects. Proper history taking and examination are crucial for the early recognition of EDS signs and symptoms, as these patients may present only with delayed wound healing and abnormal scarring.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^111YMHK4]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, with particular focus on evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining timely diagnostic testing of gastric motor functions. This includes the measurement of gastric emptying and/or accommodation in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and comorbid postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. These patients report chronic upper gastrointestinal symptoms, which should be assessed after appropriate exclusion of anatomical and structural diseases, as abnormal gastric emptying may be more common than in the general population.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^1162LRzY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically in the context of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend aligning the management of chronic gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with hypermobile EDS or hypermobility spectrum disorders. This approach is recommended for patients who do not exhibit symptoms consistent with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome or mast cell activation syndrome. The guidelines suggest using existing approaches for managing disorders of gut-brain interaction and gastrointestinal motility disorders in the general population. Integrated multidisciplinary care should be included, involving multiple specialties where appropriate, such as cardiology, rheumatology, dietetics, and psychology.

### Understanding the issues of hypermobility spectrum disorders and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in primary care: a qualitative integrative review [^117LJk4G]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSDs) and hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) are disorders characterized by joint laxity, pain, and fatigue, causing multi-system complications and significant burden. Primary care is essential in supporting HSD/hEDS patients, and understanding challenges in this setting is key.

This integrative review aims to understand and analyze issues that exist in primary care for clinicians and HSD/hEDS patients. Embase, Medline, Health Management Information Consortium, Social Policy & Practice, PsycINFO, Cochrane, and CINAHL databases were searched in October 2024, and qualitative or mixed-method studies were included. Thematic analysis and critical appraisal were performed on eight studies.

Three themes were identified as common issues for patients and clinicians:

- **Structural barriers**: These involve uncoordinated services and inadequate training.
- **Societal barriers**: Patients often face stigma at multiple levels.
- **Consultation barriers to care**: Few published studies explored the direct experiences of patients and clinicians in primary care, and data varied in quality.

Future qualitative studies could explore primary care physicians' knowledge and attitudes towards HSD/hEDS in this setting to inform the organization of appropriate services and education strategies. This could contribute to knowledge and bias reduction, improving patient outcomes in practice.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically the management of gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering treating suspected mast cell activation syndrome with histamine receptor antagonists and/or mast cell stabilizers. It is advised to avoid triggers, such as certain foods, alcohol, strong smells, temperature changes, mechanical stimuli (friction), emotional distress (pollen, mold), or specific medications (opioids, NSAIDs, iodinated contrast).

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^111AH2qg]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

One participant reflected that even if there is not a known etiology for their patient's condition, they still find a way to "give them a place to feel heard" [participant 14]. Others described the importance of providing a space for their patients to tell their stories by listening to and validating their experiences. One participant stated that patients often "feel like they're kind of ignored by the general medical system" [participant 11], so another way to provide support to these patients is through validation.

I want to tell you that I believe you. I see you, and I know this is real. I think that is really key in all of the genetic counseling sessions people just want validation that their pain is real and that it affects all these parts of their life.

Given their extensive medical history and genetic counseling's role in emphasizing psychosocial support, appointments for this patient population tend to be long. Many genetic counselors reported that they have to block off extra time in their schedule for these appointments. To keep their day on track, several participants emphasized the importance of redirecting the conversation while remaining empathic to their patients' stories.

- **Time-saving approaches**: One participant detailed her approach since "there are so many records that it is hard to try to prioritize them" [participant 14], so she would ask the patient the specific information from their medical records they would like her to review. Another participant discussed that she "feels confident in saying, 'I'm going to interrupt you because I hear what you are saying.

### Patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and CRPS: A possible association [^1164fuJC]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

Rare patients are left with chronic pain, vasodysregulation, and other symptoms that define complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) after limb traumas. The predisposing factors are unknown. Genetic factors undoubtedly contribute, but have not yet been identified. We report four CRPS patients also diagnosed with the classical or hypermobility forms of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), inherited disorders of connective tissue. These patients had been diagnosed using standard diagnostic criteria for CRPS and for EDS.

All had sustained joint injury; in three this had been surgically treated. The association of these two diagnoses leads us to hypothesize that EDS might contribute to the development of CRPS in one or more of the following ways: via stretch injury to nerves traversing hypermobile joints, increased fragility of nerve connective tissue, or nerve trauma from more frequent surgery. We review the clinical presentation of the different Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and provide clinical criteria that can be used to screen CRPS patients for EDS for clinical or research purposes.

### Neuromuscular involvement in various types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^114nRy94]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Muscle involvement is plausible based on recently discovered interactions between muscle cells and extracellular matrix molecules; however, muscle symptoms are only sporadically reported. We designed a cross-sectional study to determine whether neuromuscular features are part of EDS.

- **Methods**: Standardized questionnaires, physical examination, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, muscle ultrasound, and muscle biopsy were performed in 40 EDS patients with vascular, classic, tenascin-X (TNX)-deficient type EDS, and hypermobility type EDS caused by TNXB haploinsufficiency.

- **Results**: Muscle weakness, myalgia, and easy fatigability were reported by the majority of patients. Mild-to-moderate muscle weakness (85%) and reduction of vibration sense (60%) were common. Nerve conduction studies demonstrated axonal polyneuropathy in five patients (13%). Needle electromyography showed myopathic features in nine patients (26%) and a mixed neurogenic-myopathic pattern in most (60%). Muscle ultrasound showed increased echo-intensity (48%) and atrophy (50%). Mild myopathic features were seen on muscle biopsy of five patients (28%). Overall, patients with the hypermobility type EDS caused by TNXB haploinsufficiency were least affected.

Mild-to-moderate neuromuscular involvement is common in various types of EDS, with a remarkable relation between residual findings and specific types of the syndrome.

### Clinical and molecular features of 66 patients with musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in (mcEDS-) [^116PcatZ]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility. Musculocontractural EDS (mcEDS) is a rare type of EDS caused by biallelic loss-of-function variants either in the gene for carbohydrate sulfotransferase 14 (CHST14) also known as dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST1) (CHST14, mcEDS-CHST14) (MIM#601776) or in the gene for dermatan sulfate epimerase (DSE) (DSE, mcEDS-DSE) (MIM#615539).

D4ST1 and DSE are critical enzymes for the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (DS), which is covalently attached to specific serine residues of core proteins to form glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains for proteoglycans in the Golgi apparatus. DSE catalyzes the epimerization of the C-5 position of glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues in a chondroitin precursor backbone, resulting in the formation of the dermatan backbone. Subsequently, D4ST1 transfers a sulfate group from 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate to the C-4 hydroxy group of N-acetylgalactosamine adjacent to iduronic acid (IdoA) in the dermatan backbone, resulting in the formation of mature DS.

### Skin biopsy reveals generalized small fibre neuropathy in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^114JZDce]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are hereditary disorders of connective tissue characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. The most common subtype is the hypermobile type. Symptoms of small fibre neuropathy (SFN) due to damage to the small peripheral nerve fibres, with degeneration of the distal nerve endings, and autonomic disorders such as postural tachycardia syndrome (PoTS) are frequently reported features in patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS). At the time of writing, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still not completely understood.

The study aimed to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of small fiber neuropathy and autonomic neuropathy in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.

- **Methods**: We prospectively investigated 31 patients with hEDS compared to 31 healthy controls by using skin biopsy, quantitative sensory testing, tilt-table testing, the painDetect, Small Fibre Neuropathy Screening List, and the COMPASS-31 (Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31) questionnaire.

- **Results**: Nineteen (61%) patients with hEDS were diagnosed with SFN, and 10 (32%) fulfilled the criteria for PoTS. Patients with hEDS had significantly higher heart rates than controls. According to quantitative sensory testing, these patients had generalized thermal and tactile hypesthesia. Skin biopsy revealed significantly reduced intraepithelial nerve fibre density proximally (thigh) and distally (lower leg) in patients compared to controls. This was consistent with various complaints of pain and sensory disturbances.

### The differential diagnosis of children with joint hypermobility: A review of the literature [^115swbLE]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2009). Low credibility.

There is a spectrum of generalized joint hypermobility in children, and the phenomenon is almost certainly polygenic in origin, with environmental influences, especially participation in sports and flexibility training. Younger children are more flexible, but this resolves with increasing age in normal children. It is a clinical challenge to distinguish young children with significant hypermobility, who are unlikely to improve, from those who are in the normal spectrum of hypermobility and will improve with time. Clinical follow-up over several years is currently the only way of answering this question for an individual child.

- **Criteria for diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hypermobile type)**: These criteria are illustrated in Table 2 but are non-specific. For a diagnosis to be made, an individual needs to have one of the major criteria, either a Beighton score of ≥ 4/9 or "skin involvement (hyperextensibility and/or smooth, velvety skin)". Beighton et al. describe testing skin hyperextensibility at a neutral site, e.g. the volar aspect of the forearm, where "the skin is pulled up until resistance is felt", but they do not describe a reproducible measurement that can be taken during this test, nor what might be considered normal and abnormal.

- **Minor criteria**: These include joint dislocation, chronic joint/limb pain, and a positive family history. The presence of one or more minor criteria is "suggestive" of the diagnosis. The criteria are clearer but still require careful clinical evaluation.

### Vascular phenotypes in nonvascular subtypes of the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: a systematic review [^116qrZRT]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This systematic review was designed and conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement for reporting systematic reviews.

- **Study design**: The aim of this study was to collect all available data on vascular complications in the nonvascular EDS subtypes as described in the updated EDS classification. We queried the PubMed and Web of Science databases, considering the different notations for the EDS subtypes (e.g. classic versus classical). For classical EDS (COL5A1/2), for example, the following keywords were used: Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic*, COL5A1, COL5A2, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II.

- **Search strategy**: Based on these keywords, search strings to query the respective databases for classical EDS (COL5A1/2) were constructed as follows: ("Ehlers-Danlos syndrome"[Title/Abstract] AND (classic*[Title/Abstract] OR COL5A1[Title/Abstract] OR COL5A2[Title/Abstract])) OR "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I"[Title/Abstract] OR "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II"[Title/Abstract]. To exclude non-relevant references, queries were restricted to "title" and "abstract" in PubMed and "topic" in Web of Science. All search strings are outlined in Supplementary Table S1 online. Additionally, the Leiden Open Variation Database was queried for more references. All references published from inception until 31 May 2017 were eligible for inclusion in this review.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^111BuoTF]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically in the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering diagnostic testing with serum tryptase levels. These should be collected at baseline and 1–4 hours following symptom flares if mast cell activation syndrome is suspected. It is important to recognize that an increase of 20% above baseline plus 2 ng/mL is necessary to demonstrate evidence of mast cell activation.

### Predictors of pain and mobility disability in the hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^111X5VPX]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Among the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, the hypermobile subtype (hEDS) is the most common. The variety, accumulation, and duration of the painful symptoms make hEDS a chronic and highly disabling condition. Identifying drivers of pain and mobility disability in hEDS is necessary to provide adapted prevention and intervention programs.

- **Methods**: A cross-sectional sample of 75 adults with hEDS according to Villefranche criteria (67 women; 36 years, SD = 11.2) responded to self-assessment questionnaires regarding psychological factors (negative thoughts and emotions), health variables (pain, fatigue, diagnostic delay, body mass index, and mobility disability), and socio-demographic information.

- **Results**: Forty-three percent of the participants suffer from severe pain, and two-thirds suffer from a high level of mobility disability. Multivariate analyses show that delay of diagnosis, being professionally active, and thoughts of helplessness increase the likelihood of severe pain. In contrast, age, fatigue, and body mass index predict mobility disability. These results confirm previous research concerning the high disease burden observed in hEDS patients and highlight the importance of multidisciplinary management that includes nutritional and psychological advice to address this pathology. Increasing awareness of the clinical aspects of hEDS among physicians is necessary to reduce diagnostic delay and minimize negative outcomes.

### Skin fragility and wound management in Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: A report by the international consortium on Ehlers-Danlos syndromes and hypermobility spectrum disorders skin working group [^112jcEPo]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and generalized tissue fragility. In all types of EDS, skin wound healing is impaired to a variable degree. Additional support through wound management plans may help to improve these outcomes; however, there is a paucity of evidence regarding clinical management of skin fragility and wounds in EDS. This paper aims to review evidence and provide recommendations for the management of skin wounds in EDS types.

Preventative measures to avoid skin injury are strongly recommended, including the avoidance of high-impact sports and the use of appropriate protection such as shin guards. Bruising is common, and some types of EDS are associated with hematoma formation, with management including compression bandages and consideration of pharmacological therapy. Skin fragility and tears should be managed with a focus on protection of the remaining tissue, avoidance of wound tension, and low-adherence dressings to avoid further injury. This paper provides clear recommendations to address skin management for this group of patients and highlights the lack of good-quality published data to support treatment decisions.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^111F7ziK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically in evaluating gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome through postural vital signs. They also suggest referring patients for autonomic testing if they have hypermobile EDS or hypermobility spectrum disorders, coupled with refractory gastrointestinal symptoms and report orthostatic intolerance. This should only occur after excluding medication side effects and attempting appropriate lifestyle or behavioral modifications. It is advised not to conduct this testing for all patients with hypermobile EDS or hypermobility spectrum disorders who report gastrointestinal symptoms alone.

### Two patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type VIII with unexpected hoarseness [^114BWTWf]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) encompasses a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders, characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. It is a rare condition, and inheritance is either autosomal dominant or recessive. Previously grouped into 11 different subtypes, with increasing knowledge of the underlying molecular defects, it was reclassified in 1997 into six major groups, with type VIII excluded from this classification. Type VIII EDS is a very rare subtype, characterized by severe, early-onset periodontitis, skin fragility, and abnormal scarring. Voice abnormalities have occasionally been described in other forms of the condition and may be due to defects in the collagen of the vocal ligament. We report two cases of patients with EDS type VIII and hoarseness.

### Self-reported demographics of 154 hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients [^115gzXCs]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Demographic data for patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) has not been well established. hEDS patients often present with a constellation of symptoms; it is important to update clinical criteria for diagnosis and provide a framework for common co-morbidities. The primary objective of this study was to identify the prevalence of co-morbidities in hEDS patients to allow clinicians to better identify patients and their most common symptoms. The goal is to use this information to augment diagnostic and clinical demographic data to more accurately represent hEDS patients.

This retrospective chart review utilized patient intake forms from 154 patients diagnosed with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a clinic. Patient intake forms included responses to questions about the presence of various previous conditions. Our study revealed numerous co-morbidities with increased prevalence that differed from the diagnostic criteria, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, mast cell activation syndrome, anxiety, depression, temporomandibular joint syndrome, headaches, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. These findings will help inform clinicians of prevalent co-morbidities among hEDS patients and encourage further evaluation for screening and diagnosis. Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients presented with a wide range of co-morbidities not listed on clinical criteria. Future studies are warranted across diverse and larger patient populations and beyond self-reported data.

### Orthopaedic manifestations in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^114nfqRv]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume (2025). High credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a collagen disorder affecting multiple organ systems, including the musculoskeletal system. We sought to determine the type and severity of orthopaedic manifestations experienced by these patients. The purpose of this study was to identify the most common orthopaedic manifestations in patients with hEDS and to examine the patient-reported helpfulness of treatments. Of note, collagen disorders such as hEDS may affect the success rates of orthopaedic interventions. The success or failure of treatment is not currently fully understood for this patient population.

- **Methods**: A total of 1,999 patients who were enrolled in an international EDS registry were contacted to complete a 260-question survey regarding their experience with nonoperative and operative treatments for musculoskeletal instability and/or pain. Participants reported their demographic characteristics, hEDS diagnosis characteristics, symptomatic joints, nonoperative and operative treatments, and satisfaction with each treatment.

- **Results**: Over a 30-day period, 1,075 responses were received. Participants were predominately female (95.3%) and had a median age of 40.0 years (interquartile range width, 17.0 years). The majority (60.8%) of respondents reported a mental health burden every day, with the remainder reporting a mental health burden weekly (24.4%), monthly (11.0%), or never (3.80%). Compared to those who underwent standard physical therapy (n = 378), individuals who underwent physical therapy tailored to EDS (n = 602) more frequently reported improvements.

### Ehlers-Danlos syndrome presenting with primary nocturnal enuresis [^114p2qP7]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), hypermobility type, is probably the most common EDS type, as well as the most common heritable connective tissue disorder. Bladder dysfunction is a rare clinical manifestation of EDS and manifests itself as primary nocturnal enuresis. We present a 10-year-old boy referred to a pediatric nephrology consultation due to primary nocturnal enuresis and daytime symptoms of urinary urgency. During the appointment, a tendency to joint hypermobility was noted. On evaluation, the skin was hyperextensible and the Beighton score was positive. Genetic testing revealed a variant of the COL5A1 gene not yet described in the literature.

### Pilot study of an online-delivered mindfulness meditation in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS): Effect on quality-of-life and participant lived experience [^116emBGi]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2023). High credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are connective tissue disorders with multi-systemic symptoms. Management of chronic pain and other symptoms of EDS is a challenge for patients and clinicians. Mindfulness-based approaches for chronic pain produce improvement in pain symptoms. Mindfulness meditation could be an acceptable and readily accessible therapy for pain in EDS. This study evaluated the effect of daily practice of mindfulness meditation on pain experience and quality-of-life in EDS.

A pre-post design enabled assessment of change in quality-of-life (SF-36) after practicing internet-delivered mindful meditation for two weeks. Thematic analysis of interviews (n = 10) documented lived experience of meditation practice for pain symptoms. One hundred fifty-seven participants were recruited from UK EDS charities mailing lists, and seventy-six completed the two-week intervention.

There was a statistically significant improvement in the SF-36 mental component summary score of medium effect size; the change was clinically important. Thematic analysis revealed three key themes of lived experience relating to increased body awareness, reduction in pain intensity, and barriers to practicing meditation.

This study provides novel evidence about the effect and experience of meditation for symptoms in people with EDS. The outcomes warrant further research with appropriate control groups to determine efficacy. Mindfulness-based interventions are effective for chronic pain relief in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS).

### Profiling hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS): factors in health and wellbeing with chronic conditions and opportunities for improving self-management [^115rut8g]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2025). Low credibility.

Factors affecting physical and psychological outcomes for those with chronic conditions are complex and extend beyond medical symptomology to numerous demographic influences. Living with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is characterized by diagnostic delay and numerous comorbidities, which are known to impact wellbeing.

This high-powered study, consisting of 415 participants, investigates the mediating effect of diagnosis, comorbidity, and age on wellbeing. It provides insights into the effects of the latest hEDS reclassification. Validated measures were used to assess quality of life, perceived social support, physical health, fatigue, anxiety, pain, and loneliness.

Results indicated worse outcomes for those diagnosed after the reclassification and for those with a higher number of comorbidities. Conversely, improved outcomes were associated with older age. Findings were supported by insights captured in participants' demographic profiles, where a wider breadth of comorbidities was recorded than previously identified. Meanwhile, there was no evidence of a change in the route to diagnosis over time, and data showed ongoing limitations in terms of options for effective treatment.

These findings point to the potential effectiveness of self-management techniques for improving well-being with chronic conditions and highlight the need for improved awareness of hEDS and its management amongst primary care practitioners.

### Rare vascular complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113YTQYQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders often grouped with Marfan and Loeys-Dietz syndromes. These syndromes have variable abnormalities of the skin, ligaments, blood vessels, and viscera. The prevalence of EDS is estimated at 1 in 5000 births, lacking ethnic, racial, or geographical predisposition. The diverse genetic and molecular changes found in EDS result in poorly described subtypes and overlapping phenotypes. Despite this diversity, skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and widened atrophic scars remain the key diagnostic features in classical EDS, with minor manifestations such as bruising or bleeding diathesis. In contrast, vascular EDS predominantly presents with thin, translucent skin and a tendency for the rupture of hollow organs and arteries due to generalized vascular fragility, resulting in the worst prognosis among EDS subtypes. We present a case of an elderly man with genetically confirmed classical EDS, presenting with cumulative and devastating vascular complications throughout his life, resulting in his mortality.

### Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in a young woman with anorexia nervosa and complex somatic symptoms [^111B7FwR]. The International journal of eating disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The Ehler-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of clinically heterogeneous connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, hyperextensibility of the skin, and a general connective tissue fragility that can induce symptoms from multiple organ systems. We present a case of comorbid anorexia nervosa and EDS in a 23-year old woman with a multitude of somatic symptoms that were initially attributed to the eating disorder but that were likely caused by the underlying EDS. Various EDS symptoms, such as gastrointestinal complaints, smell and taste abnormalities, and altered somatosensory awareness may resemble or mask an underlying eating disorder, and vice versa. Because of the large clinical heterogeneity, correctly identifying symptoms of EDS presents a challenge for clinicians, who should be aware of this group of underdiagnosed and potentially serious syndromes. The Beighton Hypermobility Score is an easily applicable screening instrument in assessing potential EDS in patients with joint hypermobility.

### A narrative review of the literature on illness uncertainty in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Implications for research and clinical practice [^117B6u1v]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). High credibility.

Themes were determined utilizing the data charting method outlined by Arksey and O'Malley, wherein data is synthesized and interpreted by sorting material according to key issues and themes. They encourage a narrative review utilizing a descriptive-analytical approach, characterized by applying a common analytic framework to all works reviewed, to allow for the collection of standardized information in each study. To this end, data was collected from each reviewed manuscript on the broad domains of (1) sources or causes of illness uncertainty (IU) and (2) adverse impacts of IU. As pervasive themes within these broader domains became apparent, they were categorized further within these domains, and findings within said themes were summarized across studies. Based on these findings, the relevance for clinical intervention and further research is discussed.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^113y23Lo]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

Previous research has highlighted the challenges that patients with EDS encounter when seeking diagnosis and treatment, often resulting in negative experiences with healthcare providers and the healthcare system. Such experiences have led to clinician‐associated traumatization and poorer health outcomes for patients with this condition (Halverson et al.). Patients with EDS who do come to clinic expect genetic counselors to provide them with education about their condition, address their psychosocial needs, and create positive experiences for them (Ahimaz et al.).

However, the genetic counselors in our study reported that many patients have a misconception that a genetic test can offer them an official diagnosis of hEDS, or that genetics specialists are responsible for managing their symptoms. These misconceptions result in unmet physical and psychosocial needs for the patient (Langhinrichsen‐Rohling et al.). These misunderstandings often lead to a large amount of time being spent by genetic counselors to correct these misconceptions and address patients' inflated expectations.

Additionally, our participants also highlighted their need to use their psychosocial skills more frequently with this patient population compared to others. Ultimately, due to the complexity of this condition, patients with hEDS require more time and effort from genetic counselors to provide the care they deserve. As a result, many participants reported feelings of burnout and discouragement because they believed that they had failed to address the needs of these patients fully.

### Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS): Association with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and orthopaedic considerations [^117GwFhy]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the most common type of dysautonomia, characterized by dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system. It manifests with symptoms of orthostatic intolerance, with or without associated orthostatic hypotension and excessive autonomic excitation. Given the numerous presenting musculoskeletal symptoms of POTS and its known associations with other clinical entities like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, POTS poses an unusual treatment challenge of which orthopaedic surgeons and related healthcare providers should be aware.

- **Case description**: We describe two patients with a diagnosis of POTS and musculoskeletal manifestations. The first is a 13-year-old boy with a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and worsening back pain. His musculoskeletal symptoms resolved after treatment with a Boston Overlap LSO brace and physical therapy, while his cardiovascular symptoms resolved after pharmacologic treatment. The second patient is a 17-year-old girl with an L1 vertebral hemangioma and sudden-onset pain radiating to her lower extremities. Her symptoms were controlled with therapy and gabapentin.

- **Literature review**: POTS is a poorly understood and controversial clinical entity, with a lack of awareness and knowledge regarding the syndrome among the majority of medical specialists. Its complex and wide range of clinical presentations have led to it being commonly mistaken for malingering, depression, and anxiety disorders. A review of the literature did not yield any previous studies addressing this issue.

### Practical management strategies for benign hypermobility syndromes [^112iRnvV]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2021). Low credibility.

Patients with symptomatic hypermobility syndrome, such as hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders (HSD), commonly present to rheumatologists with joint pain and functional disability. Providers often have difficulty with diagnosis due to a lack of knowledge on the range of associated manifestations and the available therapeutic modalities. This review will discuss recent updates on diagnostic measures and treatment options for rheumatologists to help patients navigate hEDS/HSD.

- **Recent findings**: This article describes newer diagnostic measures and assessment of hEDS/HSD manifestations. Evidence supporting physical therapy and occupational therapy is provided, as well as recent updates on assistive devices, compressive garments, orthoses, and surgical interventions. Given patient heterogeneity, specific guidance about the amount and type of therapies required to produce a beneficial effect is lacking. Treatment should be individualized, and many of the studies focus on regional joint complaints rather than a whole-body approach.

In summary, physical therapy and occupational therapy remain the cornerstone of treatment.

### A narrative review of the literature on illness uncertainty in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Implications for research and clinical practice [^117QVnHv]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). Low credibility.

While no genes have been identified as causing hEDS, the impact of the disorder is lifelong. In fact, while the initial presentation of symptoms occurs in childhood to early adolescence, on average, one study indicated that patients wait 22 years between the initial presentation of symptoms and receiving an appropriate diagnosis. Therefore, education in the management of the condition must be rendered to both pediatric and adult providers, and consideration of the lifespan implications of the disorder is crucial.

Early efforts to promote patient education are also important because, although hEDS is vastly more prevalent than the other more rare and medically grave EDS subtypes, anecdotally, patients report engagement with online resources and other media outlets that warn of potential dire and life-threatening symptoms. The fact that the diagnosis of hEDS is primarily made based on physical exam and self-report of symptoms (e.g. joint hypermobility, subluxation, pain) may be unsatisfying to families who may feel the need for a more comprehensive diagnostic work-up to identify or rule out other more concerning EDS subtypes. In fact, in a review of qualitative studies assessing diagnostic delays in adults with hEDS, a lack of confirmatory tests was cited as a key perceived barrier by patients to receiving an appropriate diagnosis.

Additional cited diagnostic barriers included the range of symptoms experienced and provider attitudes (i.e. attributing symptoms to mental illness), suggesting that while hEDS is generally considered a less severe form of EDS, patients may not be easily reassured.

### Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorders [^115gKGDQ]. American Family Physician (2021). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorders are the most common symptomatic joint hypermobility conditions seen in clinical practice. The 2017 International Classification of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes replaced previous terms for symptomatic joint hypermobility with hypermobile EDS and introduced the term hypermobility spectrum disorders for patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for hypermobile EDS. Both conditions are diagnosed by applying the 2017 diagnostic criteria, which also excludes other less common conditions presenting with joint hypermobility, such as other forms of EDS and heritable connective tissue disorders. Hypermobile EDS is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, but it does not have a known genetic mutation to help with diagnosis. Clinical features of hypermobile EDS include joint hypermobility, skin findings, and joint pains or redislocations. Hypermobile EDS, and less commonly, hypermobility spectrum disorders, may also be associated with several extra-articular symptoms, including anxiety disorders, chronic pain, fatigue, orthostatic intolerance, functional gastrointestinal disorders, and pelvic and bladder dysfunction.

The central goals of therapy are managing symptoms, preventing joint injury, and educating patients about their condition. Based on limited evidence, patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders may benefit from physical and occupational therapy, psychological support, and self-management. Primary care physicians play a key role not only in initial recognition, diagnosis, and patient management but also in ensuring the coordination of care among specialists.

### Twenty-three-year-old patient with chronic pain and fainting spells: A clinical vignette [^112JwwMV]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

Care for and clinical presentation of patients with connective tissue disorders, specifically hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, is poorly understood. Diagnosis can often take years, and comprehensive care can be difficult to coordinate for these patients. This vignette aims to show the clinical characteristics of a young female with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos, as well as the evaluation of her diagnostic presentation and subsequent treatment. The demographic data of this population are yet to be established, and as it can vary widely between individuals, it is important to recognize symptoms that distinguish this disorder from others with similar presentations. Education of physicians on this syndrome will allow earlier recognition of symptoms and lead to better outcomes for these patients overall.

### Healthcare experiences among adults with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorder in the United States [^111ZuZDf]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2024). Low credibility.

This cross-sectional mixed-method study examined healthcare experiences among individuals in the U.S. with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (hEDS) and hypermobility spectrum disorder (HSD), genetic connective tissue disorders. The hypothesis was that many individuals with these conditions would report low satisfaction with healthcare and low health-related quality of life and that lower healthcare satisfaction would be related to lower health-related quality of life and self-efficacy for symptom management.

Adults living in the U.S. with hEDS or HSD (N = 2125) completed an online survey assessing satisfaction with healthcare, health-related quality of life, and symptom management self-efficacy. Qualitative data were also gathered on desired changes to improve healthcare.

Participants reported low satisfaction with healthcare and lower health-related quality of life and symptom management self-efficacy compared to norm groups. Lower satisfaction with healthcare was associated with lower health-related quality of life and lower symptom management self-efficacy, p < .001. The most common desired change to improve healthcare was more knowledge about hEDS and HSD among healthcare professionals.

U.S. adults with joint hypermobility report negative healthcare experiences and poor health-related quality of life. Future research should explore ways to improve healthcare experiences and quality of care for individuals with hEDS and HSD.

### Arterial complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: A case series [^111FZF1P]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders with several recognized types. Patients with a type of EDS experience connective tissue abnormalities resulting in joint hypermobility, skin and vascular fragility, and generalized tissue friability. Classical EDS (cEDS) typically results from dominant pathogenic variants in COL5A1 or COL5A2. The cardinal features of cEDS are hyperextensible skin, atrophic scarring, and joint hypermobility. Although arterial complications are more characteristic of vascular EDS, individual cases of arterial events in cEDS have been reported.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 154 patients with a clinical diagnosis of cEDS from the UK was analyzed.

- **Results**: Seven patients (4.5%) with a diagnosis of cEDS, including four with pathogenic, one likely pathogenic, and two variants of uncertain significance in COL5A1, experienced arterial complications. These complications mostly involved medium-sized vessels as well as two abdominal aortic aneurysms. No unique clinical features were identified in these patients.

- **Conclusion**: There is a possible increased risk of arterial complications in patients with cEDS, although not well-defined. Clinicians should be aware of this possibility when presented with a patient with an arterial complication and features of cEDS. Long-term management in families with cEDS and a vascular complication should be individually tailored to the patient's and their family's history of vascular events.

### What are the most important symptoms to assess in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome? A questionnaire study based on the Delphi technique [^114inx1i]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2022). Low credibility.

This study aims to determine from questionnaires submitted to patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobile type (hEDS), what symptoms they perceive as having the most impact on their well-being and, according to them, what symptoms should be assessed.

Three rounds of online questionnaires were conducted following the Delphi method. The first round allowed us to obtain the most important symptoms to assess according to the patients. The second and third rounds aimed at ranking the categories according to their order of importance. Establishment of a consensus was evaluated using Kendall's coefficient of concordance.

A total of 118 responses were analyzed for the first round and 87 for the second and the third round. Ten categories were extracted from the first round. Ranking of the 10 categories in the second round did not reach consensus (W = 0.33, p < 0.001), nor did the four most important categories in the third round (W = 0.43, p < 0.001). However, three categories stand out from the ranking: "pain", "fatigue and sleep disorders", and "musculoskeletal disorders".

These categories seem to be the most important to assess in patients with hEDS, despite the lack of consensus on this ranking.

- **Implications for rehabilitation**: Pain, fatigue and sleep disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders should be given high consideration in the assessment of patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The high phenotypic variability in hypermobile EDS requires individualized assessment for each patient and a multidisciplinary approach.

### Hippotherapy in the management of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113xz3ng]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is an inherited condition characterized by joint hypermobility, instability, chronic pain, and fatigue, significantly impacting quality of life and autonomy. Management focuses solely on symptom alleviation. After experiencing a rapid decline in functional abilities, a patient in late adolescence with hypermobile EDS underwent hippotherapy rehabilitation for 30 hours. She saw substantial improvements in fatigue, chronic pain, and walking abilities. Hippotherapy played a crucial role in refining her postural balance, motor skills, proprioception, muscle function, and endurance. It also positively affected her cognitive and emotional regulation by stimulating sensory inputs that activate neural pathways, providing relief from pain and fatigue. Notably, the patient transitioned from wheelchair reliance to walking with crutches, greatly enhancing both gait quality and speed. These findings demonstrate the relevance of hippotherapy for the rehabilitation of hypermobile EDS, reducing the need for pharmacological interventions and fostering a proactive approach to future challenges.

### Effects of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patients on the workflow and professional satisfaction of genetic counselors [^111LG4nk]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2024). Low credibility.

In addition to education, participants reported specific strategies and skills they used with EDS patients. Common techniques included contracting, which involves establishing the patient's understanding and goals for the appointment, setting expectations, and redirecting conversations. Most participants expressed that they utilize their psychosocial skills more with this patient population. To ensure the patient's expectations and needs are met, many participants stated that they prioritize contracting with every patient they see for hEDS.

One participant mentioned, "I do a good amount of contracting at the beginning of sessions to just say, 'This is who I am, this is what I can do, this is what we typically see, I'm going to assess your risk for one of these connective tissue disorders, and if what I imagine is true and that the risk is low, we can still do testing'. I do a lot of that because I don't like disappointing people".

Another participant found contracting important because patients arrive with differing goals: "If someone just wants medical information and good referrals of the whole system, we can give them that. And if someone is just really looking for social support, I can do that" (participant 12).

Almost all participants discussed psychosocial counseling as their predominant role for hEDS patients. They provided support for their patients by listening, validating, and empathizing with their stories. Many stated that this part of their role is what differentiates them from other healthcare professionals.

### Reduced skin thickness: A new minor diagnostic criterion for the classical and hypermobility types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^114F9CK4]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is mainly based on clinical criteria, although in some instances, a sound molecular diagnosis is available. Clinical signs can be divided into two categories: one with high diagnostic specificity and the other with low specificity. Despite the fact that reduced skin thickness is one of the dermatological features in patients with EDS, this issue has not been analyzed in greater detail.

- **Objectives**: To determine skin thickness in patients with the classical and hypermobility types of EDS.

- **Methods**: In 21 patients with the classical type of EDS and in nine patients with the hypermobility type of EDS, skin thickness was analyzed at different body sites by cross-sectional B-mode scans obtained with a 20-MHz ultrasound system.

- **Results**: We found a significant decrease in skin thickness in both types of EDS, which was highest at the chest and at the distal part of the lower leg.

- **Conclusions**: We propose that the reduced thickness of the dermis as determined by high-resolution 20-MHz ultrasound can be used as a new minor criterion in the diagnosis of the classical and the hypermobility types of EDS.

### Pain in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is common, severe, and associated with functional impairment [^112Ew8sr]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2010). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Musculoskeletal pain is mentioned in the diagnostic criteria and described as early in onset, chronic, and debilitating. However, systematic research on pain in EDS is scarce.

We investigated the prevalence and impact of pain and associated features in a large group of EDS patients. A study was performed among members of the Dutch EDS patient organization (n = 273). The McGill Pain Questionnaire was used to investigate various aspects of pain, the Sickness Impact Profile to study functional impairment, the Symptom Checklist subscale for sleep to evaluate sleep disturbances, and the Checklist Individual Strength subscale for fatigue to determine fatigue severity.

The results of this study show that chronic pain in EDS is highly prevalent and associated with regular use of analgesics. Pain is more prevalent and more severe in the hypermobility type than in the classic type. Pain severity is correlated with hypermobility, dislocations, and previous surgery. Additionally, pain is correlated with low nocturnal sleep quality and contributes to functional impairment in daily life, independent of the level of fatigue.

From this large cohort of EDS patients, we conclude that pain is common and severe in EDS. Pain is related to hypermobility, dislocations, and previous surgery, and is associated with moderate to severe impairment.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^116n3wTw]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, specifically concerning gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend focusing on the treatment of the most prominent gastrointestinal symptoms and addressing abnormal gastrointestinal function test results in patients with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility spectrum disorders, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, and mast cell activation syndrome. It is crucial to include treatment for symptoms attributable to postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and/or mast cell activation syndrome, as well as addressing general disorders of gut-brain interaction and gastrointestinal motility disorders.

### Obstetric and gynecologic challenges in women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^116s2NSJ]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

To determine the frequency of obstetric and gynecologic issues in women with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) compared with the general population and within the three most common subtypes of EDS, an anonymous, prospective online questionnaire in English was posted to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation website.

Of the 1,769 participants who completed the survey, 1,225 reported a typed diagnosis of EDS. Further stratification to the three most common types and reproductive-aged women (n = 775) allowed conclusions regarding differences in rates of obstetric complications and gynecologic dysfunction compared with the general population and between types of EDS. Rates of obstetric outcomes for women who reported at least one pregnancy included term pregnancy in 69.7%, preterm birth in 25.2%, spontaneous abortion in 57.2%, and ectopic pregnancy in 5.1%. Infertility was reported by 44.1% of survey respondents. Normal menstrual cycles were reported by only 32.8%, with intermenstrual bleeding occurring in 18.6%. Heavy menstrual bleeding was reported by 32.9% of survey participants. Gynecologic pain reported included dysmenorrhea in 92.5% and dyspareunia in 77.0%.

There is a much greater prevalence of obstetric and gynecologic issues reported by women with EDS than in the general population. Additionally, rates differed significantly among the three most common types of EDS, with the vascular type having the highest rates of adverse outcomes.

### Rare vascular complications in classical Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^1165wceY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of connective tissue disorders associated with skin, ligament, blood vessel, and organ abnormalities. Skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and widened atrophic scars are characteristic of classical EDS. Vascular complications, though rare in classical EDS, can be life-threatening. This necessitates looking for vascular associations in non-vascular forms, such as classical EDS, due to the heterogeneity of the syndrome. Reports of vascular complications in classical EDS are often limited to hematomas being the most frequent manifestation.

This case report discusses an elderly patient with genetically confirmed classical EDS who suffered from a series of pulmonary and vascular complications, including spontaneous haemopneumothorax, aortic dissection, and eventual mesenteric hemorrhage, which resulted in his death. Identifying clinical red flags is crucial to predict such future catastrophic vascular events and guide appropriate counseling and management strategies for individuals with classical EDS.

### Dermatologic manifestations and diagnostic assessments of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes: A clinical review [^1123gGQg]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2023). High credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) comprise a group of connective tissue disorders that manifest with skin hyperextensibility, easy bruising, joint hypermobility, and fragility of the skin, soft tissues, and some organs. A correct assessment of cutaneous features, along with the use of adjunct technologies, can improve diagnostic accuracy.

- **Objectives**: To systematically review the cutaneous features and adjunct investigations of EDS.

- **Methods**: A search of PubMed and Web of Science for EDS-related cutaneous features and additional investigations was undertaken from the publication of the 2017 International Classification of EDS until January 15, 2022.

- **Results**: One hundred forty studies involved 839 patients with EDS. The EDS female-to-male ratio was 1.36:1 (P < .001). A high prevalence of skin hyperextensibility, bruising, and soft skin were noted. Most patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome showed venous visibility, skin fragility, and acrogeria. Classical EDS showed subcutaneous spheroids and molluscoid pseudotumours. In patients who underwent skin biopsies, only 30.3% and 71.4% showed features suggestive of EDS using light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy, respectively.

- **Limitations**: Retrospective study and small case numbers for some EDS subtypes.

- **Conclusions**: An accurate clinical diagnosis increases the chances of a molecular diagnosis, particularly for rarer EDS subtypes, while decreasing the need for genetic testing where there is a low clinical suspicion for a monogenic EDS subtype.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^115LdQRq]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, more specifically with respect to evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering obtaining diagnostic testing for functional defecation disorders with anorectal manometry, balloon expulsion test, or defecography in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and lower gastrointestinal symptoms, such as incomplete evacuation. This is due to the high prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction, especially rectal hyposensitivity, in this population.

### The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes [^113xMwSD]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2020). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue, with common features including joint hypermobility, soft and hyperextensible skin, abnormal wound healing, and easy bruising. Fourteen different types of EDS are recognized, of which the molecular cause is known for 13 types. These types are caused by variants in 20 different genes, the majority of which encode the fibrillar collagen types I, III, and V, modifying or processing enzymes for those proteins, and enzymes that can modify glycosaminoglycan chains of proteoglycans. For the hypermobile type of EDS, the molecular underpinnings remain unknown. As connective tissue is ubiquitously distributed throughout the body, manifestations of the different types of EDS are present, to varying degrees, in virtually every organ system. This can make these disorders particularly challenging to diagnose and manage. Management consists of a care team responsible for surveillance of major and organ-specific complications (for example, arterial aneurysm and dissection) and integrated physical medicine and rehabilitation. No specific medical or genetic therapies are available for any type of EDS.

### AGA clinical practice update on GI manifestations and autonomic or immune dysfunction in hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome: Expert review [^116P9WeC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, particularly in relation to the evaluation of gastrointestinal symptoms, the AGA 2025 guidelines recommend considering testing for celiac disease earlier in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders who report a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, not only those with diarrhea. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine testing for disaccharidase deficiencies or other diet-mediated mechanisms as causes of gastrointestinal symptoms in hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders.

### Use of cluster analysis to delineate symptom profiles in an Ehlers-Danlos syndrome patient population [^113D1dgb]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2019). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDSs) are a set of rare heritable disorders of connective tissue, characterized by defects in the structure and synthesis of extracellular matrix elements that lead to a myriad of problems, including joint hypermobility and skin abnormalities. Because EDS affects multiple organ systems, defining clear boundaries and recognizing overlapping clinical features shared by disease phenotypes is challenging.

The objective of this study was to seek evidence of phenotypic subgroups of patients with distinctive symptom profiles and describe these resulting subgroups. Data were extracted from a repository assembled between 2001 and 2013 by the National Institute on Aging Intramural Research Program. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to form distinct subgroups of patients concerning the domains of pain, physical and mental fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and nighttime sleep. These domains were selected based on literature review, clinician expertise, and guidance from patient advisors.

One hundred seventy-five patients met all inclusion criteria. Three subgroups were identified:

- **Pain dominant subgroup**: This group consisted of 39 patients who had the highest mean pain values but the lowest mean values of other symptoms.
- **High symptom burden subgroup**: This group comprised 71 patients and exhibited high mean values across all domains.
- **Mental fatigue subgroup**: The 65 patients in this group had high mean values for mental fatigue and daytime sleepiness but a lower mean value for pain.

The subgroups aligned with the clinical observation of the heterogeneous nature of EDS, reflecting the complex and varied symptomatology of the condition.

### Musculoskeletal complaints, physical activity and health-related quality of life among patients with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type [^111KEZTo]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the musculoskeletal complaints, physical activity (PA), and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with the Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (EDS-HT).

Thirty-two female EDS-HT patients, as defined by the Villefranche criteria, and 32 gender- and age-matched healthy control subjects participated in the study. Data regarding musculoskeletal complaints were collected using a specific form developed for the study. Daily PA and HRQoL were evaluated by the Baecke questionnaire and the RAND 36-Item Health Survey, respectively.

Results indicated a significant presence of joint pain, joint dislocations, muscle cramps, tendinitis, fatigue, and headaches in the EDS-HT patient group. Joint pain was reported as the most frequent and severe symptom. The habitual PA level was diminished in the patient group, with EDS-HT subjects showing significantly lower sport participation but a comparable leisure time excluding sports compared to the healthy control subjects. All eight HRQoL dimensions of the RAND-36, as well as both physical and emotional summary scores, were significantly impaired in EDS-HT.

In conclusion, EDS-HT is characterized by severe musculoskeletal complaints and has a detrimental effect on habitual PA levels and HRQoL in both physical and psychosocial dimensions. Appropriate treatment and management in healthcare are needed.

### Clinical and molecular features of 66 patients with musculocontractural Ehlers-Danlos syndrome caused by pathogenic variants in (mcEDS-) [^114kx4gK]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2022). Low credibility.

This study represents the first international and the largest cohort of patients with mcEDS-CHST14. It provides a detailed and comprehensive catalog of clinical and molecular features associated with mcEDS-CHST14. A complete list of pathogenic variants in CHST14 from various ethnic backgrounds, the accurate prevalence of multisystem manifestations, and clinical courses of important complications are described.

Characteristic craniofacial, skeletal, and cutaneous features were shared by all patients and could be recognized during the neonatal period or infancy. Distinctive craniofacial and skeletal features evolved gradually from early childhood to adolescence or adulthood, as mentioned in previous case series. Regarding craniofacial features, we have created merged images of facial photographs in their childhood as well as in their adolescence-adulthood (figure 2A) and statistical significance was shown between the two periods (figure 2B). Talipes equinovarus, treated with braces or surgery, resulted in various types of progressive deformities. Congenital contractures of fingers tended to become milder, and peripheral joint hypermobility tended to become prominent. Spinal deformities typically included mild scoliosis and occasionally progressive thoracolumbar kyphosis, accompanied by reduced physiological thoracic spine curvature, cervical kyphosis, and vertebral malformations.

Cutaneous features, as described previously and common in other types of EDS, included hyperextensibility, bruisability, and fragility in all. Fine palmar creases without normal major palmar creases were also noted.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, more specifically with respect to evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend obtaining a diagnostic evaluation for gastrointestinal symptoms consistent with disorders of gut-brain interaction in patients with hypermobile EDS/hypermobility spectrum disorders and comorbid postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and/or mast cell activation syndrome. Follow a similar approach to the evaluation of disorders of gut-brain interaction as in the general population, including the use of a positive symptom-based diagnostic strategy and limited noninvasive testing.

### Patient perspectives on employment participation in the "hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome" [^112kBqa4]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

"Ehlers-Danlos syndrome" (EDS) is a heritable connective disorder influencing multiple aspects of daily life. Most studies have focused on describing the physical symptoms and level of disability, but little knowledge exists about the psychosocial effects of the pathology. Participation in employment is an aspect that strongly influences the quality of life of patients with chronic pathologies. This study, therefore, aimed to explore the lived experiences in employment participation of patients diagnosed with "hypermobile EDS".

- **Methods**: An inductive thematic analysis, using semi-structured interviews, was used. Nine patients, purposively selected by a continuum sampling strategy, were included. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim.

- **Results**: Data analysis resulted in three main themes: (1) elements assisting participation in employment, (2) limitations in employment participation, and (3) unemployment due to the "hypermobile EDS". On the one hand, the results show that related health complaints can impede employment participation to an important extent. On the other hand, patients also report several aspects of work that can positively affect their well-being.

- **Conclusion**: There are specific reasons for a person with "hypermobile EDS" to participate in employment. These reasons are different for each person and may even vary over time. "Hypermobile EDS" greatly impacts activities and participation in daily life, with "living with limitations" being the central theme in the lives of "hypermobile EDS" patients.

### Dilated aortic root and severe aortic regurgitation causing dilated cardiomyopathy in classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome [^113pTrDS]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of heritable disorders characterized by vast clinical heterogeneity. It ranges from the classic constellation of symptoms, including skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and skin fragility, to the exceedingly critical consequences of arterial rupture and visceral perforation. We describe the case of a 65-year-old male with a history of classic EDS who reported dyspnoea on exertion, orthopnoea, fatigue, and palpitations. He was found to have dilated cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 35%, aortic root dilation, and severe aortic valve regurgitation. The authors intend to draw attention to the rare cardiac manifestations of this condition and the therapeutic challenges involved in managing such patients.

### Atypical COL3A1 variants (glutamic acid to lysine) cause vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with a consistent phenotype of tissue fragility and skin hyperextensibility [^113tWVpM]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of rare inherited connective tissue disorders. Vascular EDS (vEDS) is caused by pathogenic variants in COL3A1, most frequently glycine substitutions. We describe the phenotype of the largest series of vEDS patients with glutamic acid to lysine substitutions (Glu > Lys) in COL3A1, which were all previously considered to be variants of unknown significance.

- **Methods**: Clinical and molecular data for seven families with three different Glu > Lys substitutions in COL3A1 were analyzed.

- **Results**: These Glu > Lys variants were reclassified from variants of unknown significance to either pathogenic or likely pathogenic in accordance with American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. All individuals with these atypical variants exhibited skin hyperextensibility, as seen in individuals with classical EDS and classical-like EDS, and evidence of tissue fragility as seen in individuals with vEDS.

- **Conclusion**: The clinical data demonstrate the overlap between the different EDS subtypes and underline the importance of next-generation sequencing gene panel analysis. The three different Glu > Lys variants point toward a new variant type in COL3A1 causative of vEDS, which has consistent clinical features. This is important knowledge for COL3A1 variant interpretation. Further follow-up data are required to establish the severity of tissue fragility complications compared with patients with other recognized molecular causes of vEDS.

### Clinical and genetic aspects of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, classic type [^1173KNmt]. Genetics in Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, fragile and soft skin, delayed wound healing with formation of atrophic scars, easy bruising, and generalized joint hypermobility. It comprises Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type I and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type II, but it is now apparent that these form a continuum of clinical findings and differ only in phenotypic severity.

It is currently estimated that approximately 50% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harbor mutations in the COL5A1 and the COL5A2 gene, encoding the α1 and the α2-chain of type V collagen, respectively. However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes.

In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis. Inter- and intrafamilial phenotypic variability is observed, but no genotype-phenotype correlations have been observed.
