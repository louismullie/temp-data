## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret an HFE C282Y/H63D compound heterozygote result, including diagnostic implications, risk, phenotypic assessment, management, family screening, and when to investigate non‑HFE causes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the genotype terminology and whether it is diagnostic on its own. Then, I should verify population risk and clinical penetrance. Next, I will review phenotypic thresholds and secondary causes of hyperferritinemia. After that, I will determine management based on phenotype rather than genotype. I will then consider cascade screening for relatives and indications for extended genetic testing. Finally, I will summarize counseling points and a practical follow-up plan with clear thresholds and monitoring intervals.

> Let me first confirm the genotype terminology. Heterozygous for both C282Y and H63D denotes compound heterozygosity, which in practice almost always implies the two variants are in trans on opposite alleles, and this is distinct from simple heterozygosity or C282Y homozygosity, which carries a much higher risk of iron overload [^114qBbCN] [^112VoiMx] [^111YdsFM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. This genotype alone does not establish a diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis, and diagnosis should never be based on HFE genotype without biochemical or tissue evidence of iron overload. I need to ensure we anchor decisions in iron indices or direct measures of hepatic iron, as emphasized by EASL guidance across iterations [^112dgQXJ] [^112ughp1] [^113uk8ZF].

> Now, I should review risk and penetrance. A pooled analysis suggests an increased relative risk for iron overload with C282Y/H63D versus wild type, but wait, let me verify that relative risk is not the same as absolute risk. Prospective cohorts and UK Biobank show that most compound heterozygotes do not develop clinical morbidity, with only a small minority showing disease, and any signal is modest and mainly in subgroups such as men in midlife. So, I should correct my initial impression from the odds ratio and emphasize low clinical penetrance overall [^112pCm37] [^111AM8ou] [^117EKygT] [^1153m3h1].

> Next, I should review phenotypic criteria. Let me check the thresholds that justify further evaluation. EASL recommends using transferrin saturation above roughly 45 percent in females and 50 percent in males and sex-specific ferritin thresholds above 200 micrograms per liter in females and 300 micrograms per liter in males as biochemical flags for iron overload. I need to ensure hyperferritinemia is not attributed to HFE status until common secondary causes such as alcohol use, metabolic syndrome and NAFLD, chronic inflammation, viral hepatitis, malignancy, and liver disease are excluded through history, labs, and imaging when indicated [^112dgQXJ] [^114iaTPc] [^111viGqW].

> Let me consider management when iron overload is absent. If transferrin saturation and ferritin are normal, no treatment is indicated. I should confirm a baseline and then plan periodic monitoring of transferrin saturation and ferritin every two to three years, with shorter intervals if indices approach thresholds or if clinical risk factors emerge. I need to reinforce lifestyle counseling on alcohol moderation, metabolic health, and avoiding unnecessary iron supplementation, and I should guide all decisions by phenotype and cofactors rather than genotype alone [^113uk8ZF] [^113oDkdH] [^1161f53K].

> If iron overload is present, I will now examine indications for therapy. Phlebotomy can be considered for compound heterozygotes with confirmed iron overload by MRI or biopsy, aiming for ferritin around 50 to 100 micrograms per liter with normalization of transferrin saturation, while confirming and addressing comorbid contributors that often drive the phenotype. Let me double-check that EASL 2022 supports individualized phlebotomy decisions in this genotype only when iron overload is objectively documented, which it does [^1161f53K] [^111viGqW] [^112dgQXJ].

> Next, I should review cascade screening. Adult first-degree relatives should be informed, as siblings in particular have a meaningful chance of carrying C282Y or combinations that include C282Y homozygosity with far higher risk. I need to ensure testing minors is avoided and that screening emphasizes adult relatives with combined iron studies and HFE genotyping, performed with appropriate counseling. I will also note that family screening of a compound heterozygote can uncover C282Y homozygotes among relatives and that counseling should reflect this [^1112CU78] [^114qBbCN] [^111YdsFM].

> But wait, what if the phenotype is severe or atypical. I should consider rare non‑HFE hemochromatosis and iron disorders if there is substantial iron loading without C282Y homozygosity, especially at young age or with endocrine, cardiac, or reproductive features. In such cases, I need to check for second‑level genetic testing panels targeting TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP, and HJV, ideally after confirming iron burden by MRI or biopsy and excluding secondary causes, and refer to a specialist center given interpretive complexity [^114KaSko] [^112SQPtX] [^114P7Lc5] [^112Y6HRo].

> Let me think about pitfalls and misdiagnosis. I should confirm that abnormal iron studies in liver disease, inflammation, or hematologic conditions can prompt overdiagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis in non‑diagnostic genotypes like C282Y/H63D, leading to inappropriate phlebotomy. I need to ensure we correct for this by requiring phenotypic confirmation and by ruling out secondary causes before labeling HH or initiating venesection [^113nXjcn] [^113uk8ZF] [^112dgQXJ].

> Finally, I will summarize a practical plan. Document baseline iron indices, complete blood count, and liver tests, repeat iron studies to confirm persistence if abnormal, and apply sex‑specific thresholds for action. If indices are normal, reassure and monitor every two to three years with lifestyle guidance. If indices are elevated, repeat to confirm, exclude secondary causes, consider hepatic MRI quantification, and initiate phlebotomy only when iron overload is confirmed, with targets as above and comorbidity management in parallel. I should verify referral triggers such as ferritin persistently above about 500 micrograms per liter, evidence of liver dysfunction, or suspected advanced iron overload, and involve hepatology or genetics as needed [^112dgQXJ] [^112ubnkW] [^113ezoTm] [^1161f53K].

The patient is a **compound heterozygote (C282Y/H63D)** for HFE mutations, which confers a **low risk of clinically significant iron overload** [^113uk8ZF]. Most have normal or mildly elevated iron indices [^111AM8ou], and severe iron overload is rare without additional risk factors (e.g. alcohol, metabolic syndrome, hepatitis C) [^111YdsFM]. For **management**, guidance is based on phenotype: check ferritin and transferrin saturation, and if ferritin > 300 ng/mL (men) or > 200 ng/mL (women) or transferrin saturation > 45% [^112ubnkW], evaluate for other causes [^112dgQXJ] and consider phlebotomy only if iron overload is confirmed [^113uk8ZF]. Routine **family screening is not indicated**, but first-degree relatives should have iron studies and HFE testing if abnormal [^1112CU78].

---

## Clinical significance of compound heterozygosity

- **Risk of iron overload**: Compound heterozygotes have a low risk of clinically significant iron overload [^111AM8ou]; most have normal or mildly elevated iron indices [^111YdsFM], and severe overload is rare without additional risk factors.

- **Clinical manifestations**: When present, iron overload is usually mild to moderate [^111viGqW] and often associated with comorbidities such as alcohol use, metabolic syndrome, or hepatitis C [^111YdsFM].

- **Comparison with other genotypes**: Risk is significantly lower than C282Y homozygotes [^111AM8ou] but slightly higher than simple heterozygotes or H63D homozygotes [^112pCm37].

---

## Recommended clinical evaluation and monitoring

- **Initial evaluation**: Obtain serum ferritin, transferrin saturation [^112dgQXJ], CBC, and LFTs to assess iron status and liver function [^114QGrtg].

- **Interpretation of iron studies**: Elevated ferritin (> 300 ng/mL in men, > 200 ng/mL in women) or transferrin saturation (> 45%) [^112ubnkW] warrants evaluation for other causes of hyperferritinemia (e.g. alcohol, metabolic syndrome, liver disease) [^112dgQXJ].

- **Imaging and biopsy**: If significant iron overload is suspected, consider MRI [^112dgQXJ] or liver biopsy to confirm and quantify hepatic iron [^112SQPtX].

- **Follow-up**: Monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation every 1–2 years if initial studies are normal; if elevated, monitor more frequently and address modifiable risk factors.

---

## Management strategies

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Advise moderation of alcohol, weight management, and avoidance of unnecessary iron supplements or vitamin C [^113uk8ZF].

- **Phlebotomy**: Consider only if iron overload is confirmed by MRI or biopsy [^113uk8ZF], based on individualized assessment [^1161f53K].

- **Genetic counseling**: Provide counseling to explain the low risk of significant iron overload and the influence of environmental factors [^114qBbCN].

---

## Family screening recommendations

For family screening, **first-degree relatives** do not require routine genetic testing [^1139DCj8]; obtain iron studies and perform HFE testing only if results are abnormal. Genetic counseling should be offered to explain the **low risk associated with compound heterozygosity** and the importance of **monitoring iron status** [^1112CU78].

---

## Summary of clinical implications and recommendations

| **Clinical implication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Low risk of significant iron overload | Monitor ferritin and transferrin saturation every 1–2 years |
| Mildly elevated iron indices | Evaluate for other causes of hyperferritinemia [^112dgQXJ] |
| Confirmed iron overload | Consider phlebotomy based on individualized assessment [^113uk8ZF] |
| Family members | - No routine genetic screening <br/> - Monitor iron status [^1112CU78] |

---

Compound heterozygosity for C282Y and H63D confers a **low risk of clinically significant iron overload**. Management should be phenotype-guided, with regular monitoring of iron indices and individualized treatment if iron overload is confirmed [^111viGqW].

### Hfe C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes are at low risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity [^111AM8ou]. Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

The risk of hemochromatosis-related morbidity is unknown among HFE compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D). We used a prospective population-based cohort study to estimate the prevalence of elevated iron indices and hemochromatosis-related morbidity for compound heterozygotes. A total of 31,192 subjects of northern European descent were genotyped for HFE C282Y and H63D. An HFE-genotype stratified random sample of 1,438 subjects, followed for an average of 12 years to a mean age of 65 years, completed questionnaires and gave blood. Clinical examinations were blinded to HFE genotype.

A total of 180 (84 males) clinically examined C282Y/H63D participants were compared with 330 (149 males) controls with neither HFE mutation; 132 (65 males) and 270 (122 males), respectively, had serum iron measures at both timepoints. Mean serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) were significantly greater for male and female compound heterozygotes than for wild-types at baseline and follow-up (all P < 0.02), except for females who were premenopausal at baseline, where SF was similar in both genotype groups.

For subjects with serum measures from both baseline and follow-up, mean SF and TS levels did not change significantly for men or for postmenopausal women. However, for premenopausal women, SF levels increased from 43 to 109 microg/L for compound heterozygotes and from 35 to 64 microg/L for wild-types (both P < 0.001). Male and female compound heterozygotes had a similar prevalence of hemochromatosis-related morbidity to wild-types. One of 82 males and zero of 95 females had documented hemochromatosis-related morbidity.

### The clinical relevance of compound heterozygosity for the C282Y and H63D substitutions in hemochromatosis [^111YdsFM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

The hemochromatosis gene, HFE, contains two major mutations. While the effects of the C282Y substitution have been well-characterized, the clinical significance of the C282Y/H63D state remains unclear. This study assessed the phenotypic expression in C282Y/H63D subjects compared with C282Y homozygotes.

- **Methods**: Data were obtained from 91 C282Y/H63D probands, 158 C282Y/H63D subjects identified through family screening, and 483 C282Y homozygotes. Subjects underwent clinical evaluation, genotyping, biochemical assessment, and liver biopsy where clinically indicated.

- **Results**: C282Y/H63D probands had significantly less clinical and biochemical expression than C282Y homozygotes. Biochemical expression was higher in C282Y/H63D probands than in subjects identified through family screening (P < .001). Of the C282Y/H63D subjects with serum ferritin levels greater than 1000 µg/L, all had known comorbid factors that could have contributed to the increased ferritin level. Of the 51 C282Y/H63D subjects who underwent liver biopsy, significantly increased iron stores were present in 9 subjects, and hepatic fibrosis was present in 13. Twelve of the 13 had evidence of hepatic steatosis, excess alcohol consumption, or diabetes. The mobilizable iron level was significantly higher in C282Y homozygous males than in compound heterozygous males (P < .001). Genetic screening of C282Y/H63D first-degree relatives detected 5 C282Y homozygotes.

- **Conclusions**: C282Y/H63D subjects referred for assessment had a high prevalence of increased iron stores and associated comorbidities, warranting further investigation into the clinical impact of this genetic combination.

### A homozygous HFE gene splice site mutation (IVS5+1 G/A) in a hereditary hemochromatosis patient of Vietnamese origin [^114cXio4]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

The vast majority of Caucasian patients presenting with hereditary hemochromatosis demonstrate a single homozygous missense mutation in the HFE gene (C282Y). The underlying genetic defects in hemochromatosis patients of non-Caucasian origin are largely unknown. A 48-year-old man of Vietnamese origin presented with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, tertiary adrenocortical insufficiency, and laboratory results highly indicative of hereditary hemochromatosis. Because the patient was negative for the known HFE gene mutations C282Y, H63D, and S65C HFE, the entire coding region and intron/exon boundaries of the HFE gene was investigated. Sequencing studies identified a homozygous G-to-A transition at position +1 of intron 5 (IVS5+1 G/A). This newly described mutation alters the invariant G at position +1 of the 5' splice site, causing altered mRNA splicing and exon skipping, with exon 4 being spliced to exon 6. Both heterozygously affected children (age 19 and 20 years) had moderately increased ferritin levels with normal serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation. The newly described mutation was not detected in a control group consisting of 220 Caucasian individuals as verified by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. We describe for the first time a homozygous HFE splice site mutation (IVS5+1 G/A) in a non-Caucasian patient with hereditary hemochromatosis. Although the absence of this novel HFE gene mutation in Caucasian subjects suggests that the mutation is exclusive to this family, mutation screening in populations of different ethnic backgrounds is recommended.

### Hemochromatosis: Genetic testing and clinical practice [^115RMQMK]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2005). Low credibility.

The availability of a facile treatment for hemochromatosis renders early diagnosis of iron overload syndromes mandatory, and in many instances, genetic testing allows identification of individuals at risk of developing clinical disease before pathological iron storage occurs. Numerous proteins implicated in iron homeostasis have recently come to light, and defects in the cognate genes are associated with iron storage. Although most adult patients with hereditary iron overload are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene, an increasing number with hereditary iron storage have an HFE genotype not characteristic of the disease.

Heterozygosity for mutations in the gene encoding ferroportin 1 (FPN1) is probably the second most common genetic cause of hereditary iron storage in adults; here, the primarily affected cell is the macrophage. Rare defects, including mutations in the transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) gene, have also been identified in pedigrees affected with "non-HFE hemochromatosis". Homozygous mutations in the newly identified genes encoding hemojuvelin (HFE2) and hepcidin (HAMP) cause juvenile hemochromatosis. At the same time, heterozygosity for mutations in these genes can modify the clinical expression of iron storage in patients predisposed to iron storage in adult life.

Hemochromatosis might thus be considered a polygenic disease with strong environmental influences on its clinical expression. As our mechanistic understanding of iron pathophysiology improves, our desire to integrate clinical decision-making with the results of laboratory tests and molecular analyses increases.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (hh) [^111t4sVz]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Methods used for HFE testing: All the laboratories responding to this survey routinely screen for the HFE variants p.C282Y and p.H63D, although 12% report having a policy of testing for p.H63D only in clinically affected patients with a previous result showing p.C282Y heterozygosity. Additionally, 64% of respondents routinely test for the p.S65C variant, with some reporting that the test is performed occasionally and only on specific demands. A minority of laboratories (6%) also reported routinely testing for other genetic variants included in commercially sourced kits.

A large number of different methods are used by laboratories. The four methodological approaches most frequently reported were real-time PCR (41%), PCR and RFLP (16%), PCR and reverse hybridization (14%), and direct sequencing (11%). Other less commonly used methods (4.5–5.5%) include allele-specific PCR, PCR and high-resolution melting or single-strand conformational polymorphism, pyrosequencing, and single base extension. According to this survey, allelic discrimination real-time PCR was the most commonly described method for HFE genotyping.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^113ESgdy]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

It is recognized that early treatment to normalize iron stores increases the likelihood that the potential serious complications of the disease are effectively prevented, morbidity and mortality are reduced, and quality of life is increased. Moreover, it was recently shown in a cohort of 1086 p.C282Y homozygous patients treated at early stages that they have a long-term survival superior to the general population, with a decreased number of deaths by cardiovascular disease or extra-hepatic cancer, further supporting the benefit of sustained phlebotomy treatment of iron overload in HH.

The question remains, however, as to whether preventive treatment should be recommended to all unaffected but genetically confirmed individuals because there is no evidence that all of these subjects will necessarily develop iron overload-related morbidity. To address this question, a systematic literature search was performed. Search terms were phrased as PICO where patients (P) were defined as clinically or biochemically unaffected p.C282Y homozygotes or p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes; interventions (I) were the follow-up of iron indices (TS, SF) and phlebotomy treatment in comparison (C) with no intervention; and the expected outcome (O) was the evolution of iron indices and/or development of clinical symptoms.

All systematic reviews or meta-analyses and comparative designs (cohort studies, case–control studies, and cross-sectional studies) were eligible for inclusion.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^112ughp1]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly concerning genetic testing, the EASL 2010 guidelines recommend not diagnosing HFE hemochromatosis based solely on C282Y homozygosity. Instead, there should be evidence of increased iron stores.

### A Chinese patient with non-HFE-linked iron overload [^1178MFPo]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

The gene for hemochromatosis (HFE) was recently identified and contains two missense mutations: C282Y and H63D. The C282Y mutation is found homozygous in approximately 85% to 90% of patients of Northern European ancestry with hereditary hemochromatosis. There are no previous reports with results of genetic testing in Chinese patients with regard to iron overload. In this case report, we describe a Chinese woman with marked hepatic iron overload that was nonfamilial, with unusual biopsy findings, in whom neither the C282Y nor the H63D mutations in HFE were found.

### A population-based study of the biochemical and clinical expression of the H63D hemochromatosis mutation [^1127D47Z]. Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

- **Aims**: Two major mutations are defined within the hemochromatosis gene, HFE. Although the effects of the C282Y mutation have been well characterized, the effects of the H63D mutation remain unclear. We accessed a well-defined population in Busselton, Australia, and determined the frequency of the H63D mutation and its influence on total body iron stores.

- **Methods**: Serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels were correlated with the H63D mutation in 2,531 unrelated white subjects who did not possess the C282Y mutation.

- **Results**: Sixty-two subjects (2.1%) were homozygous for the H63D mutation, 711 (23.6%) were heterozygous, and 1,758 (58.4%) were wild-type for the H63D mutation. Serum transferrin saturation was significantly increased in male and female H63D homozygotes and heterozygotes compared with wild-types. Serum ferritin levels within each gender were not influenced by H63D genotypes. Elevated transferrin saturation ≥ 45% was observed in a greater proportion of male H63D carriers than male wild-types. Male H63D homozygotes (9%) and heterozygotes (3%) were more likely to have both elevated transferrin saturation and elevated ferritin ≥ 300 ng/mL than male wild-types (0.7%). Homozygosity for H63D was not associated with the development of clinically significant iron overload.

- **Conclusions**: The presence of the H63D mutation results in a significant increase in serum transferrin saturation but does not result in significant iron overload. In the absence of the C282Y mutation, the H63D mutation is not clinically significant.

### Genetic modifiers of penetrance to liver endpoints in HFE hemochromatosis: Associations in a large community cohort [^114H5BHW]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

The iron overload condition hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) can cause liver cirrhosis and cancer, diabetes, and arthritis. Males homozygous for the p.C282Y missense mutation in the homeostatin iron regulator (HFE) gene have the greatest risk; yet, only a minority develop these conditions. We aimed to determine whether common genetic variants influencing iron levels or liver disease risk in the general population also modify clinical penetrance in HFE p.C282Y and p.H63D carriers.

- **Methods**: We studied 1,294 male and 1,596 female UK Biobank HFE p.C282Y homozygous participants of European ancestry with medical records up to 14 years after baseline assessment. Polygenic scores quantified genetic effects of blood iron biomarkers and relevant diseases (identified in the general population). Analyses were also performed in other HFE p.C282Y/p.H63D genotype groups.

- **Results**: In male p.C282Y homozygotes, a higher iron polygenic score increased the risk of liver fibrosis or cirrhosis diagnoses (odds ratio for the top 20% of iron polygenic score vs. the bottom 20% = 4.90: 95% confidence intervals, 1.63–14.73; p = 0.005), liver cancer, and osteoarthritis, but not diabetes. A liver cirrhosis polygenic score was associated with liver cancer diagnoses. In female p.C282Y homozygotes, the osteoarthritis polygenic score was associated with increased osteoarthritis diagnoses, and the type-2 diabetes polygenic score was associated with diabetes. However, the iron polygenic score was not robustly associated with diagnoses in p.C282Y female homozygotes or in other p.C282Y/p.H63D genotypes.

This study highlights the significant role of genetic modifiers in the clinical presentation of HFE hemochromatosis, with implications for personalized medical approaches.

### Iron absorption by heterozygous carriers of the HFE C282Y mutation associated with hemochromatosis [^115PUSpf]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Research conducted before genotyping was possible suggested that subjects heterozygous for the genetic mutation associated with hemochromatosis absorbed nonheme iron more efficiently than control subjects when tested with a fortified meal. Heme-iron absorption in these subjects has not been reported.

- **Objective**: We compared the absorption of heme and nonheme iron from minimally or highly fortified test meals between HFE C282Y-heterozygous and wild-type control subjects.

- **Design**: After prospective genotyping of 256 healthy volunteers, 11 C282Y-heterozygous and 12 wild-type control subjects were recruited, and their iron absorption was compared using a hamburger test meal with or without added iron and ascorbic acid. After retrospective genotyping of 103 participants in previous iron-absorption studies, 5 C282Y-heterozygous subjects were compared with 72 wild-type control subjects.

- **Results**: HFE C282Y-heterozygous subjects did not differ significantly from wild-type control subjects in their absorption of either heme or nonheme iron from minimally or highly fortified test meals. No differences were detected in blood indexes of iron status, including serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and non-transferrin-bound iron, or in blood lipids or transaminases. However, heterozygotes had significantly greater, although normal, fasting glucose concentrations than wild-type control subjects. Compound heterozygotes (those who had both HFE C282Y and H63D mutations) absorbed more nonheme (but not heme) iron from meals with high (but not low) iron bioavailability.

Methods used for non-HFE-related HH testing

A total of 25 laboratories reported performing full gene sequencing for the diagnosis of non-HFE-related HH. The majority of these (52%) offered a panel of tests for HJV, HAMP, TFR2, SLC40A1 (FPN), and the entire HFE gene. Some laboratories (24%) also offer testing for FTH1 (for hyperferritinemia). Two of the responding laboratories perform a more comprehensive panel of tests for other iron overload-related genes, adding 5'UTRFTL (for hyperferritinemia), TF (for hypotransferrinemia), SLC11A2 (for anemia and iron overload), CP (for aceruloplasminemia), and BMP6 (so far not associated with human HH). The most common method used is direct DNA sequencing of the coding regions of selected genes. Some laboratories report other methods, such as single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis followed by direct sequencing of the detected variants and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based approaches. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification has been used in cases where a large gene deletion is suspected.

- **Practices on reporting**: The reporting of HFE genotyping results is generally performed using standard pre-defined templates, most commonly (63%) adapted according to specific reasons for referral. The reporting models and interpretative comments included are usually based on established guidelines, with some laboratories referring to more general guidelines for genetic testing. However, the majority refer to specific HH guidelines established either at a national level or from other published clinical or molecular diagnostic guidelines.

### Variable phenotypic presentation of iron overload in H63D homozygotes: Are genetic modifiers the cause [^112FsSX3]. Gut (2001). Low credibility.

Initially considered a polymorphism of the HFE gene, the H63D mutation is now widely recognized as a haemochromatosis-associated allele. However, few H63D homozygotes with clinical manifestations of hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) have been reported. Concurrently, an increasing number of genes have been shown to interact with HFE in iron metabolism.

- **Aims**: To describe the clinical expression of iron overload (IO) associated with H63D homozygosity and to search for potential genetic modifiers, within the HFE or other genes, that could explain the variability of the phenotypes.

- **Patients and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical phenotype of 56 H63D homozygotes referred for a personal or family history of IO. For each subject, we examined intragenic HFE haplotypes and transferrin receptor (TfR) gene polymorphisms and searched for the Y250X mutation on the TFR2 gene. Additionally, we sequenced the HFE gene of H63D homozygotes with HH.

- **Results**: Fifty of 56 subjects had biological and/or clinical abnormalities of iron metabolism. Up to two-thirds of patients (n = 34) had no acquired cause of IO. Among these, 12 had a phenotypic diagnosis of HH. In the iron-loaded group, there was a strong prevalence of male patients. No correlation was found between the potential genetic modifiers and phenotypes. No additional mutation of HFE was identified.

- **Conclusion**: The variable phenotypes associated with H63D homozygosity do not appear to be linked to other HFE mutations, to the TFR2 Y250X mutation, or to HFE or TfR gene intragenic polymorphisms. The exact role of H63D homozygosity in these phenotypic variations remains unclear.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^116Tzn77]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

General information on requirements for variant reporting can be found in appropriate nomenclature guidelines. It is recommended that Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) convention is followed when reporting variants and unclassified variants. Information on previously described variants can be found in available databases; however, the creation of locus-specific databases listing pathogenic and non-pathogenic variants is encouraged. The following represents some basic guidelines for reporting test results based on possible scenarios.

- **Reporting results for rare forms of HFE- or non-HFE-related HH**: The report should include a description of the reason why a particular variant(s) is considered causative, drawing on all relevant supporting data including the scientific published data. Determination of the parental origin of the detected variant(s) is advised. Predictive/carrier testing of relatives at risk should be offered after appropriate genetic counselling.

Ferroportin disease exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance associated with, in its usual form (type A), hepatic and splenic iron overload in the absence of increased TS. In the type B form, its phenotype mimics that of classical HH. Heterozygous SLC40A1 variants may be sufficient to cause these particular phenotypes, and this should be taken into account when conducting family studies.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^11543X31]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, with a focus on genetic testing, EASL 2010 guidelines recommend obtaining HFE testing for the C282Y and H63D polymorphisms in all patients with otherwise unexplained increased serum ferritin and increased transferrin saturation. It is advised to obtain HFE testing only in patients with increased transferrin saturation.

### Frequency and biochemical expression of C282Y/H63D hemochromatosis (HFE) gene mutations in the healthy adult population in Italy [^111ZgQci]. Journal of Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

The actual prevalence of the main hemochromatosis (HFE) mutations in the Italian adult population and their phenotypic expression have not yet been established. This information is key to advocate a mass-screening program.

- **Methods**: Two thousand one hundred adults were tested for the C282Y/H63D HFE gene mutations by an automated genotyping assay, as well as transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin levels.

- **Results**: No homozygotes for the C282Y mutation were found. Heterozygosity for the C282Y mutation was 3.1%, while heterozygosity and homozygosity for the H63D mutation were 21.5% and 2.5%, respectively. TS was significantly higher in C282Y heterozygotes and H63D homozygotes compared to wild-type individuals (P < 0.01). Interestingly, among the HFE wild-type subjects, 5.9% had a TS value above the 45% threshold.

- **Conclusions**: This study shows that (i) the predicted prevalence for C282Y homozygosity in Italy is 1:3900; (ii) the C282Y/H63D wild-type population has an increased baseline of iron parameters, possibly due to genetic factors not linked to the C282Y/H63D mutations; (iii) since in the latter population the actual tissue iron burden cannot be assessed, phenotypic (TS) screening in Italy is not recommended until the true prevalence of all mutations in the HFE gene and in other hemochromatosis genes is established.

### Hemochromatosis classification: update and recommendations by the BIOIRON Society [^114P7Lc5]. Blood (2022). High credibility.

Clinical elements that should raise a definite suspicion of HC are summarized, with the main clinical, biochemical, and imaging elements previously identified. In Whites with a negative first-level HFE test (i.e. p. Cys282Tyr homozygosity is not detected) and in non-Whites, a second-level genetic test should be considered to identify rarer variants in the HFE or other genes known to be linked to hepcidin control. In general, these types of HC are less influenced by cofactors and are characterized by a more severe and homogeneous clinical presentation, appearing at a younger age. The molecular diagnosis is often complex since variants in HC genes other than HFE are typically private, restricted to members of only one or a few families. Modern approaches based on next-generation sequencing (NGS) have greatly expanded diagnostic possibilities in rarer HC types, while simultaneously presenting enormous challenges in interpreting results.

NGS is generally available only at referral centers and requires specific expertise to avoid misdiagnosis, with a long wait time for results. Nonetheless, treatment of patients with a defined HC phenotype should not be delayed pending the genetic test results. Recently, NGS methods have enabled the estimation of the global prevalence of HFE and non-HFE HC in different populations, using data from significant genomic datasets like the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G), Exome Sequencing Project (ESP), and Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAc).

### Contribution of different HFE genotypes to iron overload disease: a pooled analysis [^112pCm37]. Genetics in Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To determine the contribution of the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE gene to the clinical expression of hereditary hemochromatosis, a pooled analysis was conducted. This analysis involved 14 case-control studies reporting HFE genotype data to evaluate the association of different HFE genotypes with iron overload. Additionally, data from the pooled analysis and other published data were used to estimate the penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype.

Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation carried the largest risk for iron overload (OR = 4383, 95% CI 1374 to > 10,000) and accounted for the majority of hemochromatosis cases (attributable fraction (AF) = 0.73). The risks associated with other genotypes were considerably smaller. These include an OR of 32 for genotype C282Y/H63D (95% CI 18.5 to 55.4, AF = 0.06); an OR of 5.7 for H63D/H63D (95% CI 3.2 to 10.1, AF = 0.01); an OR of 4.1 for C282Y heterozygosity (95% CI 2.9 to 5.8, with heterogeneity in study results, making this association uncertain); and an OR of 1.6 for H63D heterozygosity (95% CI 1 to 2.6, AF = 0.03). Estimates of penetrance for the C282Y/C282Y genotype were highly sensitive to the estimated prevalence of iron overload disease. At a prevalence of 2.5 per 1000 or less, the penetrance of the C282Y/C282Y genotype is unlikely to exceed 50%. The penetrance of other HFE genotypes is much lower.

C282Y homozygosity confers the highest risk for iron overload, but the H63D mutation is also associated with increased risk. The data indicate a gradient of risk associated with different HFE genotypes, suggesting the presence of other modifiers, either genetic or environmental, that contribute to the clinical presentation of hereditary hemochromatosis.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^1177BJZT]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Iron overload in humans is associated with a variety of genetic and acquired conditions. Of these, HFE hemochromatosis (HFE-HC) is by far the most frequent and well-defined inherited cause when considering epidemiological aspects and risks for iron-related morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients with HFE-HC are homozygotes for the C282Y polymorphism [1]. Without therapeutic intervention, there is a risk that iron overload will occur, with the potential for tissue damage and disease.

While a specific genetic test now allows for the diagnosis of HFE-HC, the uncertainty in defining cases and disease burden, as well as the low phenotypic penetrance of C282Y homozygosity, poses a number of clinical problems in the management of patients with HC. This clinical practice guideline will therefore focus on HFE-HC.

- **Rare forms of genetic iron overload**: Recently attributed to pathogenic mutations of transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2), hepcidin (HAMP), hemojuvelin (HJV), or a subtype of ferroportin (FPN) mutations, on which limited and sparse clinical and epidemiologic data are available, will not be discussed.

We have developed recommendations for the screening, diagnosis, and management of HFE-HC.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1177YQeJ]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual); heterozygous p.C282Y: It has been documented that some p.C282Y heterozygotes may exhibit mild to moderately raised indices of iron overload, although complications due to iron overload are very rare and may be influenced by additional factors, both genetic and environmental. The individual is a carrier of the p. Cys282Tyr variant in the HFE gene. Reports should state that the diagnosis of the most common HFE-related HH is excluded. In patients with a severe iron overload phenotype, other rare forms of HH cannot be excluded. Additional comments may refer to implications of the result for other adult first-degree family members, and genetic counseling may be considered. It is not considered appropriate to recommend predictive/carrier testing to all relatives (cascade family screening). Biochemical testing of first-degree adult family members may be considered.

Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual); homozygous p.H63D: It has been suggested that p.H63D homozygotes may have a slight risk of iron overload. Despite some geographical variation, this genotype is present in about 3% of the general European population, and its significance as a susceptibility factor remains uncertain. The individual is homozygous for the p. His63Asp variant in the HFE gene. Reports should state that the diagnosis of the most common HFE-related HH is excluded. This genotype may be associated with a slight increase of ferritin and TS. Other causes of iron overload should be considered.

### HFE genotypes in decompensated alcoholic liver disease: Phenotypic expression and comparison with heavy drinking and with normal controls [^1114p1ix]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

The predisposition to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) may have a partial genetic basis. Heterozygosity for the HFE mutations C282Y and/or H63D has been associated with more severe disease in several liver conditions. Notably, studies in ALD often fail to use controls matched for alcohol consumption, resulting in conflicting outcomes.

- **Methods**: HFE genotyping was performed in two Caucasian heavy-drinking cohorts, defined as consuming more than 60 units per week for males (M) or 40 units per week for females (F) over a period of more than 5 years. The cohorts included: (a) 254 patients with decompensated ALD, indicated by Child's grade B or C, and (b) 130 controls with similar alcohol consumption but without liver disease. The results in males were also compared with data from another study involving healthy male blood donors.

- **Results**:
	1. Genotype distributions for the C282Y and H63D mutations were similar among ALD patients, heavy-drinking controls, and healthy blood donors.
	2. ALD patients with and without HFE mutations exhibited similar disease severity, age at presentation, and alcohol consumption patterns.
	3. Increased serum ferritin levels and percent transferrin saturation were observed in 63% and 29% of ALD patients, respectively, irrespective of HFE genotype. The increased percent transferrin saturation resulted from a reduced unsaturated iron binding capacity rather than an increase in serum iron.
	4. Stainable liver iron was found in 52% of patients, with a greater grade observed in patients having two HFE mutations compared to those with one or none.
	5. Substantial iron overload was only noted in two C282Y homozygote patients.

- **Conclusions**: While serum iron abnormalities are commonly present, the frequencies of C282Y and H63D mutations were not elevated in heavy drinkers with decompensated liver disease.

### A systematic review of the clinical validity and clinical utility of DNA testing for hereditary haemochromatosis type 1 in at-risk populations [^113Codam]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2008). Low credibility.

To evaluate the clinical validity and clinical utility of DNA testing in people suspected of having hereditary haemochromatosis and in family members of those diagnosed with the disorder, a systematic review was conducted.

Fifteen electronic databases were searched up to April 2007. Studies assessing the clinical validity of genotyping for the C282Y mutation included those reporting the use of DNA tests in Caucasians of northern European origin with iron overload suggestive of haemochromatosis compared with a control population. These studies also needed to report or allow the calculation of sensitivity and specificity. Studies on clinical utility were included if they involved Caucasians with iron overload suggestive of haemochromatosis or relatives of suspected cases. Additionally, they had to compare diagnostic strategies incorporating DNA testing with those that did not and report patient-based outcomes or measures of cost-effectiveness.

Eleven studies evaluated the clinical validity of genotyping for the C282Y mutation in diagnosing hereditary haemochromatosis. Clinical sensitivity of C282Y homozygosity for hereditary haemochromatosis ranged from 28.4% to 100%; in studies using strict criteria to classify hereditary haemochromatosis, clinical sensitivity ranged from 91.3% to 92.4%. No studies on clinical effectiveness were found. Two cost-effectiveness studies were identified, both suggesting that gene testing may be cost-effective.

### Clinical penetrance in hereditary hemochromatosis: Estimates of the cumulative incidence of severe liver disease among HFE C282Y homozygotes [^111nqTiH]. Genetics in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Iron overload (hemochromatosis) can cause serious, symptomatic disease that is preventable if detected early and managed appropriately. The leading cause of hemochromatosis in populations of predominantly European ancestry is homozygosity of the C282Y variant in the HFE gene. Screening of adults for iron overload or associated genotypes is controversial, largely because of a belief that severe phenotypes are uncommon, although cascade testing of first-degree relatives of patients is widely endorsed.

We contend that severe liver disease (cirrhosis or hepatocellular cancer) is not at all uncommon among older males with hereditary hemochromatosis. Our review of the published data from a variety of empirical sources indicates that roughly 1 in 10 male HFE C282Y homozygotes is likely to develop severe liver disease during his lifetime unless iron overload is detected early and treated.

New evidence from a randomized controlled trial of treatment allows for evidence-based management of presymptomatic patients. Although population screening for HFE C282Y homozygosity faces multiple barriers, a potentially effective strategy for increasing the early detection and prevention of clinical iron overload and severe disease is to include HFE C282Y homozygosity in lists of medically actionable gene variants when reporting the results of genome or exome sequencing.

### Haematological effects of the C282Y HFE mutation in homozygous and heterozygous states among subjects of northern and southern European ancestry [^114tm77o]. British Journal of Haematology (2003). Low credibility.

High frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations of the HFE gene occur in European populations, even though homozygous and compound heterozygous states are associated with hereditary haemochromatosis, a disease that decreases fitness. This suggests that heterozygotes may possess a selective advantage. HFE mutations increase iron absorption in patients with haemochromatosis, and the mean transferrin saturations and ferritin levels are mildly increased in heterozygotes, suggesting that HFE mutations may protect against iron depletion and iron deficiency anaemia.

In this study of 23,681 Caucasian adults, mean transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, and haemoglobin levels were significantly higher in subjects carrying HFE mutations compared with wild types.

- **Analyzed by ethnicity**: Mean haemoglobin and mean erythrocyte volume (MCV) were significantly lower in those with a southern versus northern European ancestry. C282Y mutation carriers had an increased mean haemoglobin level in both ethnic groups.

- **Prevalence findings**: The prevalence of non-anaemic iron deficiency was significantly lower among female carriers of the C282Y mutation compared with HFE wild types. However, the prevalence of frank iron deficiency anaemia did not differ significantly among genotypes. Quantile-quantile plots showed a small but significant upward shift in the mid-range of the haemoglobin distribution among C282Y mutation carriers that was consistent with an increased mean haemoglobin level without significant changes in the anaemic range.

### Pathophysiological consequences and benefits of mutations: 20 years of research [^117VYyDd]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Mutations in the HFE (hemochromatosis) gene cause hereditary hemochromatosis, an iron overload disorder marked by excessive accumulation of iron in parenchymal organs. The HFE mutation p. Cys282Tyr is pathologically most relevant and occurs in the Caucasian population with a carrier frequency of up to 1 in 8 in specific European regions. Despite this high prevalence, the mutation causes a clinically relevant phenotype only in a minority of cases.

In this review, we summarize historical facts and recent research findings about hereditary hemochromatosis and outline the pathological consequences of the associated gene defects. In addition, we discuss potential advantages of HFE mutations in asymptomatic carriers.

### Estimated analytic validity of HFE C282Y mutation testing in population screening: The potential value of confirmatory testing [^116CMxS3]. Genetics in Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the analytic sensitivity and specificity of HFE testing for C282Y homozygosity in the hypothetical setting of population screening for hemochromatosis.

- **Methods**: We analyzed published results from the Molecular Genetics Survey conducted by the American College of Medical Genetics/College of American Pathologists between 1998 and 2002, taking into account its educational nature.

- **Results**: Analytic sensitivity for C282Y homozygosity is 98.4% (95% CI 95.9%-99.5%). The analytic specificity is 99.8% (99.4%-99.9%). At a frequency of 40 per 10,000 for the homozygous genotype, the analytic positive predictive value is 66%.

- **Conclusion**: HFE testing for C282Y homozygosity is highly reliable. However, homozygosity is uncommon in population screening, and confirmatory testing should be considered.

### Frequency of the S65C mutation of HFE and iron overload in 309 subjects heterozygous for C282Y [^115tp9vV]. Journal of Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

HFE-related haemochromatosis is a common disorder of iron metabolism. Most affected individuals are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of HFE. Some are compound heterozygotes for C282Y/H63D. A small proportion have neither of these genotypes. We have investigated the phenotype of compound heterozygotes for C282Y and another missense mutation, S65C.

- **Methods**: The genotype for the S65C mutation was determined in 309 subjects heterozygous for C282Y and negative for H63D, referred because of increased serum iron indices or family screening. A control sample comprising 315 individuals was also studied.

- **Results**: Twelve individuals were compound heterozygotes for C282Y and S65C. Seven, referred for family screening, had normal serum iron indices. Five subjects had elevated serum iron indices; three of these had elevated hepatic iron and have received treatment for iron overload. Transferrin saturation was significantly elevated in C282Y/S65C compound heterozygotes compared with simple C282Y heterozygotes.

- **Conclusions**: Some C282Y/S65C compound heterozygotes have elevated serum iron indices and iron overload. The penetrance of this genotype is low and other genetic and environmental factors may influence the expression of iron loading. Screening for S65C may be useful in individuals with iron overload who are not homozygous for C282Y or compound heterozygous for C282Y/H63D.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^111bH1QV]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual); heterozygous p.H63D. The individual is a carrier of the p. His63Asp variant in the HFE gene. This variant is present at a high frequency in the general population. The diagnosis of the most common HFE-related HH is excluded, and other causes of iron overload should be considered.

In patients with a severe iron overload phenotype, other rare forms of HH cannot be excluded. It is not appropriate to refer to implications of this genotype for other family members.

Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual); detection of the p.S65C variant. Given the absence of any clinical merit, testing for p.S65C is not recommended. If p.S65C is detected by the analysis method in use, this variant should not be reported. Therefore, report wording should treat such diagnostic cases as 'p.C282Y and p.H63D variants not detected'.
- **Diagnostic referral (i.e. affected individual); p.C282Y and p.H63D variants not detected**: Reports should state that the diagnosis of the most common HFE-related HH is excluded, and other causes of iron overload should be considered.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis [^112SQPtX]. Journal of Hepatology (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly concerning genetic testing, the EASL 2010 guidelines recommend considering the genetic testing of other hemochromatosis genes (TFR2, SLC40A1, HAMP, HJV) in patients with increased iron stores. This is suggested after the exclusion of C282Y homozygosity if iron excess has been confirmed through direct assessment, such as MRI or liver biopsy, and other hepatic and hematological disorders have been ruled out.

### Genetic modifiers of penetrance to liver endpoints in HFE hemochromatosis: Associations in a large community cohort [^117EKygT]. Hepatology (2022). Low credibility.

Preventative treatment such as phlebotomy is safe and effective; therefore, efforts to diagnose the high-risk p.C282Y homozygote group earlier are needed to reduce morbidity. In UKB, only 33% of male and 21% of female p.C282Y homozygotes were diagnosed with hemochromatosis by the end of available medical record data (mean age 69 and 70 years, respectively). A higher polygenic score for serum iron was associated with an increased likelihood of both excess morbidity and hemochromatosis diagnosis in p.C282Y homozygotes.

In study participants with other HFE variants (including p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes, p.C282Y heterozygotes, and p.H63D genotypes separately), the iron polygenic risk score was not associated with excess morbidity. This is consistent with the lack of statistical evidence for overall excess morbidity in these latter genotype groups; that is, genotypes other than p.C282Y homozygotes have no apparent clinical consequences, even in those with a higher iron polygenic score for the studied outcomes. Therefore, recent guidelines indicate that the diagnosis of hemochromatosis is not needed in the absence of additional factors.

Nevertheless, the iron polygenic score was associated with a diagnosis of hemochromatosis in non-p.C282Y homozygotes. This may be due to clinicians mistaking higher iron blood measures as necessitating a hemochromatosis diagnosis, although more work is needed to confirm this apparent misdiagnosis.

### HFE mutations, iron deficiency and overload in 10,500 blood donors [^112G8nnC]. British Journal of Haematology (2001). Low credibility.

People with genetic haemochromatosis (GH) accumulate iron from excessive dietary absorption. In populations of northern European origin, over 90% of patients are homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the HFE gene. While about 1 in 200 people in the general population have this genotype, the proportion who develop clinical haemochromatosis is not known. The influence of HFE genotype on iron status was investigated in 10,556 blood donors. The allele frequencies of the C282Y and H63D mutations were 8.23% and 15.3%, respectively. Heterozygosity for C282Y occurred in 1 in 7.9 donors, for H63D in 1 in 4.2 donors, and 1 in 42 were compound heterozygotes. Homozygosity for H63D occurred in 1 in 42 donors, and 1 in 147 (72) were homozygous for C282Y.

Mean values increased for transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin (sFn), and decreased for unsaturated iron binding capacity (UIBC) in the order: donors lacking the mutations, H63D heterozygotes, C282Y heterozygotes, H63D homozygotes, compound heterozygotes, and C282Y homozygotes; however, serum ferritin (sFn) concentrations were no higher in H63D heterozygotes and C282Y heterozygous women than in donors lacking mutations. The percentage of donors failing the screening test for anaemia or of those with sFn < 15 µg/l did not differ among the genotype groups.

C282Y and H63D heterozygotes and donors homozygous for H63D were at no greater risk of iron accumulation than donors lacking mutations, of whom 1 in 1200 had both a raised TS and sFn. The risk was higher for compound heterozygotes (1 in 80, P = 0.003) and for C282Y homozygotes.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1135rYa9]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

An agreed set of best practice guidelines has now been updated for diagnostic, predictive, and carrier testing for HFE-related HH and for reporting the results of such testing. In addition, some basic guidelines have been developed for testing and reporting rarer forms of non-HFE-related HH.

Consensus and consultation processes for this document occurred within the framework of a best practice meeting where, following prior dissemination of related literature, relevant topics were discussed by a group of experts. The resulting recommendations are based on the available published evidence, and the GRADE system for scoring the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations was applied. This process has been translated into guidance when reporting variants associated with iron overload disorders.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^114qBbCN]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

- **Diagnostic reporting scenarios**: The diagnostic referral scenario involves cases where the individual is homozygous for the p.C282Y variant in the HFE gene. Reports should state that, in the presence of a suggestive phenotype, this genotype supports the diagnosis of HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). A formal diagnosis requires demonstration of increased hepatic iron stores.

	- Additional comments may refer to implications of the result for other adult first-degree family members and recommend genetic counselling for predictive/carrier testing. It is not appropriate to simply state that all relatives must or should be tested. Genetic testing for p.C282Y and biochemical testing for iron overload is recommended in first-degree adult family members.

- **Compound heterozygous (p.C282Y/p.H63D) referral**: Patients with this genotype may experience iron overload, but typically to a much lesser degree than those with p.C282Y homozygous HH, often in association with other risk factors. Although compound heterozygotes might maintain elevated iron indices during middle age, documented iron overload-related disease is rare. This genotype should therefore be interpreted differently than a p.C282Y homozygote referred on the same basis. The genotype is common among the general European population, and a reference to the local estimated frequency may be given. The individual is a carrier of both the p. Cys282Tyr and p. His63Asp variants in the HFE gene.

	- Reports should state that the diagnosis of the most common HFE-related HH is excluded.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1112CU78]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Genetic testing of clinically asymptomatic adult first-degree relatives of individuals with rare forms of HFE- or non-HFE-related hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) aims to identify additional individuals at risk of these conditions and is therefore recommended.

- **Recommendations for diagnostic and predictive testing**:
	- Population screening for the p.C282Y variant is not currently recommended (1B).
	- It is considered good practice to confirm elevated transferrin saturation (TS) before conducting HFE genetic diagnostic testing (1B).
	- Testing adult siblings of p.C282Y homozygotes is recommended due to the increased risk of p.C282Y homozygosity and related morbidity (1B).
	- Testing adult offspring of p.C282Y homozygotes is advised owing to the increased risk of p.C282Y homozygosity and associated morbidity (1C).
	- Testing asymptomatic parents of p.C282Y homozygotes is not systematically recommended but should be a clinical decision based on age, sex, and ferritin levels — all of which influence the probability of severe iron overload (1C).
	- Systematic testing of adult first-degree relatives of p.C282Y heterozygotes is not currently recommended in the absence of evidence of benefit (2C).
	- HFE testing of minors is not recommended (1B).
	- Prenatal diagnosis is not appropriate in HFE-related HH because it is a treatable, adult-onset condition (1C).
	- Genetic testing of first-degree relatives for rare HFE-related and non-HFE-related HH should be performed by specialist reference centers or laboratories (2C).

### Hereditary hemochromatosis: Missed diagnosis or misdiagnosis [^113nXjcn]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a disorder that can cause iron overload and organ damage. It is characterized by mutations in the HFE gene. HFE C282Y homozygotes and compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) are at risk of developing manifestations of hemochromatosis. Abnormal iron study results also occur in many liver and hematologic diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis.

- **Methods**: Pertinent clinical and laboratory data, including HFE genotype, were tabulated from the electronic medical records of patients with the International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision code 275, "disorders of iron metabolism", who were seen at a tertiary referral center between January 2002 and May 2012.

- **Results**: HFE genotyping was obtained in only 373 of 601 patients (62%); 200 were C282Y homozygotes or compound heterozygotes. Of the 173 patients with nonhereditary hemochromatosis genotypes, 53% were misdiagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis and 38% underwent phlebotomy. In two thirds of these cases, the misdiagnosis was made by a nonspecialist. In the remaining 228 patients who were not genotyped, 80 were diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis and 64 were phlebotomized. Of patients misdiagnosed with hemochromatosis, 68% had known liver disease and 5% had a hematologic cause of abnormal iron study results.

- **Conclusions**: Abnormal iron study results in patients with nonhereditary hemochromatosis genotypes commonly lead to a misdiagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis and inappropriate treatment.

### Hereditary haemochromatosis: Only 1% of adult HFEC282Y homozygotes in South Wales have a clinical diagnosis of iron overload [^116s96RC]. Human Genetics (2002). Low credibility.

In northern Europe, about 90% of patients with hereditary haemochromatosis (HH) are homozygous for a single mutation (C282Y) of the HFE gene, and approximately 1 in 150 people in the general population carries this genotype. However, the clinical significance of HFE mutations remains uncertain, as does the proportion of people homozygous for C282Y who will develop clinical symptoms leading to a diagnosis of HH.

A systematic review of patients with HH over a 2-year period within a defined UK region has revealed that only 1.2% of adult C282Y homozygotes have been diagnosed with iron overload and received treatment. In those in whom body iron load could be estimated, only 51% had more than 4 g of iron — the diagnostic threshold for iron overload.

### Differential HFE allele expression in hemochromatosis heterozygotes [^116J24j1]. Gastroenterology (2000). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with C282Y homozygosity. Some heterozygotes may also present with abnormal iron parameters. However, the precise role of H63D and C282Y mutations in iron overload is poorly understood. We investigated the level of expression of the mutated and unmutated HFE alleles in these heterozygous patients.

- **Methods**: We studied the expression of HFE messenger RNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 34 heterozygotes using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by enzymatic digestion or sequence analysis of the PCR products, which allows relative quantification of mutated and unmutated transcripts. HFE proteins were quantified by Western blotting in Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized lymphocyte extracts from 2 C282Y and H63D homozygotes and a compound heterozygote.

- **Results**: (187C > G; H63D) mutated transcripts predominated in H63D and compound heterozygotes and the normal transcripts in C282Y heterozygotes. The amount of HFE protein was increased in the H63D homozygotes and the compound heterozygote compared with the C282Y homozygotes. In addition, we found a new mutation at codon 282 (C282S) associated with severe iron overload.

- **Conclusions**: We demonstrate the existence of differential allelic expression of the HFE alleles, suggesting that the (187C > G; H63D) mutation plays a role in the disease expression in H63D heterozygotes, in particular when associated with environmental or host factors.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^116hmY5q]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

In regards to the need to test for p.H63D for the diagnosis of HFE-related HH, opinions among respondents showed no consensus. Some respondents expressed serious doubts about the necessity of testing for p.H63D (16.7%), while others clearly stated there is no need for such testing (19.4%). The common arguments against testing include its lack of clinical relevance, its high frequency in the general population with uncertain implications, and the potential for unnecessarily increasing patient anxiety. However, the continued offering of this test is often due to pressure from clinicians requesting it.

A majority of laboratories (48.6%) still considered testing for p.H63D to be necessary and/or important. They highlighted the importance of delivering carefully worded reports and providing context, especially when p.C282Y is absent. The most consistent justification for p.H63D testing was the increased risk of iron overload in p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes. A minority also acknowledged a risk for p.H63D homozygotes. Some respondents emphasized the importance of providing lifestyle recommendations in these situations.

### The frequency and potential implications of HFE genetic variants in children with cystic fibrosis [^115viJw5]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Results**: The prevalence of HFE gene variants was found to be 31% in our cohort, with allele frequencies of 13.0% and 5.3% for H63D and C282Y, respectively. No significant differences were observed in the demographics and CF-related characteristics in patients with H63D or C282Y compared with children without these variants.

- **Lung disease indicators**: In the first six years of life, CFELD severity, the number of positive PA cultures, and pulmonary function parameters did not differ significantly among the three HFE variant groups. However, the C282Y group experienced significantly more PEx episodes compared with those in the "Neither" group, p = 0.025.

Six patients were discovered to have two potentially consequential HFE variants: three compound heterozygotes for C282Y and H63D and three H63D homozygotes. Iron studies revealed that serum iron levels were normal for the three H63D homozygotes but were elevated in all three cases with the C282Y/H63D genotype. In addition, Case 3 had elevated transferrin saturation at 48% (normal < 45%), confirming phenotypic expression. None of these patients were treated with iron supplements, which is the practice of some CF centers.

The parents of all patients except for Case 2 were given a letter and explanation to summarize their child's WGS results. Because the Case 2 C282Y/H63D patient was being followed at the nondisclosing center, an extensive process was…

### H63D mutation in the HFE gene increases iron overload in beta-thalassemia carriers [^115tDQ94]. Haematologica (2002). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism. The HFE gene implicated in this disorder has been identified on chromosome 6 (6p21.3). The most prevalent mutation in HH patients changes the 282 cysteine residue to tyrosine (C282Y). The role of a second mutation, which changes the 63 histidine to aspartic acid (H63D), in iron overload has been controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the H63D mutation on the ferritin levels of beta-thalassemia carriers.

- **Design and methods**: Beta-thalassemia carriers have a tendency to increase iron absorption because of mild anemia and slightly increased erythropoiesis. Differences in ferritin levels between homozygotes for H63D and wild type may indicate a modulator effect of the HFE mutation on iron absorption. We studied 152 healthy males, heterozygous for beta-thalassemia. Serum ferritin was measured by chemiluminescence. H63D genotypes were determined by digestion of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products with MboI restriction enzyme.

- **Results**: Forty-five subjects were H63D heterozygotes and four subjects were H63D homozygotes. Ferritin levels were (mean ± SD): 250 ± 138 microg/L in homozygotes for the wild type H/H; 295 ± 186 microg/L in H/D heterozygotes; and 389 ± 75 microg/L in homozygotes for the mutation D/D. The difference in ferritin values between H/H and D/D is statistically significant (p = 0.022).

- **Interpretation and conclusions**: Beta-thalassemia carriers who are homozygotes for the H63D mutation have higher ferritin levels.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^113oDkdH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The guidance for reporting predictive/carrier testing results is based on the assumption that the iron status of the individual is not known and that appropriate genetic counseling has been performed prior to testing. In cases where screening is performed with additional genetic and/or phenotypic data, reporting recommendations may be adapted to reflect individual case scenarios more closely.

- **Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected); homozygous p.C282Y**: The individual is homozygous for the p. Cys282Tyr variant in the HFE gene and is at an increased risk of developing HFE-related HH. It is recommended that serum iron parameters (TS and ferritin) be monitored. The report may refer to the implications of the result for other adult family members and suggest that genetic counseling be considered if not previously performed. Given the variable penetrance of p.C282Y homozygosity, it is not appropriate to state that the individual has or will develop HH if no evidence of phenotypic expression is given.

- **Predictive referral (i.e. individual currently unaffected); compound heterozygous p.C282Y/p.H63D**: The individual is a carrier of both the p. Cys282Tyr and p. His63Asp variants in the HFE gene and is at low risk of developing significant iron overload. He may be at risk of developing mild-to-moderate iron overload if there is an association with other comorbidity factors (e.g. alcohol abuse, fatty liver disease, and/or metabolic syndrome).

Additional comments may suggest monitoring of iron indices.

### Role of liver biopsy in the diagnosis of hepatic iron overload in the era of genetic testing [^11792Q1Y]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

We studied hepatic iron overload (HIOL) patterns in 32 patients who underwent liver biopsies and testing for HFE mutations (C282Y, H63D). Iron-stained biopsy specimens were examined for patterns of iron deposits classified as hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) pattern or non-HH pattern. The visual iron grade, based on the amount of cellular and lobular iron, was evaluated. We found the HH pattern in 17 biopsy specimens (53%) and the non-HH pattern in 6 specimens (19%). HH with superimposed non-HH was noted in 9 cases (28%). In 25 patients with HFE mutations, HH alone and combined with non-HH patterns were observed in 22 specimens (88%). The visual iron grade correlated approximately with the hepatic iron index.

Heavy HIOL was noted in C282Y homozygotes and also in one patient with cirrhosis without either HFE mutation. Mild steatohepatitis was found in 21 specimens (66%); it was associated with the non-HH pattern in 80% (12/15) and the HH pattern in 62% (16/26) of cases. Liver biopsy can identify the pattern and grade of HIOL and associated pathology, aiding in the diagnosis and management of patients with abnormal iron studies and elevated liver function test results. Genetic tests for HFE mutations and liver biopsies are complementary in the workup of these patients.

### Diagnosis and management of hemochromatosis: 2011 practice guideline by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^111dSU2D]. Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

When considering the evidence required to determine whether general population screening should be performed for the C282Y mutation, a key factor is the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity. Approximately 30% of C282Y homozygotes do not have phenotypic expression of excess iron stores in cross-sectional studies. Because of this, from a public policy perspective, general population screening for HH is not indicated.

In a large Norwegian study, 65,238 subjects were screened using TS, and when it was elevated on two determinations, cases were confirmed by genetic testing and/or liver biopsy. In 147 subjects, liver biopsies were performed and only four men and none of the women had cirrhosis (2.7% prevalence of cirrhosis). An Australian population study of 3,011 individuals revealed 16 C282Y homozygotes. Of these 16, liver biopsy was performed in 11 cases with serum ferritin > 300 μg/L, of whom three were identified with advanced fibrosis and one with cirrhosis who had associated ALD (6.3% prevalence of cirrhosis). Other prospective population studies have reached similar conclusions that the clinical penetrance of C282Y homozygosity is quite low. This discrepancy between the morbidity seen in referred patients and the lack of morbidity in screened patients is not unique to HH.

Economic models that have included genetic testing have suggested that population screening for HH would be effective if only 20% of patients developed life-threatening complications. The natural history of untreated HH has been illustrated in the Copenhagen Heart study.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1139DCj8]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The following provides basic guidelines for reporting HFE test results based on reasons for referral and resulting genotypes. Points regarded as essential are highlighted in italics. It should be stressed that these guidelines are presented under the assumption that HFE genotyping is performed to confirm, exclude, or predict the most common HFE-related forms of HH, and they do not cover rare or population-specific alternative variants in HFE.

Other forms of iron overload and other types of HH exist, and further investigation may be suggested where relevant clinical and biochemical features indicate. In those rare cases with a strongly suggestive phenotype that are not confirmed to be p.C282Y homozygous, investigation for other genetic forms of HH or referral to a specialist unit may be suggested. However, it must be stressed that these are rare and should only be considered in cases where there is a documented severe iron overload that remains unexplained after exclusion of other causes.

Reference to the implications of the HFE test result for other adult family members and recommendations for genetic counseling should be reserved only for individuals carrying the p.C282Y variant; otherwise, it may create unnecessary anxiety. In cases where screening is performed with additional genetic and/or phenotypic data, reporting recommendations may be adapted to reflect individual case scenarios more closely. A summary of basic interpretive comments relating to HFE-related HH is given in Table 2.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^112VoiMx]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

Controversy remains regarding the definition of HH associated with HFE variants other than p.C282Y, and no established consensus has been published before. The most frequently found HFE variant in all populations is p.H63D. This was originally described by Feder and co-workers as a common variant associated with iron overload in patients who were p.C282Y heterozygotes. It should be noted that the two variants are always inherited in trans (on separate alleles) because they arose as independent founder alleles. After this original report, it became common practice to classify individuals with the p.C282Y and p.H63D variants inherited in compound heterozygosity as an HH-associated genotype.

This practice, however, was later challenged by growing evidence that p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygous subjects have a distinct iron overload phenotype (mild to moderate) usually associated with other comorbidity factors, such as alcohol abuse or dysmetabolic iron overload syndrome. Therefore, notwithstanding a role of p.H63D as a susceptibility factor for increased iron overload, for practical clinical purposes, p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes and p.H63D homozygotes are not classified as HFE-associated HH following the most recent EASL guidelines. It is recommended that in patients with these genotypes and iron overload, other genetic or environmental risk factors should be examined.

Another variant, p.S65C, reported as a normal variant in the European population, has also been described as a susceptibility allele in patients with iron overload.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hereditary hemochromatosis, more specifically with respect to genetic testing, the EASL 2022 guidelines recommend considering genotyping for p.H63D in special clinical situations. Recognize that p.H63D, in combination with p.C282Y and usually other acquired risk factors, is associated with a higher risk of mild iron overload. Avoid obtaining genotyping for p.H63D to guide treatment.

### The frequency and potential implications of HFE genetic variants in children with cystic fibrosis [^112QiFS9]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2025). High credibility.

Although cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disorder due to variants in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, three decades of research have identified genetic modifiers that can influence the course of this disorder and potentially explain variations in the onset and course of the disease. Most studies have focused on adults with CF and studied the progression of lung disease. One such study in Australia concluded that the presence of a C282Y (c.845G > A) variant in the hemochromatosis gene, HFE, is associated with worse lung disease in adults. In addition, genetic modifiers of CF‐related diabetes have been reported.

In the study reported herein, we capitalized on the unique opportunity to investigate HFE variants in a well‐defined cohort of 104 children diagnosed early through newborn screening (NBS) and enrolled in a comprehensive longitudinal observational study. Applying whole genome sequencing (WGS) in this cohort recently allowed us to identify aggregated genetic modifiers of lung disease and vitamin D nutritional status. Because potential genetic modifiers aggregated with the polygenic risk score strategy correlated with the early onset and severity of lung disease in this cohort, extending the project to assess a putative modifier, C282Y, was an attractive next step. Here we report that our WGS data revealed that HFE variants are relatively common in children with CF, particularly C282Y and H63D (c.187C > G). In addition, we discovered that some patients have two pathogenic HFE variants, thus indicating a potential genetic risk factor.

### Common conditions associated with hereditary haemochromatosis genetic variants: cohort study in UK Biobank [^111jFR1S]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Overall, 64,444 participants were heterozygous for p.C282Y (irrespective of p.H63D status, 14.3%), of whom 29,526 were men (45.8% of 64,444). Mortality was not increased in p.C282Y heterozygotes (P > 0.05) compared with participants with no p.C282Y mutations. After excluding participants with prevalent haemochromatosis, the p.C282Y heterozygotes had an increased likelihood of a haemochromatosis diagnosis compared with no p.C282Y mutations (men: hazard ratio 5.77, 95% confidence interval 4.09 to 8.13, P < 0.001; women: 5.30, 3.20 to 8.78, P < 0.001). Among the study population, n = 383,909 (45.72%) participants had no p.C282Y mutations, of whom 175,539 were men.

After excluding 10,660 p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes, simple p.C282Y heterozygotes only were still more likely to have a diagnosis of incident haemochromatosis (3.42, 2.17 to 5.38, P < 0.001) compared with those with no p.C282Y or p.H63D mutations. We observed no excess morbidity (at least one diagnosis of incident haemochromatosis; any liver disease, including liver cancer; diabetes; osteoarthritis; or rheumatoid arthritis) in the p.C282Y heterozygous men (P = 0.78) and a nominally increased likelihood in the p.C282Y heterozygous women (1.08, 1.01 to 1.15, P = 0.023) compared with those with no p.C282Y mutations. After excluding 10,660 p.C282Y/p.H63D compound heterozygotes, p.C282Y heterozygous women no longer had an increased risk of incident excess morbidity (1.07, 0.99 to 1.15, P = 0.07) compared with women with no p.C282Y or p.H63D mutations.

### Common conditions associated with hereditary haemochromatosis genetic variants: cohort study in UK Biobank [^1153m3h1]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

Many smaller studies examined p.C282Y associations using varying methodology and with varying results, with overall clinical penetrance being low in the predominantly p.C282Y heterozygotes studied. We also found a low incidence of haemochromatosis-associated diagnoses with p.C282Y heterozygote status alone (compared with no p.C282Y mutations, excluding p.C282Y homozygotes).

- **Association with genotype and morbidity**: We did find one modest association between the compound heterozygous p.C282Y/p.H63D genotype and excess incident morbidity in men aged 40 to 49. More work is needed to establish whether this association replicates in other populations and whether interacting factors increase the risk of disease in this and the other genotypes.

- **Mortality and hereditary haemochromatosis**: Our results included a nominally significant association with mortality in the combined male and female p.C282Y homozygote group, although this was based on only 107 deaths. Previous studies have reported increased mortality in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis and liver disease, but not otherwise. Liver cancer was recorded on the death certificates of 14 of the 107 p.C282Y homozygous decedents in our study.

- **Incident diagnoses and sensitivity analysis**: In analyses of specific incident diagnoses, we have accounted for this differential mortality using competing risks analyses in a sensitivity analysis. This made little difference to the results, likely because of the relatively small numbers of deaths.

### Genetic modifiers of penetrance to liver endpoints in HFE hemochromatosis: Associations in a large community cohort [^111cmUD5]. Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a genetic condition associated with iron overload. In European ancestry groups, it is predominantly caused by the missense mutation p.C282Y in the Homeostatic Iron Regulator (HFE) gene, with a homozygote mutation in over 95% of cases. Some additional diagnoses occur in p.H63D homozygotes. The p.C282Y mutation leads to reduced plasma hepcidin levels, raised ferritin and transferrin (TF) saturation levels, and a gradual accumulation of systemic iron in adults. Clinical presentations of the condition include fatigue, arthropathy (osteoarthritis is a common and sometimes severe symptom), diabetes, liver disease, and hormone dysregulation. The disease can progress to liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and cardiomyopathy.

However, penetrance to clinical symptoms or disease is limited. In the UK Biobank (UKB) study — the largest community study thus far of HFE p.C282Y homozygotes (n = 2890) — only 25.3% of p.C282Y homozygous male participants and 12.5% of homozygous female participants were diagnosed with hemochromatosis by the age of 65 years. These estimates are similar to a 2015 study across seven American medical systems (eMERGE: n = 106 homozygotes) which reported that 24.4% of male and 14.0% of female p.C282Y homozygotes were diagnosed with hemochromatosis (mean age 66.4 ± 15.8 years). Kaplan-Meier survival curves suggest 50% of the homozygote men and 25% of homozygote women were eventually diagnosed with hemochromatosis by the age of 90 years.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^116uCQke]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

The EMQN external quality assessment (EQA) scheme for HFE continues to detect both genotyping errors and variable quality of interpretive comments. This indicates the continued importance of quality assurance and improvement. It is recommended that testing laboratories are accredited to international standards (ISO 15189 or equivalent). The techniques used should be validated in-house with appropriate sample types and numbers. If CE-marked IVD kits are used, in-house verification should be performed. Laboratories reporting HFE testing results should participate annually in EQA. EQA provides a long-term, retrospective assessment of laboratory performance, allowing laboratories to demonstrate consensus with their peers and providing information on inter-method comparability. Unless dictated by legislation, the choice of EQA provider lies with the laboratory, but the use of an EQA program that assesses reporting, as well as genotyping and that is accredited to ISO 17043, is recommended wherever possible.

- **Recommendations for HFE testing strategies**: Laboratories providing testing for HFE-associated HH should test for p.C282Y (1A). According to local practice, p.H63D can be considered an optional complementary test that can be offered sequentially or simultaneously to p.C282Y testing (2C). Testing for p.S65C should not be offered; if detected as an incidental finding, it should not be reported (1B). It is recommended that testing laboratories are accredited according to international standards (ISO 15189 or equivalent).
