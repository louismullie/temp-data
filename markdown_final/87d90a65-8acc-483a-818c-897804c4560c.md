## Question

What is the recommended daily dose of vitamin D for infants?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended daily vitamin D dose for infants, including when to start, how long to continue, special populations, and safety considerations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the universal recommendation for healthy term infants. Then, I should verify the timing of initiation and duration. Next, I will examine dosing for breastfed versus formula-fed infants and mixed feeding scenarios. After that, I need to check special populations such as preterm infants, dark-skinned infants, and those at higher latitudes. I will then review safety, tolerable upper intake levels, and monitoring. Finally, I should consider alternatives like maternal supplementation and reconcile any conflicting evidence before concluding with a concise, practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the universal recommendation for healthy term infants. Multiple authoritative sources converge on 400 IU per day for infants during the first 12 months of life, regardless of feeding method, to prevent rickets and support bone health [^112J3i75] [^114tq9d1] [^112Ba1aG] [^112Ba1aG] [^1154bAPH].

> Wait, let me verify the timing and duration. I initially thought supplementation should begin at 2 months, but hold on, that reflects older guidance; current recommendations are to start within the first few days of life and continue through 12 months, with some sources extending to 24 months depending on diet and risk, which aligns with contemporary AAP and CDC guidance [^114tq9d1] [^112J3i75] [^116HpD44].

> I need to check the breastfed versus formula-fed nuance. For exclusively or partially breastfed infants, 400 IU/day is recommended because human milk typically contains insufficient vitamin D; for formula-fed infants, supplementation is generally unnecessary if they consume at least about 1 liter per day of standard formula, since formulas are fortified to approximately 400 IU/L, though some guidance uses a practical threshold of 32 oz/day and notes that many infants still do not meet intake without a supplement early on, so shared decision-making is reasonable [^112J3i75] [^1154bAPH] [^114MpSBQ] [^117JZinL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about higher doses being better. I should review special populations and risk-based adjustments. Dark-skinned infants, those living at higher latitudes, and infants with limited sun exposure may require higher amounts, with some pediatric sources suggesting up to 800 IU/day in select high-risk contexts; preterm infants are a distinct group where 400–800 IU/day is reasonable once enteral feeds are established, ideally with clinical oversight and periodic monitoring if higher doses are used [^115p3Vhx] [^115p3Vhx] [^116XiikS] [^117SNB7x].

> Next, I should review safety and tolerable upper intake levels. The tolerable upper intake level for infants 0–6 months is 1,000 IU/day and for 6–12 months is 1,500 IU/day; while high-dose pediatric trials up to 10,000 IU/day or bolus regimens did not show increased serious adverse events, these were research settings and not a basis for routine practice; I need to ensure we avoid chronic dosing above the UL without medical supervision due to risks of hypercalcemia and hypervitaminosis D [^117LzzKb] [^111yb3vp] [^116FXc4s].

> Let me consider whether higher daily doses improve bone outcomes. A large randomized trial comparing 1,200 IU vs 400 IU found no improvement in bone strength or infection incidence, supporting 400 IU as adequate for most healthy infants; similarly, a prespecified analysis in infants with low baseline 25(OH)D showed no bone advantage of 1,000 IU over 400 IU, reinforcing that 400 IU achieves clinically meaningful bone protection without excess [^116XwrDw] [^113FNzNV] [^115mWR4h].

> But wait, what if the goal is to achieve higher 25(OH)D thresholds like 75 nmol/L rather than just prevent rickets. Dose–response studies show that 800–1,600 IU/day can raise more infants above 75 nmol/L, yet 1,600 IU/day was stopped early for elevated 25(OH)D, and routine use above 400 IU/day is not recommended for otherwise healthy term infants absent specific risk factors or a therapeutic indication [^112UJCGK] [^112Q3DX5].

> I should double-check alternatives when families prefer not to give infant drops. High-dose maternal supplementation during lactation can safely transfer vitamin D via breast milk; randomized data suggest maternal 4,000–6,400 IU/day can maintain infant 25(OH)D in the normal range, though protocols vary and shared decision-making is essential, with attention to maternal safety and adherence [^113prH21] [^116LwT71].

> Let me reconsider the overall synthesis to ensure internal consistency. The weight of evidence supports a universal recommendation of 400 IU/day for all infants beginning within the first few days of life and continued through 12 months, with extension based on diet and risk; higher daily doses may be considered for defined high-risk groups with clinician oversight, and routine dosing above 1,000 IU/day should be avoided outside of specific therapeutic contexts [^112J3i75] [^114tq9d1] [^116HpD44] [^117LzzKb].

> Final recommendation: All healthy term infants should receive 400 IU of vitamin D3 daily, starting within the first few days of life and continued through 12 months; breastfed infants generally require supplementation, whereas formula-fed infants typically do not if they consume at least about 1 liter per day of fortified formula, though many families will still need supplementation early on; preterm infants, dark-skinned infants, those at higher latitudes, or with limited sun exposure may merit 400–800 IU/day with clinical judgment and, if higher dosing is used chronically, periodic monitoring of 25(OH)D and calcium; avoid routine dosing above 1,000 IU/day without medical supervision [^112J3i75] [^114tq9d1] [^111F4Qpj] [^115h9qy4] [^116XiikS] [^117LzzKb].

---

The recommended daily dose of vitamin D for infants is **400 IU (10 mcg) per day** [^112J3i75] for all infants, starting within the first few days of life and continuing through 12 months [^111F4Qpj]. This applies to breastfed infants and to formula-fed infants who consume less than 1,000 mL/day of vitamin D–fortified formula [^116HpD44]. Higher doses (up to 800 IU/day) may be needed for **preterm infants** [^117SNB7x] or those with specific risk factors, but routine higher dosing is not recommended without medical supervision [^117LzzKb]. Supplementation should continue until the infant is consuming at least 1,000 mL/day of fortified formula or begins solid foods that provide adequate vitamin D [^116HpD44].

## Recommended daily dose of vitamin D for infants

- **Standard recommendation**: 400 IU (10 mcg) per day for all infants from birth to 12 months [^114m7n7G] [^114tq9d1].

- **Timing**: Start supplementation within the first few days of life [^114BT4XW].

- **Duration**: Continue through 12 months of age [^112J3i75].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dose

Evidence shows that **400 IU/day effectively prevents rickets** [^114tq9d1] and maintains serum 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) in most infants [^112UJCGK]. Randomized trials indicate that higher doses (800–1,600 IU/day) do not improve bone outcomes [^116XwrDw] and may increase hypercalcemia risk [^112UJCGK], so they are not routinely recommended [^11132i57].

---

## Special considerations and exceptions

### Preterm infants

For preterm infants, **higher doses (400–800 IU/day)** may be needed to achieve sufficiency [^117SNB7x], but monitor for toxicity with high doses [^115MBUkh].

---

### Infants with specific risk factors

Infants with **dark skin pigmentation**, limited sun exposure, or maternal deficiency may require higher doses (up to 800 IU/day) [^115h9qy4] [^115p3Vhx], with monitoring of serum 25(OH)D and calcium if higher doses are used [^115p3Vhx].

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

- **Safety**: 400 IU/day is safe and well tolerated [^111yb3vp].

- **Upper limit**: 1,000 IU/day for infants 0–6 months; 1,500 IU/day for 6–12 months [^117LzzKb].

- **Risks**: Excess intake can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and renal damage [^115MBUkh].

---

## Comparison with previous guidelines

Historically, the **2003 AAP guideline** recommended 200 IU/day [^1161ESJ2]; this was increased to 400 IU/day in 2008 [^114tq9d1] based on new evidence showing better prevention of rickets and maintenance of sufficiency [^114tq9d1].

---

## Practical recommendations for parents and caregivers

- **Formulation**: Use liquid vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) drops [^113prH21].

- **Administration**: Give drops directly or mix with breast milk or formula.

- **Adherence**: Ensure daily dosing; missed doses can lead to deficiency [^113xVWyx].

- **Formula-fed infants**: Supplement if intake is < 1,000 mL/day of fortified formula [^115x6c42].

---

## Conclusion

All infants should receive **400 IU/day of vitamin D** [^112J3i75] from birth through 12 months, with higher doses reserved for specific risk factors and under medical supervision. This dose prevents rickets, maintains sufficiency, and is safe when adhered to [^11132i57].

### Vitamin D prophylaxis in infancy [^111F4Qpj]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

We looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in infancy for reducing vitamin D deficiency and for preventing rickets and infections. We also looked at optimal dose of vitamin D and the age until which vitamin D supplementation is beneficial. We conducted a literature search up to the 17th of July 2019 by using key terms and manual search in selected sources. We summarized the recommendations and the strength of the recommendation when and as reported by the authors. We summarized the main findings of systematic reviews with the certainty of the evidence as reported. A daily dose of 400 international units of vitamin D in infants has shown to be effective for improving bone health and preventing rickets. Evidence is more robust in groups of infants and children at risk. Vitamin D supplementation is well tolerated, and not associated with toxicity. Higher doses have not shown to add benefit while it could potentially cause toxic blood levels and hypercalcemia. Adequate levels of vitamin D might not be achieved with lower daily doses. Universal vitamin D supplementation starting shortly after birth, regardless of the mode of feeding and until 12months of age, is strongly recommended. Beyond 12months of age vitamin D supplementation is recommended only in groups of children at risk.

### Prevention of rickets and vitamin D deficiency in infants, children, and adolescents [^114tq9d1]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Rickets in infants attributable to inadequate vitamin D intake and decreased exposure to sunlight continues to be reported in the United States. There are also concerns for vitamin D deficiency in older children and adolescents. Because there are limited natural dietary sources of vitamin D and adequate sunshine exposure for the cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D is not easily determined for a given individual and may increase the risk of skin cancer, the recommendations to ensure adequate vitamin D status have been revised to include all infants, including those who are exclusively breastfed and older children and adolescents. It is now recommended that all infants and children, including adolescents, have a minimum daily intake of 400 IU of vitamin D beginning soon after birth. The current recommendation replaces the previous recommendation of a minimum daily intake of 200 IU/day of vitamin D supplementation beginning in the first 2 months after birth and continuing through adolescence. These revised guidelines for vitamin D intake for healthy infants, children, and adolescents are based on evidence from new clinical trials and the historical precedence of safely giving 400 IU of vitamin D per day in the pediatric and adolescent population. New evidence supports a potential role for vitamin D in maintaining innate immunity and preventing diseases such as diabetes and cancer. The new data may eventually refine what constitutes vitamin D sufficiency or deficiency.

### Issues in establishing vitamin D recommendations for infants and children [^1172NbZk]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

In 1963, the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition recommended 400 IU of vitamin D per day for all infants and children. After the late 1970s, this became an inconsistent recommendation, particularly for breast-feeding infants. In 2003, however, the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended 200 IU/d vitamin D for all infants and children. This was in response to the vitamin D adequate intake recommendations made by the Institute of Medicine in 1997, the increasing number of reports of nutritional rickets in certain populations of American infants, and the Healthy People 2010 goal of having 75% of infants breast-fed for the first 6 mo of life. In making these recommendations, many issues were taken into consideration, including the following. 1) Vitamin D deficiency is more than rickets, which is the final stage of the deficient state among growing children. 2) Adequate sunlight exposure cannot be determined exactly for every subject. 3) There is new awareness of the hazards of ultraviolet-B light exposure in childhood and the subsequent development of skin cancer in adulthood. 4) There is decreasing intake of vitamin D-fortified foods among older children and adolescents. More research is needed in the pediatric population to determine the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin D. A new definition of vitamin D deficiency that would make use of normal serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in a given population is needed. The recommended intake of 200 IU/d may not be enough. More data are needed to support the adequacy of the present and possibly even higher recommended vitamin D daily intakes.

### VItamin D supplementation in infants, children, and adolescents [^116KhP8m]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children can have adverse health consequences, such as growth failure and rickets. In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics increased its recommended daily intake of vitamin D in infants, children, and adolescents to 400 IU. Infants who are breastfed and children and adolescents who consume less than 1 L of vitamin D-fortified milk per day will likely need supplementation to reach 400 IU of vitamin D per day. This recommendation is based on expert opinion and recent clinical trials measuring biomarkers of vitamin D status. It is also based on the precedent of preventing and treating rickets with 400 IU of vitamin D. In addition to dietary sources, exposure to ultraviolet B sunlight provides children and adults with additional vitamin D. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends keeping infants out of direct sunlight, decreased sunlight exposure may increase children's risk of vitamin D deficiency. No randomized controlled trials assessing patient-oriented outcomes have been performed on universal vitamin D supplementation. However, vitamin D may reduce the risk of certain infections and chronic diseases. Physicians should help parents choose the appropriate vitamin D supplement for their child.

### Safety of high-dose vitamin D supplementation among children aged 0 to 6 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116FXc4s]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is high-dose vitamin D supplementation safe for children aged 0 to 6 years?

Findings

In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials including 8400 unique children, high-dose vitamin D administered as a daily or bolus supplement was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events. Clinical adverse events associated with the supplementation were rare.

Meaning

This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that vitamin D supplements in daily doses to 10 000 IU/d or bolus doses to 600 000 IU are well tolerated in children aged 0 to 6 years.

### Vitamin D prophylaxis in infancy [^11132i57]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Summary of findings

All infants should receive vitamin D for improving bone health and preventing rickets, starting shortly after birth, regardless of the mode of feeding. Evidence is more robust to support this recommendation in groups of infants and children at risk.
There is probably no benefit of universal vitamin D supplementation in infants on the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia or diarrhoea.
A daily dose of 400 international units of vitamin D in infants has shown to be effective for preventing rickets. It is well tolerated, and not associated with toxicity. Higher doses have not shown to add benefit while it could potentially cause toxic blood levels and hypercalcemia. Adequate levels of vitamin D might not be achieved with lower daily doses.
Universal vitamin D supplementation until 12 months of age is strongly recommended. Beyond 12 months of age vitamin D supplementation is recommended only in groups of children at risk. There is however a lack of evidence supporting this cut off of 12 months, so this age cut off seems arbitrary.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^115h9qy4]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Higher-risk groups and higher dosing: Premature infants, dark-skinned infants and children, and children who reside at higher latitudes (particularly above 40°) may require larger amounts of vitamin D supplementation, and consideration should be given to supplementing with up to 800 IU of vitamin D per day; a high index of suspicion for vitamin D deficiency should be maintained for these infants and children.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^115p3Vhx]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — use of supplements states "we recommend that all breastfed infants, and nonbreastfed infants and children who do not ingest at least 1 L of vitamin D–fortified milk per day, receive 400 IU vitamin D per day as a supplement", and notes that "supplementation with 400 IU/day is necessary for all breastfed infants" and should "begin within days of birth". For higher-risk groups, "Dark-skinned infants who are exclusively breastfed should receive at least 400 IU/day of vitamin D", "Preterm infants should be supplemented from birth with 400 to 800 IU/day", and the Canadian Paediatric Society "suggests supplementation with 800 IU/day for breastfed infants during the winter months"; those receiving higher doses "should be monitored at least yearly for 25(OH)-D levels". The review notes that "400 IU of vitamin D is sufficient to prevent rickets and maintain levels of > 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL)", while in adults "the recommended daily intake of vitamin D should be close to 1000 IU", pending pediatric data. Maternal high-dose options include "administration of high doses of vitamin D (4000–6400 IU daily) to breastfeeding mothers" which can raise infant 25(OH)-D without maternal hypervitaminosis D, and "High-dose vitamin D supplementation in nursing mothers… is another possible strategy for improving the vitamin D status of purely breastfeeding infants".

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111mfiHt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (daily requirements), ES 2011 guidelines recommend to ensure vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day in 0–1 year old infants and children, and at least 600 IU/day in ≥ 1 year old children, to maximize bone health. Insufficient evidence of whether 400 and 600 IU/day in 0–1 and 1–18 years old children, respectively, are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D to maximize bone health and muscle function. Recognize that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Hypercalcemia in children receiving pharmacologic doses of vitamin D [^117EQPRq]. Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, requiring vitamin D at doses greater than daily dietary intake. Several treatment regimens are found in the literature, with wide dosing ranges, inconsistent monitoring schedules, and lack of age-specific guidelines. We describe 3 children, ages 2 weeks to 2 and 9/12 years, who recently presented to our institution with hypercalcemia and hypervitaminosis D (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels > 75 ng/mL), associated with treatment of documented or suspected vitamin D-deficient rickets. The doses of vitamin D used were within accepted guidelines and believed to be safe. The patients required between 6 weeks and 6 months to correct the elevated serum calcium, with time to resolution of hypercalcemia related to age and peak serum calcium, but not to peak 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. With recent widespread use of vitamin D in larger dosages in the general population, we provide evidence that care must be taken when using pharmacologic dosing in small children. With limited dosing guidelines available on a per weight basis, the administration of dosages to infants that are often used in older children and adults has toxic potential, requiring a cautious approach in dose selection and careful follow-up. Dosage recommendations may need to be reassessed, in particular, where follow-up and monitoring may be compromised.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^112JLweK]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Generally, there is a lack of consensus about the recommended vitamin D supplementation regimen (doses, administration schedule, treatment duration, etc). Such heterogeneity can be explained, at least partly, by the scarcity of comparative pharmacokinetics studies for different dosing schedules. Moreover, different underlying conditions (eg, obesity) might reduce the effect of vitamin D supplementation. Growing evidence suggests that the treatment schedule itself (ie, bolus vs frequent administration) may differently affect the effectiveness of the treatment and also clinical outcomes, with recent studies and a few meta-analyses showing more promising results with frequent administration schedules on skeletal and extraskeletal outcomes.

In this perspective, vitamin D supplementation guidelines should be specific for age group, body weight, ethnicity (skin type), and latitude of residence. For example, differences in serum 25(OH)D by BMI and absolute body weight have been reported. Vitamin D dose per kilogram of body weight per day could explain a 34.5% variation in circulating 25(OH)D in multivariable regression analyses of data pooled from several studies, leading to pronounced differences across BMI categories. Obese and overweight individuals tend to have serum 25(OH)D levels that are, on average, around 20 nmol/L lower and 8 nmol/L lower than those of normal-weight individuals, requiring 2.6 and 1.47 times higher supplementation, respectively. This is somewhat consistent with ES guidelines suggesting that the vitamin D dosage for obese people is "three times" greater than the recommended dose for individuals with normal body weight.

Another example of targeted, specific vitamin D dosing, of course, is in the pediatric setting. Infants and children have different upper tolerance limits compared to adults. To maintain a desirable 25(OH)D concentration, the 2010 IOM guidelines recommend 600 IU/d (15 μg) for children, adolescents, and adults, and 400 IU/d (10 μg) for infants. ES guidelines recommend 400 to 1000 IU/day (10–25 μg) for infants aged up to 1 year and 600 to 1000 IU/day (15–25 μg) for children older than 1 year to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency. These values are consistent with several guidelines issued by other societies in the past several years. Of course, they can be increased if a laboratory-confirmed vitamin D deficiency is being treated.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^116p9JkA]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Pediatric vitamin D deficiency — replacement dosing and high‑dose (stoss) options are described as follows. Vitamin D given in daily doses of 25 to 250 µg (1000–10 000 IU) can be used for a 2- to 3-month period. Our recommendation is to use doses of 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for infants 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old. With therapy, radiologic evidence of healing is observed in 2 to 4 weeks, after which the dose of vitamin D can be reduced to 400 IU/day. An option after the first month of life is a single administration of high doses (100 000–600 000 IU over 1–5 days), which may need to be intermittently repeated (usually every 3 months). As examples of stoss schedules, 100 000 IU of vitamin D every 2 hours over a 12-hour period has been reported, and in teenagers and adults, 50 000 IU of vitamin D has been administered orally once per week for 8 weeks.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1145ZUz5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment dosing for deficiency or insufficiency: We recommend treating infants and children who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient with 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for children 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old; vitamin D levels should subsequently be maintained with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. For patients who demonstrate poor compliance, a high dose of vitamin D may be given as a single dose or repeated intermittently. It is important to recognize that simultaneous calcium supplementation is necessary, symptomatic hypocalcemia requires parenteral calcium replacement, and calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol can help treat hypocalcemia associated with rickets but do not build up vitamin D stores.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^1143e3eh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements, more specifically with respect to neonatal and pediatric patients, vitamin D, ES 2011 guidelines recommend to ensure vitamin D intake of at least 400 IU/day in 0–1 year old infants and children, and at least 600 IU/day in ≥ 1 year old children, to maximize bone health. Insufficient evidence of whether 400 and 600 IU/day in 0–1 and 1–18 years old children, respectively, are enough to provide all the potential nonskeletal health benefits associated with vitamin D to maximize bone health and muscle function. Recognize that at least 1,000 IU/day of vitamin D may be required to raise the serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D consistently > 30 ng/mL.

### Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117LzzKb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for vitamin D deficiency, more specifically with respect to pediatric patients (daily requirements), ES 2011 guidelines recommend to consider keeping the maintenance tolerable upper limits of vitamin D (not exceeding without medical supervision) at 1,000 IU/day in infants up to 6 months, 1,500 IU/day in infants from 6 months to 1 year, at least 2500 IU/day in 1–3 years old children, 3,000 IU/day in 4–8 years old children, and 4,000 IU/day in > 8 years old children. Recognize that higher levels of 2,000 IU/day in 0–1 year old children, 4,000 IU/day in 1–18 years old children, and 10,000 IU/day may be required to correct vitamin D deficiency.

### Vitamin D supplementation of breastfed infants: a randomized dose-response trial [^113xMZMg]. Pediatric Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Breastfed infants require supplementation with vitamin D (vD), but little is known about the necessary dose. This double blind trial evaluated four different doses of vD.

Methods

Exclusively breastfed infants (N = 213) were randomized at 1 mo to one of four doses, which they received through 9 mo while receiving no formula. The supplements provided daily 200 IU, 400 IU, 600 IU, or 800 IU of vD. The primary endpoint was plasma 25(OH)D level, and secondary outcomes were plasma parathyroid hormone and calcium, and illness incidence. The study was conducted during winter at 41° N.

Results

Most infants had low (< 50 nmol/l) 25(OH)D levels at 1 mo, but with supplementation levels rose. Overall, levels of 25(OH)D differed significantly in proportion to vD dose. There were no effects of vD on illness incidence or growth. Low levels were common, with 7.8% of levels being < 50 nmol/l and 15 infants having 2 to 4 low levels.

Conclusion

The four doses of vD produced different plasma levels of 25(OH)D. The higher doses were somewhat more efficacious in maintaining vD sufficiency in breastfed infants. The findings support the recommended dose of 400 IU/d, and stress the need to start supplementation at birth.

### Prevention of rickets and vitamin D deficiency: new guidelines for vitamin D intake [^1161ESJ2]. Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Rickets in infants attributable to inadequate vitamin D intake and decreased exposure to sunlight continues to be reported in the United States. It is recommended that all infants, including those who are exclusively breastfed, have a minimum intake of 200 IU of vitamin D per day beginning during the first 2 months of life. In addition, it is recommended that an intake of 200 IU of vitamin D per day be continued throughout childhood and adolescence, because adequate sunlight exposure is not easily determined for a given individual. These new vitamin D intake guidelines for healthy infants and children are based on the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences.

### Comparative analysis of nutritional guidelines for vitamin D [^114m7n7G]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is essential for calcium and bone homeostasis. Humans are largely dependent on UVB-radiation-induced photosynthesis of vitamin D, as few foods contain vitamin D. However, the same radiation that produces vitamin D is also carcinogenic, albeit with a long lag time, and causes DNA damage. In view of the increasing life expectancy, avoiding excessive sun exposure is prudent. Several groups of people have a shortfall between their requirements for vitamin D and their combined endogenous synthesis and intake from natural foods, and therefore need vitamin D supplementation. Governments and scientific societies are regularly updating their recommendations for intake of vitamin D, especially for groups that should (infants) or prefer to (especially elderly individuals) avoid direct sunlight. An overview of such guidelines is presented in this Review. A fairly large consensus exists that all infants should receive 400 international units (IU) (10 μg) daily during their first year of life and that elderly individuals should have access to vitamin D supplementation (at recommended dosages varying from 400 IU to 800 IU daily in most governmental guidelines but at higher dosages in other guidelines). All guidelines unanimously agree that serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) < 25 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) should be avoided at all ages. Children and adults who have limited sun exposure should receive vitamin D supplementation, but the recommended doses vary widely (from 200 IU to 2,000 IU daily), in line with disagreement regarding the minimal desirable serum concentration of 25OHD (which varies from 25 nmol/l to > 100 nmol/l).

Vitamin D supplementation for preventing infections

The Yakoob 2016 Cochrane review looked at the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation versus placebo or no intervention in children under 5 years of age for preventing infections from RCTs. There was probably no benefit of vitamin D supplementation on the incidence of radiologically confirmed pneumonia (RR 1.06 [95%CI 0.89 to 1.26]; two trials, 3134 participants; moderate certainty evidence) or diarrhoea (no effect, however meta-analysis was not possible for this outcome; two trials, 3134 participants). From one trial (3046 participants), vitamin D supplementation may not have effect on all-cause mortality (RR 1.43 (95%CI 0.54 to 3.74); low certainty evidence) or on cause-specific mortality (RR 1.50 [95%CI 0.42 to 5.30]; low certainty evidence).

Different dosages of vitamin D supplementation for preventing rickets

Three studies identified by Munns et al. compared the effect of different dosages of vitamin D supplementation. In their consensus statement, the expert panel added that "Among infants and toddlers with 25OHD levels < 50 nmol/L for whom daily vitamin D supplementation may not be ideal, intermittent bolus doses of 50 to 100 000 IU every 3 months hold promise, although a comprehensive understanding of the safety and efficacy of this approach remains to be studied". The Mimouni 2017 review identified 11 manuscripts from nine RCTs looking at the effect of different doses of vitamin D supplementation in healthy infants, including one of the three studies identified by Munns et al. Authors concluded that "there is no additional evidence that larger, more generous amounts of daily vitamin D beyond the recommended 400 IU daily dose, affects any long-term significant outcome. It even appears that larger amount may lead to serum 25(OH) D concentrations that have been reported to be potentially associated with adverse effects". The basic characteristics and main findings of the 13 studies identified by these two reviews are summarized in Table 4.

Characteristics and main findings of studies looking at different doses of vitamin D supplementation

Duration of administration of vitamin D supplementation

While most of the sources recommend vitamin D supplementation in all infants for the first 12 months of age, there is a lack of strong evidence supporting this duration of administration of 12 months. Assessment of risk factors including the overall vitamin D intake through milk and foods containing vitamin D and sun exposure seem key factors leading to the established recommendations.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^112Q3DX5]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Many studies investigated dosing regimens in pediatric patients. One trial comparing 4 different daily dosages (400, 800, 1200, 1600 IU) found that all dosages established 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/L or greater in 97% to 98% of infants at age 3 and 12 months, but only a dosage of 1600 IU/d 25(OH)D levels to 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at age 3 months; nonetheless, this study was discontinued prematurely because of elevated plasma 25(OH)D concentrations that have been associated with hypercalcemia. Another study also found that 1600 IU/day given for 10 weeks to infants from 2 weeks to 3 months of age maintained a 25(OH)D concentration above 80 nmol/L, but without causing hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mass in infants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol / L: a prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^113FNzNV]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

In the absence of robust trials investigating the effect of a dose of vitamin D supplementation higher than the standard of care (400 IU per day) on bone mineral accretion and density in infants born with 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L, this prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial provides information to help guide recommendations for vitamin D supplementation in this understudied population. Infants at elevated risk of insufficient vitamin D status provided with a daily supplement of 400 IU (compared with 1000 IU per day) did not have compromised bone outcomes (WB BMC, LS BMC, or LS BMD) across infancy. This is in line with findings from a study by Ziegler et al, in which doses of vitamin D supplementation ranging from 200 to 800 IU per day did not impact WB BMC from age 2 to 9 months in a small subsample (n = 13 at 9 months) of exclusively breastfed infants with 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L at baseline. Similarly, Gallo et aland Rosendahl et alinvestigated BMC and BMD in predominantly vitamin D–sufficient infants and showed no differences according to dose of vitamin D supplementation ranging from 400 to 1600 IU per day. The consistent absence of a dose-response in bone mass suggests a saturable effect in bone mineral accretion when vitamin D is supplemented at 400 IU per day.

The results of this study and others, complement a recent Cochrane review comparing 400 IU per day of supplemental vitamin D to placebo that reported no difference in BMC of the distal radius based on 2 trials in breastfed infants, whereas the supplement was protective against serum 25(OH)D less than 50 nmol/L in 4 other trials. More recently, a trial in newborn infants with serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L confirmed in most participants (67%) that 400 IU per day compared with placebo had no effect on BMD of the LS measured at age 4 months. This was observed even though the placebo group demonstrated declines in serum 25(OH)D concentrations, and those with concentrations less than 25 nmol/L at age 4 months had lower BMC and higher PTH. It is thus prudent to provide the breastfed infant with protection against vitamin D deficiency as soon as possible after birth using a vitamin D supplement of 400 IU per day, as is recommended in North America.

### Towards evidence-based vitamin D supplementation in infants: vitamin D intervention in infants (VIDI)-study design and methods of a randomised controlled double-blinded intervention study [^112cR7wU]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is important for bone mass accrual during growth. Additionally, it is considered a requirement for a multitude of processes associated with, for example, the development of immunity. Many countries apply vitamin D supplementation strategies in infants, but the guidelines are not based on scientific evidence and aim at prevention of rickets. It remains unclear whether the recommended doses are sufficient for the wide array of other effects of vitamin D. The VIDI trial performed in Finland is the first large randomised controlled study for evaluation of the effects of different vitamin D supplemental doses in infancy on: 1. bone strength 2. infections and immunity 3. allergy, atopy and asthma 4. cognitive development 5. genetic regulation of mineral homeostasis METHODS/DESIGN: VIDI, a randomised controlled double-blinded single-centre intervention study is conducted in infants from the age of 2 weeks to 24 months. Participants, recruited at Helsinki Maternity Hospital, are randomised to receive daily either 10 μg (400 IU) or 30 μg (1 200 IU) of vitamin D3 supplementation. Both groups are assessed at 6 months of age for calcium homeostasis, and at 12 and 24 months of age for parameters associated with bone strength, growth, developmental milestones, infections, immunity, atopy-related diseases, and genetic factors involved in these functions.

Discussion

The study enables evaluation of short and long term effects of supplemental vitamin D on growth, immune functions and skeletal and developmental parameters in infants, and the effects of genetic factors therein. The results enable institution of evidence-based guidelines for vitamin D supplementation in infancy.

### High-dose vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and 25 (OH) D sufficiency in childhood reduce the risk of fractures and improve bone mineralization in childhood: follow-up of a randomized clinical trial [^1138mNgT]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our finding of association between childhood vitamin D status and bone mineralization is in line with most previous studies, and is biologically plausible due to the well-known vitamin D effect on calcium and phosphate homeostasis, two key components in hydroxyapatite; i.e. bone mineral. Our results suggest a 25(OH)D beneficial threshold of minimum 75 nmol/l on bone mineralization and fractures, which is in line with current recommendations of vitamin D sufficiency from the Endocrine Society based on evidence showing up to a 65% increase in calcium absorption when going from 50 nmol/l to 75 nmol/l 18 and where the inverse relationship with parathyroid hormone seems to reach a plateau.

The current recommended vitamin D intake of 400 IU/day in infants from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Institute of Medicineand the European Food Safety Authorityis based on a 25(OH)D sufficiency concentration of 50 nmol/l for the prevention of rickets, which may be inadequate to reach our suggested beneficial threshold of 75 nmol/l for improved bone mineralization. The results from a vitamin D dose-response study among infants demonstrated 3.5-times and 9.7-times higher chances of reaching 75 nmol/l after 3 months of supplementation with 800 IU/day and 1200 IU/day, respectively, vs. 400 IU/day. The baseline 25(OH)D concentrations in that study were similar to what we observed in our study at age 6 years and are relatively high compared with studies of other ethnicities with more skin pigmentationwhere daily vitamin D requirements may be even larger. The number of intervention studies are limited, but a recent RCTin infants reported no differences in bone mineralization from vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day vs. 1200 IU/day, but the baseline mean 25(OH)D concentrations of the children was above 80 nmol/l and the findings may reflect that the effect of postnatal supplementation is minimal beyond the 75 nmol/l threshold. However, future large RCTs of infants and preschool children with supplementation around the tolerable upper intake levels of 1000 IU/day (up to 6 months), 1500 IU/day (6–12 months) and 2000 IU/day (from 12 months) are needed to establish the most beneficial vitamin D supplementation regime for optimizing childhood bone health. In our study, there was no evidence of toxicity with no children having 25(OH)D concentrations above the upper threshold of 250 nmol/l defined by the Endocrine Society. Further, a meta-analysis including 24 studies has suggested that vitamin D intervention doses during pregnancy up to 5000 IU/day should be considered safe.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^114VAFFm]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — conclusions emphasize implementation and assessment priorities. Recommendations for vitamin D supplementation in breastfed infants should take into account skin pigmentation and geography, and recommendations for fortification of commonly used foods with vitamin D are necessary. Current recommendations of sun exposure and vitamin D supplementation are limited because of a paucity of studies in children, nonuniformity of 25(OH)-D assays used in research studies, and lack of uniformity in the description of normal and abnormal ranges for 25(OH)-D levels in children, and a low threshold for assessing vitamin D sufficiency in infants, children, and adolescents is recommended.

### Adherence to vitamin D recommendations among US infants [^113xVWyx]. Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

In November 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) doubled the recommended daily intake of vitamin D for infants and children, from 200 IU/day (2003 recommendation) to 400 IU/day. We aimed to assess the prevalence of infants meeting the AAP recommended intake of vitamin D during their first year of life.

Methods

Using data from the Infant Feeding Practices Study II, conducted from 2005 to 2007, we estimated the percentage of infants who met vitamin D recommendations at ages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.5, 9, and 10.5 months (n = 1952–1633).

Results

The use of oral vitamin D supplements was low, regardless of whether infants were consuming breast milk or formula, ranging from 1% to 13%, varying by age. Among infants who consumed breast milk but no formula, only 5% to 13% met either recommendation. Among mixed-fed infants, 28% to 35% met the 2003 recommendation, but only 9% to 14% would have met the 2008 recommendation. Among those who consumed formula but no breast milk, 81% to 98% met the 2003 recommendation, but only 20% to 37% would have met the 2008 recommendation.

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that most US infants are not consuming adequate amounts of vitamin D according to the 2008 AAP recommendation. Pediatricians and health care providers should encourage parents of infants who are either breastfed or consuming < 1 L/day of infant formula to give their infants an oral vitamin D supplement.

### Vitamin D during pregnancy and infancy and infant serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration [^114YGfiy]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the vitamin D dose necessary to achieve serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration ≥ 20 ng/mL during infancy.

Methods

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in New Zealand. Pregnant mothers, from 27 weeks' gestation to birth, and then their infants, from birth to age 6 months, were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 mother/infant groups: placebo/placebo, vitamin D3 1000/400 IU, or vitamin D3 2000/800 IU. Serum 25(OH)D and calcium concentrations were measured at enrollment, 36 weeks' gestation, in cord blood, and in infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age.

Results

Two-hundred-and-sixty pregnant women were randomized. At enrollment, the proportions with serum 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL for placebo, lower-dose, and higher-dose groups were 54%, 64%, and 55%, respectively. The proportion with 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL was larger in both intervention groups at 36 weeks' gestation (50%, 91%, 89%, P < .001). In comparison with placebo, the proportion of infants with 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL was larger in both intervention groups to age 4 months: cord blood (22%, 72%, 71%, P < .001), 2 months (50%, 82%, 92%, P < .001), and 4 months (66%, 87%, 87%, P = 0.004), but only in the higher-dose group at age 6 months (74%, 82%, 89%, P = 0.07; higher dose versus placebo P = 0.03, lower dose versus placebo P = 0.21).

Conclusions

Daily vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy and then infancy with 1000/400 IU or 2000/800 IU increases the proportion of infants with 25(OH)D ≥ 20 ng/mL, with the higher dose sustaining this increase for longer.

### Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels: variability, knowledge gaps, and the concept of a desirable range [^114rfqdw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2015). Low credibility.

Hypovitaminosis D is prevalent worldwide but proportions vary widely between regions, depending on genetic and lifestyle factors, the threshold to define deficiency, and accuracy of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) assays used. Latitude, pollution, concealing clothing, sun exposure, gender, dietary habits, and lack of government regulation account for up to 50% in variations in serum 25OHD levels, whereas genetic polymorphisms in the vitamin D pathway account for less than 5%. Organizations/societies have developed guidelines for recommended desirable 25OHD levels and vitamin D doses to reach them, but their applicability across age groups and populations are still debated. This article and the accompanying online Supporting Information highlight sources of variations in circulating 25OHD levels, uncertainties and knowledge gaps, and analytical problems facing 25OHD assays, while keeping efficacy and safety data as the dominant factors when defining a desirable range for 25OHD levels. We propose a desirable range of 20 to 40ng/mL (50 to 100nmol/L), provided precise and accurate assays are used. Although slightly lower levels, 15 to 20ng/mL, may be sufficient for some infants and adults, higher levels, 40 to 60ng/mL, may still be safe. This desirable range allows physicians to tailor treatment while taking season, lifestyle, vitamin D intake, and other sources of variation into account. We reserve 25OHD measurements for at-risk patients, defined by disease or lifestyle, and the use of 25OHD assays calibrated against the recommended international standards. Most target groups reach desirable target levels by a daily intake of 400 to 600IU for children and 800IU for adults. A total daily allowance of vitamin D of up to 1000IU in the pediatric age groups, and up to 2000IU in adults, tailored to an individual patient risk profile, is probably safe over long durations. Additional data are needed to validate the proposed range and vitamin D doses, especially in children, pregnant women, and non-white populations.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^117JZinL]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — AAP 2003 infant supplementation guidance and formula content: In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended a vitamin D supplement for (1) breastfed infants who do not consume at least 500 mL of a vitamin D–fortified formula/beverage and (2) nonbreastfed infants who do not consume > 500 mL of vitamin D–fortified beverages. The supplementation should start during the first 2 months of life and continue throughout childhood and adolescence. The rationale for this guidance is that vitamin D stores in the newborn, which are obtained through transplacental passage from the vitamin D–replete mother, should last for at least 8 weeks after delivery given that the half-life of serum 25(OH)-vitamin D [25(OH)-D] is ~2 to 3 weeks, and in a term infant born to a vitamin D–replete mother, the supply of vitamin D may last even longer (8–12 weeks). In the United States, all infant formulas are mandated to contain 40 to 100 IU of vitamin D per 100 kcal (1 kcal = 4.2 kJ) of formula (258–666 IU of vitamin D per L of a 20 kcal/oz formula), and, in fact, all contain at least 400 IU/L of vitamin D, and thus daily intake of at least 500 mL of vitamin D–fortified formula would ensure the required minimum daily intake of vitamin D 200 IU/day.

A.S.P.E.N. neonatal metabolic bone disease — vitamin D supplementation: We suggest vitamin D supplementation for healthy breastfed infants and those with malnutrition and/or rickets (Weak), and further studies are needed to determine the optimal dose, route, and duration of supplementation. The available data suggest that vitamin D supplementation is beneficial in healthy term breastfed infants and in children with established malnutrition and rickets, but specific dosing recommendations cannot be made at this time. External professional guidance cited includes that the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 400 IU (10 μg) per day, the Institute of Medicine targets a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level > 20 ng/mL, and the Endocrine Society recommends at least 400 IU with 1000 IU daily possibly needed to achieve an optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (> 30 ng/mL). Evidence grade for this recommendation is Low (Tables 6 and 7).

### Maternal vitamin D status: implications for the development of infantile nutritional rickets [^112EkzRw]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The mother is the major source of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration in the young infant. Maternal vitamin D status is an important factor in determining the vitamin D status of the infant and their risk of developing vitamin D deficiency and infantile nutritional rickets. There is evidence that the current supplementation recommendations, particularly for pregnant and lactating women, are inadequate to ensure vitamin D sufficiency in these groups. A widespread and concerted effort is needed to ensure daily supplementation of breastfed and other infants at high risk with vitamin D 400 IU from birth and of pregnant women in high-risk communities with 2000 IU. Future studies are required to determine the optimal doses of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and during lactation, and for normalizing vitamin D stores in infancy to reduce the prevalence of infantile nutritional rickets. Operational research studies are needed to understand the best methods of implementing supplementation programs and the factors that are likely to impede their success.

### Randomised controlled trial of perinatal vitamin D supplementation to prevent early-onset acute respiratory infections among Australian first nations children: the 'D-kids' study protocol [^116S6w3t]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2023). High credibility.

To address deficiency in pregnancy, doses of 2000–4000 IU/day from 12 to 16 weeks gestation have been shown to be safe and effective. For infants with deficiency, supplementation with 400 IU (for levels between 30 and 50 nmol/L) to 1000 IU (for < 30 nmol/L) per day for 3 months is recommended depending on the severity of deficiency. Infant doses up to 1000 IU/dayand bolus doses of 100 000 IUhave been used safely. It remains unclear whether vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and infancy can reduce the burden of early-onset infant ARIs.

A 2017 meta-analysis of individual-level data from 10 933 participants in 25 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)and subsequent 2021 update of aggregate data over 48 000 participants in 46 RCTsfound that vitamin D supplementation reduced the odds of experiencing at least one ARI episode by 12% (OR 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96))and 8% (OR 0.92 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.99)), respectively, compared with placebo. This reduction was found despite considerable population (ethnicity, age, socioeconomic status, baseline vitamin D) and design (vitamin D dosage/duration and outcome measure) heterogeneity. Importantly, the data available at the commencement of our study suggested both daily and weekly vitamin D dosing were effective against ARI (OR 0.81 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.91)). More recently, the largest effects have been seen in those receiving daily supplementation of ≥ 400 IU (OR 0.70 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.89)). In general, children 1–15 years of age appear to receive the most benefit (OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.93)) and large bolus doses at monthly or greater intervals have been ineffective. A New Zealand RCT found that compared with placebo controls, perinatal vitamin D supplementation (mothers from 27-week gestation to birth, infants from birth to age 6 months) maintained infant vitamin D status > 50 nmol/L at birth and in infancyand significantly reduced ARI primary care presentations among infants (relative risk reduction of 12% (≥ 1 ARI, 99% vs 87%,) and incidence rate reduction of 37.5% (4.0 vs 2.5 ARI/child/year)) in the 12-month postsupplementation (infant age 6–18 months). Overall, few of the reviewed RCTs dosed weekly (6/46) or during the perinatal or neonatal period (4/46)where deficiency is common. As far as we are aware, none have done both.

### Towards evidence-based vitamin D supplementation in infants: vitamin D intervention in infants (VIDI)-study design and methods of a randomised controlled double-blinded intervention study [^112Ba1aG]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The biologically inactive vitamin D 3 (cholecalciferol) is produced in the skin after solar UVB exposure. It is bound to vitamin D binding protein (DBP) and transported to the liver for conversion to 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25-OHD), the most abundant circulating metabolite of vitamin D. In the kidney, 25-OHD is further hydroxylated to the active form calcitriol, 1,25-OH 2 D, that contributes to calcium metabolism. Paracrine conversion of 25-OHD to calcitriol occurs in many tissues, such as dendritic and endothelial cells, brain, placenta and parathyroids, underscoring the importance of vitamin D for these organs. Based on the number of cell types expressing vitamin D receptors (VDR), 38 potential target tissues have been recognised. In target cells, calcitriol regulates the transcription of target genes, including several genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Locally produced calcitriol in immune cells participates in host defence reactions and acts as a potent immunomodulator. In fact, vitamin D has been estimated to directly and indirectly regulate the expression of 2–3% of the human genome.

Both cutaneously synthesised and dietary vitamin D contribute to the circulating 25-OHD concentration. There is no consensus on the optimal 25-OHD concentration. In 2011, Institute of Medicine guideline stated that 25-OHD concentrations above 50 nmol/L are required for normal body functions including linear growth and bone mass accrual. According to the Endocrine Society, for optimizing long-term health benefits such as the prevention of diabetes or fractures, concentrations above 75 nmol/L may be needed.

Vitamin D supplementation has been recommended in Finland for all infants since the 1940's, but in line with the declining prevalence of rickets, the recommended doses have gradually decreased. The present Finnish Nutritional Council guidelines recommend 10 μg (400 IU) of vitamin D3 supplementation daily for all infants from the age of 2 weeks to 24 months, and 7.5 μg (300 IU) to children aged 2 to 18 years. Despite these recommendations, 20% of children were shown to be vitamin D deficient (< 50 nmol/L) at 14 months of age. In addition, we have previously shown that more than 70% of 195 apparently healthy school children in Helsinki, Finland, were vitamin D deficient (< 50 nmol/L) during the school year.

### Effect of higher vs standard dosage of vitamin D3 supplementation on bone strength and infection in healthy infants: a randomized clinical trial [^116XwrDw]. JAMA Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Although guidelines for vitamin D supplementation in infants have been widely implemented, they are mostly based on studies focusing on prevention of rickets. The optimal dose for bone strength and infection prevention in healthy infants remains unclear.

Objective

To determine whether daily supplementation with 1200 IU of vitamin D3 increases bone strength or decreases incidence of infections in the first 2 years of life compared with a dosage of 400 IU/d.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A randomized clinical trial involving a random sample of 975 healthy term infants at a maternity hospital in Helsinki, Finland. Study recruitment occurred between January 14, 2013, and June 9, 2014, and the last follow-up was May 30, 2016. Data analysis was by the intention-to-treat principle.

Interventions

Randomization of 489 infants to daily oral vitamin D3 supplementation of 400 IU and 486 infants to 1200 IU from age 2 weeks to 24 months.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were bone strength and incidence of parent-reported infections at 24 months.

Results

Of the 975 infants who were randomized, 485 (49.7%) were girls and all were of Northern European ethnicity. Eight hundred twenty-three (84.4%) completed the 24-month follow-up. We found no differences between groups in bone strength measures, including bone mineral content (mean difference, 0.4 mg/mm; 95% CI, -0.8 to 1.6), mineral density (mean difference, 2.9 mg/cm3; 95% CI, -8.3 to 14.2), cross-sectional area (mean difference, -0.9 mm2; 95% CI, -5.0 to 3.2), or polar moment of inertia (mean difference, -66.0 mm4, 95% CI, -274.3 to 142.3). Incidence rates of parent-reported infections did not differ between groups (incidence rate ratio, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.93–1.06). At birth, 914 of 955 infants (95.7%) were vitamin D sufficient (ie, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration ≥ 20.03 ng/mL). At 24 months, mean 25(OH)D concentration was higher in the 1200-IU group than in the 400-IU group (mean difference, 12.50 ng/mL; 95% CI, 11.22–13.78).

Conclusions and Relevance

A vitamin D3 supplemental dose of up to 1200 IU in infants did not lead to increased bone strength or to decreased infection incidence. Daily supplementation with 400 IU vitamin D3 seems adequate in maintaining vitamin D sufficiency in children younger than 2 years.

### Effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on linear growth and other health outcomes among children under five years of age [^115zikYT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone that is important for its role in calcium homeostasis to maintain skeletal health. Linear growth faltering and stunting remain pervasive indicators of poor nutrition status among infants and children under five years of age around the world, and low vitamin D status has been linked to poor growth. However, existing evidence on the effects of vitamin D supplementation on linear growth and other health outcomes among infants and children under five years of age has not been systematically reviewed.

Objectives

To assess effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on linear growth and other health outcomes among infants and children under five years of age.

Search Methods

In December 2019, we searched CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, 14 other electronic databases, and two trials registries. We also searched the reference lists of relevant publications for any relevant trials, and we contacted key organisations and authors to obtain information on relevant ongoing and unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation, with or without other micronutrients, compared to no intervention, placebo, a lower dose of vitamin D, or the same micronutrients alone (and not vitamin D) in infants and children under five years of age who lived in any country.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures.

Main Results

Out of 75 studies (187 reports; 12,122 participants) included in the qualitative analysis, 64 studies (169 reports; 10,854 participants) contributed data on our outcomes of interest for meta-analysis. A majority of included studies were conducted in India, USA, and Canada. Two studies reported for-profit funding, two were categorised as receiving mixed funding (non-profit and for-profit), five reported that they received no funding, 26 did not disclose funding sources, and the remaining studies were funded by non-profit funding. Certainty of evidence varied between high and very low across outcomes (all measured at endpoint) for each comparison. Vitamin D supplementation versus placebo or no intervention (31 studies) Compared to placebo or no intervention, vitamin D supplementation (at doses 200 to 2000 IU daily; or up to 300,000 IU bolus at enrolment) may make little to no difference in linear growth (measured length/height in cm) among children under five years of age (mean difference (MD) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.37 to 1.68; 3 studies, 240 participants; low-certainty evidence); probably improves length/height-for-age z-score (L/HAZ) (MD 0.11, 95% CI 0.001 to 0.22; 1 study, 1258 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); and probably makes little to no difference in stunting (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 1 study, 1247 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). In terms of adverse events, vitamin D supplementation results in little to no difference in developing hypercalciuria compared to placebo (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.28 to 14.67; 2 studies, 68 participants; high-certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether vitamin D supplementation impacts the development of hypercalcaemia as the certainty of evidence was very low (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.90; 2 studies, 367 participants). Vitamin D supplementation (higher dose) versus vitamin D (lower dose) (34 studies) Compared to a lower dose of vitamin D (100 to 1000 IU daily; or up to 300,000 IU bolus at enrolment), higher-dose vitamin D supplementation (200 to 6000 IU daily; or up to 600,000 IU bolus at enrolment) may have little to no effect on linear growth, but we are uncertain about this result (MD 1.00, 95% CI -2.22 to 0.21; 5 studies, 283 participants), and it may make little to no difference in L/HAZ (MD 0.40, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.86; 2 studies, 105 participants; low-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated stunting. As regards adverse events, higher-dose vitamin D supplementation may make little to no difference in developing hypercalciuria (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.35; 6 studies, 554 participants; low-certainty evidence) or in hypercalcaemia (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.18; 5 studies, 986 participants; low-certainty evidence) compared to lower-dose vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D supplementation (higher dose) + micronutrient(s) versus vitamin D (lower dose) + micronutrient(s) (9 studies) Supplementation with a higher dose of vitamin D (400 to 2000 IU daily, or up to 300,000 IU bolus at enrolment) plus micronutrients, compared to a lower dose (200 to 2000 IU daily, or up to 90,000 IU bolus at enrolment) of vitamin D with the same micronutrients, probably makes little to no difference in linear growth (MD 0.60, 95% CI -3.33 to 4.53; 1 study, 25 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). No studies evaluated L/HAZ or stunting. In terms of adverse events, higher-dose vitamin D supplementation with micronutrients, compared to lower-dose vitamin D with the same micronutrients, may make little to no difference in developing hypercalciuria (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.48; 1 study, 86 participants; low-certainty evidence) and probably makes little to no difference in developing hypercalcaemia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90, 1.11; 2 studies, 126 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Four studies measured hyperphosphataemia and three studies measured kidney stones, but they reported no occurrences and therefore were not included in the comparison for these outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence suggests that oral vitamin D supplementation may result in little to no difference in linear growth, stunting, hypercalciuria, or hypercalcaemia, compared to placebo or no intervention, but may result in a slight increase in length/height-for-age z-score (L/HAZ). Additionally, evidence suggests that compared to lower doses of vitamin D, with or without micronutrients, vitamin D supplementation may result in little to no difference in linear growth, L/HAZ, stunting, hypercalciuria, or hypercalcaemia. Small sample sizes, substantial heterogeneity in terms of population and intervention parameters, and high risk of bias across many of the included studies limit our ability to confirm with any certainty the effects of vitamin D on our outcomes. Larger, well-designed studies of long duration (several months to years) are recommended to confirm whether or not oral vitamin D supplementation may impact linear growth in children under five years of age, among both those who are healthy and those with underlying infectious or non-communicable health conditions.

### Trial of daily vitamin D supplementation in preterm infants [^117SNB7x]. Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the effect of 800 vs 400 IU of daily oral vitamin D3 on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) at 40 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA) in preterm infants of 28 to 34 weeks' gestation.

Methods

In this randomized double-blind trial, we allocated eligible infants to receive either 800 or 400 IU of vitamin D3 per day (n = 48 in both groups). Primary outcome was VDD (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels < 20 ng/mL) at 40 weeks' PMA. Secondary outcomes were VDD, bone mineral content, and bone mineral density at 3 months' corrected age (CA).

Results

Prevalence of VDD in the 800-IU group was significantly lower than in the 400-IU group at 40 weeks (38.1% vs. 66.7%; relative risk: 0.57; 95% confidence interval: 0.37–0.88) and at 3 months' CA (12.5% vs. 35%; relative risk: 0.36; 95% confidence interval: 0.14–0.90). One infant (2.4%) in the 800-IU group had vitamin D excess (100–150 ng/mL). Bone mineral content (mean ± SD: 79.6 ± 16.8 vs. 84.7 ± 20.7 g; p = 0.27) and bone mineral density (0.152 ± 0.019 vs. 0.158 ± 0.021 g/cm2; p = 0.26) were not different between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

Daily supplementation with 800 IU of vitamin D reduces the prevalence of VDD at 40 weeks' PMA and at 3 months' CA in preterm infants without showing any improvement in bone mineralization. However, there is a possibility that this dose may occasionally result in vitamin D excess.

### International expert consensus on micronutrient supplement use during the early life course [^1112Wbwq]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D

There was consensus agreement on the importance of vitamin D supplement use in the preconception phase, across all three trimesters of pregnancy and throughout the lactation period. In agreement with these recommendations, the strength/quality of evidence arguing for vitamin D supplement use to improve maternal and/or foetal/infant health was also rated as somewhat to very strong, except for the preconception period. This strong consensus in favour of widespread vitamin D supplement use may not sufficiently reflect the still ongoing scientific discussion on vitamin D in these settings. There is compelling evidence that a poor vitamin D status, reflected by low serum 25(OH)D concentrations, is associated with various adverse pregnancy outcomes. In contrast, data from vitamin D RCTs are inconsistent and often limited due to low sample sizes, enrolment starting after the first trimester, and/or including women with a sufficient vitamin D status. While it is beyond the scope of this manuscript to critically appraise the whole literature on vitamin D, widespread vitamin D supplement use is supported by evidence that (a) vitamin D deficiency is very common, (b) vitamin D is critical for bone health (i.e. prevention and treatment of rickets and osteomalacia) as consistently documented by evidence-based guidelines, and (c) vitamin D supplement use at moderate doses (e.g. 800–2000 IU, 20–50 µg daily) is relatively safe from preconception throughout pregnancy until lactation. There are also additional potential beneficial effects of vitamin D, such as for fertility, preventing pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes mellitus, although evidence remains limited.

### Safety of high-dose vitamin D supplementation among children aged 0 to 6 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111yb3vp]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

The influence of vitamin D on skeletal health is well known, but other biological nonskeletal effects have been discovered as the vitamin D receptor has been identified in cell types not involved in bone metabolism. Vitamin D deficiency is a common global problem, particularly in young children, and the insight about new biological nonskeletal actions of vitamin D demands revision of vitamin D supplementation policies, which have led to updated recommendations regarding clinical practice and recommended intake levels. Vitamin D is primarily obtained by cutaneous synthesis from sunlight exposure or as a nutrient from dietary sources such as fatty fish. However, as treatment and in prevention of deficiency, vitamin D supplements in the form of either cholecalciferol (vitamin D 3) or ergocalciferol (vitamin D 2) have been recommended. Supplementation of very high doses of vitamin D can cause hypercalcemia and subsequent kidney failure; therefore, an upper threshold concentration of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) corresponding to 100 ng/mL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 2.496) has been suggested by the Endocrine Society, at which the risk of developing hypercalcemia is considered minimal. Regarding intake, a tolerable upper intake level has been defined as 25 μg/d (1000 IU/d) for infants aged 0 to 12 months and 50 μg/d (2000 IU/d) for children aged 1 to 10 years by the European Food Safety Authority. In general, evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the safety of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in early childhood is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of high-dose vitamin D in children aged 0 to 6 years by examining potential clinical adverse events and biochemical changes reported in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^117TXj6D]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency in children — summary and guidelines identify higher-risk groups and thresholds. The risk of vitamin D deficiency is higher in dark-skinned populations, children who live at higher latitudes, exclusively breastfed infants and children, infants born to vitamin D–deficient mothers, and premature infants and may also be affected by cultural practices. 25(OH)-D levels should be maintained at least above 50 nmol/L (20 ng/dL) in infants and children, and studies are necessary to determine if a level of 80 nmol/L (32 ng/ mL) should be considered the cutoff for vitamin D sufficiency in a pediatric population. Risks associated with exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) need to be balanced against risks of deficient cutaneous vitamin D synthesis, and currently recommended sun exposure for infants is insufficient to maintain vitamin D levels in the recommended range for dark-skinned infants and children, particularly at higher latitudes and during the winter months.

### High-dose vitamin D intervention in infants – effects on vitamin D status, calcium homeostasis, and bone strength [^115Z9R7Q]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Context

Guidelines in Finland recommend 10 μg of vitamin D3 daily for all infants. Recent observations suggest that this may be insufficient to maintain optimal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25-OHD).

Objective

The aim of the study was to evaluate effects of various vitamin D doses and determine a dose ensuring S-25-OHD of at least 80 nmol/liter in infants without signs of vitamin D excess.

Design

We conducted a randomized double-blind intervention study. Cord blood was obtained at birth for S-25-OHD; 113 infants were randomized to receive vitamin D3 10, 30, or 40 μg/d from age 2 wk to 3 months.

Setting

An investigator-initiated study was performed in a single maternity hospital in Helsinki, Finland.

Main Outcome Measures

S-25-OHD, calcium homeostasis, and skeletal characteristics were evaluated with peripheral quantitative computed tomography at age 3 months.

Results

Baseline S-25-OHD was similar in all three groups (median, 53 nmol/liter). At 3 months, the mean S-25-OHD values were 88, 124, and 153 nmol/liter, and the minimum values were 46, 57, and 86 nmol/liter in the groups receiving 10, 30, and 40 μg (ANOVA; P < 0.001). No hypercalcemia occurred; plasma calcium, serum PTH, and urine calcium excretion was similar between the groups. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography showed a trend toward larger tibial total bone and cortical bone area with higher vitamin D doses.

Conclusion

Vitamin D3 supplementation with up to 40 μg/d from age 2 wk to 3 months was safe and caused no hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. The 40-μg dose maintained S-25-OHD above 80 nmol/liter in all infants. More extensive and longer intervention studies are necessary to assess long-term effects.

### Efficacy of daily supplementation of 800 IU vitamin D on vitamin D status at 6 months of age in term healthy Indian infants [^114yXV4S]. Journal of Perinatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Most authorities recommend daily supplementation of 400 IU vitamin D for all term healthy neonates throughout infancy, however this dose was shown to be inadequate in an earlier study from our institution. We planned to evaluate if supplementation of 800IU/day in term Indian infants would reduce the prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) at 6 months of age.

Methods

In a prospective study, we supplemented 800IU/day of vitamin D in 70 term infants from birth till 6 months of age. Serum 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol [25(OH)D] was measured at birth and 6 months for all infants; and at 6, 10 and 14 weeks of age in subsets of 23 infants each. The primary outcome was prevalence of VDI (defined as serum 25(OH)D level < 50nmol/L) at 6 months of age.

Results

A total of 58 out of 70 (83%) infants were followed up until 6 months of age. The median (nmol/L; IQR) serum 25(OH)D at birth and 6 months of age was 25 (12.5–35) and 92.5 (72.5–137.5), respectively. The prevalence of VDI at birth was 91.3% (63/69), which reduced to 6.9% (4/58) at 6 months of age. However, four infants (6.9%, 95% CI 1.9–16.7) developed vitamin D excess (serum 25(OH)D 250–375nmol/L) requiring reduction of the dose of supplementation. No infant developed vitamin D toxicity (serum 25(OH)D > 375nmol/L).

Conclusions

Daily supplementation of 800 IU of vitamin D resulted in vitamin D sufficiency in most term healthy infants at 6 months of age but with potential risk of toxicity.

### Maternal preferences for vitamin D supplementation in breastfed infants [^114KtjJh]. Annals of Family Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Daily vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants, but alternative methods include enriching breast milk with vitamin D through maternal supplementation or intermittent high-dose vitamin D. We determined maternal preferences for vitamin D supplementation in 140 mothers with exclusively breastfed infants, and 44 who used both breast and formula milk. Only 101 (55%) supplemented their infants with vitamin D. One hundred sixty (88%) preferred supplementing themselves rather than their infants, and 102 (57%) preferred daily to monthly supplementation. Safety was most important in choosing a method of supplementation. Taking maternal preferences into consideration may improve adequate intakes of vitamin D in breastfed infants.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^111uxrJL]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Sunlight exposure and vitamin D — sources, limits, and targets — are summarized as follows: Exposure to sunlight is the principal source of vitamin D for most children and adolescents, but limited skin synthesis in winter, particularly at latitudes above 37.5° and for dark-skinned people, makes supplementation necessary. Current AAP recommendations include keeping infants < 6 months old out of direct sunlight, selecting activities that minimize sunlight exposure, and using protective clothing and sunscreen; studies are needed in darker-skinned children at higher latitudes to define safe exposure that will maintain 25(OH)-D > 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL).

### Vitamin D supplementation and risk of toxicity in pediatrics: a review of current literature [^115MBUkh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

Although vitamin D toxicity is rare in children, increased use of vitamin D formulations, re-examination of optimal vitamin D levels, and use of higher doses lend potential for an increased incidence of vitamin D toxicity.

Evidence Acquisition

A PubMed search was conducted through May 2013 for cases of vitamin D intoxication and vitamin D trials in pediatrics. Safety data were collected and reviewed.

Evidence Synthesis

A small number of pediatric studies tested vitamin D doses at or above the currently recommended upper tolerable intake. In children and adolescents, vitamin D excess was rare and usually asymptomatic. Recent cases of intoxication relate to errors in manufacturing, formulation, or prescription; involve high total intake in the range of 240,000 to 4,500,000 IU; and present with severe hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, or nephrocalcinosis. However, mild hypercalcemia and hypervitaminosis using currently recommended doses have been reported in infants with rickets.

Conclusions

Although rare, cases of vitamin D intoxication that present with dramatic life-threatening symptoms still occur in children. Moreover, recent studies in infants raise a potential need for monitoring vitamin D levels when doses at or above the currently recommended upper range are used. Further studies are needed to clarify these findings. The Drugs and Therapeutics Committee of the Pediatric Endocrine Society suggests obtaining serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in infants and children who receive long-term vitamin D supplementation at or above the upper level intake that is currently recommended.

### Maternal vitamin D ₃ supplementation at 50 μ g / D protects against low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in infants at 8 wk of age: a randomized controlled trial of 3 doses of vitamin D beginning in gestation and continued in lactation [^114P9uS9]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for breastfed infants. Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation is a potential alternative, but its efficacy in maintaining infant 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration after birth is unknown.

Objectives

We determined the effect of 3 doses of maternal vitamin D supplementation beginning in gestation and continued in lactation on infant serum 25(OH)D and compared the prevalence of infant serum 25(OH)D cutoffs (> 30, > 40, > 50, and > 75 nmol/L) by dose at 8 wk of age.

Design

Pregnant women (n = 226) were randomly allocated to receive 10, 25, or 50 μg vitamin D₃/d from 13 to 24 wk of gestation until 8 wk postpartum, with no infant supplementation. Mother and infant blood was collected at 8 wk postpartum.

Results

At 8 wk postpartum, mean [nmol/L (95% CI)] infant 25(OH)D at 8 wk was higher in the 50-μg/d [75 (67, 83)] than in the 25-μg/d [52 (45, 58)] or 10-μg/d [45 (38, 52)] vitamin D groups (P < 0.05). Fewer infants born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group had a 25(OH)D concentration < 30 nmol/L (indicative of deficiency) than infants in the 25- and 10-μg/d groups, respectively (2% compared with 16% and 43%; P < 0.05). Fewer than 15% of infants in the 10- or 25-μg/d groups achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 75 nmol/L compared with 44% in the 50-μg/d group (P < 0.05). Almost all infants (∼98%, n = 44) born to mothers in the 50-μg/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration > 30 nmol/L. At 8 wk postpartum, mean maternal 25(OH)D concentration was higher in the 50-μg/d [88 (84, 91)] than in the 25-μg/d [78 (74, 81)] or 10-μg/d [69 (66, 73)] groups (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Maternal supplementation beginning in gestation with 50 μg vitamin D₃/d protects 98% of unsupplemented breastfed infants against 25(OH)D deficiency (< 30 nmol/L) to at least 8 wk, whereas 10 or 25 μg vitamin D/d protects only 57% and 84% of infants, respectively.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mass in infants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol / L: a prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^115mWR4h]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

A dose-response relation exists between vitamin D intake and 25(OH)D concentration in infants, and the lower the initial concentration, the greater the rise in vitamin D status. Adherence to 400 IU per day of vitamin D supplementation during the first year of life prevents vitamin D deficiency rickets. Trials of dosages more than 400 IU per day conducted in infants with sufficient vitamin D status show that bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) are not affected. In another trial in infants with 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L at baseline, supplementation (200 to 800 IU/d) from age 2 to 9 months elevated 25(OH)D more than 50 nmol/L, and bone mass was not different in a small subgroup analysis. It remains unclear whether BMC is compromised in infants born with serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L and whether a higher dose of vitamin D supplementation is required to build vitamin D stores and to support bone health across infancy.

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of 1000 IU per day of oral vitamin D supplementation vs 400 IU per day on bone health from age 1 to 12 months in infants born with serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L and whose mothers had an intent to breastfeed for at least 3 months. Our hypothesis was that infants born with serum 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L and provided with a supplement of 400 IU per day (compared with 1000 IU per day) would have lower bone mineral accretion by 3 months without resolution at age 12 months.

### Maternal vitamin D status: implications for the development of infantile nutritional rickets [^1113V74x]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The mother is the major source of circulating 25-OHD concentrations in the young infant. Thus maternal vitamin D status is an important factor in determining the vitamin D status of the infant and their risk of developing vitamin D deficiency and infantile nutritional rickets. As a result, breastfed infants of mothers with vitamin D deficiency who are unsupplemented and who receive little sunlight exposure are at high risk of developing vitamin D deficiency or rickets. Despite food fortification policies in many countries and recommendations for vitamin D supplementation of at-risk groups, vitamin D deficiency and infantile rickets remain major public health challenges in many developed and developing countries. There is evidence that the current supplementation recommendations, particularly for pregnant and lactating women, are inadequate to ensure vitamin D sufficiency in these groups. A widespread and concerted effort is needed to ensure daily supplementation of breastfed and other infants at high risk with vitamin D 400 IU from birth and pregnant women in high risk communities with at least 600 IU; awareness needs to be developed among the public and medical practitioners of the urgent need to improve the vitamin D status of pregnant and lactating mothers and their infants. Further studies are required to determine the optimal doses of vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and during lactation, and for normalizing vitamin D stores in infancy to reduce the prevalence of infantile nutritional rickets. Operational research studies also need to be conducted to understand the best methods of implementing supplementation programs and the factors that are likely to impede their success.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112ZNEru]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Endocrine Society — vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy: We suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, given its potential to lower risk of preeclampsia, intra-uterine mortality, preterm birth, SGA birth, and neonatal mortality. Empiric vitamin D may include daily intake of fortified foods, prenatal vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D, and/or a vitamin D supplement (pills or drops). In the clinical trials included in the systematic review, the vitamin D dosages ranged from 600 to 5000 IU (15 to 125 μg) daily equivalent, usually provided daily or weekly, and the estimated weighted average was approximately 2500 IU (63 μg) per day; this recommendation is based on evidence from trials conducted in healthy individuals during pregnancy.

### Vitamin D supplementation for term breastfed infants to prevent vitamin D deficiency and improve bone health [^116ZZxso]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Vitamin D deficiency is common worldwide, contributing to nutritional rickets and osteomalacia which have a major impact on health, growth, and development of infants, children and adolescents. Vitamin D levels are low in breast milk and exclusively breastfed infants are at risk of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency.

Objectives

To determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation given to infants, or lactating mothers, on vitamin D deficiency, bone density and growth in healthy term breastfed infants.

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to 29 May 2020 supplemented by searches of clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and citations.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs in breastfeeding mother-infant pairs comparing vitamin D supplementation given to infants or lactating mothers compared to placebo or no intervention, or sunlight, or that compare vitamin D supplementation of infants to supplementation of mothers.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and independently extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We included 19 studies with 2837 mother-infant pairs assessing vitamin D given to infants (nine studies), to lactating mothers (eight studies), and to infants versus lactating mothers (six studies). No studies compared vitamin D given to infants versus periods of infant sun exposure. Vitamin D supplementation given to infants: vitamin D at 400 IU/day may increase 25-OH vitamin D levels (MD 22.63 nmol/L, 95% CI 17.05 to 28.21; participants = 334; studies = 6; low-certainty) and may reduce the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency (25-OH vitamin D < 50 nmol/L) (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.80; participants = 274; studies = 4; low-certainty). However, there was insufficient evidence to determine if vitamin D given to the infant reduces the risk of vitamin D deficiency (25-OH vitamin D < 30 nmol/L) up till six months of age (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.05; participants = 122; studies = 2), affects bone mineral content (BMC), or the incidence of biochemical or radiological rickets (all very-low certainty). We are uncertain about adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. There were no studies of higher doses of infant vitamin D (> 400 IU/day) compared to placebo. Vitamin D supplementation given to lactating mothers: vitamin D supplementation given to lactating mothers may increase infant 25-OH vitamin D levels (MD 24.60 nmol/L, 95% CI 21.59 to 27.60; participants = 597; studies = 7; low-certainty), may reduce the incidences of vitamin D insufficiency (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.57; participants = 512; studies = 5; low-certainty), vitamin D deficiency (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.24; participants = 512; studies = 5; low-certainty) and biochemical rickets (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.44; participants = 229; studies = 2; low-certainty). The two studies that reported biochemical rickets used maternal dosages of oral D3 60,000 IU/day for 10 days and oral D3 60,000 IU postpartum and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. However, infant BMC was not reported and there was insufficient evidence to determine if maternal supplementation has an effect on radiological rickets (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.18 to 3.31; participants = 536; studies = 3; very low-certainty). All studies of maternal supplementation enrolled populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. We are uncertain of the effects of maternal supplementation on infant growth and adverse effects including hypercalcaemia. Vitamin D supplementation given to infants compared with supplementation given to lactating mothers: infant vitamin D supplementation compared to lactating mother supplementation may increase infant 25-OH vitamin D levels (MD 14.35 nmol/L, 95% CI 9.64 to 19.06; participants = 269; studies = 4; low-certainty). Infant vitamin D supplementation may reduce the incidence of vitamin D insufficiency (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.94; participants = 334; studies = 4) and may reduce vitamin D deficiency (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72; participants = 334; studies = 4) but the evidence is very uncertain. Infant BMC and radiological rickets were not reported and there was insufficient evidence to determine if maternal supplementation has an effect on infant biochemical rickets. All studies enrolled patient populations at high risk of vitamin D deficiency. Studies compared an infant dose of vitamin D 400 IU/day with varying maternal vitamin D doses from 400 IU/day to > 4000 IU/day. We are uncertain about adverse effects including hypercalcaemia.

Authors' Conclusions

For breastfed infants, vitamin D supplementation 400 IU/day for up to six months increases 25-OH vitamin D levels and reduces vitamin D insufficiency, but there was insufficient evidence to assess its effect on vitamin D deficiency and bone health. For higher-risk infants who are breastfeeding, maternal vitamin D supplementation reduces vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency, but there was insufficient evidence to determine an effect on bone health. In populations at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D supplementation of infants led to greater increases in infant 25-OH vitamin D levels, reductions in vitamin D insufficiency and vitamin D deficiency compared to supplementation of lactating mothers. However, the evidence is very uncertain for markers of bone health. Maternal higher dose supplementation (≥ 4000 IU/day) produced similar infant 25-OH vitamin D levels as infant supplementation of 400 IU/day. The certainty of evidence was graded as low to very low for all outcomes.

### Daily vs. monthly oral vitamin dfor treatment of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in infants: a randomized controlled trial [^113mFbuC]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Compare the efficacy and safety of daily vs. monthly oral vitamin D 3 in treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in infants.

Methods

90 infants with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency were randomized into Daily (D) [46 infants] and Bolus (B) [44 infants] groups to receive oral vitamin D 3, daily (2000 IU/day) and bolus (60,000 IU/month) for three months respectively. Both groups received daily oral calcium @50 mg/kg/day. Serum calcium (Ca), phosphate (P), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, urine calcium: creatinine ratio and radiological score were assessed at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. At the end of 12 weeks, 78 infants were available for evaluation of efficacy and safety of both regimens.

Results

Both regimens led to a statistically significant increase in Ca and P levels and fall in ALP and PTH levels from baseline to 4 and 12 weeks of therapy, with no inter-group difference. Infants in group D had statistically significant higher mean 25(OH)D levels as compared to group B at 4 weeks (group D 130.89 ± 43.43 nmol/L, group B - 108.25 ± 32.40 nmol/L; p - 0.012) and 12 weeks (group D - 193.69 ± 32.47 nmol/L, group B - 153.85 ± 33.60 nmol/L; p < 0.001). Eight infants [group D - 6/41 (14.6%); group B - 2/37 (5.4%), p = 0.268] developed mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia without hypercalciuria at 12 weeks that corrected spontaneously within a week.

Conclusions

Both daily and monthly oral vitamin D 3 in equivalent doses are efficacious and safe for treating symptomatic vitamin D deficiency in infants.

### Effect of weekly vitamin D supplements on mortality, morbidity, and growth of low birthweight term infants in India up to age 6 months: randomised controlled trial [^116KK8BW]. BMJ (2011). Excellent credibility.

Potential reasons for different effects on primary and secondary outcomes

It is possible that different amounts of vitamin D are required for optimisation of different vitamin D dependent functions. Evidence shows that higher doses of vitamin D are needed to improve responses to tuberculosis than are needed for prevention of bone problems, the basis for current recommended daily allowances. This could explain why the one recommended daily allowance given to the infants in our study improved growth but did not significantly affect morbidity and mortality. It is also possible that a larger dose of vitamin D, such as used in the Afghan trial, would have had even greater benefits on both growth and morbidity. It was notable that the one recommended nutrient intake dose left almost half the supplemented infants with inadequate status at six months. We were not permitted by the ethics committee to use a larger dose.

It is also possible that breast feeding, almost universal in our cohort, protected the infants against most severe infections, which is why the benefits of vitamin D were not seen. This is one difference between our study and the Afghan studysince the children in that study were older and recruited at about the same age as median breastfeeding cessation; furthermore, about 10% of their children had never breast fed.

Conclusions

Vitamin D supplements of one recommended nutrient intake improved growth in this vitamin D deficient cohort of low birthweight term infants but did not decrease mortality and severe morbidity, although the large loss to follow-up reduced power for this outcome. Infant vitamin D status depends on maternal status, particularly during pregnancy. The low status we found in the infants suggests that mothers were also deficient and it would be worth investigating the benefits for both maternal and infant health of providing vitamin D supplements during pregnancy. Improving the vitamin D status of such infants, through supplementation or increased exposure of mothers or infants to sunlight, might help reduce the prevalence of stunting and its adverse short and long term consequences. Trials should also investigate higher doses of vitamin D to determine whether its benefits can be further increased.

### Vitamin D supplementation for preventing infections in children under five years of age [^115oqi6S]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

The precise molecular mechanisms by which vitamin D helps defend people against infectious disease are now being elucidated. It has become clear that 1,25(OH)D plays a role not only in calcium homeostasis and bone metabolism, but also in the integrity of the innate immune system (Bhutta 2008; Wagner 2008b; Dimitrov 2015). Acting via the VDR, 1,25(OH)D alters the activity of many immune system cells, including macrophages, regulatory T cells, and natural killer cells.

Based on bone health benefits of vitamin D, the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) published new dietary guidelines in 2010, with the adequate intake for infants of 400 International Units (IU) daily of vitamin D, and raised the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for children older than one year from 400 IU/day in 2008 (Wagner 2008a) to 600 IU/day (IOM 2010). Health Canada also has similar recommendations of 400 IU/day for all exclusively breastfed, healthy infants; this should be continued until the infant's diet provides at least 400 IU/day from other sources (Canadian Paediatric Society 2007). However, the IOM committee did not find sufficient conclusive evidence for effects on non‐skeletal outcomes (Shapses 2011). It is therefore not yet known if these doses are sufficient to deliver all potential non‐skeletal health benefits related to vitamin D, and some experts recommend that at least 1000 IU/day may be required to consistently raise serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 30 ng/mL (Holick 2011). Vitamin D is generally safe and well tolerated when given at appropriate doses; cases of hypercalcaemia have been documented with vitamin D toxicity (only at doses of 50,000 IU/day or more for several weeks), which may eventually lead to vascular and tissue calcification with subsequent renal and cardiovascular damage (IOM 2010).

Vitamins A and D are essential nutrients that play important roles in growth and development. Preterm and low birth weight infants have low levels of these nutrients and are at risk for developing detrimental health consequences associated with vitamin A and vitamin D deficiencies. Preliminary data suggest that vitamin A and D supplementation is needed to prevent deficiency. More work is needed to define optimal doses, timing, and modes of administration to ensure that an adequate supply of these vitamins is available to meet the critical needs during pregnancy and in high-risk neonates.

### Effect of different dosages of oral vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D status in healthy, breastfed infants: a randomized trial [^112UJCGK]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Vitamin D supplementation in infancy is required to support healthy bone mineral accretion. A supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D per day is thought to support plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations between 40 and 50 nmol/L; some advocate 75 to 150 nmol/L for bone health.

Objective

To investigate the efficacy of different dosages of vitamin D in supporting 25(OH)D concentrations in infants.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Double-blind randomized clinical trial conducted among 132 one-month-old healthy, term, breastfed infants from Montréal, Québec, Canada, between March 2007 and August 2010. Infants were followed up for 11 months ending August 2011 (74% completed study).

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) supplements of 400 IU/d (n = 39), 800 IU/d (n = 39), 1200 IU/d (n = 38), or 1600 IU/d (n = 16).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was a plasma 25(OH)D concentration of 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included 25(OH)D concentrations of 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at 6, 9, and 12 months; 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/L or greater across all times; growth; and whole body and regional bone mineral content. Data were analyzed by intention to treat using available data, logistic regression, and mixed-model analysis of variance.

Results

By 3 months, 55% (95% CI, 38%-72%) of infants in the 400-IU/d group achieved a 25(OH)D concentration of 75 nmol/L or greater vs 81%(95% CI, 65%-91%) in the 800-IU/d group, 92% (95% CI, 77%-98%) in the 1200-IU/d group, and 100% in the 1600-IU/d group. This concentration was not sustained in 97.5% of infants at 12 months in any of the groups. The 1600-IU/d dosage was discontinued prematurely because of elevated plasma 25(OH)D concentrations. All dosages established 25(OH)D concentrations of 50 nmol/L or greater in 97% (95% CI, 94%-100%) of infants at 3 months and sustained this in 98% (95% CI, 94%-100%) to 12 months. Growth and bone mineral content did not differ by dosage.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among healthy, term, breastfed infants, only a vitamin D supplement dosage of 1600 IU/d (but not dosages of 400, 800, or 1200 IU/d) increased plasma 25(OH)D concentration to 75 nmol/L or greater in 97.5% of infants at 3 months. However, this dosage increased 25(OH)D concentrations to levels that have been associated with hypercalcemia.

### Effects of ethnicity and vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D status and changes in bone mineral content in infants [^114MpSBQ]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D has been given to infants to prevent and treat rickets for almost 100 years. The recommended dose of 400 IU (10 micrograms) daily for infants was established based on typical amounts in a teaspoon of cod liver oil. This recommendation has recently been reaffirmed as being appropriate by both the Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Pediatrics whereas the Endocrine Society considers the 400 IU to be a minimum appropriate dose. Although the dose of 400 IU daily is used for both breast-fed and formula-fed babies, vitamin D-deficient rickets is extremely rare in formula-fed infants primarily due to the mandatory addition of vitamin D to infant formulas in the United States. Formula-fed infants typically consume 300–500 IU/day from their formula and therefore generally meet the current recommendations without an additional oral supplement of vitamin D drops especially after the first 6 to 8 weeks of life. The relatively greater calcium and phosphorus concentration in US infant formulas compared to human milk may also be protective against rickets in some infants.

Remarkably, few data have looked at modern techniques of assessing bone mineral status and compared it to vitamin D levels and supplementation in this population. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) is accepted as the best marker of vitamin D status although it may serve primarily as a marker of exposure rather than clinical outcomes. There are few data that correlate serum 25(OH)D levels with functional outcomes in newborns and small infants.

Neonatal serum 25(OH)D levels reflect a range of in utero factors, most significant of these being the maternal vitamin D status. Although calcium and phosphorus are transported transplacentally without vitamin D, the effects of low vitamin D in utero or shortly after birth are uncertain.

This study was conducted to evaluate early life bone mineral content (BMC) and the effects of three months of vitamin D supplementation in breast-fed Hispanic and non-Hispanic Caucasian (henceforth, "Caucasian") infants on vitamin D levels. We hypothesized that 25(OH)D would be lower in Hispanic than Caucasian newborns but that these differences would not be substantial enough to be related closely to BMC and bone mineral density (BMD) or their changes during the first three months of life.

Recommended vitamin D serum levels and supplementation for preschoolers

It is well established that 25-hydroxyvitamin D serum levels above 50 nmol/L in children are sufficient to prevent rickets. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in children be above 50 nmol/L. Data from adults suggest that serum levels above 75 nmol/L are required to minimize calcium resorption from bone and maximize intestinal calcium absorption. Therefore, the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS) suggests that optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D level for children is above 75 nmol/L.

The recommended vitamin D dietary allowance (RDA) for children older than 1 year has been set at 600 IU/day by both Health Canada and the Institute of Medicine. Because children who consume less than 1000 mL of vitamin D fortified cow's milk per day (which includes most preschoolers) are unlikely to receive this amount of dietary vitamin D, the AAP recommends routine vitamin D supplementation of 400 IU/day for all children ingesting < 1000 ml/day of vitamin D-fortified formula or cow's milk. The CPS has no recommendation for routine vitamin D supplementation for Canadian children older than 1 year. However, we have found that 56% of our population is receiving 400 IU/day of supplemental vitamin D. To reflect the current AAP recommendation and common practice in our population, we chose 400 IU/day for the 'standard dose' arm.

Low vitamin D levels in North American children

There is consistent evidence, from both single center studies and national surveys, that North American children older than 1 year have vitamin D serum levels lower than AAP or CPS recommendations (see Additional file 1). Data from the 2001–2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicated that 70% of children 1 to 11 years had vitamin D levels < 75 nmol/L. Data from the 2007–2009 Canadian Health Measures Survey suggested that 51% of children age 6–11 years had vitamin D levels < 75 nmol/L. Studies of pre-school aged children from Boston (42°N), Toronto (43°N), St. John's (47°N), Calgary (51°N), Edmonton (53°N) and Alaska (58–61°N) have all found significant rates of vitamin D deficiency in infants and toddlers using various definitions.

### Self-reported prescribing behaviour of vitamin D prophylaxis in healthy children by Belgian paediatricians [^116W3W22]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

There is currently no consensus on the guidelines for vitamin D prophylaxis in healthy children. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prescribing behaviour of vitamin D prophylaxis among Belgian paediatricians. Between June and September 2022, a questionnaire was distributed by email to all Belgian paediatricians who are a member of at least one of three scientific or professional organisations, as well as to the heads of every Belgian paediatric or neonatal hospital ward. We analysed 426 completed questionnaires. All regions, age categories and subspecialties were represented. Vitamin D prophylaxis is always or frequently recommended by 98% of paediatricians. Fifty-eight per cent of paediatricians advise vitamin D prophylaxis up to the age of six years and 66% of paediatricians advise a daily dose of 400IU. In nearly every hospital in Belgium (96%), there is a specific protocol for vitamin D prophylaxis for newborns; but not for the paediatric unit (only 30%). Nearly all Belgian paediatricians prescribe vitamin D prophylaxis to infants. Although not recommended by guidelines, 25(OH)D is frequently measured by paediatricians. Practices regarding duration and dosing of vitamin D prophylaxis show large variability. Most neonatal wards do have a protocol, whereas most paediatric wards do not.

### Effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone mass in infants with 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations less than 50 nmol / L: a prespecified secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^114TCiRr]. JAMA Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D status at birth reflects maternal-fetal transfer of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D). The Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D for pregnancy and lactation is set at 600 IU per day. When the expecting mother has 25(OH)D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L (ie, 20 ng/mL), infants are born with elevated risk of vitamin D insufficiency (25[OH]D less than 50 nmol/L) or are deficient (25[OH]D less than 30 nmol/L). Human milk does not provide vitamin D in amounts consistent with the Adequate Intake for infants (400 IU per day). Therefore, public health policies in North America recommend that all breastfed infants begin vitamin D supplementation (400 IU per day) shortly after birth. The recommended amount of vitamin D for infants is set in accordance with intakes that maintain serum 25(OH)D concentration, the best marker of vitamin D status, in the range of 40 to 50 nmol/L in support of bone health. In Canada, based on studies from different provinces, the proportion of infants with insufficient vitamin D status ranges from 24.4% in Quebec City (cord serum 25[OH]D concentration less than 50 nmol/L) to 28% in Calgary and Edmonton (cord serum 25[OH]D concentrations less than 50 nmol/L) and 36% in Winnipeg (cord serum 25[OH]D concentrations less than 27.5 nmol/L).

### Vitamin D deficiency and supplementation in pregnancy in a multiethnic population-based cohort [^117FWL9N]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2016). Low credibility.

The debate about the optimal dose of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is ongoing. Guidelines from Scandinavia and UK recommend all pregnant women supplement intake with 10 μg (400 IU) vitamin D daily to prevent vitamin D deficiency. The guidelines from the Institute of Medicine (IOM), the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice, the WHO and the Canadian Pediatric Society differ. There is no consensus of the optimal concentration of 25(OH)D in pregnancy. There is no doubt that low infant 25(OH)D increases the risk of skeletal diseases such as rickets and hypocalcemia, but the effect of maternal deficiency on the fetus is not clear. Concerns about the impact of low 25(OH)D concentrations during pregnancy on fetal development is present, as low levels have been associated with preterm birth, low birth weight, bone mass and postnatal calcium concentrations, as well as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes in the mother.

### Vitamin D for the prevention of disease: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113Q5M89]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

Figure 1 — Vitamin D for the prevention of disease lists population-specific empiric supplementation as follows: Ages 1–18 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" "To prevent nutritional rickets and because of the potential to lower the risk of respiratory tract infections", Ages 19–49 state "No empiric vitamin D supplementation" with "Follow the Institute of Medicine Recommended Daily Allowance", Ages 50–74 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation", Ages ≥ 75 indicate "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of mortality", Pregnancy indicates "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of preeclampsia, intrauterine mortality, preterm birth, small for gestational age birth and neonatal mortality", and Prediabetes indicates "Empiric vitamin D supplementation" because of "the potential to lower the risk of progression to diabetes". Empiric vitamin D supplementation* is defined on-page as vitamin D (D3 or D2) intake that exceeds the DRI and is implemented without testing for 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and doses in trials varied so optimal doses remain unclear.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^115BArQA]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D intake in breastfed infants — adequacy and serum 25(OH)-D targets — is addressed by noting that the 200 IU/day intake (based on 2003 AAP guidelines) is "very questionable" for all breastfed infants; 200 IU/day was intended to maintain 25(OH)-D ≥ 27.5 nmol/L (11 ng/mL), yet rickets can occur at 25–50 nmol/L (10–20 ng/mL). In infants aged 7 to 12 months, 200 IU/day maintains ≥ 25 nmol/L (10 ng/mL), whereas 25(OH)-D levels of > 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) "need to be aimed for", and historical data indicate that 400 IU/day (cod liver oil) is sufficient and "is not harmful". Prior AAP guidance recommended 400 IU/day for deeply pigmented breastfed infants, and the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends 800 IU/day in winter based on high deficiency prevalence (46% mothers, 36% infants), indicating dietary requirements may be higher in northern latitudes, particularly in winter.

### Vitamin D: effects on childhood health and disease [^111J2DAH]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2013). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D is a key nutrient for both healthy children and those with chronic illnesses. Understanding its roles in health and disease has become one of the most important issues in the nutritional management of children. Formal guidelines related to nutrient requirements for vitamin D in healthy children, recommending dietary intakes of 400 IU per day for infants and 600 IU per day for children over 1 year of age, were released by the Institute of Medicine in November 2010. However, application of these guidelines to children with acute and chronic illnesses is less clear. In this Review, we consider major illness categories and specific examples of conditions in children that might be affected by vitamin D. This information can be used in developing both model systems of investigation and clinical trials of vitamin D in children with acute and chronic illnesses.

### Relationship between vitamin D and asthma from gestational to adulthood period: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^113ScD2N]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Vitamin D is not only a regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism, but also acts as an immunomodulator. Humans can get the vitamin D from three major sources: sunlight, food supplements and diet. Vitamin D was discovered in 1922. In 1928 Adolf Windaus received the Nobel Prize for research on the composition of sterols and their relationship with vitamins. However, it was not until 1941 that the vitamin was added to the list of recommended dietary supplements. Nowadays, vitamin D deficiency is a common problem among both children and adults. The proper level of vitamin D is important at any age: starting at pregnancy, where its deficiency may necessitate a caesarean section during childbirth, or cause the development of caries or wheezing in newborn babies. Studies indicate that even in the United States, where vitamin D is added to some dietary products, its levels below 30 ng/ml have been detected in 50% of children under the age of 5 and 70% of children aged 6 to 11 years. This phenomenon may be caused, among others, by an increased incidence of obesity or the excessive use of sunscreen creams. The recommended daily vitamin D intake reaches 400 IU for infants up to 1 year of age; while in children/adolescents from 1 to 18 years – 600 IU. Of note, supplementation is crucial for infants, as even 8 weeks-old infant may develop vitamin D deficiency. Similarly, recommended daily intake of vitamin D differs among adult and elderly groups. Recommended dose of vitamin D for adults under 70 years-old equals 600 IU per day; while past 71 years, 800 IU daily dosage is proposed.

### Recognition and management of vitamin D deficiency [^114Lxtxc]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency affects persons of all ages. Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency are symmetric low back pain, proximal muscle weakness, muscle aches, and throbbing bone pain elicited with pressure over the sternum or tibia. A 25-hydroxyvitamin D level should be obtained in patients with suspected vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 20 ng per mL (50 nmol per L), and insufficiency is defined as a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 20 to 30 ng per mL (50 to 75 nmol per L). The goal of treatment is to normalize vitamin D levels to relieve symptoms and decrease the risk of fractures, falls, and other adverse health outcomes. To prevent vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants and children receive at least 400 IU per day from diet and supplements. Evidence shows that vitamin D supplementation of at least 700 to 800 IU per day reduces fracture and fall rates in adults. In persons with vitamin D deficiency, treatment may include oral ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) at 50,000 IU per week for eight weeks. After vitamin D levels normalize, experts recommend maintenance dosages of cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at 800 to 1,000 IU per day from dietary and supplemental sources.

Low serum concentrations (< 50 nmol/L) are common in preterm infants during birth hospitalisation and at discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit.
Current neonatal nutritional strategies for early preterm infants may be insufficient to achieve recommended vitD intake and target serum 25(OH)D concentrations.
Improving maternal vitD status during pregnancy and neonatal vitD supplementation is warranted to optimise vitD status of preterm infants in early infancy.

### Vitamin D: extraskeletal health [^112guEFx]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and likely the most common medical condition in the world. There is a multitude of causes of vitamin D deficiency, but the major cause has been the lack of appreciation that the body requires 5- to 10-fold higher intakes than is currently recommended by the Institute of Medicine and other health agencies. It is likely that our hunter gatherer fore-fathers being exposed to sunlight on a daily basis were making several thousand IU of vitamin D a day. The fact that 100 IU of vitamin D prevented overt signs of rickets led to the false security that ingesting twice this amount was more than adequate to satisfy the body's vitamin D requirement. Although this may be true for preventing overt skeletal deformities associated with rickets, there is now overwhelming and compelling scientific and epidemiologic data suggesting that the human body requires a blood level of 25(OH)D above 30 ng/mL for maximum health. The likely reason is that essentially every tissue and cell in the body has a VDR and thus, to have enough vitamin D to satisfy all of these cellular requirements, the blood level of 25(OH)D needs to be above 30 ng/mL. It has been estimated that for every 100 IU of vitamin D ingested that the blood level of 25(OH)D increases by 1 ng/mL. Thus to theoretically achieve a blood level above 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 3000 IU of vitamin D a day. There is evidence, however, that when the blood levels of 25(OH)D are less than 15 ng/mL, the body is able to more efficiently use vitamin D to raise the blood level to about 20 ng/mL. To raise the blood level of 25(OH)D above 20 ng/mL requires the ingestion of 100 IU of vitamin D for every 1-ng increase; therefore to increase the blood level to the minimum 30 ng/mL requires the ingestion of at least 1000 IU of vitamin D a day for adults. There is a great need to significantly increase the recommended adequate intakes of vitamin D. All neonates during the first year of life should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D, and increasing it to 1000 IU/d may provide additional health benefits. Children 1 year and older should take at least 400 IU/d of vitamin D as recently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, but they should consider increasing intake up to 2000 IU/d derive maximum health benefits from vitamin D. Prepubertal and teenage girls who received 2000 IU of vitamin D per day for a year showed improvement in their musculoskeletal health with no untoward toxicity. All adults should be taking 2000 IU of vitamin D per day. A recent study reported that adults who took 50,000 IU of vitamin D once every 2 weeks, which is equivalent to taking 3000 IU of vitamin D a day, for up to 6 years was effective in maintaining blood levels of 25(OH)D of between 40 and 60 ng/mL without any toxicity. There is no downside to increasing either a child's or adult's vitamin D intake, with the exception of acquired disorders such as granulomatous diseases including sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, as well as some lymphomas with activated macrophages that produce 1,25(OH)2D3 in an unregulated fashion.

### Vitamin D in the healthy European paediatric population [^113ATw2N]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

In recent years, reports suggesting a resurgence of vitamin D deficiency in the Western world, combined with various proposed health benefits for vitamin D supplementation, have resulted in increased interest from health care professionals, the media, and the public. The aim of this position paper is to summarise the published data on vitamin D intake and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the healthy European paediatric population, to discuss the health benefits of vitamin D and to provide recommendations for the prevention of vitamin D deficiency in this population. Vitamin D plays a key role in calcium and phosphate metabolism and is essential for bone health. There is insufficient evidence from interventional studies to support vitamin D supplementation for other health benefits in infants, children, and adolescents. The pragmatic use of a serum concentration > 50 nmol/L to indicate sufficiency and a serum concentration < 25 nmol/L to indicate severe deficiency is recommended. Vitamin D deficiency occurs commonly among healthy European infants, children, and adolescents, especially in certain risk groups, including breast-fed infants, not adhering to the present recommendation for vitamin D supplementation, children and adolescents with dark skin living in northern countries, children and adolescents without adequate sun exposure, and obese children. Infants should receive an oral supplementation of 400 IU/day of vitamin D. The implementation should be promoted and supervised by paediatricians and other health care professionals. Healthy children and adolescents should be encouraged to follow a healthy lifestyle associated with a normal body mass index, including a varied diet with vitamin D-containing foods (fish, eggs, dairy products) and adequate outdoor activities with associated sun exposure. For children in risk groups identified above, an oral supplementation of vitamin D must be considered beyond 1 year of age. National authorities should adopt policies aimed at improving vitamin D status using measures such as dietary recommendations, food fortification, vitamin D supplementation, and judicious sun exposure, depending on local circumstances.

### Prevalence and risk factors for vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency at birth and associated outcome [^116qij2h]. BMC Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

We found that up to 45% infants are at risk for deficient and 35% for insufficient levels of vitamin D. The approximated probability of an infant being born with a sufficient vitamin D level as defined by the AAP for children is less than 40%. Importantly, the upper limit of vitamin D that is defined as sufficient could be suboptimal because vitamin D levels of < 30 ng/mL have been associated with increased secretion of intact parathyroid hormone and reduced intestinal calcium absorption in healthy adults. While a vitamin D level of 20 ng/mL is considered sufficient, maintenance of 30 ng/mL is recommended for better health in children and adults despite the lack of clear evidence of an optimal concentration of vitamin D for bone and general health. Because the main source of vitamin D is vitamin D 3 that is synthesized in the skin through a photolytic reaction, the level of vitamin D depends on skin pigmentation, use of sunscreens, coverage of sun-exposed skin, seasonal factors, and geographic latitude.

### Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy and lactation and infant growth [^114YK4vV]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

There was no clear evidence of other health benefits of improved vitamin D status in the latter half of pregnancy or early infancy. In particular, purported effects of vitamin D on preterm birthwere not substantiated, consistent with a recent meta-analysis. Published prenatal vitamin D trials in high-income countries have been limited by the inclusion of few (if any) women with vitamin D deficiency and the lack of a placebo (no vitamin D) group. MDIG had several advantages: most participants were vitamin D deficient at enrolment; true placebo control group; excellent adherence; robust dose-response effect on vitamin D status across a wide dose range up to the tolerable upper intake level (4000 IU/day); rigorous anthropometric and clinical data collection; and, high retention rates.

The surprising lack of any demonstrable adverse effects of maternal vitamin D deficiency on infant outcomes underscored the uncertainties about vitamin D requirements in pregnancy and lactation. The dose equivalent to the Institute of Medicine recommended dietary allowance(4200 IU/week) was sufficient for eliminating maternal vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L) without elevating 25(OH)D above a conservative long-term risk threshold (125 nmol/L). However, 16800 IU/week prevented maternal vitamin D deficiency at the < 50 nmol/L cut-off, maximally suppressed maternal iPTH, and prevented cord 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/L. Maternal postpartum supplementation (28000 IU/week) maintained infant 25(OH)D above 30 nmol/L up to 6 months of age, despite variability in feeding patterns. The occurrence of four cases of rickets in the placebo and 4200;0 groups was consistent with a plausible effect of 16800 IU/week or higher prenatally in the prevention of early rickets, but the incidence of x- ray-confirmed rickets was too low to be conclusive. Ongoing analyses of infant acute respiratory infectionsand other proposed follow-up studies of the MDIG cohort may provide additional insights into longer-term effects of maternal vitamin D supplementation on child health (e.g. asthma, bone mass).

### Vitamin D requirements during lactation: high-dose maternal supplementation as therapy to prevent hypovitaminosis D for both the mother and the nursing infant [^116LwT71]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2004). Low credibility.

Scientific data pertaining to vitamin D supplementation during lactation are scarce. The daily recommended intake for vitamin D during lactation has been arbitrarily set at 400 IU/d (10 microg/d). This recommendation is irrelevant with respect to maintaining the nutritional vitamin D status of mothers and nursing infants, especially among darkly pigmented individuals. Our objective was to examine the effect of high-dose maternal vitamin D2 supplementation on the nutritional vitamin D status of mothers and nursing infants. Fully lactating women (n = 18) were enrolled at 1 mo after birth to 1 of 2 treatment arms, ie, 1600 IU vitamin D2 and 400 IU vitamin D3 (prenatal vitamin) or 3600 IU vitamin D2 and 400 IU vitamin D3, for a 3-mo study period. High-dose (1600 or 3600 IU/d) vitamin D2 supplementation for a period of 3 mo safely increased circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations for both groups. The antirachitic activity of milk from mothers receiving 2000 IU/d vitamin D increased by 34.2 IU/L, on average, whereas the activity in the 4000 IU/d group increased by 94.2 IU/L. Nursing infant circulating 25(OH)D2 concentrations reflected maternal intake and the amount contained in the milk. With limited sun exposure, an intake of 400 IU/d vitamin D would not sustain circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and thus would supply only limited amounts of vitamin D to nursing infants in breast milk. A maternal intake of 2000 IU/d vitamin D would elevate circulating 25(OH)D concentrations for both mothers and nursing infants, albeit with limited capacity, especially with respect to nursing infants. A maternal intake of 4000 IU/d could achieve substantial progress toward improving both maternal and neonatal nutritional vitamin D status.

### Vitamin D prophylaxis in infancy [^113yBBWh]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Introduction

The World Health Organization (WHO) European Region is developing a new pocket book for primary health care for children and adolescents in Europe. This article is part of a series of reviews, which aim to summarize the existing recommendations and the most recent evidence on preventive interventions applied to children under 5 years of age to inform the WHO editorial group to make recommendations for health promotion in primary health care. In this article, we looked at existing recommendations and supporting evidence on the effectiveness of vitamin D supplementation in reducing vitamin D deficiency and in preventing rickets and infections.

Why is vitamin D important?

Vitamin D is essential in the metabolism of calcium and phosphate, skeletal growth and bone health, but is also involved in other functions such as the modulation of the function of activated B and T lymphocytes, insulin production, the secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone and myocardial contractility.

Context

Vitamin D from the diet is limited, the main natural source of vitamin D being from the action of the sunlight on the skin. However, several factors such as cultural practices and sun protection for prevention of cancer has conditioned vitamin D deficiency and rickets to reappear as a global health problem. Low concentration of vitamin D in breast milk, and the recommendation of keeping newborns and infants out of direct sun exposure are all factors that contribute to the risk of vitamin D deficiency in infants. Vitamin D deficiency is usually defined as serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D lower than 50 nmol/l (equivalent to 20 ng/ml), while serum levels superior to 75 nmol/l (equivalent to 30 ng/ml) ensure adequate metabolic demands and health.

### New World Health Organization recommendations for care of preterm or low birth weight infants: health policy [^116XiikS]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A conditional recommendation based on low-certainty evidence was also made that enteral vitamin D supplementation may be considered for human milk fed preterm or LBW infants who are not receiving vitamin D from another source. Evidence review indicated that there were small benefits of decreased bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 2 months and decreased developmental delay at 2 years (very low certainty evidence) and increased weight and length at 6 months (moderate certainty evidence). Evidence was uncertain for mortality (low certainty evidence). It was suggested that a daily dose of 400–800 IU could be initiated when enteral feeds are fully established and continued until the infant receives vitamin D from another source.

Enteral vitamin A supplementation was recommended conditionally, based on low certainty evidence, and may be considered for human milk fed preterm or LBW infants < 32 weeks gestation or < 1.5 kg at birth who are not receiving vitamin A from another source. Evidence showed small benefit of decreased mortality, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and patent ductus arteriosus (low certainty evidence), as well as retinopathy of prematurity (very low certainty evidence), with no evidence of harm. The GDG suggested that a daily dose of 1000–5000 IU be initiated when enteral feeds are fully established and continued until the infant receives vitamin A from another source.

No recommendation was made for calcium and phosphorus supplementation or for multiple micronutrient supplementation, as there was insufficient evidence for preterm or LBW infants.

Management of complications

Among interventions for management of complications in preterm or LBW infants, two respiratory interventions were prioritised: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for respiratory distress and methylxanthines for apnoea (Table 2). Recommendations for other interventions were maintained unchanged (Table 2).

Children and adolescents aged 1 to 18 years — We suggest empiric vitamin D supplementation to prevent nutritional rickets and potentially lower the risk of respiratory tract infections (2 | ⊕⊕◯◯). Empiric vitamin D may include daily intake of fortified foods, vitamin formulations that contain vitamin D, and/or daily intake of a vitamin D supplement (pill or drops), and in trials vitamin D dosages ranged from 300 to 2000 IU (7.5 to 50 μg) daily equivalent with an estimated weighted average of approximately 1200 IU (30 μg) per day.

### Why the IOM recommendations for vitamin D are deficient [^116s7MJA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2011). Low credibility.

The IOM recommendations for vitamin D fail in a major way on logic, on science, and on effective public health guidance. Moreover, by failing to use a physiological referent, the IOM approach constitutes precisely the wrong model for development of nutritional policy.

### Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy: state of the evidence from a systematic review of randomised trials [^114EVEwy]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Objectives To estimate the effects of vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy on 11 maternal and 27 neonatal/infant outcomes; to determine frequencies at which trial outcome data were missing, unreported, or inconsistently reported; and to project the potential contributions of registered ongoing or planned trials. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials; systematic review of registered but unpublished trials. Data sources Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to September 2017; manual searches of reference lists of systematic reviews identified in the electronic search; and online trial registries for unpublished, ongoing, or planned trials. Eligibility criteria for study selection Trials of prenatal vitamin D supplementation with randomised allocation and control groups administered placebo, no vitamin D, or vitamin D ≤ 600 IU/day (or its equivalent), and published in a peer reviewed journal. Results 43 trials (8406 participants) were eligible for meta-analyses. Median sample size was 133 participants. Vitamin D increased maternal/cord serum concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, but the dose-response effect was weak. Maternal clinical outcomes were rarely ascertained or reported, but available data did not provide evidence of benefits. Overall, vitamin D increased mean birth weight of 58.33 g (95% confidence interval 18.88 g to 97.78 g; 37 comparisons) and reduced the risk of small for gestational age births (risk ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.90; seven comparisons), but findings were not robust in sensitivity and subgroup analyses. There was no effect on preterm birth (1.0, 0.77 to 1.30; 15 comparisons). There was strong evidence that prenatal vitamin D reduced the risk of offspring wheeze by age 3 years (0.81, 0.67 to 0.98; two comparisons). For most outcomes, meta-analyses included data from a minority of trials. Only eight of 43 trials (19%) had an overall low risk of bias. Thirty five planned/ongoing randomised controlled trials could contribute 12530 additional participants to future reviews. Conclusions Most trials on prenatal vitamin D published by September 2017 were small and of low quality. The evidence to date seems insufficient to guide clinical or policy recommendations. Future trials should be designed and powered to examine clinical endpoints, including maternal conditions related to pregnancy (such as pre-eclampsia), infant growth, and respiratory outcomes.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^112isUUE]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Daily supplementation

From a physiological perspective, daily administration of cholecalciferol seems to be most natural. Indeed, it appears that a daily approach results in higher efficacy in terms of 25(OH)D exposure and extraskeletal benefits.

In a recent RCT comparing 3 different dosing regimens in vitamin D–deficient participants with similar total end-of-study cumulative doses (D 3 daily 10 000 IU 8 weeks, then 1000 IU for 4 weeks; 50 000 IU weekly for 12 weeks; and 100 000 IU every 2 weeks for 12 weeks), the group receiving the daily supplementation was the quickest to reach sufficiency (< 2 weeks, although receiving a higher cumulative dose in the first 8 weeks when compared to the other 2 arms) and reached the highest serum 25(OH)D levels. Importantly, daily administration was associated with higher systemic exposure to 25(OH)D (greater area under the curve, +23% and +27% compared to weekly and biweekly administration, respectively), even when corrected for the cumulative dose. The greater 25(OH)D exposure of daily regimens could be due to lower activation of the 24-hydroxylase enzyme (CYP24A1). In an RCT of lactating women comparing the effect of bolus (150 000 IU) vs daily vitamin D 3 dosing (5000 IU) on vitamin D 3 catabolism, a single high-bolus dose of vitamin D led to greater production of 24,25(OH) 2 D 3, relative to the 25(OH)D 3 value than did daily vitamin D supplementation, with this effect persisting for at least 28 days after supplementation. The greater therapeutic potential of daily regimens compared to other regimens might be less relevant at lower doses (≤ 2000 IU). Two studies comparing 2000 IU/day vs 50 000 IU/month and 800 IU/day vs 5600 IU/month found no statistically significant differences in the 2 areas under the curves.

### ABM clinical protocol # 29: iron, zinc, and vitamin D supplementation during breastfeeding [^113prH21]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D supplementation — breastfed infant dosing and maternal alternatives — is specified as follows: The breastfed infant should receive vitamin D supplementation for a year, beginning shortly after birth in doses of 10–20 μg/day (400–800 IU/day) (LOE IB). This supplement should be cholecalciferol, vitamin D3, because of superior absorption unless a vegetable source such as ergocalciferol vitamin D2, is desired (LOE II). Randomized trials demonstrate that safe vitamin D supplementation may be provided to a nursing mother to achieve healthy vitamin D status in her breastfeeding infant, when there is objection or contraindication to direct infant supplementation, with current studies pointing to 160 μg/day (6,400 IU/day) for 7 months and 125 μg/day (5,000 IU/day) for 28 days or 3,750 μg (150,000 IU) in a single dose (lasting at least 28 days) as appropriate to achieve 25(OH)D status in the normal range for both mother and infant (LOE IB). Vitamin D supplementation recommendations are based on the amount of supplementation needed to achieve an infant 25(OH)D > 50 nmol/L, and currently, the 25(OH)D status associated with toxicity is not defined.

### Coverage of vitamin D supplementation for infants… [^1154bAPH]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Given the health risks associated with vitamin D deficiency, the American Academy of Family Physicians supports coverage of vitamin D supplementation by third party payers. Vitamin D deficiency, including cases of rickets, continues to be diagnosed in infants in the United States. Human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. Therefore, the AAFP recommends that infants fed human milk whether exclusive or partial) receive 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation daily starting soon after birth until one year of age. Formula-taking infants should receive vitamin D supplementation until they are taking in more than 32 ounces of formula per day.
