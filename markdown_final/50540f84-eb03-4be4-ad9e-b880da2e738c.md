## Question

What dose and course of steroids would be used to treat this

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what dose and course of steroids should be used to treat brain metastases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether steroids are indicated. Then, I should verify the choice of steroid and why dexamethasone is preferred. Next, I will stratify dosing by symptom severity and mass effect. After that, I need to check the duration and taper strategy, including when tapering is unnecessary. Finally, I will consider monitoring, adverse effect mitigation, and special scenarios like immune-related adverse events and adrenal insufficiency risk, and I will close with a concise, practical summary anchored to guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and indication. Steroids are not routinely indicated for asymptomatic brain metastases without mass effect; they are reserved for symptomatic patients with edema and increased intracranial pressure, where they provide temporary symptomatic relief while definitive therapy is planned, so I need to ensure there is a clear indication before prescribing anything [^112dT19n] [^11475Svv].

> I will now examine the choice of steroid. Dexamethasone is the preferred agent because of its long half-life, high glucocorticoid potency, and minimal mineralocorticoid activity, which reduces fluid retention and hypertension compared with alternatives; this pharmacologic profile supports once- or twice-daily dosing and sustained control of vasogenic edema, so dexamethasone is the right starting point here [^112dT19n] [^11475Svv].

> Next, I should review dose stratification by symptom severity and mass effect. For mild symptoms attributable to mass effect, a starting dose of 4–8 mg/day of dexamethasone is recommended; for moderate to severe symptoms or signs of raised intracranial pressure, higher doses such as 16 mg/day or more are reasonable, with some centers using up to 24 mg/day in severe cases; wait, let me verify the upper bound — while 16 mg/day is the guideline minimum for severe symptoms, expert practice often extends to 24 mg/day in life-threatening herniation risk, but I should acknowledge that higher doses increase toxicity and should be used only when clearly indicated [^112dT19n] [^11475Svv].

> Hold on, I should verify the dosing frequency and split. Although dexamethasone's long half-life allows once-daily dosing, many clinicians divide the total dose twice daily to mitigate peaks and troughs in symptom control, especially at higher doses; the guidelines do not mandate a specific split, so I should individualize based on response and tolerability while staying within the recommended total daily ranges [^111j5PzE].

> Now, I need to check duration and tapering. The principle is to use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, then taper slowly; for courses under 3–4 weeks, abrupt discontinuation is acceptable because HPA axis suppression risk is low, but for longer courses or higher cumulative exposure, a gradual taper is prudent; typical practice is to taper over about 2 weeks, adjusting to clinical response, and in symptomatic patients or those on prolonged therapy, longer tapers may be needed to avoid rebound edema or withdrawal symptoms [^11475Svv] [^113QLgrN] [^114DSdhQ].

> Wait, let me verify the taper mechanics. A practical approach is to reduce the total daily dose by roughly 50% every 3–4 days while monitoring neurologic status, then slow the decrement as the dose approaches physiologic ranges; if symptoms recur, I should step back up to the last effective dose and extend the taper; I should also remember that for short-term use, no taper is required, which can simplify care when the course is limited to under 3–4 weeks [^113QLgrN].

> I should confirm monitoring priorities. Daily assessment of neurologic status, headache, nausea, visual symptoms, and gait is essential; I also need to monitor for steroid toxicities including hyperglycemia, hypertension, mood changes, insomnia, dyspepsia, infection risk, and proximal myopathy, and I should proactively mitigate risks with gastric protection, glycemic screening, and fall precautions as indicated; if prolonged therapy is anticipated, bone protection and opportunistic infection prophylaxis should be considered in line with oncologic steroid safety principles [^1176Pv9S] [^1172VX2H].

> But wait, what if the patient is on immune checkpoint inhibitors with an immune-related adverse event affecting the brain or meninges. In that scenario, steroid management follows irAE principles: use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, taper slowly over 4–6 weeks when treatment extends beyond a couple of weeks, and consider physiologic hydrocortisone bridging when tapering below 5 mg prednisone or 0.5 mg dexamethasone if HPA suppression is a concern; I need to ensure I am not inadvertently compromising antitumor efficacy by prolonging high-dose steroids without indication [^1172VX2H] [^114YTyrW].

> I should double-check adrenal insufficiency considerations. Supraphysiologic exposure beyond about 3–4 weeks can suppress the HPA axis; if therapy extends that long, I should plan a taper and, when approaching physiologic doses, consider morning cortisol testing to guide completion of the taper; if the patient becomes unstable during taper, I must consider steroid withdrawal syndrome and adjust the pace accordingly, recognizing that recovery of HPA function is variable and individualized [^113Pu83V] [^114DSdhQ].

> Let me reconsider the practical summary to ensure internal consistency. For symptomatic brain metastases with mass effect, start dexamethasone 4–8 mg/day for mild symptoms or 16–24 mg/day for moderate to severe symptoms, divide twice daily if needed, reassess within 24–72 hours, and taper as soon as clinically feasible; if the total course is under 3–4 weeks, abrupt discontinuation is acceptable, but for longer courses, taper over about 2 weeks or more based on response; throughout, monitor neurologic status and steroid toxicities, and escalate definitive therapy such as radiotherapy or surgery as indicated to minimize steroid exposure [^112dT19n] [^113QLgrN] [^1176Pv9S].

---

For brain metastases, **dexamethasone is first-line** [^112dT19n] to reduce vasogenic edema and intracranial pressure [^11475Svv]. Use **4–8 mg/day for mild symptoms** and **16 mg/day or more for moderate–severe symptoms** or impending herniation, divided every 6–12 hours. Taper over 2 weeks or longer if clinically needed, and avoid routine steroids in asymptomatic patients without mass effect [^11475Svv] [^111j5PzE]. Monitor for hyperglycemia, infection, psychiatric effects, and GI bleeding; provide GI prophylaxis and manage comorbidities [^1176Pv9S] [^1172VX2H].

## Indications for steroid use in brain metastases

Steroids are indicated to provide **temporary symptomatic relief** from increased intracranial pressure and edema secondary to brain metastases [^112dT19n]. They are not recommended for **asymptomatic patients without mass effect**, as the risks outweigh the benefits [^111j5PzE].

---

## Choice of steroid

Dexamethasone is the **preferred steroid** [^112dT19n] due to its long half-life, minimal mineralocorticoid activity, and strong anti-inflammatory effects [^111j5PzE].

---

## Recommended dosing regimen

The recommended dosing regimen varies with symptom severity and mass effect:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended dexamethasone dose** |
|-|-|
| Mild symptoms (minimal mass effect) | 4–8 mg/day orally, divided every 12 hours [^112dT19n] |
| Moderate to severe symptoms or impending herniation | 16 mg/day or more orally, divided every 6–12 hours [^112dT19n] [^11475Svv] |

---

## Duration and tapering of steroid therapy

Steroids should be tapered as rapidly as clinically tolerated, but no faster than clinically tolerated [^112dT19n]. A typical taper involves reducing the dose by **50% every 3–4 days** [^114DSdhQ] until the lowest effective dose is reached, then discontinuing if clinically feasible. For short-term use (< 3–4 weeks), abrupt cessation is acceptable [^113QLgrN]; for longer courses, taper over 2 weeks or more to avoid withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency [^11475Svv].

---

## Monitoring and management of steroid-related side effects

Steroid therapy carries significant side effects, including:

- Hyperglycemia
- Hypertension
- Increased infection risk
- Psychiatric disturbances
- Gastrointestinal bleeding
- Osteoporosis
- Adrenal suppression

Regular monitoring and proactive management are essential [^1176Pv9S]. Provide **GI prophylaxis** (e.g. proton pump inhibitors), monitor glucose, and assess for infections and psychiatric symptoms [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Immune checkpoint inhibitors**: Steroids may blunt immunotherapy efficacy; use the lowest effective dose and taper promptly [^1172VX2H].
- **Radiation therapy**: Steroids are often continued during whole-brain radiation, with tapering after completion based on clinical response.
- **Surgery**: Perioperative steroids are commonly used, with tapering postoperatively as clinically indicated.

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Indication**: Symptomatic brain metastases with mass effect or edema [^112dT19n].
- **Choice**: Dexamethasone [^112dT19n].
- **Dose**: 4–8 mg/day for mild symptoms; 16 mg/day or more for moderate–severe symptoms or impending herniation [^112dT19n] [^11475Svv].
- **Duration**: Shortest effective course, typically 1–2 weeks, with tapering as tolerated [^112dT19n].
- **Monitoring**: Regular assessment of neurologic status, glucose, blood pressure, infection, and psychiatric symptoms [^1176Pv9S].

---

Steroids are a cornerstone for managing symptomatic brain metastases, providing rapid relief of edema and intracranial pressure. Use the **lowest effective dose**, taper appropriately, and monitor closely for side effects.

Do steroids improve neurologic symptoms in patients with metastatic brain tumors compared to no treatment? If steroids are given, what dose should be used? Comparisons include: (1) steroid therapy versus none. (2) comparison of different doses of steroid therapy.

Target Population

These recommendations apply to adults diagnosed with brain metastases.

Recommendations

Steroid therapy versus no steroid therapy Asymptomatic brain metastases patients without mass effect Insufficient evidence exists to make a treatment recommendation for this clinical scenario. Brain metastases patients with mild symptoms related to mass effect Level 3 Corticosteroids are recommended to provide temporary symptomatic relief of symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and edema secondary to brain metastases. It is recommended for patients who are symptomatic from metastatic disease to the brain that a starting dose of 4–8 mg/day of dexamethasone be considered. Brain metastases patients with moderate to severe symptoms related to mass effect Level 3 Corticosteroids are recommended to provide temporary symptomatic relief of symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and edema secondary to brain metastases. If patients exhibit severe symptoms consistent with increased intracranial pressure, it is recommended that higher doses such as 16 mg/day or more be considered. Choice of Steroid Level 3 If corticosteroids are given, dexamethasone is the best drug choice given the available evidence. Duration of Corticosteroid Administration Level 3 Corticosteroids, if given, should be tapered slowly over a 2 week time period, or longer in symptomatic patients, based upon an individualized treatment regimen and a full understanding of the long-term sequelae of corticosteroid therapy. Given the very limited number of studies (two) which met the eligibility criteria for the systematic review, these are the only recommendations that can be offered based on this methodology.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^1172VX2H]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Steroid-related adverse effects during immune-related adverse event (irAE) management — general principles: Steroids remain the most studied and valuable agents in the management of immunotherapy-related AEs, but higher steroid doses may be necessary and use is often prolonged, placing patients at significant risk for acute and long-term toxicities. Evaluation of the patient's pre‑existing conditions and careful monitoring of steroid-related complications is crucial, and prophylactic agents to prevent certain opportunistic infections along with preemptive measures to mitigate various toxicities are necessary for patients needing longer‑term steroid use. The lowest possible dose of steroids should be used for the shortest possible duration, steroid tapers should be gradual and individualized based on the irAE's response and the patient's ability to tolerate steroids, and certain patients such as those with diabetes mellitus, an immune‑compromised state, and the elderly will need special attention. A multidisciplinary approach may be used for certain steroid‑related complications, institutional guidelines should be considered in decision making, and readers are directed to Table 12 for a complete set of recommendations for prevention and management of AEs related to steroid use.

### An international consensus on appropriate management of corticosteroids in clinical trials in inflammatory bowel disease [^1121earM]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Approval of new therapies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) requires rigorously designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Corticosteroids remain a cornerstone of IBD induction therapy and many patients in trials are enrolled while taking corticosteroids. Despite this, approaches to corticosteroid management in RCTs have been highly heterogeneous, often differing from clinical practice. This negatively impacts patients' willingness to participate due to prolonged corticosteroid exposure and may potentially bias outcomes in the clinical trial. Our aim is to provide comprehensive standardized recommendations on key aspects of corticosteroid use in IBD clinical trials through a multi-phase, international expert consensus, with a goal to help inform and standardize practice in future RCTs.

Methods

The consensus was informed by a systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, which determined the corticosteroid management rules used in placebo-controlled trials of advanced therapies in IBD. International expert consensus recommendations for all aspects of corticosteroid management in RCTs were then developed using a modified Delphi process with two rounds of survey questions and a ratification meeting.

Results

These recommendations propose management of corticosteroids during screening, induction, and maintenance phases of pharmacologic trials in IBD, and define corticosteroid-related endpoints. We emphasize the need for minimizing corticosteroid exposure through expedited tapering and shorter fixed-dosing periods that more closely reflect clinical care, and provide recommendations for standardized definitions of corticosteroid-free remission.

Conclusions

These recommendations will serve to optimize trial design and facilitate appropriate, acceptable, and standardized RCT corticosteroid handling practices.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115NiiPm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary of Recommendations

The recommendations are worded as recommend (strong recommendation) and suggest (weak recommendation). The quality of evidence behind the recommendations is classified as very low (⊕○○○), low (⊕⊕○○), moderate (⊕⊕⊕○), and strong (⊕⊕⊕⊕). Recommendations that were based on good clinical practice and experience of the working group members are not formally graded but acknowledged in the guideline as "good clinical practice". Recommendations that were neither based on evidence or good clinical practice, are not graded at all (also see "Methods" section).

1. General recommendations for glucocorticoid therapy of non-endocrine conditions and recommendations regarding patient education R 1.1 — We recommend that, in general, patients on, or tapering off glucocorticoids for non-endocrine conditions do not need to be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice) R 1.3 — We recommend that patients on glucocorticoid therapy have access to current up-to-date and appropriate information about different endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)
2. Recommendations regarding taper of systemic glucocorticoid therapy for non-endocrine conditions, diagnosis and approach to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome R 2.1 — We suggest not to taper glucocorticoids in patients on short-term glucocorticoid therapy of < 3–4 weeks, irrespective of the dose. In these cases, glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing due to low concern for HPA axis suppression. (⊕○○○) R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice) R 2.3 — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper. When glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is severe, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. (Good clinical practice) R 2.4 — We recommend against routine testing for adrenal insufficiency in patients on supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids, or if they are still in need of glucocorticoid treatment for the underlying disease. (Good clinical practice) R 2.5 — We suggest that patients taking long-acting glucocorticoids (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) should be switched to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting glucocorticoids are no longer needed. (⊕○○○) R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○) R 2.7 — If confirmation of recovery of the HPA axis is desired, we recommend morning serum cortisol as the first test. The value of morning serum cortisol should be considered as a continuum, with higher values more indicative of HPA axis recovery. (⊕○○○) As a guide: 1.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that the test indicates recovery of the HPA axis if cortisol is > 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL and glucocorticoids can be stopped safely; 2.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is between 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL and 300 nmol/L or 10 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after an appropriate time period (usually weeks to months); 3.000000000000000e+00 we suggest that if the result is < 150 nmol/L or 5 μg/dL, the physiologic glucocorticoid dose should be continued, and the morning cortisol repeated after a few months. R 2.8 — We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy. (⊕○○○) R 2.9 — We suggest awareness of possible glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency in patients: 1.000000000000000e+00 with current or recent use of non-oral glucocorticoid formulations presenting with signs and symptoms indicative of adrenal insufficiency, or 2.000000000000000e+00 using multiple glucocorticoid formulations simultaneously, or 3.000000000000000e+00 using high-dose inhaled or topical glucocorticoids, or 4.000000000000000e+00 using inhaled or topical glucocorticoids for > 1 year, or 5.000000000000000e+00 who received intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in the previous 2 months, or 6.000000000000000e+00 receiving concomitant treatment with strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors. R 2.10 — We suggest that patients with current or previous glucocorticoid treatment presenting with signs and symptoms of exogenous Cushing syndrome are assumed to have glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. (Good clinical practice) R 2.11 — We suggest that patients aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids, but without recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent, should be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. We suggest that patients on glucocorticoids and history of adrenal crisis should also be evaluated by an endocrinology specialist. (Good clinical practice) R 2.12 — We recommend against the use of fludrocortisone in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency.
3. Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy of adrenal crisis in patients with glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency R 3.1 — We recommend that patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency should receive stress dose coverage when they are exposed to stress. (Good clinical practice) R3.1A — Oral glucocorticoids should be used in case of minor stress and when there are no signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R3.1B — Parenteral glucocorticoids should be used in case of moderate to major stress, procedures under general or regional anesthesia, procedures requiring prolonged avoidance or inability of oral intake, or when there are signs of hemodynamic instability or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea. R 3.2 — We suggest that in patients with current or recent glucocorticoid use who did not undergo biochemical testing to rule out glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency and present with hemodynamic instability, vomiting, or diarrhea, the diagnosis of adrenal crisis should be considered irrespective of the glucocorticoid type, mode of administration, and dose; patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be treated with parenteral glucocorticoids and fluid resuscitation. (Good clinical practice)

### Different oral corticosteroid regimens for acute asthma [^115paH13]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Asthma is a common long-term breathing condition that affects approximately 300 million people worldwide. People with asthma may experience short-term worsening of their asthma symptoms; these episodes are often known as 'exacerbations', 'flare-ups', 'attacks' or 'acute asthma'. Oral steroids, which have a potent anti-inflammatory effect, are recommended for all but the most mild asthma exacerbations; they should be initiated promptly. The most often prescribed oral steroids are prednisolone and dexamethasone, but current guidelines on dosing vary between countries, and often among different guideline producers within the same country. Despite their proven efficacy, use of steroids needs to be balanced against their potential to cause important adverse events. Evidence is somewhat limited regarding optimal dosing of oral steroids for asthma exacerbations to maximise recovery while minimising potential side effects, which is the topic of this review.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and safety of any dose or duration of oral steroids versus any other dose or duration of oral steroids for adults and children with an asthma exacerbation.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR), ClinicalTrials.gov (www. ClinicalTrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (www.who.int/ictrp/en/) and reference lists of all primary studies and review articles. This search was up to date as of April 2016.

Selection Criteria

We included parallel randomised controlled trials (RCTs), irrespective of blinding or duration, that evaluated one dose or duration of oral steroid versus any other dose or duration, for management of asthma exacerbations. We included studies involving both adults and children with asthma of any severity, in which investigators analysed adults and children separately. We allowed any other co-intervention in the management of an asthma exacerbation, provided it was not part of the randomised treatment. We included studies reported as full text, those published as abstract only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results for included trials, extracted numerical data and assessed risk of bias; all data were cross-checked for accuracy. We resolved disagreements by discussion with the third review author or with an external advisor. We analysed dichotomous data as odds ratios (ORs) or risk differences (RDs) using study participants as the unit of analysis; we analysed continuous data as mean differences (MDs). We used a random-effects model, and we carried out a fixed-effect analysis if we detected statistical heterogeneity. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 18 studies that randomised a total of 2438 participants - both adults and children - and performed comparisons of interest. Included studies assessed higher versus lower doses of prednisolone (n = 4); longer versus shorter courses of prednisolone (n = 3) or dexamethasone (n = 1); tapered versus non-tapered courses of prednisolone (n = 4); and prednisolone versus dexamethasone (n = 6). Follow-up duration ranged from seven days to six months. The smallest study randomised just 15 participants, and the largest 638 (median 93). The varied interventions and outcomes reported limited the number of meaningful meta-analyses that we could perform. For two of our primary outcomes - hospital admission and serious adverse events - events were too infrequent to permit conclusions about the superiority of one treatment over the other, or their equivalence. Researchers in the included studies reported asthma symptoms in different ways and rarely used validated scales, again limiting our conclusions. Secondary outcome meta-analysis was similarly hampered by heterogeneity among interventions and outcome measures used. Overall, we found no convincing evidence of differences in outcomes between a higher dose or longer course and a lower dose or shorter course of prednisolone or dexamethasone, or between prednisolone and dexamethasone. Included studies were generally of reasonable methodological quality. Review authors assessed most outcomes in the review as having low or very low quality, meaning we are not confident in the effect estimates. The predominant reason for downgrading was imprecision, but indirectness and risk of bias also reduced our confidence in some estimates.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence is not strong enough to reveal whether shorter or lower-dose regimens are generally less effective than longer or higher-dose regimens, or indeed that the latter are associated with more adverse events. Any changes recommended for current practice should be supported by data from larger, well-designed trials. Varied study design and outcome measures limited the number of meta-analyses that we could perform. Greater emphasis on palatability and on whether some regimens might be easier to adhere to than others could better inform clinical decisions for individual patients.

### Use of glucocorticoids in patients with cancer: potential benefits, harms, and practical considerations for clinical practice [^1176Pv9S]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Glucocorticoids are commonly used in patients with cancer for symptom relief or as part of their anticancer treatment. Despite their frequent use, indications and dosing regimens are not exclusively evidence-based and can come with a multitude of adverse effects, some of which can be life-threatening. The objective of this review is to update our current state of knowledge on the use of glucocorticoids in adult patients with cancer.

Methods and Materials

A comprehensive literature review (1949–2022) was conducted using search terms "glucocorticoids", "corticosteroids", and "cancer". Information was organized by main concepts including indications, potential benefits, and prevention and management of common side effects of glucocorticoid therapy, in addition to appropriate dosing and taper regimens.

Results

Glucocorticoids can be highly effective in improving outcomes and quality of life in patients with cancer. Their uses include management of disease manifestations, symptoms, and complications of cancer treatment. The lowest effective dose should be used and treatment duration should be minimized as clinically feasible. Side effects can be minimized by careful monitoring, continued assessment of benefits versus harms, and preventative measures for expected side effects.

Conclusions

This review provides general principles and practical recommendations on the use of glucocorticoids in patients with cancer. Further prospective studies on the outcomes of patients on glucocorticoids may help guide practice.

### 2025 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^115LZtbv]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

2025 ACR guideline for SLE — glucocorticoid therapy principles and severe flare management states to use glucocorticoids promptly at the lowest dose and shortest duration, and for organ- or life-threatening SLE flares conditionally recommends pulse methylprednisolone with specified dosing followed by an oral taper rather than initiating with high-dose oral glucocorticoids alone. Intravenous glucocorticoids are noted to have a faster onset and are preferred for life- or organ-threatening manifestations in this context.

### Glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis: current status and future studies [^113eStFw]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

US recommendations

The 2015 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for early and established RA recommend adding GCs to DMARDs during disease flares, at the lowest dose and for the shortest period possible. In contrast to the European recommendations, adding GCs when a csDMARD is initiated depends on disease activity.

Taken together, these international recommendations agree on the use of GCs for disease flare and possibly at the start of a new csDMARD. Specific advice concerning dosage, duration, route of administration and strategies is limited and less consensual, because reliable and detailed evidence is scarce. For US recommendations, a dose < 10 mg/day is considered a low dose, and GCs should be tapered in less than 3 months, whereas for European recommendations, the threshold is 7.5 mg/day, and GCs could be prescribed in combination with csDMARDs for up to 6 months maximum, knowing that this duration is mainly expert-driven. Despite these differences, international guidelines underline the importance of GCs but also advocate the use of GCs at the lowest cumulative dose possible because of the high awareness of potentially associated adverse effects.

In these sets of recommendations as well as in this review, GCs dosages are expressed in prednisone equivalent.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115sWmpJ]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society guideline — clinical scope and tapering principles: Chronic glucocorticoid therapy results in "at least 1% of the population" using it and "being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency", and this risk "is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility". Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it "necessitates careful education and management of affected patients". Tapering "can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency", and "in general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly with a supraphysiological dosage range, followed by a slower taper when on physiologic glucocorticoid dosing". The "degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure" and "recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals".

### Steroids in immune checkpoint inhibitor myocarditis [^116wE1pz]. JACC: CardioOncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as essential cancer treatments with an increasing expansion in their indications. Despite the cancer therapeutic success of ICIs, a wide array of toxicities can occur in any organ system of the body, referred to as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These irAEs are thought to be secondary to the loss of self-tolerance leading to an autoimmune inflammatory response. Several cardiovascular irAEs have been described, including myocarditis and pericarditis. ICI myocarditis is uncommon with an incidence around 1% but has the highest reported irAE mortality, initially up to 50%. Given the high mortality, timely recognition and optimal treatment regimens are needed in addition to preventive therapies. At present, the mainstay of treatment for most irAEs, including ICI myocarditis, is steroids. The optimal dosing, duration, and timing of steroids recommended by expert consensus guidelines are based on limited evidence. This viewpoint discusses the evolving role of steroids in treating ICI myocarditis.

The emergence of irAEs from ICIs over the past 15 years has led to several medical professional societies publishing irAE treatment guidelines, largely based on expert consensus opinion without high level of evidence, and corticosteroids are the primary recommended treatment. However, given their adverse effects, nonsteroidal agents targeting specific immune pathways are increasingly being used for the treatment of ICI myocarditis. There are 4 key components of steroid therapy: dose, timing of initiation, duration of treatment, and consideration of additional or alternate nonsteroidal therapy.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^117Qjx3Q]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Prevention and management of adverse effects related to steroid use — pretreatment considerations emphasize baseline infection screening and optimization of comorbidities before starting glucocorticoids; dosing is individualized and the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration should be used given dose- and duration-dependent toxicity. Baseline workup includes viral hepatitis B and C serology and consideration for latent or active TB testing, and in pre-existing HIV, HIV viral load and CD4 count testing are appropriate; comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, cataract, glaucoma, infection, or osteoporosis should be optimally managed before steroids, and steroid dosing and duration vary by patient, oncologic agents, and type of immune-related adverse event (irAE).

### Prevention and management of glucocorticoid-induced side effects: a comprehensive review: a review of glucocorticoid pharmacology and bone health [^111JLQNH]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2017). Low credibility.

Systemic glucocorticoids are an essential therapy for a range of conditions, but their multiple side effects can produce significant morbidity for patients. The objective of this review is to discuss these side effects while addressing 3 questions: 1) What dose and duration of glucocorticoid therapy should prompt concern for individual side effects?; 2) How should clinicians counsel patients about these complications?; and 3) How can these problems be prevented or managed? To accomplish these objectives, we have created a series of tables and algorithms based on a review of relevant data to guide counseling, prophylaxis, and management of 11 glucocorticoid side effects. The first article in this 4-part continuing medical education series begins with a review of glucocorticoid pharmacology followed by a discussion of bone health (ie, osteoporosis and osteonecrosis).

Practical considerations

Figure 3 outlines the key practical issues for patients and clinicians discussing corticosteroid treatment for sepsis.

Fig 3
Practical issues about use of corticosteroids for treatment of sepsis

The optimal corticosteroid drug, dose, and duration of treatment are uncertain. Hydrocortisone was the most commonly used corticosteroid in the RCTs and is therefore a reasonable choice. Differences among corticosteroids, if they do exist, are probably small; dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisolone were also studied and produced similar results. Adding an agent that has additional mineralocorticoid activity, such as fludrocortisone, could be helpful, but that is highly speculative.

The typical hydrocortisone dose for an adult in the RCTs was 200–300 mg/day, given either as an infusion or as boluses every six hours. If an infusion is chosen, a bolus of 50–100 mg can be given before the infusion. In the RCTs the duration of treatment was typically 7–14 days, or less for those who were rapidly improving.

Inflammation may recur after discontinuing corticosteroid therapy, especially when it is stopped abruptly. Clinicians should carefully monitor all patients after discontinuing corticosteroids. In patients who deteriorate after stopping corticosteroids (such as development of shock or need for mechanical ventilation), reinitiating corticosteroid therapy could be helpful, although this is highly speculative. Whether corticosteroids should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly is unclear. Corticosteroid induced adrenal suppression is probably duration dependent, and so patients who receive longer courses of corticosteroids (such as > 14 days) might be particularly likely to benefit from a taper before discontinuing and an evaluation of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis function if in doubt.

Costs

Corticosteroids are typically inexpensive and widely available. The impact of corticosteroids on the overall costs to patients and to health systems is uncertain and would be driven mostly by ICU and hospital lengths of stay or prolonged periods of rehabilitation.

### Decreased mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients treated with corticosteroids: an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials with trial sequential analysis [^117U8fy6]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our meta-analysis indicated that glucocorticoid treatment might reduce overall mortality and duration of mechanical ventilation and improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS. Glucocorticoids might be recommended as an adjunct to standard care for ARDS; however, the optimal dose and duration of steroid therapy remains unknown and further studies are needed.

Glucocorticoids — DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity: Initiation of a csDMARD without short-term (< 3 months) glucocorticoids is conditionally recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with short-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity. Initiation of a csDMARD without longer-term (≥ 3 months) glucocorticoids is strongly recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with longer-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity. Treatment with glucocorticoids should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible.

### The role of steroids in the management of brain metastases: a systematic review and evidence-based clinical practice guideline [^111j5PzE]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Given the very limited number of studies that met the inclusion criteria for the systematic literature review on the role of steroids in metastatic brain disease, we are unable to propose specific guidelines on many of the issues of central interest to the treating physician.

In summarizing the Discussion section above we are able to offer the following observations: first, Overall the literature favors the position that corticosteroids are of benefit in providing temporary symptomatic relief of CNS symptoms related to increased intracranial pressure and edema secondary to brain metastases. Secondly, dexamethasone is the steroid most often used, with the rationale that it has limited mineralocorticoid effects. Other steroids have been used with similar reported clinical responses. Dosing has been recommended to be sufficient at twice daily although more frequent dosing has been suggested with increasing concern for raised intracranial pressure and impending herniation. Finally, based primarily on the asymptomatic patients in the study by Hempen et al. it is the opinion offered in the available studies that asymptomatic patients do not require steroids. Numerous authors cite concerns for the toxicity of steroid therapy and due to the lack of a uniform recommendation on dosing and the apparent complexity of the response in individual patients it has been recommended that dose reduction be considered within 1 week of initiation of treatment. The dose reduction appears to often require alteration in individual patients due to the diversity of response.

An interesting observation in the review of the literature on this subject is the number of authors who appear to assume that steroids are a mainstay of treatment for the patient with metastatic brain disease despite the relative lack of detailed information available to guide specific therapy. In general, the evidence for specific dosages and regimens of steroids are poorly detailed. On the other hand, there is very little information provided in the literature that suggests that steroids are of no benefit in this patient population with the exception of the asymptomatic patient.

Given the general consensus in the literature that steroids are of benefit in selected patients with metastatic brain disease and the frequent observation that dosing needs to be specifically tailored to the individual, it appears unlikely that in depth studies specifically addressing this issue will be forthcoming. However, the need for additional recommendations for dosing and duration of therapy may result in an increased awareness of this concern and potentially an alteration of clinical trials designed to address comparisons.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^111F5rZm]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

ICI-pneumonitis grade 2 or greater — treatment approach and unresolved issues — details that proposed treatments include ICI cessation, systemic corticosteroids, and variable recommendations for additional immune-suppressive medications; symptomatic disease management has centered on withholding the ICI agent, treating with systemic corticosteroids over 4 to 6 weeks, and adding immunosuppressive medications in refractory cases, yet the optimal timing, dose, and duration of corticosteroid therapy, as well as the optimal dose, duration, and type of immunosuppressive treatment for steroid-refractory disease, have not been defined; a "rebound" or "flare" of worsening pneumonitis after steroid discontinuation has been described with limited guidance for further therapy, and phenotypic, radiographic, or other diagnostic findings (such as BAL differential) may clarify response and should be evaluated for guiding treatment.

### Impact of corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^112RVta3]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Since its appearance in late 2019, infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have created unprecedented challenges for health systems worldwide. Multiple therapeutic options have been explored, including corticosteroids. Preliminary results of corticosteroids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are encouraging; however, the role of corticosteroids remains controversial.

Research Question

What is the impact of corticosteroids in mortality, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and viral shedding in COVID-19 patients?

Study Design and Methods

We conducted a systematic review of literature on corticosteroids and COVID-19 in major databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE) of published literature through July 22, 2020, that report outcomes of interest in COVID-19 patients receiving corticosteroids with a comparative group.

Results

A total of 73 studies with 21,350 COVID-19 patients were identified. Corticosteroid use was reported widely in mechanically ventilated patients (35.3%), ICU patients (51.3%), and severe COVID-19 patients (40%). Corticosteroids showed mortality benefit in severelly ill COVID-19 patients (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51–0.83; p = 0.0006); however, no beneficial or harmful effects were noted among high-dose or low-dose corticosteroid regimens. Emerging evidence shows that low-dose corticosteroids do not have a significant impact in the duration of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. The analysis was limited by highly heterogeneous literature for high-dose and low-dose corticosteroids regimens.

Interpretation

Our results showed evidence of mortality benefit in severely ill COVID-19 patients treated with corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are used widely in COVID-19 patients worldwide, and a rapidly developing global pandemic warrants further high-quality clinical trials to define the most beneficial timing and dosing for corticosteroids.

### Strategies for improving the management of immune-related adverse events [^112CRL1L]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Optimizing the choice of immunosuppressive agents

Current guidelinesrely heavily on the use of steroids for management of irAEs. The duration of steroid use and cumulative dose are usually much greater for management of irAEs compared with other clinical indications for corticosteroid use. However, long-term use of steroids gives rise to several concerns.

Though the recommendation is to continue steroids until resolution of an irAE to grade 1 or better and subsequently taper the dose over a period of 4–6 weeks, efficacy of long-term steroid use in management of irAEs has not been validated. In contrast, when oral methylprednisolone was used as a 5-day tapered dose pack (steroid burst) for mild irAEs, all patients had recurrent grade 2 irAEs. Thus, the optimal dose and duration of steroid use with minimal risk of side effects in the management of irAEs are unknown.
Long-term steroid use may be associated with other complications, such as gastritis, hypertension, new-onset hyperglycemia, and opportunistic infections (eg, pneumocystis pneumonia).

Intranasal steroids (INS) dosing and expected response — onset, duration, and use pattern: Onset of action starts at time points ranging from 3–5 hours to 36 hours after first dosing, and the continuous use of INS is recommended and more efficacious than intermittent use, although studies of as-needed use of intranasal fluticasone have shown that intermittent use is better than placebo; based on the available data, it is reasonable to assume that efficacy would be reached after 1 week of therapy at the most and, if none is observed, the treatment might be considered ineffective.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^112HtCuf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) should be treated with systemic corticosteroid for seven to 14 days. Intermittent systemic corticosteroid use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness. Shorter treatment could reduce adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of short-duration (seven or fewer days) and conventional longer-duration (longer than seven days) systemic corticosteroid treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD.

Search Methods

Searches were carried out using the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of Trials, MEDLINE and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) up to June 2014 and ongoing trials registers up to July 2014.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of systemic corticosteroid defined as short (i.e. seven or fewer days) or longer (i.e. longer than seven days). Other interventions-bronchodilators and antibiotics-were standardised. Studies with participants requiring assisted ventilation were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

Eight studies with 582 participants met the inclusion criteria, of which five studies conducted in hospitals with 519 participants (range 28 to 296) contributed to the meta-analysis. Mean ages of study participants were 65 to 73 years, the proportion of male participants varied (58% to 84%) and COPD was classified as severe or very severe. Corticosteroid treatment was given at equivalent daily doses for three to seven days for short-duration treatment and for 10 to 15 days for longer-duration treatment. Five studies administered oral prednisolone (30 mg in four, tapered in one), and two studies provided intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Studies contributing to the meta-analysis were at low risk of selection, performance, detection and attrition bias. In four studies we did not find a difference in risk of treatment failure between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; odds ratio (OR) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.36 to 1.46)), which was equivalent to 22 fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 51 fewer to 34 more). No difference in risk of relapse (a new event) was observed between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 457; OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.56), which was equivalent to nine fewer per 1000 for short-duration treatment (95% CI 68 fewer to 100 more). Time to the next COPD exacerbation did not differ in one large study that was powered to detect non-inferiority and compared five days versus 14 days of systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 311; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.37). In five studies no difference in the likelihood of an adverse event was found between short-duration and longer-duration systemic corticosteroid treatment (n = 503; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.69, or nine fewer per 1000 (95% CI 44 fewer to 51 more)). Length of hospital stay (n = 421; mean difference (MD) -0.61 days, 95% CI -1.51 to 0.28) and lung function at the end of treatment (n = 185; MD FEV1–0.04 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.10) did not differ between short-duration and longer-duration treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Information from a new large study has increased our confidence that five days of oral corticosteroids is likely to be sufficient for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD, and this review suggests that the likelihood is low that shorter courses of systemic corticosteroids (of around five days) lead to worse outcomes than are seen with longer (10 to 14 days) courses. We graded most available evidence as moderate in quality because of imprecision; further research may have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect or may change the estimates. The studies in this review did not include people with mild or moderate COPD; further studies comparing short-duration systemic corticosteroid versus conventional longer-duration systemic corticosteroid for treatment of adults with acute exacerbations of COPD are required.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^114Dh7TX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. This results in at least 1% of the population using chronic glucocorticoid therapy, being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. This risk is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility. Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it necessitates careful education and management of affected patients. Tapering glucocorticoids can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency. In general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly within a supraphysiological range, followed by a slower taper when on physiological glucocorticoid dosing. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. This first European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society joint clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid clinicians involved in the care of patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy.

### "Official view" on glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic review of international guidelines and consensus statements [^115EB1kk]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the perception of the current role of systemic glucocorticoids in the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by examining their importance and the current level of evidence in recent guidelines, and to identify open questions to be addressed in future guidelines and research projects.

Methods

We conducted a systematic literature review using the databases Ovid Embase, PubMed Medline, and Cochrane Library for guidelines on the pharmacologic treatment of RA. Retrieved articles were evaluated regarding their quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II tool and scrutinized for all relevant information concerning the use of glucocorticoids.

Results

All guidelines agree that glucocorticoids, especially if given at low doses and for a short duration, are an appropriate option in the treatment of RA. However, many recommendations remain vague, as reliable and detailed evidence is scarce. Important aspects of glucocorticoid therapy are partially or completely neglected, and the existing nomenclature is not used uniformly. Quality evaluation revealed flaws in many articles, concerning not only glucocorticoid-specific recommendations but also guideline quality in general.

Conclusion

Current recommendations for use of glucocorticoids in the management of RA are suboptimal. More rigorous evaluation of doses, timing, and duration of their use is needed. Existing nomenclature on glucocorticoid therapy should be used uniformly.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^111EEe41]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids — adult and pediatric dosing and duration for asthma exacerbations are specified: daily doses of oral corticosteroids (OCS) equivalent to 50 mg prednisolone as a single morning dose, or 200 mg hydrocortisone in divided doses are typically used for adults, and for children a prednisolone dose of 1–2 mg/kg up to a maximum of 40 mg/day is suggested; evidence does not demonstrate a benefit of intramuscular or intravenous over oral routes. For duration, 5- and 7-day courses in adults are as effective as 10- and 14-day courses respectively, and in most children a 3–5-day course is usually considered sufficient, and there is no benefit in tapering OCS either in the short term or over several weeks. Oral dexamethasone 12–16 mg given once daily for 1–2 days has similar relapse and adverse events to prednisolone for 3–5 days; in children, 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg once daily for 1–2 days shows no difference in relapse versus prednisolone/prednisone for 3–5 days, with better adherence and substantially lower risk of vomiting; oral dexamethasone should not be continued beyond 2 days, and if there is failure of resolution or relapse, consideration should be given to switching to prednisolone.

### Different durations of corticosteroid therapy for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^111mP5Fh]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend that acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) be treated with systemic corticosteroids (SCs) for seven to 14 days. Intermittent SC use is cumulatively associated with adverse effects such as osteoporosis, hyperglycaemia and muscle weakness. Shorter treatment could therefore reduce the risk of adverse effects.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of short-duration (seven days or fewer) and longer-duration (more than seven days) SC treatment of acute COPD exacerbations in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Register of Trials (to April 2011) Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (to April 2011), MEDLINE (from 1950 to October 2010), EMBASE (from 1980 to October 2010) and the reference lists of articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing different durations of SC (seven days or fewer or more than seven days). Other interventions, e.g. bronchodilators and antibiotics, were standardised; studies in other lung diseases were excluded, unless data on participants with COPD were available.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data that were pooled them using Review Manager 5. We sought missing data from authors of studies published as abstracts only.

Main Results

We identified seven studies including 288 participants; two studies were fully published and five were published as abstracts. We obtained data for two studies published as abstracts from authors; these two abstracts and the two full papers contributed to meta-analysis. No study specified COPD diagnostic criteria and only one specified exacerbation criteria. Short course treatment varied between three and seven days and longer duration 10 to 15 days, at equivalent daily doses of corticosteroids; five studies used oral prednisolone (dose 30 mg, four studies, one tapered dose) and two studies used intravenous corticosteroid treatment. Mean ages of participants ranged from 64 to 73 years. We assessed the risk of allocation and blinding bias as low for these studies.

Primary Outcomes

risk of treatment failure did not differ significantly by treatment duration, but the confidence interval (CI) was too wide to conclude equivalence (Peto odds ratio (OR) 0.82; 95% CI 0.24 to 2.79) (three studies, n = 146). Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) did not differ significantly when measured up to seven days (mean difference (MD) -0.07 L; 95% CI -0.19 to 0.05) or after seven days (MD -0.02 L;95% CI -0.10 to 0.06) in four studies (n = 187). The likelihood of an adverse event (four studies, n = 192) did not differ significantly by treatment duration, but again the CI was wide (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.14 to 2.40).

Authors' Conclusions

We based assessment of the efficacy of short (seven days or less) compared to longer duration (more than seven days) systemic corticosteroid therapy for acute exacerbations of COPD in this review on four of the seven included studies for which data were available. Two studies were fully published and two were published as conference abstracts but trialists were able to supply data requested for the review. The finding in this review that there is no significant increase in treatment failure with shorter systemic corticosteroid treatment for seven days or less for acute exacerbations of COPD, does not give conclusive evidence to recommend change in clinical practice due to a wide confidence interval around the estimate of effect. The four studies which contributed to the meta-analysis were of relatively low quality and five of the seven studies were not published as full articles. Thus there are insufficient data to allow firm conclusions concerning the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy of acute exacerbations of COPD to be drawn.

Definitions

We recognize that there is great inter-individual variation in responses to glucocorticoids, likely affecting the risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. Consequently, glucocorticoid exposure should be considered as a multidimensional risk factor, including dose and frequency, administration mode, duration of therapy, potency of glucocorticoid, and individual susceptibility. Glucocorticoid exposure via oral administration that poses risk for adrenal insufficiency, is expected to at least exceed both of the following thresholds:

Duration of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — 3–4 weeks, or greater
Dose of glucocorticoid therapy to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency — any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalent of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)

The following defined terms will be used in the remainder of these guidelines:

Physiologic daily dose equivalent: Daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Endogenous production of cortisol is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. The above mentioned doses are based on an estimate of bioavailability
Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy: Any dose greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent (see above)
Short-term glucocorticoid therapy: Any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration
Long-term glucocorticoid therapy: Glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone)
Glucocorticoid taper: Taper of glucocorticoid therapy dose, initially guided by the management of the underlying disease (= therapeutic taper), and later by the management of glucocorticoid withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency (= endocrine taper)
Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome: Symptoms experienced when lowering glucocorticoid dose within the supraphysiologic glucocorticoid dose range, that are not due to the underlying disease for which the glucocorticoids were initially prescribed for and per definition not due to untreated adrenal insufficiency, as the total glucocorticoid daily dose is still supraphysiologic

Glucocorticoid doses vary based on glucocorticoid agent and are defined as physiologic within the lower and upper ranges to illustrate the inter-individual differences. In the recommendations, prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably.

### Standardised nomenclature for glucocorticoid dosages and glucocorticoid treatment regimens: current questions and tentative answers in rheumatology [^116Md2Bg]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

In rheumatology and other medical specialties there is a discrepancy between the widespread use and the imprecise designation of glucocorticoid treatment regimens. Verbal descriptions of glucocorticoid treatment regimens used in various phases of diseases vary between countries and institutions. Given this background, a workshop under the auspices of the EULAR Standing Committee on International Clinical Studies including Therapeutic Trials was held to discuss this issue and to seek a consensus on nomenclature for glucocorticoid treatment. This report summarises the panel's discussion and recognises that answers derived from consensus conferences are not definitive. Nevertheless, recommendations on glucocorticoid treatment are presented that (1) reflect current and best knowledge available and (2) take into account current clinical practice. A question-answer rationale presentation style has been chosen to convey the messages, to summarise the meeting in a readable format, and to avoid dogmatism.

"Patients received oral schedules of 4.0 mg CH5126766 twice per week… or 4.0 mg CH5126766 three times per week… delivered in cycles of 28 days.… Patients who had grade 2 or worse treatment-related toxicity, with the exception of grade 2 rash and grade 2 creatine phosphokinase elevation, had dose interruptions until the toxicity improved to grade 1 or less. Patients who had dose interruptions for grade 3 or worse rash or grade 3 or worse creatine phosphokinase elevation were able to resume treatment upon improvement of the toxicities to grade 2 or less. After the first dose delay, treatment continued at the same dose; however, if it was necessary to delay dosing again, the patient was allowed a 0.8 mg dose reduction (ie, to 3.2 mg or 2.4 mg). The maximum permitted dose interruption was 14 days. Given that rash was a common side-effect, we recommended the use of topical steroids, and where necessary, oral steroids, as well as dose interruptions for recurrent rash or grade 3 or worse rash and prompt dermatological consultation".

In this example, although the maximum duration for dose interruption is stated, implying treatment would be stopped if dose interruption exceeded the specified duration, it does not explicitly state the criteria for dose discontinuation.

### Knowledge gaps and research priorities in immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis. An official American Thoracic Society research statement [^112WYeVU]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Overview — key topics and conclusions for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-related pneumonitis (ICI-pneumonitis) emphasize rising recognition and major research gaps. The increase in ICI use has led to more irAEs, including potentially fatal ICI-pneumonitis, and development of these events is sporadic, unpredictable, and relatively uncommon per site, making systematic study difficult. Terminology used to define, diagnose, and describe radiologic findings has been inconsistent. Proposed mechanisms include increased T-cell activity against autoantigens, increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced complement-mediated inflammation, yet the key biologic mechanisms remain poorly understood. Because patients with underlying rheumatologic or lung diseases have been underrepresented in trials, it is unknown if comorbid conditions increase risk, and how best to risk stratify using baseline physiologic, radiologic, and serologic evaluation is poorly understood and in need of research. Current recommendations for diagnostic evaluation lack clear evidence that they differentiate ICI-pneumonitis from infection; the role of physiologic testing (pulmonary function tests) remains undefined and should be incorporated in research studies, and the role and timing of bronchoscopy with BAL deserve further investigation. Management uncertainties include which asymptomatic radiographic changes warrant a change in management, the optimal timing, dose, and duration of steroids, and whether steroid dose and duration impact outcomes. For steroid-refractory disease, the role of steroid-sparing agents should be studied in clinical trials, and there is a major concern that steroid treatment may adversely impact the ICI antitumor response and increase infection risk.

### Low-dose corticosteroids and disease modifying drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [^116Kvx5M]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Low-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) exhibit a differential effect on continuation of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and the degree of adverse effects (AE) associated with DMARDs. Therefore, GCs address important problems in DMARD use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), i.e. cumulative toxicity and frequent AE. Low-dose GCs often are recommended to achieve a better symptomatic control or as 'bridge therapy' before the onset of action of DMARDs. RA patients with GC co-medication had better radiographic outcomes but experienced more GC-related AE. Further long-term studies are needed to focus on timing of administration, duration and identification of risk factors for developing AE to establish the optimal use of GCs in the treatment of RA.

### Glucocorticoids in rheumatoid arthritis: current status and future studies [^114UCoHg]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Since their first use for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in the late 1940s, glucocorticoids (GCs) have been representing a substantial part of the therapeutic arsenal for RA. However, even if GCs are still widely prescribed drugs, their toxicity is discussed controversially, so obtaining consensus on their use in RA is difficult. Hence, the most recent European League Against Rheumatism and American College of Rheumatology recommendations on early arthritis and RA management advocate the use of GCs as adjunct treatment to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, at the lowest dose possible and for the shortest time possible. However, the recommendations remain relatively vague on dose regimens and routes of administration. Here, we describe literature data on which the current recommendations are based as well as data from recent trials published since the drafting of the guidelines. Moreover, we make proposals for daily practice and provide suggestions for studies that could help clarifying the place of GCs in RA management. Indeed, numerous items, including the benefit/risk ratio of low-dose and very low-dose GCs and optimal duration of GCs as bridging therapy, remain on the research agenda, and future studies are needed to guide the next recommendations for RA.

Systemic corticosteroids — indications, dosing duration, and precautions: medications include prednisone, prednisolone, methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone tablets, and dexamethasone, given by tablets or suspension or by IM or IV injection; short-term treatment (usually 5–7 days in adults) is important for severe acute exacerbations with main effects seen after 4–6 hours, oral corticosteroid (OCS) therapy is preferred to IM or IV therapy and is effective in preventing short-term relapse, tapering is required if OCS are given for more than 2 weeks, and patients should be reviewed after any exacerbation; as a last resort, long-term OCS may be required for some patients with severe asthma but serious side-effects are problematic, and such patients should be referred for specialist review if available to have treatment optimized and phenotype assessed.

### Pharmacological principles guiding prolonged glucocorticoid treatment in ARDS [^1124yewZ]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Current literature addressing the pharmacological principles guiding glucocorticoid (GC) administration in ARDS is scant. This paucity of information may have led to the heterogeneity of treatment protocols and misinterpretation of available findings. GCs are agonist compounds that bind to the GC receptor (GR) producing a pharmacological response. Clinical efficacy depends on the magnitude and duration of exposure to GR. We updated the meta-analysis of randomized trials investigating GC treatment in ARDS, focusing on treatment protocols and response. We synthesized the current literature on the role of the GR in GC therapy including genomic and non-genomic effects, and integrated current clinical pharmacology knowledge of various GCs, including hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone and dexamethasone. This review addresses the role dosage, timing of initiation, mode of administration, duration, and tapering play in achieving optimal response to GC therapy in ARDS. Based on RCTs' findings, GC plasma concentration-time profiles, and pharmacodynamic studies, optimal results are most likely achievable with early intervention, an initial bolus dose to achieve close to maximal GRα saturation, followed by a continuous infusion to maintain high levels of response throughout the treatment period. In addition, patients receiving similar GC doses may experience substantial between-patient variability in plasma concentrations affecting clinical response. GC should be dose-adjusted and administered for a duration targeting clinical and laboratory improvement, followed by dose-tapering to achieve gradual recovery of the suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. These findings have practical clinical relevance. Future RCTs should consider these pharmacological principles in the study design and interpretation of findings.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — definitions and dose thresholds — are specified as follows: physiologic daily dose equivalent is defined as daily glucocorticoid dose equivalent to average daily cortisol production with 15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, and 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone, and endogenous cortisol production is estimated to be 9–10 mg/day. Short-term glucocorticoid therapy is any glucocorticoid therapy of less than 3–4 weeks duration, while long-term glucocorticoid therapy is glucocorticoid therapy greater than 3–4 weeks duration with glucocorticoid doses greater than physiologic daily dose equivalent of hydrocortisone (15–25 mg hydrocortisone, 4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Exposure thresholds considered to pose risk for adrenal insufficiency include duration of glucocorticoid therapy 3–4 weeks, or greater, and any dose greater than daily hydrocortisone equivalence of 15–25 mg (4–6 mg prednisone or prednisolone, 3–5 mg methylprednisolone, 0.25–0.5 mg dexamethasone). Prednisone and prednisolone are used interchangeably, and doses vary by agent and are defined as physiologic within lower and upper ranges to reflect inter-individual differences.

Recommendation R 2.2 — Glucocorticoid taper for patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy should only be attempted if the underlying disease for which glucocorticoids were prescribed is controlled, and glucocorticoids are no longer required. In these cases, glucocorticoids are tapered until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent is achieved (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). (Good clinical practice).

Introduction

The role of glucocorticoids in the treatment of RA

Glucocorticosteroids (GCs) have a long history of good efficacy and safety in the treatment of RA. This has resulted in their inclusion in guidelines for the management of this disease. For example, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) guidelines recommend that GCs be added at low to moderately high doses to synthetic DMARD monotherapy (or combinations of synthetic DMARDs) since they have been shown to provide benefit as an initial short-term treatment. However, it is also generally recommended that GCs should be tapered as rapidly as clinically feasible. The Canadian Rheumatology Association treatment recommendations state that GCs (oral, intramuscular or intra-articular) can be added to DMARD therapy as part of the initial treatment strategy for patients with RA, and may be an option for managing flares as bridge therapy while waiting for a DMARD to take effect, or for symptom control if no other options exist.

While the use of GCs in patients with RA is supported by clinical trial results, there is still some concern surrounding their use because of potential associations with clinically important adverse events, particularly when they are administered at high doses and/or for long duration. While caution is certainly warranted in the use of GCs in patients with RA, results from a large number of studies have indicated that combination of low doses of these agents with DMARDs may have significant benefit with respect to joint preservation and also acceptable safety. In addition, new GC molecules are being developed in an effort to improve their efficacy and tolerability.

The aim of this article was to systematically review the efficacy (radiological and clinical outcomes) and safety of low-dose GCs when used as part of treatment regimens for patients with RA. The analysis included studies in which GCs were administered at low doses (≤ 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent). In some trials, GCs were delivered at higher doses for a short interval prior to tapering to a dose ≤ 10 mg/day.

Rationale

Despite their efficacy as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents, chronic use of glucocorticoids can induce manifestations of Cushing syndrome, along with concomitant central and later permanent adrenal insufficiency (suppression of the entire HPA axis). For this reason, clinicians prescribing glucocorticoids for non-endocrine reasons are advised to employ the lowest effective dose and duration of therapy and consider tapering glucocorticoid doses when treatment is no longer necessary for the underlying condition.

Given the widespread use of glucocorticoids, it is imperative that treating physicians of any discipline be well-versed in the clinical consequences of long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy and the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. It is equally critical to recognize signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and be experienced in methods to taper and/or stop glucocorticoids once their pharmacologic effects are no longer required.

The management of glucocorticoid therapy is considered a general medical skill that should be managed by the prescribing clinician, also taking into consideration the underlying disease as a determinant of tapering speed. Furthermore, the affected number of patients (at least 1% of the general population) is too large with too few endocrinology providers to perform consultations for each instance of glucocorticoid tapering. When prescribing clinicians decide that glucocorticoid therapy is no longer required, they should educate their patient on methods to taper the dose, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency and appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose (Table 2). In the vast majority of cases, glucocorticoid taper does not cause any clinical endocrine concerns. In rare cases, however, when long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy has resulted in prolonged suppression of HPA axis (greater than 1 year), or when patients experience adrenal crises, referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered (see recommendation 2.11). However, it should be recognized that endocrinology providers have no specialized diagnostic approaches or therapies to facilitate unique care of glucocorticoid tapering. In this regard, the education and approach to stopping glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical process that every clinician who prescribes glucocorticoids should be familiar with.

R 1.2 — We recommend that clinicians who implement treatment with glucocorticoids educate patients about various endocrine aspects of glucocorticoid therapy. (Good clinical practice)

Currently, the optimal type and dose of glucocorticoids to use during the taper has not been established. There is also a lack of reliable data comparing different strategies and tapering regimens vary widely in clinical practice. Moreover, there is no compelling evidence to switch intermediate-acting glucocorticoids such as prednisone to hydrocortisone or cortisone acetate to further promote the recovery of the HPA axis. The evidence of the effect of different types and dosages of glucocorticoid taper on the timing of HPA axis recovery and possible symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal remain limited and inconclusive. Consequently, an individualized approach to glucocorticoid taper is possible and necessary.

R 2.6 — We suggest that patients on a physiologic daily dose equivalent, and aiming to discontinue glucocorticoid therapy, either: 1. continue to gradually taper the glucocorticoid dose, while being monitored clinically for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, or 2. be tested with a morning serum cortisol. (⊕○○○)

During the initial glucocorticoid tapering, ACTH and cortisol levels remain suppressed. When the dose of glucocorticoid therapy is lowered, the hypothalamus and pituitary gland start to recover, resulting in increased production of ACTH. ACTH increase can promote the recovery of adrenal function leading to an increase and recovery in cortisol. Complete recovery of cortisol production can remain impaired in a minority of patients (Fig. 1).

Figure 1.
Schematic representation of HPA axis recovery following discontinuation of supraphysiologic glucocorticoid therapy (adapted from: Prete and Bancos 2021).

There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering. Discontinuation of long-term glucocorticoid therapy necessitates a cautious approach due to an increased risk of adrenal insufficiency, though the risk of clinically relevant adrenal crisis is generally low. Although glucocorticoid dose and treatment duration are associated with the development of adrenal insufficiency, predicting the risk of adrenal insufficiency remains challenging. A uniform approach to tapering the glucocorticoid dose has not yet been established and there is a lack of sufficient data on this topic (see Clinical question II). While some authors recommend a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps, others prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated. An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOASST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved.

### Choice and dose of corticosteroid for antenatal treatments [^116PQSXt]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2004). Low credibility.

Although antenatal glucocorticoids are standard of care for women at risk of preterm delivery before 32 to 34 weeks' gestation, the choice and dosing of the corticosteroid has not been standardized. An analysis of the trial data demonstrates that the risk of neonatal death is decreased with betamethasone, but not dexamethasone. Other clinical data also indicate that betamethasone is the drug of choice for antenatal treatment. The pharmacology of the corticosteroids suggests that a lower total glucocorticoid dose per treatment may be as effective as the current treatment recommendations. However, a change from current practice will require further randomized controlled trials.

Systemic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — timing and dosing: Spontaneous and steroid-related recovery is greatest in the first 2 weeks, with little benefit after 4 to 6 weeks, and more recent studies encourage treatment within 7 days of onset. For optimal treatment outcomes, the recommended oral prednisone dose is 1 mg/kg/d as a single dose (usual maximum 60 mg daily) for 10 to 14 days; representative regimens include 4 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a 10-mg taper every 2 days, 7 to 10 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper over the next week, or 4 weeks at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper. Dose equivalence is prednisone 60 mg = methylprednisolone 48 mg = dexamethasone 10 mg, and methylprednisolone/prednisone dose packs should be avoided for underdosing and delay.

### Early corticosteroids are associated with lower mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19: a cohort study [^116SdZ52]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, patients who never received corticosteroids had higher mortality than early treated patients, a difference that was not observed when we compare them with ever-treated patients, that includes early plus delayed treatment. Delayed corticosteroids, when advanced organ damage already exists, might be ineffective and even detrimental, as previously described in ARDS, with increased infectious complications and mortality, counteracting the positive effect of early treatment. The absence of benefit with too early use of corticosteroids (within 7 days of symptom onset), together with the beneficial effect of early use, and the worst results with delayed use, reveals a U-shaped time-outcome relationship. Although we do not know the optimal time to start corticosteroids, probably patients with elevated inflammatory markers after seven days of symptoms, requiring oxygen or ventilatory support may benefit the most, whereas those who have not received corticosteroids in early phases, probably will not benefit afterwards.

To the best of our knowledge, recommendations about dose and duration of corticosteroid treatment are empiric. With large doses and long treatments, the potential for adverse effects increases, and the possible benefit is lost. The Italian National Institute for Infectious Diseases recommends a 10-day regimen: 5-days full dose of methylprednisolone 1 mg/Kg daily or dexamethasone 20 mg daily, and five days for tapering. In general, most regimens for acute hyperinflammatory states recommend treatments shorter than two weeks. Most common dose regimens range between 0.5–2 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone, equivalent to 0.1–0.4 mg/kg/day of dexamethasone, defined in our study as moderate-to-high doses. The cut-off points were defined before the publication of the RECOVERY trial that used a fixed dexamethasone dose (6 mg) lower than described in the literature for ARDS. We observed a greater mortality reduction with a moderate-to-high dose regimen, similar to other studies. Although our classification is artificial, it favours a higher dose of corticosteroids. As a result of the RECOVERY trial, the NIH and the WHO recommend a low fixed dose of daily dexamethasone, and numerous studies with different corticosteroids and doses were prematurely stopped without completion, but future comparative studies with higher doses are warranted.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — methylprednisolone use is characterized by earlier initiation and specified dosing, with the task force noting a reduction in hospital mortality by approximately 7% and 11% in mild and severe ARDS, respectively, and that early (< 72 h) versus late (≥ 7 days) initiation shows response to a low dose (1 mg/kg/day vs 2 mg/kg/day) with faster disease resolution. An individual patient data analysis of four trials (n = 322) confirmed improved survival and decreased duration of mechanical ventilation. The task force suggested that methylprednisolone be considered in early ARDS (up to day 7 of onset; PaO2/FiO2 of < 200) at 1 mg/kg/day and in late (after day 6 of onset) persistent ARDS at 2 mg/kg/day followed by slow tapering over 13 days; methylprednisolone should be weaned slowly (6–14 days) and not stopped rapidly (2–4 days), and infection surveillance is recommended because glucocorticoids blunt the febrile response.

We discuss the arguments against and in favour of maintenance therapy with low-dose glucocorticoids in patients with RA, and present recent studies, assessments and conclusions on this question.

### Systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 [^1153b4ZV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Systemic corticosteroids are used to treat people with COVID-19 because they counter hyper-inflammation. Existing evidence syntheses suggest a slight benefit on mortality. So far, systemic corticosteroids are one of the few treatment options for COVID-19. Nonetheless, size of effect, certainty of the evidence, optimal therapy regimen, and selection of patients who are likely to benefit most are factors that remain to be evaluated.

Objectives

To assess whether systemic corticosteroids are effective and safe in the treatment of people with COVID-19, and to keep up to date with the evolving evidence base using a living systematic review approach.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register (which includes PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and medRxiv), Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Emerging Citation Index), and the WHO COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease to identify completed and ongoing studies to 16 April 2021.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids for people with COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, participant age, gender or ethnicity. We included any type or dose of systemic corticosteroids. We included the following comparisons: systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care (plus/minus placebo), dose comparisons, timing comparisons (early versus late), different types of corticosteroids and systemic corticosteroids versus other active substances. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome), corticosteroids in combination with other active substances versus standard care, topical or inhaled corticosteroids, and corticosteroids for long-COVID treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess the risk of bias in included studies, we used the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' 2 tool for RCTs. We rated the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality, ventilator-free days, new need for invasive mechanical ventilation, quality of life, serious adverse events, adverse events, and hospital-acquired infections.

Main Results

We included 11 RCTs in 8075 participants, of whom 7041 (87%) originated from high-income countries. A total of 3072 participants were randomised to corticosteroid arms and the majority received dexamethasone (n = 2322). We also identified 42 ongoing studies and 16 studies reported as being completed or terminated in a study registry, but without results yet. Hospitalised individuals with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 Systemic corticosteroids plus standard care versus standard care plus/minus placebo We included 10 RCTs (7989 participants), one of which did not report any of our pre-specified outcomes and thus our analysis included outcome data from nine studies. All-cause mortality (at longest follow-up available): systemic corticosteroids plus standard care probably reduce all-cause mortality slightly in people with COVID-19 compared to standard care alone (median 28 days: risk difference of 30 in 1000 participants fewer than the control group rate of 275 in 1000 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80 to 1.00; 9 RCTs, 7930 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days: corticosteroids may increase ventilator-free days (MD 2.6 days more than control group rate of 4 days, 95% CI 0.67 to 4.53; 1 RCT, 299 participants; low-certainty evidence). Ventilator-free days have inherent limitations as a composite endpoint and should be interpreted with caution. New need for invasive ventilation: the evidence is of very low certainty. Because of high risk of bias arising from deaths that occurred before ventilation we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics. Quality of life/neurological outcome: no data were available. Serious adverse events: we included data on two RCTs (678 participants) that evaluated systemic corticosteroids compared to standard care (plus/minus placebo); for adverse events and hospital-acquired infections, we included data on five RCTs (660 participants). Because of high risk of bias, heterogeneous definitions, and underreporting we are uncertain about the size and direction of the effects. Consequently, we did not perform analysis beyond the presentation of descriptive statistics (very low-certainty evidence). Different types, dosages or timing of systemic corticosteroids We identified one study that compared methylprednisolone with dexamethasone. The evidence for mortality and new need for invasive mechanical ventilation is very low certainty due to the small number of participants (n = 86). No data were available for the other outcomes. We did not identify comparisons of different dosages or timing. Outpatients with asymptomatic or mild disease Currently, there are no studies published in populations with asymptomatic infection or mild disease.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic corticosteroids probably slightly reduce all-cause mortality in people hospitalised because of symptomatic COVID-19. Low-certainty evidence suggests that there may also be a reduction in ventilator-free days. Since we are unable to adjust for the impact of early death on subsequent endpoints, the findings for ventilation outcomes and harms have limited applicability to inform treatment decisions. Currently, there is no evidence for asymptomatic or mild disease (non-hospitalised participants). There is an urgent need for good-quality evidence for specific subgroups of disease severity, for which we propose level of respiratory support at randomisation. This applies to the comparison or subgroups of different types and doses of corticosteroids, too. Outcomes apart from mortality should be measured and analysed appropriately taking into account confounding through death if applicable. We identified 42 ongoing and 16 completed but not published RCTs in trials registries suggesting possible changes of effect estimates and certainty of the evidence in the future. Most ongoing studies target people who need respiratory support at baseline. With the living approach of this review, we will continue to update our search and include eligible trials and published data.

During this era of gradual improvement in treatment outcomes, there were no randomized controlled trials or published corticosteroid treatment regimens to guide therapeutic decisions. In fact, only recently has a randomized controlled trial studied superiority of two different immunomodulatory agent in combination with prednisone to prednisone alone; however, this manuscript was published in 2016 many years after practice trends had developed. Generally, different doses, routes, and duration of glucocorticoids were first-line therapy for mild, moderate, and severe JDM in combination with other immunomodulatory agents. However, a number of published reports advocated that initial high-dose, intravenous and/or pulsed intervals of glucocorticoids were needed to aggressively suppress disease activity, sustain remission, and prevent calcinosis, a highly morbid JDM complication. Despite this trend, there remained tremendous variety in practice, with most authors advocating an initial oral prednisone dose of 2 mg/kg/day (up to a maximum of 60–80 mg/day), with pulses of high-dose (up to 30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g daily) intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) for moderate to severe cases as induction therapy, followed by a slow taper of oral steroids over 1 year. However, lower to medium doses of prednisone (1 to 1.5 mg/kg/day) were also reported effective, particularly after taking into account the disability associated with higher glucocorticoid dosing. Another report showed comparable outcomes using combinations of other immunosuppressive agents with no use of systemic glucocorticoids, albeit in an admittedly mild disease phenotype where the practice was not universal amongst treated patients. Not only have disease outcomes improved with addition of steroid-sparing agents, but it is recognized that aggressively utilizing these agents can reduce the burden of adverse effects of glucocorticoids without sacrificing outcome. Regardless, the most current recommendations continue to endorse high-dose glucocorticoids: Consensus-based treatment plans published by the Childhood Arthritis and Rheumatology Research Alliance (CARRA) for the initial treatment of moderate to severe JDM recommended 2 mg/kg/day oral prednisone in combination with methotrexate in their most conservative protocol, with the two more aggressive protocols utilizing intravenous methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g) for 3 days and continuing with weekly or monthly intravenous methylprednisolone pulses ⁠. Similarly, European recommendations from the Single Hub and Access point for Pediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) recommended high-dose intravenous dosing of methylprednisolone (15–30 mg/kg/day, maximum 1 g/day) for all patients at diagnosis or with a disease flare, followed by an oral prednisone taper beginning at 1–2 mg/kg/day. To our knowledge, there have been no reports describing outcomes with lower doses of glucocorticoids used consistently in early combination with other immunosuppressive agents as a universal approach in a single referral center.

### Glucocorticosteroids for sepsis: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^116MVEoz]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

The systematic review was conducted following the recommendations of The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the PRISMA statement. The protocol was published on PROSPERO (, ID: CRD42013005617).

In addition to an overall analysis including all doses, two separate analyses were conducted of high and low dose steroids. The cut-off value of high and low dose steroids was chosen arbitrarily. High doses were defined as daily doses of more than 500 mg hydrocortisone; low doses were defined as a daily intake of equal or less than 500 mg. Other steroids were recalculated into the equivalent hydrocortisone dose. When doses were expressed in milligram per kilogram body weight, doses were calculated assuming a body weight of 75 kg.

Eligibility criteria

Randomised clinical trials that included adult patients (age > 18 years) with SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock, or any combinations thereof (Table S1). Trials with patients with SIRS were excluded when SIRS criteria were not explicitly described in their methods section. Trials were also excluded when evaluating steroids for the prevention of the occurrence of SIRS. No limitations were made regarding underlying cause of illness. There were no restrictions on duration of treatment (days) or whether administration occurred continuously or intermittently. All types of steroids were included.

Trials were included independently of the type of control intervention: placebo, no intervention, or any other control intervention. Co-interventions were allowed provided that similar administration occurred in the intervention groups. Trials were included irrespective of chosen outcomes. No limitations were made on the basis of language or publication status. The following study types were excluded: quasi-randomised studies, observational studies, cross-over studies, and studies comparing different doses or different types of steroids in both trial intervention groups.

Search strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, PubMed/Medline, Embase, Web of Science and Cinahl. We also hand-searched the reference lists of included trials and systematic reviews for further trials. Ongoing trials were sought through trial registries. No time restrictions were applied. The electronic literature search strategies are listed in Table S2.

Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency, more specifically with respect to corticosteroid administration, sepsis, ESICM/SCCM 2017 guidelines recommend to consider administering long-course low-dose (such as IV hydrocortisone < 400 mg/day for at ≥ 3 days at full dose) rather than short-course high-dose corticosteroids when using corticosteroids in adult patients with septic shock.

### Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^113y3XMP]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis is the most common form of secondary osteoporosis and the first cause in young people. Bone loss and increased rate of fractures occur early after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, and are then related to dosage and treatment duration. The increase in fracture risk is not fully assessed by bone mineral density measurements, as it is also related to alteration of bone quality and increased risk of falls. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, a treat-to-target strategy focusing on low disease activity including through the use of low dose of prednisone, is a key determinant of bone loss prevention. Bone loss magnitude is variable and there is no clearly identified predictor of the individual risk of fracture. Prevention or treatment of osteoporosis should be considered in all patients who receive prednisone. Bisphosphonates and the anabolic agent parathyroid hormone (1–34) have shown their efficacy in the treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. Recent international guidelines are available and should guide management of corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis, which remains under-diagnosed and under-treated. Duration of antiosteoporotic treatment should be discussed at the individual level, depending on the subject's characteristics and on the underlying inflammation evolution.

### Systematic review of the toxicity of short-course oral corticosteroids in children [^112cGyf6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

For over 50 years, corticosteroids have been used in a wide array of medical conditions as therapeutic and diagnostic tools, predominantly for their immunosuppressant and anti-inflammatory properties. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to corticosteroids are known to be associated with the size of the dose, the route of administration and the length of time for which the drug is prescribed. Many ADRs have been reported, such as mood and behaviour changes, vomiting, hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, increased blood pressure and insomnia.

The duration of corticosteroid therapy varies depending on the medical condition being treated and the pathology of the patient. Different definitions have been used for short duration or short courses of corticosteroids. The current British guideline for treatment of acute asthma advises using oral corticosteroids from 3 to 7 days, however the previous guideline (2008) advised use from 7 to 14 days.

While ADRs caused by corticosteroids are well recognised and documented in the summaries of product characteristics (SPC) for relevant products, the toxicity of short-course oral corticosteroids has not been extensively evaluated and their relative risks are unclear. We therefore performed a systematic review to determine the toxicity associated with short-course oral corticosteroids, to identify the most common and serious ADRs and to determine their relative risk levels. We defined short-course oral corticosteroids as use for 14 days or less.

IDSA COVID-19 — glucocorticoids in hospitalized patients: Among hospitalized critically ill patients with COVID-19, the guideline panel recommends dexamethasone rather than no dexamethasone (Strong recommendation, Moderate certainty of evidence). If dexamethasone is unavailable, equivalent total daily doses of alternative glucocorticoids may be used; dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO for 10 days (or until discharge) or equivalent glucocorticoid dose may be substituted, with equivalent total daily doses of alternative glucocorticoids to dexamethasone 6 mg daily being methylprednisolone 32 mg and prednisone 40 mg. Among hospitalized patients with severe, but non-critical, COVID-19, the panel suggests dexamethasone rather than no dexamethasone (Conditional recommendation†, Moderate certainty of evidence), and dexamethasone 6 mg IV or PO for 10 days (or until discharge) or equivalent glucocorticoid dose may be substituted if dexamethasone is unavailable.

Systemic lupus erythematosus treatment goals and early therapy — good practice statements specify that the goal of SLE treatment should be optimal control of disease (e.g., remission or a low level of disease activity) to improve long-term clinical outcomes, and to prescribe glucocorticoids promptly to obtain rapid control of acute inflammation using the lowest dose and shortest duration necessary and initiate immunosuppressive therapy early to minimize glucocorticoid-related toxicity.

### Pulse steroids: how much is enough? [^1167HuNm]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

High dose pulse intravenous steroids with 1 g of methylprednisolone (MEP) given daily, usually for three days, is an accepted practice to treat severe manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or systemic vasculitides, despite the lack of definitive data. Most studies addressing the efficacy of high dose glucocorticoids (GCs) have been uncontrolled, retrospective or did not compare different doses. A limited number of studies comparing different doses of GCs suggest that lower doses of MEP given as intravenous pulse therapy might be as effective as the very high doses currently used. In addition, while early reports did not find serious adverse effects related to very high doses of steroids, several more recent studies indicate a high risk of serious infections proportional to the current or cumulative dose of GCs. While we await more conclusive studies addressing these questions, one might wonder whether we could be using too much of a good thing.

Use of glucocorticoids — patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target: Addition of/switching to DMARDs is conditionally recommended over continuation of glucocorticoids for patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target. This recommendation assumes that improved disease control with DMARDs should allow less use of glucocorticoids. The recommendation is conditional because the continued use of glucocorticoids may be required for patients who do not respond to DMARDs even after maximizing methotrexate dosage and switching DMARD classes.

### Prednisone [^112n7JK8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

Multiple Sclerosis

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.)

### SARS-CoV-2 organising pneumonia:' has there been a widespread failure to identify and treat this prevalent condition in COVID-19?' [^113s9vbT]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Conclusion

It is our view that, based on the similar clinical presentations, radiographic abnormalities, overlapping yet supportive histopathological patterns on autopsy in conjunction with studies reporting that patients are 'steroid-responsive', early COVID-19 respiratory disease is better understood primarily as 'SARS-CoV-2 induced secondary OP'.

Given this likely high prevalence of OP, AFOP or both in early COVID-19, a concern is that the increasingly adopted RECOVERY trial protocol (6 mg dexamethasone daily for up to 10 days) may be insufficient given that treatment of secondary OP often requires higher doses, prolonged duration of treatment, and a careful and monitored tapering. Thus, additional studies comparing corticosteroid type, dosing and duration should be conducted along with the use of other immunosuppressive agents. Initial and maintenance corticosteroid dosing should be similar to that recommended to treat COP, although patients with secondary OP typically require a shorter duration. Clinicians should also be aware of the higher 'pulse' doses required in the successful treatment of fulminant cases of OP or AFOP. Although chronic macrolide therapy has demonstrated efficacy as a steroid-sparing agent in the treatment of COP, there are insufficient data to support a recommendation for use in COVID-19 secondary OP.

### Short-term vs conventional glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: the REDUCE randomized clinical trial [^113xqzFL]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Importance

International guidelines advocate a 7- to 14-day course of systemic glucocorticoid therapy in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, the optimal dose and duration are unknown.

Objective

To investigate whether a short-term (5 days) systemic glucocorticoid treatment in patients with COPD exacerbation is noninferior to conventional (14 days) treatment in clinical outcome and whether it decreases the exposure to steroids. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS REDUCE: (Reduction in the Use of Corticosteroids in Exacerbated COPD), a randomized, noninferiority multicenter trial in 5 Swiss teaching hospitals, enrolling 314 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute COPD exacerbation, past or present smokers (≥ 20 pack-years) without a history of asthma, from March 2006 through February 2011.

Interventions

Treatment with 40 mg of prednisone daily for either 5 or 14 days in a placebo-controlled, double-blind fashion. The predefined noninferiority criterion was an absolute increase in exacerbations of at most 15%, translating to a critical hazard ratio of 1.515 for a reference event rate of 50%.

Main Outcome and Measure

Time to next exacerbation within 180 days.

Results

Of 314 randomized patients, 289 (92%) of whom were admitted to the hospital, 311 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis and 296 in the per-protocol analysis. Hazard ratios for the short-term vs conventional treatment group were 0.95 (90% CI, 0.70 to 1.29; p = 0.006 for noninferiority) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.93 (90% CI, 0.68 to 1.26; p = 0.005 for noninferiority) in the per-protocol analysis, meeting our noninferiority criterion. In the short-term group, 56 patients (35.9%) reached the primary end point; 57 (36.8%) in the conventional group. Estimates of reexacerbation rates within 180 days were 37.2% (95% CI, 29.5% to 44.9%) in the short-term; 38.4% (95% CI, 30.6% to 46.3%) in the conventional, with a difference of -1.2% (95% CI, -12.2% to 9.8%) between the short-term and the conventional. Among patients with a reexacerbation, the median time to event was 43.5 days (interquartile range [IQR], 13 to 118) in the short-term and 29 days (IQR, 16 to 85) in the conventional. There was no difference between groups in time to death, the combined end point of exacerbation, death, or both and recovery of lung function. In the conventional group, mean cumulative prednisone dose was significantly higher (793 mg [95% CI, 710 to 876 mg] vs 379 mg [95% CI, 311 to 446 mg], P < .001), but treatment-associated adverse reactions, including hyperglycemia and hypertension, did not occur more frequently.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients presenting to the emergency department with acute exacerbations of COPD, 5-day treatment with systemic glucocorticoids was noninferior to 14-day treatment with regard to reexacerbation within 6 months of follow-up but significantly reduced glucocorticoid exposure. These findings support the use of a 5-day glucocorticoid treatment in acute exacerbations of COPD.

### Initiation, dose reduction, and duration of inhaled corticosteroid therapy [^1175tDWG]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Asthma is characterized by persistent airway inflammation, which is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and variable airflow obstruction, which accounts for the majority of symptoms experienced by asthmatic patients. Allergen sensitization and inhalation causes airway inflammation, and is likely important in the initiation and persistence of asthma in more than 50% of patients, and while allergen avoidance (or avoidance of other initiating factors, such as occupational sensitizers) can help some patients, it is often difficult to achieve. For this reason, pharmacologic treatment to reduce airway inflammation is currently the cornerstone of therapy for most individuals who have asthma.

### Long-term corticosteroid use, adrenal insufficiency and the need for steroid-sparing treatment in adult severe asthma [^111Vkt1Y]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Unfortunately, there is no established dosage or duration of OCS that is determined to control asthma symptoms without causing AEs. Experts are calling for 'OCS stewardship' to reduce the risks, including AI, related to OCS use. To mitigate the potential for AEs, OCS use should be minimized by optimizing inhaled and biologic therapies for asthma. The availability of newer biologics has allowed for the advent of OCS‐sparing therapies in asthma, although the process by which long‐term corticosteroids should be tapered and/or discontinued has not been established. Consideration should be given to the risk of symptom recurrence and withdrawal‐induced AI.

In 2020, a consensus statement on the use of OCS was issued by 131 practitioners of specialties who frequently use OCS (mostly pulmonologists, respiratory disease specialists and allergists). Of the participating experts, more than 95% concurred that, ultimately, the goal in asthma should be to avoid the use of OCS. When OCS are required, the dosage and duration should be minimized as much as possible. Experts also agreed that individualized tapering to a minimally effective dosage (or complete discontinuation) should be attempted in all patients receiving OCS for maintenance therapy regardless of comorbid conditions. For AI risk, the experts agreed that AI is insufficiently assessed and that patients on long‐term OCS therapy should be assessed for the risk and presence of AI. This includes patients receiving OCS dosages in excess of 2.0 g per year or more than 4 repeat courses of short‐term OCS in 1 year.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^117LYPfW]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

Primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) initial management emphasizes that aggressive blood pressure control and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) blockade is an important component of the initial management of proteinuric patients with FSGS; we recommend beginning these medications immediately. A measurement of baseline proteinuria (ie, at least 2 if not 3 determinations of the rate of protein excretion) should be obtained as a reference point prior to starting immunosuppressive therapy. Patients with non–nephrotic-range proteinuria do not necessarily require immunosuppression. There are no placebo-controlled trials and no randomized trials to support the specific magnitude or duration of the recommended steroid regimens, although the largest retrospective study of 281 patients with FSGS found an association between using high-dose corticosteroids and achieving partial or complete remission. The average time to complete remission following treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is approximately 3–4 months, and it is recommended that patients who are treated with corticosteroids require prolonged therapy before being considered unresponsive. There is no evidence for or against initial or early use of steroid "sparing" agents, but we concur with the recommendation to consider CNIs for patients with a relative contraindication to steroids; relapses are common following withdrawal of CNIs, and there are insufficient data to support the use of MMF in these patients.

### 2015 recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica: a European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^114kF4bm]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, tapering, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to follow an individualized corticosteroid tapering schedule, predicated to regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events. Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

### Asthmatic adult with marked blood eosinophilia: is it truly asthma? [^112DM2dH]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of treatment in CEP includes the use of steroids. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no consensus recommendation on the duration and dose of steroid therapy. In some studies, acutely unwell patients with rapidly progressive disease received 3 to 5 days of high-dose steroids (intravenous methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours), after which they were converted to oral prednisolone once they are stabilised. All other patients were started on oral prednisolone, typically at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/dayand tailed down after 2 weeks of treatment. Clinical improvement following steroid administration is typically dramatic, with response seen within 48 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be sought if patients do not improve quickly with steroids. Clinical response can be measured by improvement in symptoms, decline in pulmonary or peripheral blood eosinophilia, marked reduction or clearing of radiographic abnormalities, as well as physiological improvement on spirometry or diffusion coefficient.

Both symptomatic and radiographic relapse is common in CEP after cessation of therapy or during tailing of steroid doses. Time of relapse can occur any time from months to years after the initial presentation. Management of relapse includes increasing steroid dose up to 0.5 mg/kg/day for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Although the total dose and length of treatment may vary among patients, one study showed that up to three quarters of patients require prolonged steroid therapy, with a mean duration of 19 months. In the study by Marchand et al, up to 69% of patient were still on oral corticosteroid therapy over the mean follow-up period of 6.2 years. Some studies also recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids to lower the rate of CEP relapse.

Learning points

Asthma is commonly associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia. However, markedly increased levels are not common in allergic asthma and a high index of suspicion for another cause is required especially if patients do not respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy.
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) should be considered in a patient with asthma-like symptoms with blood and pulmonary eosinophilia.
Patients with CEP show dramatic response to systemic steroid therapy, though relapses during tailing of doses are common.

Regarding medical management for corticosteroid-induced adrenal insufficiency, more specifically with respect to tapering corticosteroids, ES/ESE 2024 guidelines recommend to attempt tapering corticosteroids in patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy only if the underlying disease for which corticosteroids were prescribed is controlled, and corticosteroids are no longer required. Taper corticosteroids in these cases until approaching the physiologic daily dose equivalent (4–6 mg prednisone).

### Corticosteroids for treating sepsis [^113tKS4r]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sepsis occurs when an infection is complicated by organ failures as defined by a sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score of two or higher. Sepsis may be complicated by impaired corticosteroid metabolism. Giving corticosteroids may benefit patients. The original review was published in 2004 and was updated in 2010 and again in 2015.

Objectives

To examine the effects of corticosteroids on death at one month in patients with sepsis, and to examine whether dose and duration of corticosteroids influence patient response to this treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014, Issue 10), MEDLINE (October 2014), EMBASE (October 2014), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS; October 2014) and reference lists of articles, and we contacted trial authors. The original searches were performed in August 2003 and in October 2009.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials of corticosteroids versus placebo or supportive treatment in patients with sepsis.

Data Collection and Analysis

All review authors agreed on the eligibility of trials. One review author extracted data, which were checked by the other review authors, and by the primary author of the paper when possible. We obtained some missing data from trial authors. We assessed the methodological quality of trials.

Main Results

We identified nine additional studies since the last update, for a total of 33 eligible trials (n = 4268 participants). Twenty-three of these 33 trials were at low risk of selection bias, 22 were at low risk of performance and detection bias, 27 were at low risk of attrition bias and 14 were at low risk of selective reporting. Corticosteroids reduced 28-day mortality (27 trials; n = 3176; risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.00; P value = 0.05, random-effects model). The quality of evidence for this outcome was downgraded from high to low for imprecision (upper limit of 95% CI = 1) and for inconsistency (significant heterogeneity across trial results). Heterogeneity was related in part to the dosing strategy. Treatment with a long course of low-dose corticosteroids significantly reduced 28-day mortality (22 trials; RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97; P value = 0.01, fixed-effect model). The quality of evidence was downgraded from high to moderate for inconsistency (owing to non-significant effects shown by one large trial). Corticosteroids also reduced mortality rate in the intensive care unit (13 trials; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00; P value = 0.04, random-effects model) and at the hospital (17 trials; RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98; P value = 0.03, random-effects model). Quality of the evidence for in-hospital mortality was downgraded from high to moderate for inconsistency and imprecision (upper limit of 95% CI for RR approaching 1). Corticosteroids increased the proportion of shock reversal by day seven (12 trials; RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.51; P value = 0.0001) and by day 28 (seven trials; n = 1013; RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.21; P value = 0.01) and reduced the SOFA score by day seven (eight trials; mean difference (MD) -1.53, 95% CI -2.04 to -1.03; P value < 0.00001, random-effects model) and survivors' length of stay in the intensive care unit (10 trials; MD -2.19, 95% CI -3.93 to -0.46; P value = 0.01, fixed-effect model) without inducing gastroduodenal bleeding (19 trials; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0. 92 to 1.67; P value = 0.15, fixed-effect model), superinfection (19 trials; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.20; P value = 0.81, fixed-effect model) or neuromuscular weakness (three trials; RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.88; P value = 0.40, fixed-effect model). Corticosteroid increased the risk of hyperglycaemia (13 trials; RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.37; P value < 0.00001, fixed-effect model) and hypernatraemia (three trials; RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.28 to 2.09; P value < 0.0001, fixed-effect model).

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, low-quality evidence indicates that corticosteroids reduce mortality among patients with sepsis. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that a long course of low-dose corticosteroids reduced 28-day mortality without inducing major complications and led to an increase in metabolic disorders.

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

### Treatment of sarcoidosis [^112G77nD]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2015). Low credibility.

In general, sarcoidosis treatment should be offered to palliate symptoms and improve quality of life or to prevent end-organ disease. Symptoms include pulmonary as well as extra-pulmonary manifestations of the disease. The assessment of response to disease includes functional studies such as the forced vital capacity. Radiologic imaging such as chest x-ray has also been used to assess response, although standardized measures have rarely been tested. There are sufficient clinical trials to make specific recommendations regarding treatment of symptomatic pulmonary disease. Initial therapy is usually prednisone or a similar glucocorticoid. However, there are several features of this treatment which are unknown. This includes the initial dose, timing of reduction of dose, and when to discontinue treatment. Since many patients are intolerant of prednisone, steroid-sparing alternatives have been studied. Methotrexate is the most widely used anti-metabolite, but azathioprine, leflunomide, and mycophenolate have also been reported as helpful. The biologic agents, especially monoclonal anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) antibodies, have proved effective in patients who have failed other treatments. Infliximab, the most widely studied anti-TNF antibody, has proved effective for a range of refractory sarcoidosis. However, there remain questions regarding dose and duration of therapy. For the clinician, the many treatment options allow for a specific treatment regimen for each patient which minimizes risk while enhancing benefit.

### Guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. section 3. guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapies [^116nBgUc]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2009). Medium credibility.

Topical corticosteroids for plaque-type psoriasis (Table III) can be used as monotherapy 1–2 times daily and can be combined with other topical agents, UV light, and systemic agents; the Stoughton-Cornell classification system divides steroids into 7 classes. For duration, Class I steroids: available data for 2–4 weeks of treatment, and gradual reduction in usage recommended following clinical response; while optimal end point is unknown, unsupervised continuous use is not recommended; for clobetasol and halobetasol, maximal weekly use should be 50 g or less. Short-term results note that highly potent agents have greater efficacy than less potent agents, whereas true efficacy and risks associated with long-term use are unknown as most clinical trials are of short duration; tachyphylaxis, while not demonstrated in clinical trials, may affect the long-term results achieved in a given patient, and combination with other topicals and variations in dosing schedules may lessen risk of long-term side effects. Systemic risks include that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression may occur with use of medium- and high-potency topical steroids and increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts have been reported with use around the eye; risks increase when used with excessive frequency or duration and it is unknown if there is an increased risk of infection with long-term use. Baseline monitoring: None, with ongoing monitoring including assessment of growth in children using topical corticosteroids for long term and regular skin checks for all patients receiving long-term therapy to assess for atrophy; special populations guidance includes Pregnancy: Category C, Nursing: Unknown safety, and Pediatric use cautions that risks to infants and children may be higher for systemic effects secondary to enhanced absorption and that growth retardation is also a potential concern.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114YTyrW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Tapering of steroids for irAE management — taper length is individualized, but tapering should occur slowly, generally over 4–6 weeks; detailed oral and intravenous (IV) strategies, options for physiologic hydrocortisone when very low doses are reached, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis testing guidance are provided. Oral tapering is recommended over 4–6 weeks with a reduction in prednisone or prednisolone of 10 mg every 3–7 days until the dose is 10 mg/d, then reduced by 5 mg every 3–7 days; for IV steroids, tapering is recommended over 4 weeks or longer with initial IV methylprednisolone ≥ 1 mg/kg/d converted to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d at minimum, and longer tapers (> 4–6 weeks) may be required. When ready to drop below 5 mg of prednisone or 0.5 mg of dexamethasone after a longer course with concern for iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic dosing (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon) is an option; if needed for disease control, a simultaneous slow, low-dose taper can decrease by 1 mg prednisone per week, and HPA axis function can be tested 24 hours after the last oral hydrocortisone with AM cortisol and ACTH, with ACTH stimulation for ambiguous results.

### The glucocorticoid receptor: isoforms, functions, and contribution to glucocorticoid sensitivity [^116DvVeH]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In therapeutic uses, dosage of glucocorticoids is disease specific and often protocol driven. For systemic, high-dose glucocorticoids to treat autoimmune/inflammatory diseases or in organ transplantation, regimens typically begin at a moderate-high doses with or without an initial very high-dose induction "pulse". Many regimens use a 1 mg/kg prednisolone equivalent starting dose and wean down over time, often months. Reduction in dosage is dependent on clinical or biochemical measures of underlying disease activity and/or emergence of side effects, with consideration of HPA axis suppression once approaching physiological dosing. Addition of alternative immunosuppressants is often used to reduce steroid exposure. Alternatively, in oncology regimens, high doses of glucocorticoids are delivered intermittently to coincide with cytotoxic medications. For many of these uses, aside from the initial weight-based commencement dose, little consideration is made to interindividual sensitivity to glucocorticoids and there currently is no mechanism/biomarker to assess the extent of glucocorticoid activity, which is likely to result in many patients being unnecessarily exposed to excess glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a key regulator of glucocorticoid sensitivity and further understanding of how it does so may provide a promising avenue by which to assess an individual's sensitivity.

### Diagnosis and treatment of primary adrenal insufficiency: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113ejWEN]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoid physiology and dose equivalence — Glucocorticoids are secreted in a pulsatile and circadian rhythm with a morning peak and a nadir around midnight. Mean cortisol production is about 5–8 mg/m2/d, which is equivalent to an oral replacement with 15–25 mg/d of hydrocortisone or 20–35 mg of cortisone acetate in adults. In most industrialized countries, hydrocortisone is the preferred pharmacological replacement agent, but cortisone acetate is also in widespread use, and in a number of countries only prednisolone is available. Because of the short plasma half-life of hydrocortisone (approximately 90 min), multiple dosing is recommended; the first and largest dose is suggested upon awakening, the second after lunch, and, with a three-dose regimen, the last and smallest dose not later than 4–6 hours before bedtime.

### A different look at corticosteroids… [^1176iZBL]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

8 Most of the recognized use has previously been in hospitalized patients with acute laryngotracheo-bronchitis. The use of steroids in children with croup is associated with significant clinical improvement at about 12 hours post-treatment and results in less endotracheal intubation. 9 Most current research focuses on outpatient use of corticosteroids in the treatment of moderate and severe croup. Some authors have found that routine use of steroids reduces the need for hospitalization. 14, 16, 19 The recommended dosing regimen is oral prednisone, 40 mg twice daily for five days, then 40 mg once daily for five days, then 20 mg daily for the duration of the anti-pneumocystis therapy. Methylprednisolone, given at 75 percent of the oral prednisone dosage, can be substituted if parenteral therapy is necessary.

Further investigation is required to determine the appropriate use and benefits of steroid therapy when the patient has concomitant life-threatening infections and when the patient has already received more than three days of anti-pneumocystis therapy and has developed significant hypoxia. 22, 26 Dexamethasone can be used for that purpose, at a dosage of 2 mg intravenously every six hours, and can eventually can be switched to an oral dosage of 2 mg every six hours.
28. Pain Management Corticosteroids are used as adjuvant analgesics for pain in cancer patients and patients with neuropathic pain such as herpes zoster–related neuropathy, spinal cord compression and pain following oral surgery. Prednisone, at a dosage of 7. 5 to 10 mg per day, may be useful in decreasing pain in some patients with advanced prostate cancer. Perioperative use of corticosteroids has been advocated to reduce pain and decrease edema and trismus following oral surgical procedures.

The most significant improvement occurs in the treatment of postoperative edema. Dosages of prednisone between 40 and 80 mg per day can be used. Maximal benefit has been achieved after third-molar extraction, although some benefit has been reported after other surgeries. Haemophilus influenzae. 50 Corticosteroids were found to be more effective when administered simultaneously with antibiotics or 15 to 20 minutes before starting them. The drug was administered in a dosage of 0. 6 to
0. 8 mg per kg per day in four divided doses for two to four days.

### Low-dose corticosteroids for adults with severe pulmonary infections… [^116MrigD]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Observations Corticosteroids mitigate the immune response to infection and improve outcomes for patients with several types of severe pulmonary infections. Low-dose corticosteroids, defined as less than or equal to 400 mg hydrocortisone equivalent daily, can reduce mortality of patients with severe COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, and Pneumocystis pneumonia. A randomized clinical trial of 6425 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who required supplemental oxygen or noninvasive or invasive mechanical ventilation reported that dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 10 days decreased 28-day mortality. A meta-analysis that included 7 randomized clinical trials of 1689 patients treated in the intensive care unit for severe bacterial community-acquired pneumonia reported that hydrocortisone equivalent less than or equal to 400 mg daily for 8 days or fewer was associated with lower 30-day mortality compared with placebo.

In a meta-analysis of 6 randomized clinical trials, low-dose corticosteroids were associated with lower mortality rates compared with placebo for patients with HIV and moderate to severe Pneumocystis pneumonia. In a predefined subgroup analysis of a trial of low-dose steroid treatment for septic shock, patients with community-acquired pneumonia randomized to 7 days of intravenous hydrocortisone 50 mg every 6 hours and fludrocortisone 50 μg daily had decreased mortality compared with the placebo group. For patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by various conditions, low-dose corticosteroids were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality according to a meta-analysis of 8 studies that included 1091 patients. Adverse effects of low-dose corticosteroids may include hyperglycemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, neuropsychiatric disorders, muscle weakness, hypernatremia, and secondary infections.

Conclusions and Relevance Treatment with low-dose corticosteroids is associated with decreased mortality for patients with severe COVID-19 infection, severe community-acquired bacterial pneumonia, and moderate to severe Pneumocystis pneumonia. Low-dose corticosteroids may also benefit critically ill patients with respiratory infections who have septic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or both. © 2025 JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.
