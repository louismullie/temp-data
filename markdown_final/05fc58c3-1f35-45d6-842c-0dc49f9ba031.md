## Question

Severe sepsis classification

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "severe sepsis" remains a valid classification and how sepsis is currently defined and operationalized under Sepsis-3, including practical implications for diagnosis, documentation, and coding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical SIRS→sepsis→severe sepsis→septic shock model. Then, I should verify why that framework was challenged. Next, I will confirm exactly what Sepsis-3 changed, including the definitions and operational criteria for sepsis and septic shock. After that, I need to review rationale and validation data supporting the removal of "severe sepsis". Finally, I should consider lingering issues like ICD coding, quality metrics, and bedside implications so documentation and care align with current standards [^115tUKZq].

> Let me first confirm the historical context so I don't misstate the baseline. Historically, "severe sepsis" meant sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension within a linear progression of SIRS to sepsis to severe sepsis to septic shock; that 1991/2001 taxonomy put inflammation via SIRS at the center and treated organ dysfunction as a higher tier, which is the stage that was labeled "severe sepsis" [^113faCoX] [^114qFyMu].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without examining why this older scheme was problematic. I need to check whether SIRS truly discriminated infectious from noninfectious illness and whether "severe sepsis" separated a meaningfully different risk group; large datasets showed SIRS was overly sensitive and nonspecific, and patients with infection plus organ dysfunction had similar risks whether or not they met 2+ SIRS, undermining "severe" as a distinct stage, which supports rethinking the taxonomy [^11183mWR] [^115tUKZq].

> Now, I should confirm the Sepsis-3 task force's core conclusion and the updated definitions. The task force explicitly concluded that the term "severe sepsis" is redundant; sepsis is now defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, operationalized as an acute increase in SOFA by 2 or more points from baseline, while septic shock is a subset with vasopressors required to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluids, so "severe sepsis" collapses into "sepsis" under Sepsis-3 [^115tUKZq] [^115A1XRf] [^112suHuL].

> Wait, let me verify the operationalization and bedside screening to ensure I'm not missing a key element. Sepsis-3 removed SIRS from the definition and introduced qSOFA as a pragmatic bedside screen to flag possible sepsis outside the ICU, with the primary definitional anchor being SOFA-based organ dysfunction; external evaluations suggest the SOFA-based definition improves prognostic validity and reduces misclassification compared with prior staging, though qSOFA trades sensitivity for simplicity outside the ICU [^115A1XRf] [^112K4J4E] [^111T4vxG].

> Next, I should review the reasoning for eliminating "severe sepsis" so the conceptual shift is precise. If sepsis is defined by life-threatening organ dysfunction, then "severe sepsis" adds nothing semantically or clinically; risk increases continuously with organ dysfunction burden rather than in discrete steps, and simplifying to sepsis (organ dysfunction present) and septic shock (circulatory and metabolic failure) enhances clarity, comparability, and face validity for clinical care, research, and surveillance [^115tUKZq] [^111T4vxG] [^115JiwrE].

> I will now examine transition and coding issues because practice and policy often lag definitions. I need to ensure we acknowledge that ICD-10 still retains codes labeled "severe sepsis", which can create documentation friction, whereas contemporary guidelines and scholarship post-2016 use the Sepsis-3 framework, so clinicians should document "sepsis" (infection with organ dysfunction) and "septic shock" when criteria are met, while mapping to legacy codes as required by local administrative systems [^114BjKAW] [^112JPJMT] [^111N79dr].

> Let me think about the bedside implications so recommendations remain actionable. For diagnosis, I should confirm that clinicians screen for suspected infection and assess organ dysfunction with SOFA (using qSOFA as a quick flag when appropriate); meeting infection plus SOFA increase ≥ 2 equals sepsis, and the presence of vasopressor-dependent hypotension with lactate > 2 mmol/L after adequate fluids equals septic shock; documentation should avoid "severe sepsis" and instead use Sepsis-3 terms while applying SSC guidance for time-to-antibiotics stratified by certainty and severity, and for resuscitation targets including lactate-guided reassessment when elevated [^115A1XRf] [^117Y8Ryt] [^111b4ee6].

> But wait, what if early infection without overt organ dysfunction is clinically dangerous — does removing "severe sepsis" obscure urgency before SOFA rises? I should double-check the critiques; some argue Sepsis-3 may downplay pre-dysfunction states and prefer earlier flags, yet the definition change doesn't preclude early recognition or treatment of suspected infection — screening tools and SSC recommendations still encourage rapid evaluation and timely antimicrobials based on risk and severity; also, I initially thought SIRS remained part of Sepsis-3 screening, but that's not correct — SIRS was removed from the definition, with qSOFA proposed for rapid identification and SOFA for diagnosis, which I needed to correct [^115EQsJt] [^113p97aa] [^115A1XRf].

> In summary, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and consistent with the consensus. "Severe sepsis" is a retired term under Sepsis-3; the valid classifications are sepsis, defined by infection with life-threatening organ dysfunction quantified by a SOFA increase ≥ 2, and septic shock, defined by sepsis with vasopressors required to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg and lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation; while "severe sepsis" persists in some ICD-10 coding and legacy programs, clinical documentation and contemporary guidelines should use Sepsis-3 terminology for clarity and alignment with evidence [^115tUKZq] [^115A1XRf] [^114BjKAW].

---

Severe sepsis refers to sepsis with acute organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension and is now encompassed by Sepsis-3 as **life-threatening organ dysfunction** from a dysregulated host response to infection, defined operationally as a **SOFA score increase of ≥ 2 points** [^115tUKZq] [^111T4vxG]. The term "severe sepsis" has been **removed from current classifications**, with sepsis defined by infection plus organ dysfunction and septic shock by vasopressor-dependent hypotension with lactate > 2 mmol/L despite fluids [^115A1XRf] [^112suHuL]. This shift emphasizes early recognition and management of organ dysfunction; the SOFA score is central to current classification and risk stratification [^115tUKZq] [^112JPJMT].

---

## Historical definitions and evolution

The 1991 ACCP/SCCM consensus defined sepsis as infection plus SIRS [^11183mWR]; severe sepsis as sepsis with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension; and septic shock as persistent hypotension despite fluids [^113faCoX]. In 2001, the international sepsis definitions conference retained severe sepsis as sepsis with acute organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension [^113faCoX] [^115apqan]. Sepsis-3 (2016) redefined sepsis as life-threatening organ dysfunction from a dysregulated host response to infection, operationalized as an increase in SOFA score of ≥ 2 points, and **removed the term** "severe sepsis" as redundant [^115tUKZq] [^115A1XRf].

---

## Current classification criteria (sepsis-3)

| **Category** | **Definition** | **Clinical criteria** |
|-|-|-|
| Sepsis | Life-threatening organ dysfunction from a dysregulated host response to infection | SOFA score increase ≥ 2 points from baseline [^115tUKZq] [^111T4vxG] |
| Septic shock | Subset of sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities | - Vasopressor therapy to maintain MAP ≥ 65 mmHg <br/> - Serum lactate > 2 mmol/L despite adequate fluid resuscitation [^112suHuL] |

---

## Clinical manifestations and organ dysfunction

Severe sepsis (now **sepsis with organ dysfunction**) presents with diverse forms of organ dysfunction, including [^111T4vxG]:

- **Respiratory**: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), hypoxemia [^117BhT86].

- **Cardiovascular**: Hypotension, shock, arrhythmias.

- **Renal**: Acute kidney injury, oliguria.

- **Hepatic**: Hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy.

- **Neurologic**: Altered mental status, delirium.

- **Hematologic**: Thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) [^112vCssU].

---

## Diagnostic tools and biomarkers

- **SOFA score**: Central to Sepsis-3 for quantifying organ dysfunction and risk stratification [^115tUKZq] [^112JPJMT].

- **qSOFA**: Rapid bedside tool (respiratory rate ≥ 22, altered mentation, systolic BP ≤ 100 mmHg) for identifying patients at risk of poor outcomes [^115tUKZq] [^112K4J4E].

- **Biomarkers**: Lactate, procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) support diagnosis and monitoring [^115dkGek] [^111b4ee6].

---

## Clinical implications of sepsis-3 redefinition

The Sepsis-3 redefinition emphasizes **early recognition** and prompt identification and management of organ dysfunction [^111T4vxG]. It also provides a consistent framework for clinical practice, research, and epidemiology, and guides appropriate use of critical care resources [^115JiwrE].

---

## Controversies and challenges

Controversies and challenges include the **loss of "severe sepsis" — some clinicians argue [^115EQsJt] that removing the term may delay recognition and treatment of early organ dysfunction [^113faCoX] — and concerns about **applicability, particularly Sepsis-3's suitability in resource-limited settings and pediatric populations [^114djv1k] [^114vHH6V].

---

## Impact on clinical practice and outcomes

Implementation of Sepsis-3 and SSC guidelines has been associated with **mortality reduction**. Early recognition and standardized management are linked to **improved outcomes**, reducing healthcare costs.

---

## Future directions and research priorities

Future directions include **personalized medicine** with targeted therapies based on patient-specific factors [^117MBfak] and advances in rapid diagnostic tools and biomarkers [^113VeMWH]. Efforts also focus on adapting definitions and guidelines to diverse healthcare settings to enhance global applicability [^114djv1k] [^113FbjAh].

---

Severe sepsis now denotes sepsis with organ dysfunction, but the term has been removed from current classifications [^115tUKZq]. The Sepsis-3 definition emphasizes early recognition and management of organ dysfunction [^115A1XRf], with the **SOFA score as a central tool** for classification and risk stratification [^111T4vxG].

## References

### The third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3) [^115tUKZq]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The definitions of sepsis and septic shock were last revised in 2001. Since then, considerable advances have been made in the pathobiology — changes in organ function, morphology, cell biology, biochemistry, immunology, and circulation — management, and epidemiology of sepsis, suggesting the need for reexamination.

- **Objective**: To evaluate and, as needed, update definitions for sepsis and septic shock.

- **Process**: A task force of 19 experts in sepsis pathobiology, clinical trials, and epidemiology was convened by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Definitions and clinical criteria were generated through meetings, Delphi processes, analysis of electronic health record databases, and voting, followed by circulation to international professional societies, requesting peer review and endorsement by 31 societies.

- **Key findings from evidence synthesis**: Limitations of previous definitions included an excessive focus on inflammation, the misleading model that sepsis follows a continuum through severe sepsis to shock, and inadequate specificity and sensitivity of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria. Multiple definitions and terminologies are currently in use for sepsis, septic shock, and organ dysfunction, leading to discrepancies in reported incidence and observed mortality. The task force concluded the term "severe sepsis" was redundant.

- **Recommendations**: Sepsis should be defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

### The third international consensus definitions for sepsis and septic shock (sepsis-3) [^115A1XRf]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on sepsis and septic shock:

- **Definition**: According to the Sepsis-3 definition, sepsis is characterized by life-threatening organ dysfunction, defined as an increase of ≥ 2 points from baseline in the SOFA score, caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is no longer included in the definition of sepsis. Septic shock is defined as sepsis with profound circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities, requiring vasopressor therapy to maintain a mean arterial pressure of ≥ 65 mmHg and serum lactate level > 2 mmol/L (> 18 mg/dL) in the absence of hypovolemia.

- **Pathophysiology**: The most common infectious pathogens responsible for the development of sepsis are S. aureus (20.5%), Pseudomonas species (19.9%), fungi (19%), E. coli (16.0%), Klebsiella species (12.7%), and Acinetobacter (9%).

- **Epidemiology**: In hospitalized adult patients, the incidence of sepsis is estimated at 6.0%.

- **Disease course**: In patients with sepsis, continued activation of immune cells in response to an infection results in a dysregulated inflammatory response. The coagulation system is closely tied to the inflammatory response, with cross talk between the two systems. These pathophysiological changes cause the clinical manifestations of organ dysfunction, which may progress to multiple organ failure and death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The overall mortality associated with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock is 10–20%, 20–50%, and 40–80%, respectively.

### Sepsis and septic shock [^111T4vxG]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a common condition associated with unacceptably high mortality and, for many survivors, long-term morbidity. Increased awareness of the condition, resulting from ongoing campaigns and evidence from research over the past 10 years, has improved understanding among clinicians and laypeople and led to better outcomes. The World Health Assembly and WHO made sepsis a global health priority in 2017 and adopted a resolution to enhance prevention, diagnosis, and management of sepsis. In 2016, a new definition of sepsis (Sepsis-3) was developed, now defined as infection with organ dysfunction. This definition utilizes the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score to codify organ dysfunction.

Ongoing research aims to better define patient populations for individualized management strategies tailored to a patient's molecular and biochemical profile. The search continues for improved diagnostic techniques to facilitate this and for a pharmacological agent that can improve outcomes by altering the disease process. While awaiting these advancements, enhanced basic care driven by education and quality-improvement programs offers the best hope for increasing favorable outcomes.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^111N79dr]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for sepsis and septic shock, the SSC 2021 guidelines specifically recommend considering referring adult survivors of sepsis or septic shock who received mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours or had an ICU stay of more than 72 hours to a post-hospital rehabilitation program.

### A comparison of different scores for diagnosis and mortality prediction of adults with sepsis in low-and-middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Rs6ti]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; it is responsible for twenty percent of all-cause global mortality, the majority of which occurs in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs).

Sepsis is a syndrome that can manifest in affected patients as a broad constellation of symptoms and signs caused by the interplay of pathogens and host factors. To address the challenge of sepsis diagnosis, multiple sepsis diagnostic and mortality prediction models or scores have been developed.

- **Early warning scores**: The availability of sophisticated laboratory investigation tools and early warning scores are important instruments to improve diagnosis and management of sepsis in high-income countries (HICs), but applying those to LMIC settings is complex. The first early warning score, published in 1997, was designed to enable detection of changes in illness severity using aberrations in vital signs. In 2001, the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) was published. It was created by assigning weighted scores to five physiological parameters (systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and level of consciousness) based on severity of the abnormality. Though not specific for sepsis, MEWS is intended to support medical staff in anticipating patients' clinical deterioration.

- **Sepsis definitions**: Sepsis definitions have been modified significantly between 1991 and 2016. The current definition describes sepsis as organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. For clinical operationalization, organ dysfunction is represented through scoring models that evaluate physiological parameters.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Results of an international guideline-based performance improvement program targeting severe sepsis [^1165v8bA]. Intensive Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC or "the Campaign") developed guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock. A performance improvement initiative targeted changing clinical behavior (process improvement) via bundles based on key SSC guideline recommendations to improve process improvement and patient outcomes.

- **Design and setting**: A multifaceted intervention was implemented voluntarily in the US, Europe, and South America to facilitate compliance with selected guideline recommendations in the ICU, ED, and wards of individual hospitals and regional hospital networks. Elements of the guidelines were "bundled" into two sets of targets to be completed within 6 hours and 24 hours. An analysis was conducted on data submitted from January 2005 through March 2008.

- **Main results**: Data from 15,022 subjects at 165 sites were analyzed to determine compliance with bundle targets and the association with hospital mortality. Compliance with the entire resuscitation bundle increased linearly from 10.9% in the first site quarter to 31.3% by the end of 2 years (P < 0.0001). Compliance with the entire management bundle started at 18.4% in the first quarter and increased to 36.1% by the end of 2 years (P = 0.008). Compliance with all bundle elements increased significantly, except for inspiratory plateau pressure, which was high at baseline. Unadjusted hospital mortality decreased from 37% to 30.8% over 2 years (P = 0.001). The adjusted odds ratio for mortality improved the longer a site was in the Campaign, resulting in an adjusted absolute drop of 0.8% per quarter and 5.4% over the study period.

### Systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria in defining severe sepsis [^11183mWR]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The consensus definition of severe sepsis requires suspected or proven infection, organ failure, and signs that meet two or more criteria for the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). We aimed to test the sensitivity, face validity, and construct validity of this approach.

- **Methods**: We studied data from patients from 172 intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand from 2000 through 2013. We identified patients with infection and organ failure and categorized them according to whether they had signs meeting two or more SIRS criteria (SIRS-positive severe sepsis) or less than two SIRS criteria (SIRS-negative severe sepsis). We compared their characteristics and outcomes and assessed them for the presence of a step increase in the risk of death at a threshold of two SIRS criteria.

- **Results**: Of 1,171,797 patients, a total of 109,663 had infection and organ failure. Among these, 96,385 patients (87.9%) had SIRS-positive severe sepsis and 13,278 (12.1%) had SIRS-negative severe sepsis. Over a period of 14 years, these groups had similar characteristics and changes in mortality (SIRS-positive group: from 36.1% [829 of 2296 patients] to 18.3% [2037 of 11,119], P < 0.001; SIRS-negative group: from 27.7% [100 of 361] to 9.3% [122 of 1315], P < 0.001). Moreover, this pattern remained similar after adjustment for baseline characteristics (odds ratio in the SIRS-positive group, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.96 to 0.97; odds ratio in the SIRS-negative group, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.98; P = 0.12 for between-group difference).

### A severe sepsis mortality prediction model and score for use with administrative data [^114zDMRU]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Administrative data are utilized for research, quality improvement, and health policy in severe sepsis. However, there currently is no sepsis-specific tool applicable to administrative data to adjust for illness severity. The objective of this study was to develop, internally validate, and externally validate a severe sepsis mortality prediction model and an associated mortality prediction score.

- **Design**: This was a retrospective cohort study using 2012 administrative data from five U.S. states. Three cohorts of patients with severe sepsis were created: 1) using International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification codes for severe sepsis/septic shock, 2) employing the Martin approach, and 3) applying the Angus approach. The model was developed and internally validated in the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification cohort and externally validated in other cohorts. Integer point values for each predictor variable were generated to create a sepsis severity score.

- **Setting**: The study was conducted in acute care, nonfederal hospitals in New York, Maryland, Florida, Michigan, and Washington.

- **Subjects**: The study involved patients in one of three severe sepsis cohorts: 1) explicitly coded (n = 108,448), 2) Martin cohort (n = 139,094), and 3) Angus cohort (n = 523,637).

- **Measurements and main results**: Maximum likelihood estimation logistic regression was used to develop a predictive model for in-hospital mortality. Model calibration and discrimination were assessed via Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit and C-statistics, respectively. The primary cohort was divided into risk deciles, and observed versus predicted mortality was evaluated.

### Validation of the new Sepsis-3 definitions: Proposal for improvement in early risk identification [^112K4J4E]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis-3 definitions generated controversies regarding their general applicability. The Sepsis-3 Task Force outlined the need for validation with emphasis on the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score. This was done in a prospective cohort from a different healthcare setting.

- **Methods**: Patients with infections and at least two signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were analyzed. Sepsis was defined as a total SOFA score ≥ 2 outside the intensive care unit (ICU) or as an increase of ICU admission SOFA score ≥ 2. The primary endpoints were the sensitivity of qSOFA outside the ICU and sepsis definition both outside and within the ICU to predict mortality.

- **Results**: In total, 3346 infections outside the ICU and 1058 infections in the ICU were analyzed. Outside the ICU, respective mortality for ≥ 2 SIRS and qSOFA ≥ 2 was 25.3% and 41.2% (p < 0.0001); the sensitivities of qSOFA and sepsis definition to predict death were 60.8% and 87.2%, respectively. This was 95.9% for the sepsis definition in the ICU. The sensitivity of qSOFA and of ≥ 3 SIRS criteria for organ dysfunction outside the ICU was 48.7% and 72.5%, respectively (p < 0.0001). Misclassification outside the ICU with the 1991 and Sepsis-3 definitions into stages of lower severity was 21.4% and 3.7%, respectively (p < 0.0001), and 14.9% and 3.7%, respectively, in the ICU (p < 0.0001). Adding arterial pH ≤ 7.30 to qSOFA increased the sensitivity for prediction of death to 67.5% (p = 0.004).

- **Conclusions**: Our analysis positively validated the use of the SOFA score to predict unfavorable outcomes and to limit misclassification.

### Organ dysfunction during sepsis [^117BhT86]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is the most common reason for sepsis-associated mortality.

In the 40 years since it was first described, understanding of its pathophysiology has improved, and novel methodologies for monitoring and severity of illness scoring have emerged. These, together with the development of systematic strategies for managing organ dysfunction in sepsis and potentially effective new therapeutic interventions, should assist in reducing sepsis-associated mortality.

These historical developments are discussed, and the reader is directed to these references for further guidance.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016 [^1123c9fG]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this guideline is to provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

- **Design**: A consensus committee of 55 international experts representing 25 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings for those committee members attending the conference. A formal conflict-of-interest (COI) policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. A stand-alone meeting was held for all panel members in December 2015. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

- **Methods**: The panel consisted of five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were reviewed and updated as needed, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup generated a list of questions, searched for the best available evidence, and then followed the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess the quality of evidence from high to very low, and to formulate recommendations as strong or weak, or a best practice statement when applicable.

- **Results**: The Surviving Sepsis Guideline panel provided 93 statements on the early management and resuscitation of patients with sepsis or septic shock. Overall, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was provided for four.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^113faCoX]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The definition of sepsis has shifted over time. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were initially defined in 1991 by a consensus panel convened by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM). The conference defined sepsis as a SIRS due to infection. "Severe" sepsis was defined as sepsis associated with organ dysfunction, hypoperfusion, or hypotension. "Septic shock" was defined as sepsis with arterial hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation.

The definitions were revisited in 2001 during the International Sepsis Definitions Conference, which included members from the ACCP, the SCCM, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the Surgical Infection Society (SIS). The consensus retained the definitions of sepsis as SIRS due to infection (presumed or confirmed) and severe sepsis as sepsis associated with acute organ dysfunction. However, the new criteria defining SIRS were greatly expanded from the 1991 original, and organ dysfunction variables indicative of severe sepsis were also defined. This new set of sepsis criteria also changed the diagnostic requirement from "more than 1" of the original 4 to "some" of the expanded list.

In February 2016, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a proposal for new definitions and criteria for sepsis, called Sepsis-3, updating previous sepsis definitions.

### Recognizing and managing sepsis: What needs to be done [^116242hQ]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased. However, sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in the hospital. In this forum article, clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

### Revising sepsis definitions to better target and tailor sepsis care [^112HH8jE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

How we define sepsis has significant implications for clinical care, quality improvement, and regulatory policies. Sepsis criteria identify heterogeneous patients that vary widely in their clinical syndromes, triggering pathogens, and prognoses; one-third have viral or non-infectious processes, and crude mortality rates vary 30-fold.

Nonetheless, clinicians have been trained to treat all patients with possible sepsis immediately, aggressively, and uniformly with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Evidence continues to mount, however, that immediate antibiotics are critical for patients with septic shock or multiorgan dysfunction, but short delays can safely be tolerated by patients with single organ dysfunction without shock. This allows time to clarify whether these patients are infected or not.

We suggest modifying sepsis operational definitions to flag just those patients in whom short antibiotic delays are associated with worse outcomes. This will help focus sepsis care where it is needed, aid antibiotic stewardship, and increase the validity of sepsis quality measures.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^113RMzNh]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for sepsis and septic shock, specifically concerning source control, the SSC 2021 guidelines recommend rapidly identifying or excluding a specific anatomical diagnosis of infection that requires emergent source control. Any necessary source control intervention should be implemented as soon as medically and logistically practical in adult patients with sepsis or septic shock.

### The role of the endothelium in severe sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome [^112vCssU]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis, defined as sepsis with acute organ dysfunction, is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. The development of novel therapies for sepsis is critically dependent on an understanding of the basic mechanisms of the disease. The pathophysiology of severe sepsis involves a highly complex, integrated response that includes the activation of a number of cell types, inflammatory mediators, and the hemostatic system. Central to this process is an alteration of endothelial cell function.

The goals of this article are to:

- **Provide an overview**: Sepsis and its complications are discussed comprehensively.
- **Discuss the role of the endothelium**: The article explores how the endothelium orchestrates the host response in sepsis.
- **Emphasize potential therapy targets**: The potential value of the endothelium as a target for sepsis therapy is highlighted.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: Research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^117MBfak]. Intensive Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcomes, and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock, a consensus committee of 16 international experts was convened. These experts represented the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine at the annual meetings of both societies. The subgroups engaged in teleconferences and electronic-based discussions, while the entire committee iteratively developed the document and recommendations.

Each committee member independently proposed their top five priorities for sepsis research, aggregating to a total of 88 suggestions. These suggestions were grouped into categories, resulting in the formation of seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science.

The committee co-chairs facilitated this grouping process. Each subgroup conducted teleconferences to discuss priorities followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee also voted on top priorities across all subgroups except for basic/translational science.

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee identified 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Among these, the top six clinical priorities include critical questions, such as whether targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches can determine which therapies will work for which patients at specific times, and what the ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation are, along with how volume resuscitation should be titrated.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^114b3JML]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for sepsis and septic shock, specifically with respect to the transition of care, the SSC 2021 guidelines recommend considering longer courses of antimicrobial therapy than the standard duration of 7–10 days. This is applicable in patients who have a slow clinical response, undrainable foci of infection, bacteremia with S. aureus, certain fungal and viral infections, or immunologic deficiencies, including neutropenia.

### New method of classifying infections in critically ill patients [^117KLSjF]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

To develop a systematic classification describing the contribution made by infection to the outcome from sepsis, it is important to consider the emergence of effective therapies for sepsis. Accurate methods of risk assessment are increasingly important. Although well-validated instruments exist for describing host risk factors, the contribution made by the infection is less well served.

A systematic literature review of the English language literature published during the last 30 years was conducted on studies describing the outcome of infections, categorized by microorganism and site of infection. We surveyed 510 published articles, including 55,854 clinical infections, and generated specific risk codes for bacteremia, meningitis, pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, peritonitis, and urinary tract infections. Both the nature of the organisms and the site of infection significantly impact survival from sepsis, and there is a significant interaction between them.

We have described a novel approach to better assess the contribution made by the infection to mortality in patients with sepsis or septic shock.

### Recognizing and managing sepsis: What needs to be done [^114a2P75]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized and treated. Since the development of early goal-directed therapy, mortality rates have decreased, but sepsis remains a major cause of death in patients arriving at the emergency department or staying in the hospital. In this forum article, we asked clinicians and researchers with expertise in sepsis care to discuss the importance of rapid detection and treatment of the condition, as well as special considerations in different patient groups.

Over the last 100 years, huge advances have been made in the field of sepsis in terms of pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, monitoring, and therapeutics. Here, we offer our perspective on the key changes and situations in each of these areas. Despite these changes, mortality rates remain unacceptably high, and continued progress, particularly in early diagnosis and therapy, is urgently needed.

### Infectious diseases society of America (IDSA) position statement: Why IDSA did not endorse the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines [^116FQvVP]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

IDSA did not endorse the 2016 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines despite being represented in the working group that drafted the guidelines document. Leadership from the IDSA, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines, and the Society of Critical Care Medicine had numerous amicable discussions, primarily regarding the bolded, rated guidelines recommendations. Our societies had different perspectives, however, regarding the interpretation of the major studies that informed the guidelines' recommendations, thus leading us to different conclusions and perspectives on the recommendations. Consequently, IDSA elected not to endorse the guidelines. Nonetheless, IDSA hopes to continue collaborating with the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and the Society of Critical Care Medicine to resolve our differences and develop further strategies together to prevent sepsis and septic shock, as well as reduce death and disability from these conditions both nationally and globally.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Results of an international guideline-based performance improvement program targeting severe sepsis [^111q9AYh]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC or "the Campaign") developed guidelines for the management of severe sepsis and septic shock. A performance improvement initiative targeted changing clinical behavior (process improvement) via bundles based on key SSC guideline recommendations.

- **Design and setting**: A multifaceted intervention was voluntarily implemented in the United States, Europe, and South America to facilitate compliance with selected guideline recommendations. This took place in the intensive care unit, emergency department, and wards of individual hospitals and regional hospital networks. Elements of the guidelines were "bundled" into two sets of targets to be completed within 6 hours and within 24 hours. An analysis was conducted on data submitted from January 2005 through March 2008.

- **Subjects**: A total of 15,022 subjects were involved.

- **Measurements and main results**: Data from 15,022 subjects at 165 sites were analyzed to determine compliance with bundle targets and their association with hospital mortality. Compliance with the entire resuscitation bundle increased linearly from 10.9% in the first site quarter to 31.3% by the end of 2 years (p < .0001). Compliance with the entire management bundle started at 18.4% in the first quarter and increased to 36.1% by the end of 2 years (p = .008). Compliance with all bundle elements increased significantly, except for inspiratory plateau pressure, which was high at baseline. Unadjusted hospital mortality decreased from 37% to 30.8% over 2 years (p = .001). The adjusted odds ratio for mortality improved the longer a site was in the Campaign, resulting in an improved outcome.

### Beyond septic shock: who else requires immediate antibiotics [^116u9zSX]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Landmark studies published almost 20 years ago documented strong associations between time to antibiotic therapy and mortality in critically ill patients, most of whom had septic shock. These findings catalyzed early versions of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign that recommended administering antibiotics within one hour after the diagnosis of sepsis with any acute organ dysfunction, not just septic shock. Some state and national quality metrics further extended this guidance, requiring rapid administration of antibiotic therapy for all patients with suspected sepsis or septic shock.

Sepsis, however, is a broad and heterogeneous syndrome that encompasses a wide range of inciting organisms, sites of infection, and patterns of organ dysfunctions. These differences are magnified by host factors, including extremes of age, comorbidities, and immune function. The manifestations of sepsis, prognoses, and the impact of therapy are very different for a young and healthy host with bacterial pneumonia compared with a geriatric patient with cancer complicated by neutropenia and disseminated fungal infection.

The latest version of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines recognizes some of this variability. The 2021 guidelines suggest that patients be stratified by certainty of infection and severity of illness. Specifically, they advise antibiotic therapy within one hour after recognition in all patients with possible septic shock and all patients with definite or probable sepsis without shock. In patients with possible sepsis without shock, however, in whom the diagnosis of infection is uncertain, a more cautious approach may be warranted.

### The effect of early goal-directed therapy on outcome in adult severe sepsis and septic shock patients: A meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^111fee28]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) on ICU mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock patients has been examined in four trials that reported ICU mortality outcomes. EGDT significantly reduced ICU mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock patients with a relative risk (RR) of 0.72 and a 99% confidence interval (CI) of 0.57–0.90 (P = 0.0002).

- **The effect of EGDT on mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock patients with different severity of illness**: In evaluating the impact of early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) on mortality among patients with varying severity of illness due to severe sepsis and septic shock, the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (APACHE II score) was used. The data were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or medians with interquartile ranges. The distinction between higher severity of illness and less severity was made based on the mean APACHE II scores reported in each article. In five trials, the APACHE II score of included patients was greater than 20, whereas in the remaining three, it was either less than 20 or unclear. For patients with a higher severity of disease (APACHE II score ≥ 20), there was a trend towards mortality benefit favoring EGDT with an RR of 0.87 and a 99% CI of 0.74–1.03 (P = 0.03) when compared with control care.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^114zHw6V]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

- **Design**: A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings for committee members who attended the conferences. A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset and enforced throughout the process. The entire guidelines process was conducted independently of industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co-chairs, vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic discussions among subgroups and the entire committee were integral to the development process.

- **Methods**: The authors adhered to the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. This system guided the assessment of the quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and helped determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of critically ill patients and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

- **Results**: Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^113p97aa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a multifaceted host response to an infecting pathogen that may be significantly amplified by endogenous factors. If left untreated, it may lead to the functional impairment of one or more vital organs or systems. There are many well-known risk factors for the infections that most commonly precipitate organ dysfunction, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, many cancers, the use of immunosuppressive agents, and advanced age. Although significant progress has been made, the pathophysiological mechanisms for organ dysfunction are not entirely known. It has become apparent that infection triggers a much more complex, variable, and prolonged host response, involving the early activation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory responses.

Sepsis has variable clinical presentations depending on the initial site of infection, the causative organism, the pattern of acute organ dysfunction, and the underlying health status of the patient. There is a general consensus that early recognition and timely treatment largely determine the outcome of sepsis.

Since the first classification in 1991, the definitions of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock, although imprecise, have provided clinicians with a useful framework for clinical management. Stressing the need for early recognition, and when these criteria are followed by applying the Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommendations, they have a notable history of success in reducing sepsis mortality in several areas of the world.

### Sepsis: Key insights, future directions, and immediate goals. A review and expert opinion [^117D2nTa]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

This review explores the landscape and evolving understanding of sepsis, highlighting both challenges and future directions. Sepsis remains a major global health burden, with diverse clinical presentations complicating timely diagnosis and management. Existing definitions, including the Sepsis-3 criteria, emphasize the importance of organ dysfunction, yet early sepsis detection remains limited by available tools. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, though widely used, may not fully capture early stages of infection or account for complex presentations like noncatecholamine-resistant shock.

Additionally, the review underscores the pressing need for standardized terminology across sepsis and shock characterization to ensure consistency in diagnosis and treatment strategies. Accessible, resource-adapted solutions are particularly crucial in low- and middle-income countries where sepsis-related mortality rates are higher due to limited resources. Future research should focus on developing and validating integrated, multi-parameter tools that combine clinical, biochemical, and microbiological data to improve sepsis outcomes globally. Advancing sepsis care will require both technological innovation and collaborative, globally consistent guidelines to bridge disparities in healthcare delivery.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: Considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^114iswjs]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a leading cause of global mortality in children, yet definitions for pediatric sepsis are outdated and lack global applicability and validity. In adults, the Sepsis-3 Definition Taskforce queried databases from high-income countries to develop and validate the criteria. The merit of this definition has been widely acknowledged; however, important considerations about less-resourced and more diverse settings pose challenges to its use globally. To improve applicability and relevance, the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce sought to develop a conceptual framework and rationale for the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the optimal operationalization of future pediatric sepsis definitions.

It is important to address challenges in developing a set of pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illnesses with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. Ideal criteria need to be unambiguous and capable of adapting to the different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. Additionally, criteria need to facilitate early recognition and timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression and limit life-threatening organ dysfunction.

To address these challenges, locally adaptable solutions are required, which permit individualized care based on available resources and the pretest probability of sepsis. This should facilitate affordable diagnostics that support risk stratification and prediction of likely treatment responses while providing solutions for locally relevant contexts.

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^115EQsJt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The Sepsis-3 definitions, which require the presence of organ dysfunction to define sepsis, may hinder awareness of the importance of early recognition and treatment of infections before organ dysfunction appears, de-emphasizing intervention at earlier stages when it is most treatable.

Ideally, patients at risk for sepsis should be identified before organ dysfunction is established. Therefore, it may be questionable if it is helpful to have a definition that recognizes a patient once organ dysfunction has occurred and the patient already needs intensive care.

An observational study conducted at 132 medical institutions worldwide over a 4-month period enrolled 4,533 patients to validate a predictive score for patients with intra-abdominal infections. Data from the WSES cIAIs Score Study (WISS) showed that mortality was significantly affected by the previous sepsis definition. Mortality rates were 1.2% with no sepsis, 4.4% with sepsis, 27.8% with severe sepsis, and 67.8% with septic shock. Severity of illness and the inherent mortality risk escalated from no sepsis through sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock.

The previous stratification of severity and consequent mortality due to infection that progressed from no sepsis to sepsis (infection meeting the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome or SIRS), to severe sepsis (sepsis with organ failure, arterial hypertension, and/or hypoperfusion), to septic shock (arterial hypotension refractory to adequate volume resuscitation) is now reduced to simple infection, sepsis (infection and organ dysfunction).

### Is restriction of intravenous fluid beneficial for septic shock in ICU patients? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114qKpRA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. It is a life-threatening condition caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. This condition is characterized by an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses. Septic shock is the most critical stage of sepsis progression. The latest guidelines define sepsis as the presence of hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation and the need to rely on vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure ≥ 60 mmHg. The mortality rate of sepsis can reach 50% or higher. Under the new classification of shock types, septic shock is categorized as distributional shock owing to its unique mechanism of occurrence. The pathophysiology of septic shock includes loss of vascular tone regulation and increased vascular permeability, which cause abnormal vascular volume distribution and fluid leakage into the interstitial tissue.

The cornerstone of septic shock treatment is fluid resuscitation and the use of positive inotropic agents, as well as vasopressors, to increase cardiac preload and organ perfusion. For patients with septic shock, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) expert consensus guidelines recommend rapid resuscitation with a minimum of 30 ml/kg isotonic crystalloid intravenously within the first 3 hours. This recommendation is based on retrospective studies and randomized controlled trials on the hemodynamic management of sepsis. However, there is limited evidence to guide fluid management after initial fluid resuscitation in septic shock. Intravenous fluids can increase cardiac output.

### Sepsis subphenotypes, theragnostics and personalized sepsis care [^113VeMWH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sepsis is a heterogeneous condition characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. Globally, sepsis accounts for eleven million deaths each year and continues to be one of the leading causes of death. Treatment has remained fundamentally unchanged over decades and comprises early antibiotics, source control, and supportive care with interventions such as intravenous fluids and vasopressors.

No biological therapies that modulate the host response have reached sustained clinical practice, with many negative or neutral clinical trials. The reason for this is at least in part due to the clinical, microbiological, and immunological heterogeneity of sepsis, where patients with similar disease entities can have very different presentations or responses to treatment. Increasing recognition of the immunological concepts underpinning heterogeneity, including resistance, disease tolerance, and repair, may enable the identification of further mechanisms which could be targeted by therapeutics.

Furthermore, there is also emerging evidence that this heterogeneity extends to individual patients' response to interventions: while some patients may derive benefit from an intervention, others may not and may even experience harm. In order to better target treatments and deliver effective therapies, it is necessary to identify which patients will benefit from specific therapies. This personalized medicine approach has been identified as a research priority by clinicians, patients, and their families.

### Global, regional, and national sepsis incidence and mortality, 1990–2017: Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study [^113FbjAh]. Lancet (2020). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We used GBD 2017 data to produce sepsis estimates consistent with other GBD estimates. By contrast with previous hospital-based approaches, vital registration death records served as the primary basis for our estimates because they represent deaths both in and out of hospital. Utilizing these records is essential for global sepsis estimates since much of the sepsis burden could be incurred outside of the hospital, particularly in low-income or middle-income countries. We initially estimated sepsis-related mortality using multiple cause-of-death vital registration data and age-specific, sex-specific, location-specific, and cause-specific GBD 2017 estimates for all causes of death worldwide, from 1990 to 2017. We estimated the incidence of sepsis by applying modelled sepsis-related case-fatality from hospital administrative data to mortality estimates. We adhered to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) recommendations.

- **Defining sepsis**: Sepsis is diagnosed clinically by the presence of acute infection and new organ dysfunction. Unlike the previous idea of septicaemia, which was a non-specific term describing an individual who appeared unwell and had a bloodstream infection, the modern notion of sepsis extends across bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens. It focuses on the host response as the major source of morbidity and mortality and requires only that infection be suspected rather than proven, in recognition that many cases do not have such confirmation.

### What sepsis researchers can learn from COVID-19 [^113SxXNQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Outcome measures for sepsis clinical trials have been frequently discussed. Trials using novel therapeutic options have failed to demonstrate a benefit in general outcomes such as rates of ICU admission or mortality. In 2005, the International Sepsis Forum proposed that sepsis researchers should widen the breadth of outcome measures used in clinical trials. Mortality is an attractive outcome measure, but other patient-centered benefits, such as quality of life and long-term morbidity, should not be overlooked. The International Sepsis Forum colloquium provided additional clinically relevant possibilities to show the benefits of a treatment. Nevertheless, the literature on new therapeutics for sepsis continues to be dominated by the search for short-term mortality benefits.

For COVID-19, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized that a core set of outcome measures was needed to investigate this new disease and compare outcomes globally. Experts who proposed the outcome measures for sepsis in 2005 also did so for COVID-19 in 2020. This time, a minimal common outcome measures set was used globally.

Another advantage of focusing on a more defined disease state, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection, in contrast to all-cause sepsis, is that site-specific outcome measures can be used. For instance, the Murray score to assess lung injury or diffusion capacity to assess pulmonary function are valuable outcomes that could potentially be improved by certain treatments. Obviously, it does not make sense to assess pulmonary function as an outcome in all sepsis cases.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^117Y8Ryt]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of sepsis and septic shock, particularly concerning antimicrobial therapy indications, the SSC 2021 guidelines recommend a time-limited course of rapid investigation for adult patients with possible sepsis without shock. Antimicrobials should be administered within 3 hours from the time sepsis is first recognized if there is a persistent concern for infection.

### Surviving sepsis campaign: Research priorities for sepsis and septic shock [^117UUHPH]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify research priorities in the management, epidemiology, outcomes, and underlying causes of sepsis and septic shock.

A consensus committee of 16 international experts, representing the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, was convened at their annual meetings. Subgroups engaged in teleconference and electronic-based discussions. The entire committee iteratively developed the document and recommendations.

Each committee member independently offered their top five priorities for sepsis research. In total, 88 suggestions were submitted (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/CCM/D636). These were grouped into categories by committee co-chairs, forming seven subgroups: infection, fluids and vasoactive agents, adjunctive therapy, administration/epidemiology, scoring/identification, post-intensive care unit, and basic/translational science. Each subgroup held teleconferences to deliberate on priorities, followed by formal voting within each subgroup. The entire committee then voted on top priorities across all subgroups, except for basic/translational science.

The Surviving Sepsis Research Committee has identified 26 priorities for sepsis and septic shock. Among these, the top six clinical priorities were highlighted, including: 1) determining whether targeted/personalized/precision medicine approaches can identify which therapies will work for specific patients at specific times; and 2) establishing ideal endpoints for volume resuscitation and determining appropriate strategies for volume management in patients.

### The surviving sepsis campaign: Fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy research priorities in adult patients [^116Xkvmv]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a long-standing initiative of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, designed to improve mortality from sepsis. The campaign has released four sets of guidelines, with another due to be published in 2021. Although recommendations within the SSC guidelines have been associated with improved outcomes, the guidelines are often unable to make more specific recommendations in multiple areas of clinical importance due to ongoing gaps in the literature.

In an attempt to define priorities for research within the field of sepsis, the SSC created a research committee charged with developing a list of research questions related to sepsis. This led to the joint publication of "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Research Priorities for Sepsis and Septic Shock" in Critical Care Medicine and Intensive Care Medicine in August 2018. The initial document presented a broad overview, identifying 26 questions to explore as research priorities in several domains, with an explicit intention to publish separate papers with more detailed descriptions for each domain in the future. This article is the second in a series of manuscripts (following a prior effort devoted to basic science research), which will expand upon the three research questions related to fluid resuscitation and vasopressors originating from the broader publication.

### Developing a new definition and assessing new clinical criteria for septic shock: For the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3) [^112suHuL]. JAMA (2016). High credibility.

Septic shock currently refers to a state of acute circulatory failure associated with infection. Emerging biological insights and reported variation in epidemiology challenge the validity of this definition.

To develop a new definition and clinical criteria for identifying septic shock in adults, the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine convened a task force of 19 participants to revise the sepsis/septic shock definitions. Three sets of studies were conducted:

- **Systematic review and meta-analysis**: Observational studies in adults published between January 1, 1992, and December 25, 2015, were analyzed to determine clinical criteria currently reported to identify septic shock and to inform the Delphi process.
- **Delphi study**: The task force conducted three surveys and discussed results from the systematic review, surveys, and cohort studies to achieve consensus on a new septic shock definition and clinical criteria.
- **Cohort studies**: Tests were conducted on variables identified by the Delphi process using Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) (2005–2010; n = 28,150), University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) (2010–2012; n = 1,309,025), and Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) (2009–2013; n = 1,847,165) electronic health record (EHR) data sets.

The primary focus was on evidence for and agreement on septic shock definitions and criteria.

The systematic review identified 44 studies reporting septic shock outcomes, involving a total of 166,479 patients from a broader compilation of 92 sepsis studies.

The objective of this update is to continue the work of the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock: 2012".

- **Design**: A consensus committee of 55 international experts from 25 organizations was formed. Nominal groups met at key international conferences for committee members attending. A conflict-of-interest policy was developed and enforced throughout. A separate meeting for all panel members occurred in December 2015, and teleconferences and electronic discussions among subgroups and the entire committee were key components of the development process.

- **Methods**: The panel focused on five sections: hemodynamics, infection, adjunctive therapies, metabolic, and ventilation. Population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes (PICO) questions were updated, and evidence profiles were generated. Each subgroup listed questions, searched for the best evidence, and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to assess evidence quality from high to very low, formulating strong or weak recommendations, or best practice statements.

- **Results**: The panel provided 93 statements on the early management and resuscitation of sepsis or septic shock patients. Of these, 32 were strong recommendations, 39 were weak recommendations, and 18 were best-practice statements. No recommendation was given for four areas.

### Laboratory diagnosis of sepsis? No SIRS, not just yet [^115dkGek]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

In order to maximize the benefit of prompt antimicrobial therapy and avoid the risk associated with the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents, patients with suspected sepsis must be rapidly differentiated from patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In combination with standard microbiological testing, a number of biomarkers have been recently evaluated for this purpose, and the performance characteristics of the most promising of these are reviewed.

The 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines for medical management of sepsis and septic shock, particularly regarding fluid resuscitation, recommend considering the administration of intravenous crystalloid fluid. Specifically, at least 30 mL/kg should be administered within the first 3 hours of resuscitation in patients experiencing sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or septic shock.

### Sepsis subclasses: A framework for development and interpretation [^1121f4tW]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Sepsis is defined as a dysregulated host response to infection that leads to life-threatening acute organ dysfunction. It afflicts approximately 50 million people worldwide annually and is often deadly, even when evidence-based guidelines are applied promptly. Many randomized trials have tested therapies for sepsis over the past two decades, but most have not proven beneficial. This may be because sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome, characterized by a vast set of clinical and biological features. Combinations of these features, however, may identify previously unrecognized groups or "subclasses" with different risks of outcome and response to a given treatment.

As efforts to identify sepsis subclasses become more common, many unanswered questions and challenges arise, including:

- **The semantic underpinning of sepsis subclasses**: Considerations on the terminology used.
- **The conceptual goal of subclasses**: Understanding the objectives behind defining subclasses.
- **Considerations about study design, data sources, and statistical methods**: Methodological approaches must be scrutinized.
- **The role of emerging data types**: Evaluating new data types and their integration.
- **How to determine whether subclasses represent "truth"**: Validating the authenticity of identified subclasses.

We discuss these challenges and present a framework for the broader study of sepsis subclasses. This framework is intended to aid in the understanding and interpretation of sepsis subclasses, provide a mechanism for explaining subclasses generated by different methodological approaches, and guide clinicians in considering subclasses in bedside care.

In this special article from the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, we present a conceptual framework and a rationale for the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the operationalization of sepsis definitions in children around the world. These include biological factors, epidemiology, differences in the pathways to care, pretest probabilities of sepsis at different levels of care, and the resources that are available to provide care.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: Considerations for the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce [^114Nb3j3]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Across the world, substantial morbidity, mortality, expense, and adverse impacts on healthcare systems are attributed to pediatric sepsis. Unfortunately, variability in the operationalization of pediatric sepsis definitions leads to difficulties in measuring the burden of sepsis and optimizing management and may compromise quality improvement initiatives. In many settings, "sepsis" has been used synonymously with "severe infection", resulting in substantial challenges and variability in recognition and coding for sepsis. Although Sepsis-3 definitions were intended to unify the various definitions and terminologies, they have some limitations when applied to the global healthcare community. These limitations are even more pronounced when considering pediatric age groups. There are significant differences in the epidemiology, biology, susceptibility, and approach to sepsis management between adults and children. These differences are magnified between high-income country (HIC) and upper middle-income country (UMIC) settings compared with low-income country and low middle-income country (LMIC) settings, where the majority of pediatric sepsis occurs.

Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection, but there are no validated measures that determine when a child transitions from having an "infection" to having "sepsis". The purpose of establishing criteria for pediatric sepsis is to support a structured process for the early diagnosis of sepsis and the development of appropriate interventions for that diagnosis.

### Adjudication of codes for identifying sepsis in hospital administrative data by expert consensus [^114BjKAW]. Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

- **Key points**:
	- **Question**: Can expert consensus develop an administrative data definition of hospitalized sepsis that includes less severe cases?
	- **Findings**: AlgorithmL includes 720 of 1,928 infection codes, and 50 of 108 organ dysfunction codes. In a large Canadian city, annual incidence rates per 100,000 were 91 in the ICU and 291 in the non-ICU cohort. Hospital sepsis mortality rates were 24% in ICU and 17% in non-ICU cohorts. Compared with other common algorithms, AlgorithmL includes more codes, indicates higher incidence, lower mortality, and fewer meeting the Adult Sepsis Event criteria.
	- **Meanings**: AlgorithmL may more fully encompass the full range of sepsis severity.

Sepsis is a major global health problem, with 50 million cases and 10 million deaths annually. The World Health Assembly recognizes sepsis as a global health priority and suggests countries take action, including surveillance to monitor incidence and outcomes of sepsis. Of note, before 2016, infection-related acute organ dysfunction was called severe sepsis and is still referred to as such in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) coding.

The two main approaches to sepsis monitoring are code-based administrative data algorithms and electronic health record (EHR)-based algorithms, such as the Centers for Disease Control Adult Sepsis Event (ASE). Although EHR-based approaches have less bias due to temporal changes and variation in clinician recognition and labeling of sepsis, EHR systems are not universally available, even in high-income countries. Thus, code-based algorithms remain the preferred method in many settings.

### A framework for the development and interpretation of different sepsis definitions and clinical criteria [^115JiwrE]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although sepsis was described more than 2,000 years ago and clinicians still struggle to define it, there is no "gold standard", and multiple competing approaches and terms exist. Challenges include the ever-changing knowledge base that informs our understanding of sepsis, competing views on which aspects of any potential definition are most important, and the tendency of most potential criteria to be distributed in at-risk populations in such a way as to hinder separation into discrete sets of patients. We propose that the development and evaluation of any definition or diagnostic criteria should follow these 4 steps:

- **Define the epistemologic underpinning**: Agree on all relevant terms used to frame the exercise.
- **State the intended purpose**: For any proposed set of criteria, adopt a scientific approach to inform on their usefulness with regard to the intended purpose.

Usefulness can be measured across six domains:

1. **Reliability**: Stability of criteria during retesting, between raters, over time, and across settings.
2. **Content validity**: Similar to face validity.
3. **Construct validity**: Whether criteria measure what they purport to measure.
4. **Criterion validity**: How new criteria fare compared to standards.
5. **Measurement burden**: Cost, safety, and complexity.
6. **Timeliness**: Whether criteria are available concurrent with care decisions.

The relative importance of these domains of usefulness depends on the intended purpose, of which there are four broad categories:

- **Clinical care**
- **Research**
- **Surveillance**
- **Quality improvement and audit**

### Raising concerns about the sepsis-3 definitions [^1148pq6L]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of sepsis involves a complex interaction between the host immune system and the infecting microorganisms. Sepsis describes a broad-based syndrome covering many infectious agents, affecting various sites in patients of differing age, gender, and comorbidity. Its clinical manifestations are highly variable and may lead to severe organ dysfunction and death. Despite remarkable advances in the management of patients with sepsis, its recognition and timely, appropriate treatment remain of utmost importance.

The Sepsis-3 definitions underline the concept of a dysregulated immune response resulting in potentially modifiable life-threatening organ dysfunction. However, they may fail in identifying patients with serious infections before organ dysfunction ensues.

- **Downplaying infections**: Infections that do not meet the Sepsis-3 criteria may hinder their identification, resulting in an unnecessary increase in both morbidity and mortality due to their inexorable progression in the following hours.

- **Clear definitions for sepsis**: Sepsis and septic shock should guide clinicians both to support early recognition of at-risk patients and to facilitate an understanding of the global epidemiology of sepsis.

Sepsis is a burden for global health. Its global nature calls for a global response, both in the geographic sense and across the whole range of sectors involved.

In this paper, we have raised our concerns regarding the Sepsis-3 definitions. We believe that in order for sepsis definitions to be universally accepted, they should facilitate clinical care on a global scale.

### Operationalizing appropriate sepsis definitions in children worldwide: Considerations for the pediatric sepsis definition taskforce [^114rS8PN]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Sepsis is a leading cause of global mortality in children, yet definitions for pediatric sepsis are outdated and lack global applicability and validity. In adults, the Sepsis-3 Definition Taskforce queried databases from high-income countries to develop and validate the criteria. The merit of this definition has been widely acknowledged; however, important considerations about less-resourced and more diverse settings pose challenges to its use globally. To improve applicability and relevance globally, the Pediatric Sepsis Definition Taskforce sought to develop a conceptual framework and rationale of the critical aspects and context-specific factors that must be considered for the optimal operationalization of future pediatric sepsis definitions.

It is important to address challenges in developing a set of pediatric sepsis criteria which capture manifestations of illnesses with vastly different etiologies and underlying mechanisms. Ideal criteria need to be unambiguous and capable of adapting to the different contexts in which children with suspected infections are present around the globe. Additionally, criteria need to facilitate early recognition and timely escalation of treatment to prevent progression and limit life-threatening organ dysfunction. To address these challenges, locally adaptable solutions are required, which permit individualized care based on available resources and the pretest probability of sepsis. This should facilitate affordable diagnostics which support risk stratification and prediction of likely treatment responses.

### Sepsis in the 21st century: Recent definitions and therapeutic advances [^115QLdp9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Sepsis as a disease has received renewed interest since recent publications of a revised clinical definition and crucial clinical trials showing the benefits of early goal-directed resuscitation, recombinant human activated protein C, and low-dose corticosteroids. The epidemiology of sepsis has also been further examined. Management guidelines and international quality improvement efforts have been developed targeting increased disease identification, clinician education, and optimal patient care, resulting in decreased patient mortality. The evidence suggests that early recognition and early intervention are most important in affecting outcomes. This article summarizes these developments in the diagnosis and management of sepsis at the turn of this century.

### Defining and diagnosing sepsis [^1139SkNw]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome that encompasses infections of many different types and severity. Not surprisingly, it has confounded most attempts to apply a single definition, which has also limited the ability to develop a set of reliable diagnostic criteria. It is perhaps best defined as the different clinical syndromes produced by an immune response to infection that causes harm to the body beyond that of the local effects of the infection.

### What's new in sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings [^111jp5j1]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is associated with bacterial, fungal, viral, protozoal (e.g. malaria), or tropical infections. We provided a set of simple, readily available, and affordable recommendations on recognizing sepsis and identifying the underlying type of infection, the causative microbiological pathogen, and septic shock in resource-limited settings. As most evidence originates from resource-rich settings, there is an urgent need for related research in resource-limited settings.

### Impact of the surviving sepsis campaign on the recognition and management of severe sepsis in the emergency department: Are we failing [^1112gT8q]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2011). Low credibility.

Severe sepsis/septic shock (SS/SS) has a high mortality rate. Over the past decade, there has been a concerted international effort to tackle this problem through the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC). However, bundle delivery remains problematic. In 2009, the College of Emergency Medicine (CEM) set out guidelines for the management of SS/SS, establishing the standards for this audit.

- **Objectives**: To assess the recognition and management of patients presenting with SS/SS across three emergency departments (EDs) within the West Midlands.

- **Methods**: Data were collected retrospectively over a 3-month period. Patients in the ED with a diagnostic code of, or presenting complaint suggestive of, sepsis had their scanned notes assessed for evidence of SS/SS. Compliance with the CEM guidelines and evidence of referral to the intensive care staff were evaluated.

- **Results**: A total of 255 patients with SS/SS were identified. Of these, 17% (44/255) were documented as septic by ED staff. The CEM standard of care was received in 41% of those with a documented diagnosis of severe sepsis in the ED, and 23% of patients with SS/SS overall. 89% of patients received the 'treatment' aspects of care: oxygen, IV antibiotics, and IV fluids. Twelve patients with a raised lactate level and normal blood pressure (cryptic shock) failed to receive fluid resuscitation. 71% of patients with SS/SS had no documented discussion or consideration of referral to the intensive care unit.

- **Conclusions**: The SSC has had some impact; however, there is still a long way to go. It is assumed that the picture is similar in EDs across the region.

### Identifying patients with sepsis on the hospital wards [^116vYcDt]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Sepsis contributes to up to half of all deaths in hospitalized patients, and early interventions, such as appropriate antibiotics, have been shown to improve outcomes. Most research has focused on early identification and treatment of patients with sepsis in the emergency department (ED) and the intensive care unit (ICU); however, many patients acquire sepsis on the general wards. The goal of this review is to discuss recent advances in the detection of sepsis in patients on the hospital wards.

We discuss data highlighting the benefits and limitations of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria for screening patients with sepsis, such as its low specificity, as well as newly described scoring systems, including the proposed role of the quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score. Challenges specific to detecting sepsis on the wards are discussed, and future directions that use big data approaches and automated alert systems are highlighted.

### Sepsis: A roadmap for future research [^112eJYYS]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a common and lethal syndrome; although outcomes have improved, mortality remains high. No specific anti-sepsis treatments exist; as such, management of patients relies mainly on early recognition, allowing correct therapeutic measures to be started rapidly, including administration of appropriate antibiotics, source control measures when necessary, and resuscitation with intravenous fluids and vasoactive drugs when needed.

Although substantial developments have been made in understanding the basic pathogenesis of sepsis and the complex interplay of host, pathogen, and environment that affect the incidence and course of the disease, sepsis has stubbornly resisted all efforts to successfully develop and then deploy new and improved treatments. Existing models of clinical research seem increasingly unlikely to produce new therapies that will result in a step change in clinical outcomes.

In this Commission, we set out our understanding of the clinical epidemiology and management of sepsis and then ask how the present approaches might be challenged to develop a new roadmap for future research.

### Comment on "Surviving sepsis campaign: International guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008" by Dellinger et al [^116skvWv]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the revised SSC guidelines have certainly been improved by the use of the GRADE system to classify the strength of the recommendations. However, a strong recommendation in favor of the use of SDD should have been implemented. The strong recommendations in favor of stress ulcer prophylaxis and glucose control are not in line with evidence.

### Long-term outcome and quality-adjusted life years after severe sepsis [^114Hsrx5]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The objective was to study long-term mortality, quality of life (QOL), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs per QALY in an unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patient population with severe sepsis.

- **Design**: Prospective observational cohort study.

- **Setting**: Twenty-four ICUs in Finland.

- **Patients**: A total of 470 adult patients with severe sepsis who were treated in ICUs between November 1, 2004, and February 28, 2005. The QOL before critical illness was assessed in 252 patients, and QOL after severe sepsis in 156 patients (58% of the patients surviving as of April 30, 2006). Ninety-eight patients responded to both questionnaires. QOL was assessed by a generic EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) measurement with summary index (EQsum) and visual analogue scale (VAS).

- **Measurements and main results**: The 2-year mortality after severe sepsis was 44.9% (211 of 470). The median response time for QOL assessment after severe sepsis was 17 months (interquartile range [IQR] 16–18). The median EQsum (75, IQR 56–92) and EQ VAS (66, IQR 50–80) were lower after severe sepsis than age- and sex-adjusted reference values (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The decrease between the mean EQsum reference value and that of severe sepsis patients was 12 (95% confidence interval, 9–16). The difference between the mean EQ VAS reference values and the mean EQ VAS was 8 (95% CI, 5–11). The mean calculated QALYs after severe sepsis were 10.9 (95% CI, 9.7–12.1), and the calculated cost for one QALY was only €2,139 for all survivors and non-survivors.

- **Conclusions**: Two-year mortality after severe sepsis was high (44.9%).

### What's new in sepsis recognition in resource-limited settings [^114djv1k]. Intensive Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by one or more organ dysfunctions due to a dysregulated host response to infection, or in certain cases, due to direct pathogen effects. Sepsis is not only associated with bacterial or fungal infections but also with any other infection such as viral disease, protozoal (e.g. malaria), or tropical infections. Although the literature suggests that sepsis is predominantly a healthcare issue in resource-rich countries, the global burden of acute infections is highest in resource-limited areas. Successful sepsis management relies on various components, of which early recognition is essential. Evidence and recommendations for sepsis recognition are mainly based on research performed in resource-rich settings. However, resource-rich and resource-limited countries differ in healthcare accessibility and infectious disease epidemiology. It is therefore unreasonable to directly translate evidence between these settings.

The Global Intensive Care Working Group of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, together with the Mahidol-Oxford Research Unit, formed an international team of physicians to revise existing recommendations for sepsis management in resource-limited settings. In this manuscript, we summarize recommendations on sepsis recognition. A detailed description of the guideline team, conflicts of interest, methods, rationales, and references is given in the online supplement.
