## Question

Management of tachycardia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of tachycardia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and hemodynamic assessment. Then, I should verify the ECG-based classification into narrow versus wide complex and regular versus irregular. Next, I will consider mechanism-specific acute therapies for narrow-complex SVT, followed by the approach to wide-complex tachycardia including VT versus SVT with aberrancy. After that, I need to address special scenarios like pre-excitation, pregnancy, and electrical storm. Finally, I will outline long-term management, follow-up, and key safety pearls, ensuring each step aligns with contemporary guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the priorities in the initial assessment: airway, breathing, circulation, oxygenation, IV access, continuous ECG monitoring, and a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia if feasible, because mechanism identification drives therapy and delays in ECG acquisition are common in the ED setting where SVT accounts for roughly 50,000 visits annually and the mechanism is often unknown at presentation [^1166JbEB] [^1152t553] [^112NuTmB].

> Wait, let me verify the hemodynamic stability definition before committing to drugs versus electricity: instability includes hypotension, shock, acute pulmonary edema, ischemic chest pain, or altered mental status, and in such cases immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated regardless of mechanism, whereas stable patients can proceed with diagnostic and pharmacologic therapy first [^111RB2Ve] [^114itWXL] [^11793xYn].

> I will now examine the ECG to classify the tachycardia, because treatment diverges sharply: narrow-complex rhythms have QRS less than 120 ms and wide-complex rhythms have QRS 120 ms or more, and I should also determine regularity and look for P waves and AV relationships to infer mechanism, since AVNRT and AVRT are typically regular with short RP intervals, whereas atrial fibrillation and multifocal atrial tachycardia are irregular, and atrial flutter often shows atrial rates exceeding ventricular rates with sawtooth flutter waves [^111nrZQN] [^112oYoDT] [^112W2LLp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about wide-complex tachycardia. I should confirm that in undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia it is safest to assume ventricular tachycardia until proven otherwise, using validated bedside criteria such as AV dissociation, extreme axis deviation, concordance, and Brugada or Vereckei features, while remembering that adenosine may be considered only in regular, monomorphic wide-complex tachycardia when the diagnosis is uncertain and there is no pre-excitation, primarily as a diagnostic maneuver rather than definitive therapy [^111kp74T] [^111zzfUm] [^114MAGAw].

> For regular narrow-complex SVT of unknown mechanism, let me think about first-line maneuvers: vagal techniques such as the modified Valsalva improve conversion rates compared with standard Valsalva, and if that fails, IV adenosine 6 mg rapid push with a 12 mg second dose if needed is highly effective for AVNRT and orthodromic AVRT, with success around 95 percent in AVNRT and the added benefit of unmasking atrial activity to aid diagnosis [^113vjRT7] [^1125UJZG] [^111te4zr].

> If adenosine fails or is contraindicated, I should double-check that IV nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or beta-blockers are reasonable next steps in stable patients, with diltiazem or verapamil and agents like metoprolol or esmolol as options, while avoiding these in hypotension or decompensated heart failure, and if pharmacologic therapy fails, synchronized cardioversion is appropriate [^112b9Mas] [^112PRmGD] [^111te4zr].

> Let me consider focal atrial tachycardia specifically: if the diagnosis is established, IV beta-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are first-line for rate control or conversion, adenosine can be diagnostic and sometimes therapeutic, and IV amiodarone or ibutilide are reasonable alternatives when first-line agents fail, with synchronized cardioversion reserved for instability or drug-refractory cases [^113qauDu] [^113i1feu] [^114kygUT].

> For atrial flutter, I need to ensure anticoagulation is addressed if flutter has persisted 48 hours or more or if the duration is unknown, and then I can use rate control with beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, consider pharmacologic cardioversion with ibutilide or dofetilide, or proceed to synchronized cardioversion, noting that rapid atrial pacing is an option when pacing wires are in place and that catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus is often definitive [^111QRVQg] [^114ePz3V].

> But wait, what if this is inappropriate sinus tachycardia rather than a reentrant SVT? I should confirm the diagnosis of exclusion with resting heart rate above 100 bpm, mean 24-hour rate above 90 bpm, and absence of secondary causes, and management focuses on treating triggers, lifestyle measures, and symptom-directed therapy with beta-blockers or ivabradine rather than acute antiarrhythmic strategies [^114fL7YJ] [^113Qk5hB] [^112459Bv].

> Now, for wide-complex tachycardia, I should confirm the principle that electricity is prioritized in instability: immediate synchronized cardioversion for hemodynamic compromise, while in stable patients I can consider procainamide, amiodarone, or lidocaine depending on context, with procainamide favored for early conversion of stable monomorphic VT and amiodarone useful for recurrent or unstable VT, and I must avoid verapamil or diltiazem in undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia because they can precipitate collapse, especially in VT or pre-excited AF [^116MfpuK] [^111JMqfg] [^111RB2Ve].

> I should double-check adenosine use in wide-complex rhythms: it is reasonable only for regular, monomorphic wide-complex tachycardia when the diagnosis is uncertain and there is no pre-excitation, primarily to reveal SVT with aberrancy if it converts, whereas adenosine is contraindicated in irregular or polymorphic wide-complex tachycardias and in known pre-excited AF [^114MAGAw] [^113r5KTn] [^114YpGcP].

> For pre-excited atrial fibrillation, hold on, I should verify that AV nodal blockers such as beta-blockers, diltiazem, verapamil, adenosine, or digoxin are harmful because they may accelerate ventricular rates via the accessory pathway and precipitate VF. Instead, preferred acute therapy is ibutilide, procainamide, or synchronized cardioversion, and definitive management is catheter ablation of the accessory pathway [^111te4zr] [^114PUCDJ] [^114fL7YJ].

> In pregnancy, let me reconsider medication safety: vagal maneuvers and adenosine are first-line, synchronized cardioversion is safe when needed, and if adenosine fails, beta-blockers such as metoprolol are reasonable, with verapamil as a secondary option and procainamide or amiodarone reserved for refractory or life-threatening cases after weighing fetal risks [^116QnLVu].

> For electrical storm with recurrent VT or VF, I need to ensure a structured approach: confirm device programming and correct reversible causes including ischemia and electrolytes, initiate aggressive beta-blockade, consider IV amiodarone or lidocaine depending on ischemia, and escalate to sedation, intubation, and autonomic modulation or catheter ablation if refractory, as early multidisciplinary intervention improves outcomes [^117Tahde] [^113dhbnH] [^1135Cgue].

> Turning to long-term management, I should confirm that recurrent symptomatic SVT warrants discussion of curative catheter ablation as first-line definitive therapy, with AVNRT and AVRT ablation success rates typically exceeding 90 percent, while rate-control drugs such as beta-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are reasonable alternatives for patients declining or unsuitable for ablation, and antiarrhythmics like flecainide or propafenone can be considered in selected patients without structural heart disease [^115P2TML] [^1124vjR8] [^113ucCj8].

> Let me verify atrial flutter specifics: cavotricuspid isthmus ablation is highly effective and often preferred as first-line therapy for recurrent CTI-dependent flutter, with anticoagulation aligned to atrial fibrillation protocols and rhythm-maintenance options including dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone tailored to comorbidities and ventricular function [^114ePz3V] [^111QRVQg].

> I should confirm follow-up priorities: all patients merit education on vagal maneuvers and a rescue plan, those with syncope or high-risk features warrant expedited electrophysiology referral, and patients with ICDs who receive shocks should have device interrogation, programming optimization, and adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy to reduce shocks and improve quality of life [^1124vjR8] [^111BT9Fi].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety pearls are explicit: never give verapamil or diltiazem for undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia, avoid AV nodal blockade in pre-excited AF, screen for and correct reversible precipitants like ischemia, electrolyte derangements, and drug toxicity, and use synchronized cardioversion rather than unsynchronized shocks to avoid inducing VF in unstable but perfusing rhythms [^111JMqfg] [^111te4zr] [^114bFhQU].

Tachycardia management starts with **ABC stabilization** and a **12-lead ECG** to classify rhythm and guide therapy [^1152t553] [^1166JbEB]. For unstable patients, perform **immediate synchronized cardioversion** [^111RB2Ve]; for stable patients, use vagal maneuvers and adenosine for regular narrow-complex SVT [^112PRmGD], and beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers if needed [^112b9Mas]. For wide-complex tachycardia, treat as VT until proven otherwise; use procainamide or amiodarone for stable VT and perform immediate cardioversion if unstable [^116MfpuK] [^111RB2Ve]. Avoid AV nodal blockers in pre-excited AF and use beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for IST [^114PUCDJ]. Address reversible causes, apply anticoagulation for AF/flutter when indicated, and consider catheter ablation for recurrent or drug-refractory arrhythmias [^114bFhQU] [^115P2TML].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Airway, breathing, circulation (ABC)**: Ensure airway patency, adequate ventilation, and circulatory support [^115K4ouQ].

- **12-lead ECG**: Obtain immediately to differentiate narrow vs wide complex and regular vs irregular rhythms [^111kp74T].

- **Vital signs and oxygenation**: Monitor continuously; provide supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO2 ≥ 94% [^115K4ouQ].

- **Intravenous access**: Establish two large-bore IV lines for medication administration and fluid resuscitation [^115K4ouQ].

- **Hemodynamic stability assessment**: Determine if the patient is stable or unstable based on blood pressure, mental status, and signs of shock or ischemia [^114itWXL].

## Management of narrow-complex tachycardia

### Stable patients

In stable patients with narrow-complex tachycardia, **vagal maneuvers** (Valsalva, carotid massage) are first-line to increase vagal tone and slow AV nodal conduction [^113Cggyu]. If these fail, **adenosine 6 mg IV rapid push** with a 12 mg repeat if needed is recommended; it temporarily blocks the AV node and is effective for AVNRT/AVRT [^notfound]. If adenosine fails, **IV beta-blockers** (metoprolol, esmolol) or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are appropriate alternatives [^112b9Mas]. Synchronized cardioversion (50–100 J) is indicated when pharmacologic therapy fails or is contraindicated [^notfound].

---

### Unstable patients

In unstable patients with narrow-complex tachycardia, **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is the treatment of choice [^114itWXL].

---

## Management of wide-complex tachycardia

### Stable patients

In stable patients with wide-complex tachycardia, treat as **VT until proven otherwise**. Procainamide or amiodarone are first-line antiarrhythmics; avoid AV nodal blockers if VT is suspected [^116MfpuK]. Adenosine may be considered only for regular, monomorphic wide-complex tachycardia of uncertain mechanism without pre-excitation [^113r5KTn] [^114MAGAw].

---

### Unstable patients

In unstable patients with wide-complex tachycardia, perform **immediate synchronized cardioversion** without delay [^111zvD9B].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pre-excited atrial fibrillation**: Avoid AV nodal blockers (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin); use procainamide or amiodarone and consider early cardioversion [^114PUCDJ].

- **Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST)**: Treat with beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers; catheter ablation may be considered in refractory cases [^112459Bv].

- **Reversible causes**: Identify and correct electrolyte abnormalities, hypoxia, ischemia, and drug toxicity [^117Tahde].

---

## Long-term management and prevention

Long-term management and prevention emphasize **catheter ablation** — a curative option for recurrent SVT, AVNRT, AVRT, and atrial flutter [^1124vjR8] [^113ucCj8] [^114ePz3V]. Anticoagulation is indicated for atrial fibrillation/flutter based on CHA2DS2-VASc score, and rate-control strategies may use beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin. Rhythm-control options include amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or dofetilide, selected based on patient factors and comorbidities.

---

## Summary of key recommendations

- **Immediate synchronized cardioversion**: For unstable tachycardia of any mechanism [^111RB2Ve].

- **Vagal maneuvers and adenosine**: First-line for stable narrow-complex SVT [^112PRmGD].

- **Procainamide or amiodarone**: First-line for stable wide-complex tachycardia (presumed VT) [^notfound].

- **Avoid AV nodal blockers**: In pre-excited atrial fibrillation [^114PUCDJ].

- **Catheter ablation**: Curative option for recurrent SVT and atrial flutter [^notfound].

---

Effective tachycardia management requires rapid **stabilization**, accurate **rhythm classification**, and mechanism-specific therapy, with early consideration of **cardioversion** for unstable patients and **catheter ablation** for recurrent arrhythmias.

Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

2017 AHA/ACC/HRS ventricular arrhythmias guideline — initial tachycardia management: The initial management of any tachycardia should proceed according to published AHA advanced cardiovascular life support guidelines. Immediate cardioversion should be performed for hemodynamic instability at presentation or if it develops subsequently, and an ECG should be obtained for stable rhythms. Wide-complex tachycardias, defined by a QRS duration ≥ 0.12 s, can be due to VT, SVT with aberrancy, preexcited tachycardia, or a paced rhythm such as pacemaker-mediated tachycardia, and an irregular wide-complex tachycardia may be AF with aberrancy, preexcited AF (ie, AF using an accessory pathway for anterograde conduction), atrial flutter, or VT; a diagnosis should be established, and consultation with an arrhythmia expert considered.

Recommendations for acute treatment of SVT of unknown mechanism — synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in patients with hemodynamically unstable SVT when vagal maneuvers or adenosine are ineffective or not feasible (COR I; LOE B-NR). Sinus rhythm must be promptly restored in patients with SVT who are hemodynamically unstable, cardioversion successfully restored sinus rhythm in all patients in a prehospital cohort, and the 2010 adult ACLS guideline endorses synchronized cardioversion for any persistent SVT resulting in hypotension, acute altered mental status, signs of shock, chest pain, or acute heart failure symptoms while recommending that adenosine be considered first if the tachycardia is regular and has a narrow QRS complex.

### Advanced management of electrical storm: beyond antiarrhythmics [^1135Cgue]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Electrical storm is a life-threatening condition caused by recurrent ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), either ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). This condition portends a grim prognosis, and acute management requires emergent pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Commonly, rhythm control may be the sole focus when managing electrical storm, especially at institutions with limited resources. Beyond rhythm management, the use of certain proven diagnostic studies and interventions that are known to improve outcomes is key to maximise survival. To highlight the utility of a contemporary algorithm for advanced management of patients with refractory VAs, we present a case involving a previously healthy patient who presented with acute onset of electrical storm and cardiogenic shock and required several urgent investigations and interventions to achieve electrical and haemodynamic stability and an overall favourable outcome.

Regular supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) of unknown mechanism — acute treatment algorithm: Regular SVT is managed first with vagal maneuvers and/or IV adenosine (Class I). If ineffective or not feasible, assess hemodynamic status; if not hemodynamically stable, perform synchronized cardioversion* (Class I). If hemodynamically stable, give IV beta blockers, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (Class IIa); if ineffective or not feasible, proceed to synchronized cardioversion* (Class I). For rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, synchronized cardioversion is not appropriate.

Ventricular tachycardia storm and incessant VT — clinical features and initial management note that while a definition of greater than 2 episodes in 24 h has been used, much more frequent episodes can also occur, and hemodynamically stable VT lasting hours has been termed "incessant". Severe underlying heart disease is frequently present, although VT storm can occur in patients who have a structurally normal heart. Polymorphic VT storm in a patient with coronary disease is strongly suggestive of acute myocardial ischemia; pauses may occur prior to polymorphic VT even in the absence of QT prolongation. Frequent appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks may represent part of the natural history of advanced heart disease and may or may not portend a serious deterioration in underlying prognosis. Management highlights include that the first step in VT storm is to identify and correct inciting factors and that with frequent ICD shocks electrograms and programming should be reviewed to determine if device reprogramming is desirable; intravenous beta blockade should be considered for a polymorphic VT storm as it is the single most effective therapy and revascularization procedures may be urgently needed, with additional examples that in Brugada syndrome quinidine or isoproterenol may terminate incessant arrhythmias, in acute ischemia intravenous amiodarone seems more effective than other antiarrhythmic drugs, and pacing may be useful especially if the tachycardia onset is pause dependent.

### Inappropriate sinus tachycardia: etiology, pathophysiology, and Management: JACC review topic of the week [^112459Bv]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is a clinical syndrome that generally affects young patients and is associated with distressing symptoms. Although the most common symptom is palpitations, it can be accompanied by a myriad of symptoms, including anxiety, dizziness, presyncope, and syncope. The pathogenesis of IST is not well understood and considered multifactorial, with autonomic dysfunction being the central abnormality. IST is a diagnosis of exclusion. Management presents a clinical challenge. The overall efficacy of lifestyle modifications and medical therapy may be limited. Recent advances in catheter and surgical sinus node sparing ablation techniques have led to improvement in outcomes. In addition, increased focus has led to development of multimodality team-based interventions to improve outcomes in this group of patients. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic basis of IST, review current approaches to diagnosis, and outline contemporary therapeutic approaches.

Shared decision making in SVT — "It is important that the patient be included in clinical decision-making processes, with consideration of his/her preferences and goals for therapy, as well as his/her unique physical, psychological, and social situation". "In selected cases, personalized, self-directed interventions can be developed in partnership with the patient, such as vagal maneuvers and 'pill-in-the-pocket' drug therapy". "Shared decision making is especially important for patients with SVT", and "SVT treatment can be nuanced and requires expert knowledge of EP processes and treatment options". Options "are highly specific to the exact type of arrhythmia and can depend on certain characteristics of a particular arrhythmia (eg, whether there is pre-excitation)", so "a detailed explanation of the benefits and risks must be included in the conversation", with patients "encouraged to ask questions" and clinicians using "lay terminology" to provide "the best possible understanding of all management options in terms of risks, benefits, and potential effects on quality of life".

Atrial flutter ongoing management — Catheter ablation of the cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI) is useful in patients with atrial flutter that is either symptomatic or refractory to pharmacological rate control, and beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful to control the ventricular rate in patients with hemodynamically tolerated atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is useful in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter after failure of at least 1 antiarrhythmic agent, and ongoing management with antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). For rhythm maintenance in symptomatic, recurrent atrial flutter, the following drugs can be useful with the drug choice depending on underlying heart disease and comorbidities: amiodarone, dofetilide, or sotalol. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with CTI-dependent atrial flutter that occurs as the result of flecainide, propafenone, or amiodarone used for treatment of AF, and catheter ablation of the CTI is reasonable in patients undergoing catheter ablation of AF who also have a history of documented clinical or induced CTI-dependent atrial flutter. Catheter ablation is reasonable in patients with recurrent symptomatic non–CTI-dependent flutter as primary therapy, before therapeutic trials of antiarrhythmic drugs, after carefully weighing potential risks and benefits of treatment options; flecainide or propafenone may be considered to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have symptomatic recurrent atrial flutter; and catheter ablation may be reasonable for asymptomatic patients with recurrent atrial flutter.

Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia — clinical considerations for acute management note that electrical cardioversion is always indicated for hemodynamically unstable tachycardia, and monomorphic VT is usually related to a structural abnormality such as MI scarring but is mechanistically heterogeneous; some "idiopathic" VTs respond well and terminate with intravenous verapamil or adenosine, and if these unique VT entities cannot be recognized with confidence, it is prudent to assume that one is dealing with VT related to structural heart disease. Timely termination is usually desirable even if VT is well tolerated, this can be achieved with cardioversion, antiarrhythmic medications, or pacing techniques, and DC cardioversion even at early stage or as a "first line" is reasonable; caution needs to be exercised if the patient also has concurrent AF (e.g., double tachycardia), and if such is the case, the ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation need to be followed when feasible. Initial treatment often includes the administration of intravenous antiarrhythmic medication, with advantages including the lack of necessity for anesthesia and ready availability and disadvantages including delay in termination, failure to terminate in some patients, and adverse effects including hypotension and proarrhythmia; only intravenous procainamide, lidocaine, and amiodarone are widely available and intravenous ajmaline is used frequently in some European countries. Intravenous amiodarone loading has proved useful in unstable and recurrent VT and it is also reasonable in patients in whom oral amiodarone is required after the intravenous phase; although intravenous amiodarone has an early effect on AV nodal conduction, the effects on myocardial conduction and refractoriness are gradual in onset and maximum effect may not be seen for weeks or months, so intravenous amiodarone is not ideal for early conversion of stable monomorphic VT, whereas intravenous procainamide is more appropriate when early slowing of the VT rate and termination of monomorphic VT are desired; close monitoring of blood pressure and cardiovascular status is recommended in the presence of congestive HF or severe LV dysfunction as intravenous procainamide can cause transient hypotension, and lidocaine is effective when VT is thought to be related to myocardial ischemia.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS supraventricular tachycardia guideline — Managing patients with multiple conditions can be complex, especially when recommendations applicable to coexisting illnesses are discordant or interacting; the guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and the recommendations should not replace clinical judgment. Management in accordance with guideline recommendations is effective only when followed, and adherence can be enhanced by shared decision making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions based on individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities; consequently, circumstances may arise in which deviations from these guidelines are appropriate.

### Electrocardiographic differential diagnosis of narrow QRS complex tachycardia: an ED-oriented algorithmic approach [^116iPp5U]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The differentiation of narrow complex tachycardias is a common diagnostic conundrum encountered by emergency physicians. Although a number of published algorithms are available to assist the clinician in evaluating features of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), many of these are too cumbersome, requiring multiple decisions and introducing treatment suggestions within the diagnostic framework. To optimize the diagnosis of the narrow complex tachycardia, we propose 3 separate algorithms tailored to address varying levels of available clinical information. The static algorithm depends only on the 12-lead ECG without the benefit of historical data or diagnostic interventions. The comparative algorithm requires a baseline ECG to which the presenting ECG is compared. The dynamic algorithm encourages the clinician to take advantage of diagnostic maneuvers to further elucidate the tachycardia mechanism. Each of these algorithms requires the clinician to answer either "yes" or "no" for each criterion and does not include treatment recommendations.

### Gender and race-related disparities in the management of ventricular arrhythmias [^114JZpZ4]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Modern studies have revealed gender and race-related disparities in the management and outcomes of cardiac arrhythmias, but few studies have focused on outcomes for ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) such as ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). The aim of this article is to review relevant studies and identify outcome differences in the management of VA among Black and female patients. We found that female patients typically present younger for VA, are more likely to have recurrent VA after catheter ablation, are less likely to be prescribed antiarrhythmic medication, and are less likely to receive primary prevention ICD placement as compared to male patients. Additionally, female patients appear to derive similar overall mortality benefit from primary prevention ICD placement as compared to male patients, but they may have an increased risk of acute post-procedural complications. We also found that Black patients presenting with VA are less likely to undergo catheter ablation, receive appropriate primary prevention ICD placement, and have significantly higher risk-adjusted 1-year mortality rates after hospital discharge as compared to White patients. Black female patients appear to have the worst outcomes out of any demographic subgroup.

Orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) — acute treatment algorithm: Begin with vagal maneuvers and/or IV adenosine (Class I). If ineffective or not feasible, assess hemodynamic stability; if unstable, perform synchronized cardioversion (Class I). If stable, branch on pre-excitation on resting ECG: when present, use IV beta blockers, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (Class IIb); when absent, use IV beta blockers, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (Class IIa). If these measures are ineffective or not feasible, proceed to synchronized cardioversion (Class I). A footnote notes that for rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, synchronized cardioversion is not appropriate.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) — risk stratification and arrhythmia features note that supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias are induced by exercise when heart rate reaches 120 to 130 beats per minute, progressing from premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) and sometimes sustained VT; a beat-to-beat alternating QRS axis that rotates by 180° defines typical bidirectional VT, and irregular polymorphic VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) can occur. Patients with an episode of VF are considered at higher risk and are usually implanted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) along with beta-blocker therapy, and recurrence of sustained VT or hemodynamically non tolerated VT while on beta blockers is a marker of higher risk for which an ICD is often recommended. Electrophysiology (EP) testing is not useful for management and risk stratification because CPVT patients are usually not inducible. Beta blockers prevent recurrences of syncope in the majority of patients, but if syncope occurs while taking a beta blocker, ICD implantation is recommended, and ICD therapy requires careful programming to prevent needless therapy for nonsustained episodes.

Atrial flutter — acute treatment recommendations: I A: Oral dofetilide or intravenous ibutilide is useful for acute pharmacological cardioversion in patients with atrial flutter. I B-R: Intravenous or oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful for acute rate control in patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable. I B-NR: Elective synchronized cardioversion is indicated in stable patients with well-tolerated atrial flutter when a rhythm-control strategy is pursued. I B-NR: Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment of patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically unstable and do not respond to pharmacological therapies. I C-LD: Rapid atrial pacing is useful for acute treatment of atrial flutter in patients who have pacing wires in place as part of a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or for temporary atrial pacing after cardiac surgery. I B-NR: Acute antithrombotic therapy is recommended in patients with atrial flutter to align with recommended antithrombotic therapy for patients with AF. IIa B-R: Intravenous amiodarone can be useful for acute control of the ventricular rate (in the absence of preexcitation) in patients with atrial flutter and systolic heart failure, when beta blockers are contraindicated or ineffective.

Narrow-complex tachycardias are commonly seen on shift in the emergency department. Although a portion of patients present with hemodynamic instability because of arrhythmia, it is important to know that the tachycardia can be a result of an underlying condition. Rapid identification of the type and etiology of the arrhythmia is vital to directing appropriate management strategies and disposition decisions.

Sinus tachycardia definitions — physiologic versus inappropriate: sinus tachycardia is a rhythm arising from the sinus node in which the rate of impulses exceeds 100 bpm; physiologic sinus tachycardia is an appropriate increased sinus rate in response to exercise and other situations that increase sympathetic tone; inappropriate sinus tachycardia is defined by sinus heart rate > 100 bpm at rest with a mean 24-h heart rate > 90 bpm not due to appropriate physiological responses or primary causes such as hyperthyroidism or anemia.

Junctional tachycardia — definition and related rhythm — Junctional tachycardia is a rapid, occasionally irregular, narrow-complex tachycardia with rates typically of 120 bpm to 220 bpm that arises from the atrioventricular (AV) junction, and AV dissociation (often isorhythmic) when present excludes the misdiagnosis of AVRT and makes AVNRT highly unlikely. If it is irregular, junctional tachycardia may be misdiagnosed as AF or MAT, and the mechanism for junctional tachycardia is enhanced (abnormal) automaticity from an ectopic focus in the AV junction. Junctional tachycardia is uncommon in adults; it is typically seen in infants postoperatively, after cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease; as such, there is limited evidence with regard to diagnosis and management of junctional tachycardia in adult patients. A related rhythm, nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia (more commonly known as accelerated AV junctional rhythm), is far more common in adults than paroxysmal junctional tachycardia, is associated with automaticity or triggered activity, occurs at a slower rate (70 bpm to 130 bpm), is often due to digoxin toxicity or myocardial infarction, and treatment of this rhythm centers on addressing the underlying condition.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — electrophysiological (EP) testing and device outcomes: In 1989, Fananapazir et al. showed by using 2 premature stimuli that only 16% of patients with cardiac arrest or syncope in the setting of HCM had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT), and later data included 230 patients, including 155 reported earlier, noting poorer prognosis with inducible VT and that induced VT was often polymorphic. In a prospective study of 29 patients with HCM, 8 presenting with syncope, EP testing with up to 3 extrastimuli at 3 cycle lengths including left ventricular (LV) stimulation failed to distinguish patients with from those without syncope, and among patients who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention, the estimated appropriate discharge rate was 5% per year.

### Common types of supraventricular tachycardia: diagnosis and management [^115P2TML]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is an abnormal rapid cardiac rhythm that involves atrial or atrioventricular node tissue from the His bundle or above. Paroxysmal SVT, a subset of supraventricular dysrhythmias, has three common types: atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, and atrial tachycardia. Presenting symptoms may include altered consciousness, chest pressure or discomfort, dyspnea, fatigue, lightheadedness, or palpitations. Diagnostic evaluation may be performed in the outpatient setting and includes a comprehensive history and physical examination, electrocardiography, and laboratory workup. Extended cardiac monitoring with a Holter monitor or event recorder may be needed to confirm the diagnosis. Acute management of paroxysmal SVT is similar across the various types and is best completed in the emergency department or hospital setting. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable, synchronized cardioversion is first-line management. In those who are hemodynamically stable, vagal maneuvers are first-line management, followed by stepwise medication management if ineffective. Beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers may be used acutely or for long-term suppressive therapy. When evaluating patients for paroxysmal SVTs, clinicians should have a low threshold for referral to a cardiologist for electrophysiologic study and appropriate intervention such as ablation. Clinicians should use a patient-centered approach when formulating a long-term management plan for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia. Catheter ablation has a high success rate and is recommended as the first-line method for long-term management of recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal SVT, including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

Adult congenital heart disease — ventricular arrhythmia care recommendations (COR I, LOE B‑NR) state that adult patients with repaired complex congenital heart disease presenting with frequent, complex, or sustained ventricular arrhythmias (VA), or unexplained syncope should undergo evaluation for potential residual anatomic or coronary abnormalities. In patients with adult congenital heart disease and complex or sustained VA in the presence of important residual hemodynamic lesions, treatment of hemodynamic abnormalities with catheter or surgical intervention as feasible is indicated prior to consideration of ablation or an implantable cardioverter‑defibrillator (ICD). In patients with adult congenital heart disease and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT), an ICD is recommended after evaluation and appropriate treatment for residual lesions/ventricular dysfunction if meaningful survival of greater than 1 year is expected.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation — wide-complex tachycardia and ventricular tachycardia (VT) differentiation is aided by obtaining a 12-lead ECG during tachycardia and during sinus rhythm, and a wide-complex tachycardia (QRS duration > 120 ms) may represent either VT or a supraventricular rhythm with abnormal conduction. Atrioventricular (AV) dissociation with ventricular rate faster than atrial rate or fusion complexes provides the diagnosis of VT, while concordance of precordial QRS complexes suggests VT or pre-excitation and QRS complexes identical to sinus rhythm are consistent with SVT. Because the failure to correctly identify VT can be potentially life threatening and when doubt exists it is safest to assume any wide-complex tachycardia is VT, adenosine is suggested if a wide-complex tachycardia is monomorphic, regular, and hemodynamically tolerated, because it may help convert the rhythm to sinus and may help in the diagnosis.

Transient arrhythmias of reversible cause — Class I recommendations: "1. Myocardial revascularization should be performed, when appropriate, to reduce the risk of SCD in patients experiencing cardiac arrest due to VF or polymorphic VT in the setting of acute ischemia or MI. (Level of Evidence: C) 2. Unless electrolyte abnormalities are proved to be the cause, survivors of cardiac arrest due to VF or polymorphic VT in whom electrolyte abnormalities are discovered in general should be evaluated and treated in a manner similar to that of cardiac arrest without electrolyte abnormalities. (Level of Evidence: C) 3. Patients who experience sustained monomorphic VT in the presence of antiarrhythmic drugs or electrolyte abnormalities should be evaluated and treated in a manner similar to that of patients with VT without electrolyte abnormalities or antiarrhythmic drugs".

Electrocardiogram (ECG) evaluation in SVT emphasizes obtaining a 12‑lead during tachycardia and sinus rhythm to define mechanism and characteristic P‑wave findings: a 12‑lead ECG obtained during tachycardia and during sinus rhythm may reveal the etiology of tachycardia; for a patient presenting in SVT, the 12‑lead ECG can potentially identify the arrhythmic mechanism; if the SVT is regular, this may represent AT with 1:1 conduction or an SVT that involves the atrioventricular (AV) node; SVTs that involve the AV node as a required component of the tachycardia reentrant circuit include AVNRT and AVRT; in these reentrant tachycardias, the retrogradely conducted P wave may be difficult to discern, especially if bundle‑branch block is present; in typical AVNRT, atrial activation is nearly simultaneous with the QRS with a pseudo S wave in inferior leads and pseudo R' in V1; in orthodromic AVRT, the P wave can usually be seen in the early part of the ST‑T segment; in typical forms of AVNRT and AVRT, the tachycardias are referred to as having a "short RP".

Acute treatment of suspected focal atrial tachycardia — algorithm: The flow begins with "Suspected focal atrial tachycardia" and evaluates "Hemodynamically stable"; "No" leads to "Cardioversion* (Class I)". If stable, it asks "Diagnosis of focal atrial tachycardia established"; if "Yes", treat with "IV beta blocker, IV diltiazem, or IV verapamil (Class I)" and then "IV amiodarone or IV ibutilide (Class IIb)". If the diagnosis is not established, use "IV adenosine (Class IIa)" and, if "If ineffective or not feasible", perform "Cardioversion* (Class I)". The figure cautions "For rhythms that break or recur spontaneously, synchronized cardioversion is not appropriate. IV indicates intravenous".

ACC/AHA/ESC sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia — acute management recommendations state that wide-QRS tachycardia should be presumed to be VT if the diagnosis is unclear (Level of Evidence: C). Direct current cardioversion with appropriate sedation is recommended at any point in the treatment cascade in patients with suspected sustained monomorphic VT with hemodynamic compromise (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous procainamide (or ajmaline in some European countries) is reasonable for initial treatment of patients with stable sustained monomorphic VT (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous amiodarone is reasonable in patients with sustained monomorphic VT that is hemodynamically unstable, refractory to conversion with countershock, or recurrent despite procainamide or other agents (Level of Evidence: C). Transvenous catheter pace termination can be useful to treat patients with sustained monomorphic VT that is refractory to cardioversion or is frequently recurrent despite antiarrhythmic medication (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous lidocaine might be reasonable for the initial treatment of patients with stable sustained monomorphic VT specifically associated with acute myocardial ischemia or infarction (Level of Evidence: C). Calcium channel blockers such as verapamil and diltiazem should not be used in patients to terminate wide-QRS-complex tachycardia of unknown origin, especially in patients with a history of myocardial dysfunction (Level of Evidence: C).

A further confounding diagnostic challenge is that patients with POTS and their families report ongoing difficulties related to diagnosis, medical stigma, and the challenges related to "living with an invisible illness". They are often told their symptoms are purely psychosomatic in nature or due to anxiety. It is common for youth with POTS to meet with as many as seven doctors before being diagnosed and to continue to see numerous specialists to determine a treatment plan after diagnosis. Once a POTS specialist has been identified, the wait to be seen is estimated to be between six to 36 months, further delaying accurate diagnosis and treatment, with youth experiencing an average of 5 years to diagnosis after symptom presentation.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) — management is often individualized with device therapy, ablation, and surgical options. The treatment of ARVC is often based on individual patient presentation and local physician experience. The implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) has been used in patients with unexplained syncope, sustained VT, or VF with a high incidence of appropriate shocks, although there are no specific large randomized trials in ARVC and ICD treatment in individuals with a known family history of sudden cardiac death (SCD) or unexplained syncope is intuitively compelling but not rigidly proved. The impact of medical therapy on mortality is not established. Radiofrequency (RF) ablation has been used in selected patients for VT; elimination of 1 or more clinical tachycardias by RF ablation is useful for management of symptoms but may not be sufficient to prevent SCD. Operative therapy in the form of total electrical right ventricular (RV) disconnection has proved successful in medically refractory patients with normal left ventricular (LV) function but carries a risk of postoperative right heart failure (HF). Heart transplantation and ventricular assist devices are an option in patients with biventricular failure.

Adult narrow QRS tachycardia — differential diagnosis algorithm: Begin with Narrow QRS tachycardia (QRS duration < 120 ms). If the rhythm is not regular, consider atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia/flutter with variable AV conduction, or multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT). If regular but P waves are not visible, consider AVNRT or other mechanism with P waves not identified. If P waves are visible and the atrial rate is greater than ventricular rate, the diagnoses are atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia. If P waves are visible and the atrial rate is not greater than ventricular rate, evaluate RP interval short (RP < PR); if No (RP > PR), consider atrial tachycardia, PJRT, or atypical AVNRT, and if RP interval is short then assess RP < 90 ms, which leads to AVRT, atypical AVNRT, or atrial tachycardia.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) clinical presentation and differential diagnosis — In adults, mean age of symptom onset was 32 ± 18 years for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) versus 23 ± 14 years for atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT), whereas in pediatric populations mean ages of onset of AVRT and AVNRT were 8 and 11 years, respectively. Compared with AVRT, patients with AVNRT are more likely to be female with an age of onset > 30 years, and AVNRT onset has been reported after the age of 50 years in 16% and before the age of 20 years in 18%. Among women with SVT and no other cardiovascular disease, symptom onset occurred during childbearing years (15 to 50 years) in 58%; the first onset of SVT occurred in only 3.9% during pregnancy, but among those with established SVT, 22% reported pregnancy exacerbated symptoms. In a retrospective study of patients < 21 years with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern on the electrocardiogram, 64% had symptoms at presentation and 20% developed symptoms during follow-up; modes of presentation included documented SVT in 38%, palpitations in 22%, chest pain in 5%, syncope in 4%, atrial fibrillation (AF) in 0.4%, and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in 0.2%. A confounding factor in diagnosing SVT is differentiating it from panic and anxiety disorders or heightened awareness of sinus tachycardia (such as postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome); in one study, criteria for panic disorder were fulfilled in 67% of unrecognized SVT and physicians attributed symptoms to panic, anxiety, or stress in 54%, with women more likely to be mislabeled. Compared with AVRT, AVNRT symptoms more frequently include "shirt flapping" or "neck pounding".

Junctional tachycardia — clinical features and related rhythms are summarized as follows: Junctional tachycardia is a rapid, occasionally irregular, narrow-complex tachycardia (with rates typically of 120 bpm to 220 bpm). AV dissociation (often isorhythmic) may be seen, and when present, excludes the misdiagnosis of AVRT and makes AVNRT highly unlikely. Junctional tachycardia is uncommon in adults; it is typically seen in infants postoperatively, after cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease; this is also known as junctional ectopic tachycardia. Adults with junctional tachycardia typically have a relatively benign course, whereas infants and children with acquired or congenital junctional tachycardia have a high rate of death due to heart failure or an uncontrollable, incessant tachyarrhythmia. There are data to support the use of beta blockers, diltiazem, flecainide, procainamide, propafenone, and verapamil for the treatment of junctional tachycardia. The efficacy of amiodarone has been reported only in pediatric patients, and digoxin has not been well established as chronic therapy for junctional tachycardia. A related rhythm, nonparoxysmal junctional tachycardia (more commonly known as accelerated AV junctional rhythm), occurs at a slower rate (70 bpm to 130 bpm) and is often due to digoxin toxicity or myocardial infarction; treatment of this rhythm centers on addressing the underlying condition, and there is some evidence that beta blockers, intravenous adenosine, or verapamil can terminate an accelerated junctional arrhythmia; a transient junction rhythm may be seen after slow-pathway ablation for AVNRT.

### Keeping It "Current": a review of treatment options for the management of supraventricular tachycardia [^1125UJZG]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review treatment options and updates that exist for the management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).

Data Sources

A literature search of PubMed was performed including articles from 1974 to June 2023 using the terms: arrhythmias, adenosine, verapamil, diltiazem, esmolol, propranolol, metoprolol, beta-blockers, amiodarone, PSVT, synchronized cardioversion, methylxanthines, dipyridamole, pediatrics, heart transplant, and pregnancy. Primary literature and guidelines were reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were considered if they were available in English and conducted in humans.

Data Synthesis

PSVT is a subset of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) that presents as a rapid, regular tachycardia with an abrupt onset and termination. Due to frequent emergency department (ED) visits annually with symptoms of PSVT, appropriate and efficient management of these patients is vital. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of PSVT, while also describing the literature behind nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management of PSVT.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review describes new literature regarding the improved success of the modified Valsalva maneuver as a nonpharmacologic therapy in PSVT. In addition, it describes a new technique in administration of adenosine that has improved outcomes, defines dose adjustments needed for drug interactions with adenosine, compares the utilization of nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers with adenosine, and provides management recommendations for patients in special populations.

Conclusions

With high annual rates of ED visits for SVT, providers should be aware of the data behind management and modifications of therapy based on patient-specific factors (ie, patient preference, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, drug interactions, and special populations).

Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) acute treatment — vagal maneuvers are recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and these maneuvers should be performed with the patient in the supine position; the practice of applying pressure to the eyeball is potentially dangerous and has been abandoned. Adenosine is recommended for acute treatment in patients with AVNRT, and can be considered as both a therapeutic and diagnostic agent in narrow-complex tachyarrhythmias; it will acutely terminate AVNRT in approximately 95% of patients and will unmask atrial activity in arrhythmias such as atrial flutter or AT. Synchronized cardioversion should be performed for acute treatment in hemodynamically unstable patients with AVNRT when adenosine and vagal maneuvers do not terminate the tachycardia or are not feasible, and synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when pharmacological therapy does not terminate the tachycardia or is contraindicated. Intravenous beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT, whereas oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be reasonable for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT. Intravenous amiodarone may be considered for acute treatment in hemodynamically stable patients with AVNRT when other therapies are ineffective or contraindicated.

### Overlooked and underdiagnosed: cardiac sarcoidosis and unexplained ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation [^111P5mqh]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

CS remains significantly underdiagnosed in patients presenting with unexplained VT/VF, as highlighted by the notably low utilization of advanced diagnostic testing observed in this study. This underdiagnosis carries significant risks, including delayed treatment and the potential for adverse clinical outcomes such as heart failure or sudden cardiac death. Bridging this diagnostic gap with greater clinician awareness and guideline adherence is the key for timely and appropriate diagnostic testing for CS, particularly in younger patients with unexplained VT/VF. Future studies are needed to further identify underlying barriers to guideline adherence and to explore strategies for improving the diagnosis and management of CS, with the goal of improving care and outcomes for this high-risk population.

Perspectives

COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: CS should be considered in all patients with unexplained VT/VF, and clinicians should use appropriate imaging techniques, such as MRI, PET, or biopsy, to enhance diagnostic accuracy. A high degree of clinical suspicion and timely diagnosis of CS is essential, as it directly influences management decisions and improves patient outcomes, reducing the risk of cardiac complications.

TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: This study highlights the low rate of diagnostic testing for CS in patients with unexplained VT/VF, with only a small fraction undergoing cardiac MRI, PET scans, or myocardial biopsy. This study is the first, to our knowledge, to report on the prevalence of sarcoidosis diagnosis in this population, revealing that it is significantly underdiagnosed, with only 1.4% of patients receiving a diagnosis, far below the expected prevalence of 17% to 28%.

### Therapeutic hypothermia in patients with out-of-hospital arrest [^112u52VF]. Heart (2015). Low credibility.

Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) is increasingly used in patients presenting with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Such strategies derive from data that suggest TH may improve survival and attenuate adverse neurological outcomes associated with the cardiac arrest. Consequently, TH has been integrated into various guidelines for the management of OHCA and has become a focussed strategy, particularly in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. However, there remains uncertainty over the true impact of TH. In patients with OHCA due to asystole or pulseless electrical activity, overall available evidence suggests that TH does not improve neurological outcomes and survival. While in patients with OHCA due to ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, observational studies and small, randomised studies have suggested there may be survival benefits and improved neurological recovery. However, even here, trial data robustness has been questioned, with ongoing debate regarding the optimum temperature for managing patients with OHCA and optimal timing of its initiation. More uniform and robust guidelines for the application of TH for patients with OHCA are required, but can only be formulated on appropriately sized robust trials. This review examines the current status of TH.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) acute evaluation emphasizes early documentation and mechanism assessment, noting that patients with SVT account for approximately 50 000 emergency department visits each year and that emergency physicians may be the first to evaluate patients whose tachycardia mechanism is unknown; it is important to record a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to differentiate tachycardia mechanisms according to whether the AV node is an obligate component, because treatment that targets the AV node will not reliably terminate tachycardias.

Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia — definition and at-risk populations are described as follows: The term "hemodynamically unstable" has not been rigidly defined but is widely used, and it connotes a tachycardia associated with hypotension and poor tissue perfusion that is considered to have the imminent potential to lead to cardiac arrest or shock if left untreated. Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia is usually, but not exclusively, observed in patients with poor ventricular function, yet patients with normal ventricular function can have unstable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation if the tachycardia is rapid enough, as in the long QT syndrome and other abnormal repolarization syndromes, and even idiopathic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia can cause hypotension because of a vasovagal reaction.

### Ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death [^112LF4P9]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Management strategies for ventricular arrhythmias are guided by the risk of sudden death and severity of symptoms. Patients with a substantial risk of sudden death usually need an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Although ICDs effectively end most episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and decrease mortality in specific populations of patients, they have inherent risks and limitations. Generally, antiarrhythmic drugs do not provide sufficient protection from sudden death, but do have a role in reducing arrhythmias that cause symptoms. Catheter ablation is likewise important for reducing the frequency of spontaneous arrhythmias and is curative for some patients, usually those with idiopathic arrhythmias and no heart disease. Arrhythmia surgery is now infrequent, offered by only a few specialised centres for refractory arrhythmias. Advances in understanding of genetic arrhythmia syndromes and in technology for mapping and ablation of ventricular arrhythmias, and enhanced algorithms in implantable devices for rhythm management, have contributed to improved outcomes.

Focal atrial tachycardia (AT) — definition, epidemiology, ECG localization, and mechanisms: Focal AT is characterized as a fast rhythm from a discrete origin and can be sustained or nonsustained, with the atrial rate usually between 100 and 250 bpm. In referral populations, focal AT represents approximately 3% to 17% of patients referred for SVT ablation, and AT-mediated cardiomyopathy has been reported in up to 10% of patients referred for ablation for incessant SVT. Diagnosis is suspected when ECG criteria are met and algorithms use P-wave morphology on a standard 12-lead ECG; positive P waves in leads I, II, and aVF suggest a cranial atrial origin, and shorter P-wave duration correlates with paraseptal origin versus free wall. The precise location is ultimately confirmed by mapping during EP studies when successful ablation is achieved. Mechanistically, an automatic AT can be transiently suppressed by adenosine or overdrive pacing and may be terminated by beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil; a triggered AT can be terminated by adenosine or overdrive pacing with variable response to these drugs; and a microreentrant AT can be induced and terminated by programmed stimulation, with drug response dependent on circuit location.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) in syncope — In patients with syncope and SVT, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is recommended and listed as "I C-EO". Although patients with SVT frequently manifest palpitations and lightheadedness, syncope is uncommon, and older patients with paroxysmal SVT are more prone to syncope or near-syncope than younger patients. Younger patients with SVT causing syncope generally have a very rapid tachycardia. Evaluation of syncope in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with preexcitation on electrocardiogram requires a thorough history to differentiate an arrhythmic syncope from a nonarrhythmic syncope, such as vasovagal syncope (VVS), in younger patients. When a patient with syncope reports antecedent palpitations and lightheadedness, ventricular tachycardia (VT) should be more strongly suspected than SVT, and electrophysiology study (EPS) may be useful to distinguish a VT from an SVT responsible for syncope associated with these antecedent symptoms. It should be noted that palpitations can also precede vasovagal faints due to sinus tachycardia, so not all palpitations are necessarily due to paroxysmal SVT or VT.

### The sinus tachycardias [^117FrYK9]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2005). Medium credibility.

Sinus tachycardia, in the forms of four distinct rhythm disturbances, is frequently encountered in clinical practice but is often overlooked. The most common rhythm, normal sinus tachycardia, whether physiologic, pathologic or iatrogenic, is predominantly catecholamine driven, is virtually asymptomatic and is managed by identifying and treating the underlying cause. The other so-called primary sinus tachycardias, which include inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and sinus node re-entry tachycardia, have fundamentally different clinical features, basic underlying etiologic mechanisms and treatment strategies. Differentiation of these types from normal sinus tachycardia and from other atrial arrhythmias is crucial for successful management. Accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy of the sinus tachycardias not only prevents multiple consultations but might also have important long-term prognostic implications.

Atrial flutter — acute treatment recommendations: COR I, LOE B-NR, acute antithrombotic therapy is recommended to align with antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF). COR IIa, LOE B-R, intravenous amiodarone can be useful for acute control of the ventricular rate in atrial flutter with systolic heart failure when beta blockers are contraindicated or ineffective and in the absence of pre-excitation; because of potential toxicity, amiodarone should not be used for long-term rate control in most patients, and potential risks and benefits should be considered for patients with atrial flutter lasting ≥ 48 hours who are not adequately anticoagulated.

### Approach to the diagnosis and initial management of the stable adult patient with a wide complex tachycardia [^114nq5KJ]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

The initial electrocardiographic evaluation of every tachyarrhythmia should begin by addressing the question of whether the QRS complex is wide or narrow. The most important cause of wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is ventricular tachycardia. However, supraventricular tachycardia can also manifest with a wide QRS complex. The ability to differentiate between supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS due to aberrancy or preexcitation and ventricular tachycardia often presents a diagnostic challenge. The identification of whether WCT has a ventricular or supraventricular origin is critical because the treatment for each is different, and improper therapy may have potentially lethal consequences. In conclusion, although the diagnosis and treatment of sustained WCT often arise in emergency situations, this report focuses on a stepwise approach to the management of WCT in relatively stable adult patients, particularly the diagnosis and differentiation of ventricular tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia with a wide QRS complex on standard 12-lead electrocardiography.

Supraventricular tachycardia mechanisms on the 12-lead ECG — classification by regularity and atrioventricular relationships: For a patient presenting in SVT, the 12-lead ECG can potentially identify the arrhythmia mechanism and the tachycardia should first be classified as having a regular or irregular ventricular rate; an irregular ventricular rate suggests atrial fibrillation (AF), multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), or atrial flutter with variable AV conduction, and with a rapid ventricular response AF can be misdiagnosed as a regular SVT. If the atrial rate exceeds the ventricular rate, atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia (AT) is usually present, though rare cases of atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) with 2:1 conduction have been described. If the SVT is regular, this may represent AVNRT with 1:1 conduction or an SVT that involves the AV node; junctional tachycardias can be regular or irregular with variable atrial conduction, in typical AVNRT the terminal P wave lies at the end of the QRS (pseudo S in inferior leads and pseudo R' in V1), and in orthodromic atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia (AVRT) the P wave is usually seen in the early ST‑T segment. Typical AVNRT and AVRT have a "short RP" with a 1:1 P‑QRS relationship, whereas unusual AVNRT (such as "fast‑slow") and the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia (PJRT) have a long RP; a long RP interval is typical of AT.

### Deciphering the sinus tachycardias [^116Rsxx4]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Sinus tachycardia is the most common rhythm disturbance encountered in clinical practice. Primary sinus tachycardia without an underlying secondary cause, despite often being associated with troublesome symptoms, is often neglected leading to multiple consultations and frustration on part of both the practitioner and the patient. The fact that primary sinus tachycardias are a heterogeneous group of disorders is seldom appreciated; hence, a firm diagnosis is rarely reached and management is haphazard. Furthermore, there may be prognostic implications for prolonged or recurrent sinus tachycardia, making it imperative that this group of arrhythmias receive adequate and appropriate attention. Normal sinus tachycardia (i.e., secondary), inappropriate sinus tachycardia, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) and sinus node reentry tachycardia make up this group of arrhythmias. Their definitions, clinical features, diagnostic criteria, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and optimum management are discussed in this review.

Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are recommended for the termination of regular SVT of uncertain type, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Synchronized cardioversion is recommended for the termination of any hemodynamically unstable SVT. In the absence of hemodynamic compromise, SVT should be treated with synchronized cardioversion when pharmacologic therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol is recommended for control of heat rate in patients with hemodynamically stable atrial flutter and for the treatment of hemodynamically stable focal atrial tachycardia.

Intravenous diltiazem, verapamil, or metoprolol can be useful in terminating hemodynamically stable regular SVT of uncertain type, multifocal atrial tachycardia. Another important step is to try to establish the mechanism of the tachycardia because this will help inform the best treatment course. Finally, it is critically important to review the patient's medical history to discover any potential contraindications to therapies that could be administered in these settings. 2, 3. For the termination of SVT, the guideline addressed the following interventions: vagal maneuvers, adenosine, synchronized cardioversion, β-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, digoxin, antiarrhythmic medications, and rapid atrial pacing. The potential benefits and harms of each intervention were carefully considered.

Interventions used for the termination of SVT are generally safe as long as no contraindications exist. For example, β-blockers and calcium-channel blockers should not be given in the presence of hypotension. The 1 recommendation involving harm was related to giving digoxin, amiodarone, β-blockers, or calcium-channel blockers for pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Conflict of Interest Disclosures: All authors have completed and submitted the ICMJE Form for Disclosure of Potential Conflicts of Interest and none were reported.

### Common types of supraventricular tachycardia: diagnosis… [^1124vjR8]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT When evaluating a patient with known or suspected paroxysmal SVT in the outpatient setting, there should be a low threshold for referral to a cardiologist for electrophysiologic study and appropriate intervention such as ablation. Ablation is a safe, potentially curative procedure recommended in contemporary guidelines for recurrent, symptomatic paroxysmal SVT. 1, 11 Not all patients should undergo electrophysiologic study and ablation, but all patients should know that there may be a curative option. Among patients with infrequent episodes of tachycardia and tolerable symptoms, it may be reasonable to defer ablation or long-term pharmacotherapy. 11 About 50% of these patients will eventually become asymptomatic. 21 Patients who decline ablation and pharmacotherapy should be educated on vagal maneuvers to terminate any recurrent arrhythmias, and treatment should be reconsidered at follow-up.

11 Ongoing pharmacologic therapy may not be needed after the procedure. For patients who are not candidates for catheter ablation or prefer not to undergo the procedure, long-term suppressive pharmacotherapy with nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or beta blockers may be considered. 11 There are limited data comparing the effectiveness of these agents; therefore, choice of agent may be determined based on patient factors such as baseline heart rate, blood pressure, and comorbidity. In patients who cannot tolerate nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers or beta blockers and do not want to pursue catheter ablation, antiarrhythmic drugs may be considered with the assistance of a cardiologist. If ablation is not desirable or feasible in patients who have antidromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia without ischemic or structural heart disease, propafenone or flecainide may be considered for long-term treatment.

11 In patients with orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, no signs of preexcitation on ECG, and no history of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may be considered.
11. 11 If ablation is not desired or feasible, clinicians can consider initial pharmacotherapy with a beta blocker; a nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker in patients who do not have reduced ejection fraction due to heart failure; or propafenone or flecainide in patients who have ischemic or structural heart disease. 11.

### Evaluation and management of patients after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shock [^111BT9Fi]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

There has been a tremendous increase in the use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) after several large clinical trials demonstrated their ability to effectively reduce mortality in selected populations of patients with cardiac disease. Thus, the nonelectrophysiologist will often encounter patients who have received an ICD shock.

Objective

To assess options for the evaluation and management of patients who have received an ICD shock.

Evidence Acquisition

Literature search using the PubMed and MEDLINE databases to identify articles published from January 1990 to September 2006, using the Medical Subject Headings defibrillators, implantable; defibrillators, implantable/adverse effects; anti-arrhythmic agents; electric countershock; quality of life; tachycardia therapy; algorithm; ventricular tachycardia/diagnosis; and supraventricular tachycardia/diagnosis. Case reports were excluded and articles were limited to those published in English. Scientific statements and guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the Heart Rhythm Society were also reviewed, as were the reference lists of retrieved articles, to identify any additional articles for inclusion.

Evidence Synthesis

There are multiple causes of both appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks. Irrespective of appropriateness, receiving ICD shocks substantially impairs a patient's quality of life. A variety of techniques are available using ICD programming to reliably limit the occurrence of appropriate or inappropriate ICD shocks. Antiarrhythmic medications can also effectively reduce the occurrence of shocks.

Conclusions

Through the use of effective ICD programming and antiarrhythmic medications, the occurrence of ICD shocks can be reduced while maintaining the lifesaving ability of the ICD. A basic understanding of the range of available options is fundamental for evaluation and management of the patient who has received an ICD shock.

### Acute management of ventricular Arrhythmia in Patients with Suspected Inherited heart Rhythm Disorders [^116ad93c]. JACC: Clinical Electrophysiology (2019). Medium credibility.

After the most common causes of sudden cardiac death including ischemic and structural heart disease have been ruled out, clinicians on the front lines of emergent medical care can be faced with unexplained and recurrent life-threatening arrhythmia episodes in children and adults. In these cases, an inherited arrhythmia syndrome should be suspected, and a departure from conventional advanced cardiac life support algorithms may be required. This review focuses on the electrocardiographic clues of an inherited arrhythmia syndrome that can be uncovered through a careful analysis of the baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) and classification of the presenting ventricular arrhythmia and its mode of onset. After presenting an informed working diagnosis and an explanation of the implied electrophysiologic mechanisms, discussion provides a protocol approach to acute and subacute management decisions. Careful attention to a patient's response to treatment and its ECG surrogates have the potential to facilitate tailored therapy based on the underlying arrhythmogenic substrate and pathophysiology.

### ECG clues for diagnosing ventricular tachycardia mechanism [^115xCNcq]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2008). Low credibility.

Three mechanisms underlie the initiation and maintenance of ventricular tachycardia: automaticity, triggered activity, and reentry. As straightforward as these mechanisms are, assessing which mechanism is operative in a particular patient's ventricular tachycardia can be difficult. The optimal treatment strategy for ventricular tachycardia in a given patient can be influenced by the mechanism underlying the ventricular tachycardia. Appropriately counseling patients, choosing the optimal pharmacologic agent that maximizes efficacy while minimizing undesirable side effects, risks, and toxicities, as well as recommending and timing ablative therapy all hinge on identifying the probable mechanism of ventricular tachycardia. Much has been published regarding invasive electrophysiologic maneuvers that allow for correct diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia mechanism. The aim of this clinical review is to provide insight into VT mechanisms based on ECG clues of spontaneous arrhythmia events and the response to pharmacologic manipulation prior to invasive electrophysiologic evaluation.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^1165Y4oj]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Paroxysmal supraventricular and ventricular tachycardias — management when associated with syncope: "In patients with paroxysmal AV nodal reciprocating tachycardia, AV reciprocating tachycardia, or typical atrial flutter associated with syncope, catheter ablation is the first-choice treatment". In these patients, drug therapy "is limited to being a bridge to ablation or when ablation has failed", and for AF or atypical left atrial flutter "the decision should be individualized". For torsade de pointes, "the result of drugs which prolong the QT interval", "Treatment is the immediate discontinuation of the suspected drug". For VT-related syncope, "Catheter ablation or drug therapy should be considered", while "ICD is indicated in patients with syncope and depressed cardiac function, and VT or fibrillation without correctable cause", and "it is indicated to reduce the risk of SCD" despite not usually preventing recurrences.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) — definition, diagnostic features, distinctions, and management: Inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST) is defined as sinus tachycardia that is unexplained by physiological demands at rest, with minimal exertion, or during recovery from exercise and is associated with symptoms that include weakness, fatigue, lightheadedness, and uncomfortable sensations, such as heart racing. Patients with IST commonly show resting heart rates > 100 bpm and average rates that are > 90 bpm in a 24-hour period. It is important to distinguish IST from secondary causes of tachycardia, including hyperthyroidism, anemia, dehydration, pain, and use of exogenous substances and drugs of abuse, and to exclude structural heart disease; anxiety is also an important trigger, and patients with IST may have associated anxiety disorders. IST must also be distinguished from other forms of tachycardia, including AT arising from the superior aspect of the crista terminalis and sinus node reentrant tachycardia; patients with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have predominant symptoms related to a change in posture, and treatment to suppress the sinus rate may lead to severe orthostatic hypotension. Thus, IST is a diagnosis of exclusion. There are no specific recommendations for acute treatment of IST, and because the prognosis of IST is generally benign, treatment is for symptom reduction and may not be necessary.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Orthodromic atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) — ongoing pharmacologic management when ablation is not chosen: For patients without pre-excitation on their resting ECG, oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil "are indicated", with observational data noting effectiveness in "approximately 50% of patients without pre-excitation". In patients without structural heart disease or ischemic heart disease who have AVRT and/or pre-excited AF and are not candidates for or decline ablation, oral flecainide or propafenone "is reasonable", with these drugs "effective in approximately 85% to 90% of patients", and with adverse effects where "Side effects occur in up to 60% of patients, and approximately 20% discontinue the medications because of adverse effects". For those not undergoing ablation, oral sotalol or dofetilide "may be reasonable", with initiation precautions that "inpatient monitoring with serial ECGs is generally performed". If others are ineffective or contraindicated, oral amiodarone "may be considered" for ongoing management in patients with AVRT and/or pre-excited AF.

### 2015 Heart Rhythm Society expert consensus statement on the diagnosis and treatment of postural tachycardia syndrome, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, and vasovagal syncope [^113sa8Xi]. Heart Rhythm (2015). Medium credibility.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.
