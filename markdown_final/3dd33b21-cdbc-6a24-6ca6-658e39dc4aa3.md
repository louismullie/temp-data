## Question

Treatment of polycythemia vera

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the treatment of polycythemia vera. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching treatment goals and risk stratification framework. Then, I should verify the universal foundation of care for all patients. Next, I will examine low-risk versus high-risk management, including when to add cytoreduction and which agents to choose. After that, I need to check special populations and scenarios, and finally, I will review monitoring, response criteria, and emerging therapies, making sure each assertion is supported by high-quality evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the core treatment goals and risk categories, because everything else hinges on them. The primary objective is to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications by maintaining hematocrit below 45% and using antiplatelet therapy, with secondary goals of symptom control and mitigation of disease progression, recognizing that current therapies have not definitively proven survival benefit or cure. Risk is dichotomized as high-risk if age is 60 years or older or there is a history of thrombosis, and low-risk if neither is present, which guides intensity of cytoreduction [^575b314b] [^e3ef1d46] [^f772d390].

> I need to ensure the universal foundation of care is explicit. For all patients with PV, therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit less than 45% is mandatory, and low-dose aspirin 75–100 mg daily is recommended unless contraindicated. This is supported by randomized data showing fewer cardiovascular events with strict hematocrit control and by a randomized trial demonstrating reduced thrombotic complications with low-dose aspirin, without a significant increase in major bleeding [^584875b6] [^8ceed3c7] [^38f72990] [^8e426a71].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about cytoreduction in low-risk disease. Initially, I thought cytoreduction is never indicated in low-risk patients, but wait, I should verify guideline nuances. While phlebotomy plus aspirin is standard, cytoreduction can be considered in select low-risk patients who have poor tolerance to phlebotomy, progressive or symptomatic splenomegaly, extreme thrombocytosis, persistent leukocytosis, uncontrolled hematocrit despite venesection, or high symptom burden; in these scenarios, interferon is generally preferred over hydroxyurea when cytoreduction is pursued in younger patients [^3ff29592] [^f4844bc6] [^d34a86a7].

> Next, I should review high-risk disease management. I should confirm that cytoreductive therapy is indicated for all high-risk patients, with hydroxyurea or interferon as first-line options. Hydroxyurea reduces thrombotic events and is the traditional default, while pegylated interferon or ropeginterferon are attractive in younger patients or when disease modification is a priority, given their capacity to reduce JAK2 variant allele frequency over time. Ruxolitinib is reserved for hydroxyurea resistance or intolerance, with robust randomized data supporting hematocrit control and symptom improvement in RESPONSE and RESPONSE-2 [^f772d390] [^627f60a4] [^08faede6] [^a12cc9c5] [^d00d8b68].

> Let me consider special populations and scenarios carefully. In pregnancy or women of childbearing potential, interferon is preferred because it is not teratogenic, whereas hydroxyurea should be avoided. In very elderly patients with limited life expectancy, intermittent busulfan may be reasonable. For patients with extreme thrombocytosis, I should double-check for acquired von Willebrand syndrome before prescribing aspirin to mitigate bleeding risk. For symptomatic splenomegaly or refractory pruritus, ruxolitinib is a rational choice given its efficacy in reducing spleen size and controlling symptoms. And for patients with venous thrombosis, anticoagulation is indicated, with aspirin often continued in conjunction, though I need to individualize bleeding risk [^f4844bc6] [^16e11e4a] [^575b314b] [^a12cc9c5] [^0cf2e5cd].

> I will now examine monitoring and response assessment, because treatment without targets is inadequate. Hematocrit should be checked frequently during induction and then every 3 months in maintenance, with a hard target of less than 45% in all patients. Complete hematologic response is typically defined by normalization of red cell mass and blood counts without phlebotomy, and molecular responses refer to reductions in JAK2 V617F variant allele frequency, which are more commonly achieved with interferon and are being studied as surrogates for disease modification, though clinical validation is ongoing. I should also remember to reassess cardiovascular risk annually and manage modifiable risk factors aggressively [^38f72990] [^b6f6167e] [^4a2fe775] [^ff0c2edb] [^e4386610].

> But wait, what about emerging therapies and the future landscape. Ropeginterferon has shown durable hematologic and molecular responses in randomized trials and is increasingly positioned as a disease-modifying option, particularly in younger or low-risk patients who need more stable hematocrit control than phlebotomy alone can provide. Rusfertide, a hepcidin mimetic, has early data suggesting substantial reductions in phlebotomy requirements, potentially enabling a phlebotomy-free approach, though longer-term outcomes are pending. And while JAK2 allele burden reduction is intriguing, I should confirm that it is not yet a validated surrogate endpoint for hard outcomes like thrombosis or survival in routine practice [^08faede6] [^d34a86a7] [^57dc1b3b] [^4a2fe775].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-adapted algorithm to ensure nothing is missed. All patients receive phlebotomy to hematocrit less than 45% and low-dose aspirin unless contraindicated. Low-risk patients are monitored closely, with cytoreduction considered only if they develop intolerance to phlebotomy, progressive splenomegaly, extreme thrombocytosis, persistent leukocytosis, uncontrolled hematocrit, or significant symptoms. High-risk patients should start cytoreduction with hydroxyurea or interferon, switching to ruxolitinib if hydroxyurea fails or is not tolerated. Throughout, I need to monitor for bleeding, cytopenias, and disease progression, and adjust therapy accordingly [^575b314b] [^f772d390] [^d2e80943].

> Finally, I should double-check that I have addressed the key evidence gaps and uncertainties. There is no definitive proof that cytoreduction improves survival in PV, although it clearly reduces thrombosis. The clinical significance of molecular responses remains under investigation. And optimal sequencing and combinations of therapies, including the role of early interferon to modify disease course, are active areas of research. Until then, I will continue to individualize decisions based on age, comorbidities, symptoms, fertility plans, and patient preferences, aligning with current guideline-concordant care [^575b314b] [^4a2fe775] [^05ca4945].

The cornerstone of PV management is **phlebotomy to maintain hematocrit < 45%** [^584875b6] and **low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg/day)** [^8ceed3c7] for all patients without contraindications [^8e426a71]. High-risk patients (age ≥ 60 or prior thrombosis) [^f772d390] should receive cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon [^627f60a4]; ruxolitinib is indicated for hydroxyurea resistance/intolerance [^a12cc9c5] [^d2e80943]. Low-risk patients may be managed with phlebotomy and aspirin alone, adding interferon if symptoms persist or phlebotomy is poorly tolerated [^f4844bc6] [^d34a86a7]. Monitor for thrombosis, bleeding, and progression; adjust therapy to maintain hematocrit < 45% and control symptoms [^38f72990] [^575b314b].

---

## Universal foundation: phlebotomy and aspirin

- **Phlebotomy**: Maintain hematocrit < 45% in all patients [^584875b6] to reduce thrombotic risk [^a77a76d7]; typical schedule is 300–450 mL weekly until target, then maintenance every 4–8 weeks [^5bb167d5].

- **Aspirin**: 75–100 mg/day [^8e426a71] unless contraindicated (e.g. bleeding, aspirin allergy) [^8ceed3c7]; reduces arterial and venous thrombosis without excess bleeding [^8ceed3c7].

---

## Risk-adapted cytoreductive therapy

| **Risk category** | **Definition** | **Recommended cytoreductive therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk | Age ≥ 60 years or prior thrombosis | - Hydroxyurea (first-line) [^627f60a4] <br/> - Interferon-α (pegylated or ropeginterferon) [^08faede6] (alternative, especially < 60 years) [^f4844bc6] <br/> - Ruxolitinib for hydroxyurea resistance/intolerance [^a12cc9c5] [^d2e80943] |
| Low-risk | Age < 60 years and no prior thrombosis | - Phlebotomy + aspirin alone [^575b314b] <br/> - Consider interferon if symptoms persist or phlebotomy intolerance [^f4844bc6] [^d34a86a7] |

---

## Specific cytoreductive agents

- **Hydroxyurea**: First-line for high-risk PV; effective thrombosis reduction [^notfound] and well tolerated [^notfound].

- **Interferon-α**: Preferred in younger patients, women of childbearing age, or when disease modification is desired [^f4844bc6]; ropeginterferon alfa-2b shows durable hematologic and molecular responses [^08faede6].

- **Ruxolitinib**: For hydroxyurea resistance/intolerance [^a12cc9c5]; improves hematocrit control, splenomegaly, and symptoms [^d00d8b68].

---

## Management of complications

- **Thrombosis**: Acute events require anticoagulation (LMWH, DOACs, or warfarin) per standard protocols [^0cf2e5cd]; duration individualized based on event severity and disease control [^0cf2e5cd].

- **Bleeding**: Optimize cytoreduction [^a5bb7b76]; screen for acquired von Willebrand syndrome if platelets ≥ 1,000 × 10⁹/L before aspirin [^575b314b].

- **Pruritus**: Ruxolitinib is effective for refractory cases [^a12cc9c5]; interferon or SSRIs are alternatives [^f5980474].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Regularly monitor **hematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocytes, and platelets** to guide therapy and detect progression [^notfound]. Assess cardiovascular risk annually and manage modifiable factors aggressively [^ff0c2edb] [^e4386610]. Watch for transformation to myelofibrosis or AML, with 20-year risks of ~16% and ~4%, respectively [^e665d3d6].

---

## Emerging therapies

Ropeginterferon alfa-2b demonstrates **durable hematologic and molecular responses** and is increasingly used in low-risk patients [^08faede6] [^d34a86a7]. Rusfertide, a hepcidin mimetic, significantly reduces phlebotomy needs and is under regulatory review [^57dc1b3b]. Novel agents targeting JAK2, iron metabolism, and immune pathways are in development [^f5415ab6].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

- **All patients**: Phlebotomy to hematocrit < 45% + aspirin 75–100 mg/day [^584875b6] [^8e426a71].

- **High-risk patients**: Add cytoreduction (hydroxyurea or interferon); ruxolitinib if hydroxyurea fails/intolerant [^f772d390] [^a12cc9c5].

- **Low-risk patients**: Phlebotomy + aspirin; consider interferon if symptoms or phlebotomy intolerance [^f4844bc6] [^d34a86a7].

- **Monitor**: Regular labs, cardiovascular risk, and disease progression [^ff0c2edb] [^575b314b].

---

Effective PV care centers on **strict hematocrit control**, **risk-adapted cytoreduction**, and **symptom management**, with therapy individualized to age, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^575b314b].

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera (...) [^51b257ee]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance Polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an increased red blood cell mass and increased risk of thrombosis, affects approximately 65 000 people in the US, with an annual incidence of 0. 5 to
4. 0 cases per 100 000 persons. Observations Erythrocytosis is a required diagnostic criterion, although thrombocytosis and leukocytosis are common. Patients may have pruritus, erythromelalgia, transient visual changes, and splenomegaly with abdominal discomfort. PV is also associated with an increased bleeding risk, especially in patients with acquired von Willebrand disease, which can occur with extreme thrombocytosis. All patients with PV should receive therapeutic phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin.

Patients who are at higher risk of thrombosis include those aged 60 years or older or with a prior thrombosis. These patients and those with persistent PV symptoms may benefit from cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon to lower thrombosis risk and decrease symptoms. Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor that can alleviate pruritus and decrease splenomegaly in patients who are intolerant of or resistant to hydroxyurea. About 12. 7% of patients with PV develop myelofibrosis and
6. 8% develop acute myeloid leukemia. Conclusions and Relevance PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by erythrocytosis and is almost universally associated with a JAK2 gene variant. PV is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, myelofibrosis, and acute myeloid leukemia. To decrease the risk of thrombosis, all patients with PV should be treated with aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit of less than 45%.

Cytoreductive therapies, such as hydroxyurea or interferon, are recommended for patients at high risk of thrombosis. JAMA+ AI Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### How I treat polycythemia vera [^d635c9b8]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its discovery, polycythemia vera (PV) has challenged clinicians responsible for its diagnosis and management and scientists investigating its pathogenesis. As a clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder, PV is a neoplasm but its driver mutations result in overproduction of morphologically and functionally normal blood cells. PV arises in an HSC but it can present initially as isolated erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or any combination of these together with splenomegaly or myelofibrosis, and it can take years for a true panmyelopathy to appear. PV shares the same JAK2 mutation as essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis, but erythrocytosis only occurs in PV. However, unlike secondary causes of erythrocytosis, in PV, the plasma volume is frequently expanded, masking the erythrocytosis and making diagnosis difficult if this essential fact is ignored. PV is not a monolithic disorder: female patients deregulate fewer genes and clinically behave differently than their male counterparts, while some PV patients are genetically predisposed to an aggressive clinical course. Nevertheless, based on what we have learned over the past century, most PV patients can lead long and productive lives. In this review, using clinical examples, I describe how I diagnose and manage PV in an evidence-based manner without relying on chemotherapy.

### Cardiovascular events and intensity of treatment in polycythemia vera [^584875b6]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

Background

Current treatment recommendations for patients with polycythemia vera call for maintaining a hematocrit of less than 45%, but this therapeutic strategy has not been tested in a randomized clinical trial.

Methods

We randomly assigned 365 adults with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera who were being treated with phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, or both to receive either more intensive treatment (target hematocrit, <45%) (low-hematocrit group) or less intensive treatment (target hematocrit, 45 to 50%) (high-hematocrit group). The primary composite end point was the time until death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events. The secondary end points were cardiovascular events, cardiovascular hospitalizations, incidence of cancer, progression to myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation, and hemorrhage. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed.

Results

After a median follow-up of 31 months, the primary end point was recorded in 5 of 182 patients in the low-hematocrit group (2.7%) and 18 of 183 patients in the high-hematocrit group (9.8%) (hazard ratio in the high-hematocrit group, 3.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.45 to 10.53; P=0.007). The primary end point plus superficial-vein thrombosis occurred in 4.4% of patients in the low-hematocrit group, as compared with 10.9% in the high-hematocrit group (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.19 to 6.12; P=0.02). Progression to myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation, and bleeding were observed in 6, 2, and 2 patients, respectively, in the low-hematocrit group, as compared with 2, 1, and 5 patients, respectively, in the high-hematocrit group. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients with polycythemia vera, those with a hematocrit target of less than 45% had a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular death and major thrombosis than did those with a hematocrit target of 45 to 50%.

### Antiplatelet drugs for polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia [^104a7e94]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia are chronic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms that increase the risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, as well as bleeding. In addition to the different therapeutic strategies available, an antiplatelet drug is often used to reduce thrombotic risk.

Objectives

To quantify the benefit and harm of antiplatelet drugs for long-term primary and secondary prophylaxis of arterial and venous thrombotic events in patients with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library (Issue 1 2012), MEDLINE (1966 to 2012), and EMBASE (1980 to 2012), as well as online registers of ongoing trials and conference proceedings. The date of the last search was October 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing long-term (>6 months) use of an antiplatelet drug versus placebo or no treatment in participants with polycythaemia vera or essential thrombocythaemia, as diagnosed by established international criteria, with data for at least one of the selected outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Using a pre-defined extraction form, two review authors independently screened results, extracted data, and assessed quality. We planned to analyse the following outcomes: mortality from arterial and venous thrombotic events (primary efficacy outcome), mortality from bleeding episodes (primary safety outcome), fatal and non-fatal arterial thrombotic events, fatal and non-fatal venous thrombotic events, micro-circulation events, transient neurological and ocular manifestations, major and minor bleeding episodes, and all-cause mortality and any adverse events. We based quantitative analysis of outcome data on an intention-to-treat principle. We used the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) with a fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel) to estimate the overall treatment effect.

Main Results

We identified no new studies from the updated searches. We included in this review two RCTs for a total of 630 participants. Both RCTs included participants with an established diagnosis of polycythaemia vera and with no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy. We judged both studies to be of moderate quality. Published data from both studies were insufficient for a time-to-event data analysis and for some of the primary and secondary outcomes that we planned. The use of low-dose aspirin, compared with placebo, was associated with a lower risk of fatal thrombotic events (although this benefit was not statistically significant (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.14; P = 0.07). No data on mortality from bleeding episodes were available. A non-significant benefit of aspirin was shown for all-cause mortality (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01; P = 0.05). No increase in the risk of major bleeding was reported in participants taking aspirin compared with those given placebo (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.23 to 4.36; P = 0.99), and a non-significant increase with aspirin treatment was shown for minor bleeding (OR 1.85, 95% CI 0.90 to 3.79; P = 0.09). No published studies have reported findings in participants with essential thrombocythaemia or in the study of other antiplatelet drugs.

Authors' Conclusions

For patients with polycythaemia vera who have no clear indication or contraindication to aspirin therapy, available evidence suggests that the use of low-dose aspirin, when compared with no treatment, is associated with a statistically non-significant reduction in the risk of fatal thrombotic events and all-cause mortality, without an increased risk of major bleeding.

### Improving the investigative approach to polycythaemia vera: a critical assessment of current evidence and vision for the future [^5f8c15c2]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Polycythaemia vera is a challenging disease to study given its low prevalence and prolonged time-to-event for important clinical endpoints such as thrombosis, progression, and mortality. Although researchers in this space often rise to meet these challenges, there is considerable room for improvement in the analysis of retrospective data, the development of risk-stratification tools, and the design of randomised controlled trials. In this Viewpoint, we review the evidence behind the contemporary approach to risk stratification and treatment of polycythaemia vera. Frameworks for using data more efficiently, constructing more nuanced prognostic models, and overcoming challenges in clinical trial design are discussed.

### Current management of polycythemia vera [^294dbaf9]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

Over a century has elapsed since the first description of polycythemia vera (PV), and current treatment recommendations are primarily based on the results of clinical trials that were performed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Continued identification and appropriate utilization of PV-specific biologic parameters may allow substantial modification of early diagnostic criteria. New cytoreductive treatment agents are increasingly being used without any evidence of superiority over conventional therapy. The role of aspirin is being readdressed by an ongoing controlled study. Transformation of PV into either myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or acute leukemia remains a major complication that may not be influenced by current therapy.

### Practice patterns in the diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera in the post-JAK2 V617F discovery era [^140fb0b5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2016). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is an acquired clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets; thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications; and an increased risk of transformation to myelofibrosis and acute leukemia. In 1967, the Polycythemia Vera Study Group proposed the optimal approach to diagnosis and treatment of PV, and in 2002, investigators from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine surveyed the practice patterns of hematologists as they pertained to PV. Since this survey, the JAK2 V617F mutation was discovered, leading to a new era of discovery in the disease pathogenesis, diagnosis, and classification and treatment of PV. Our objective was to survey hematologists in the diagnosis and treatment of PV in the modern, post-JAK2 V617F discovery era. An anonymous 17-question survey was emailed to members of the Myeloproliferative Neoplasm (MPN) Research Foundation database and Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation. A total of 71 surveys were used in the analysis. Diagnostic testing varied according to the respondent's clinical experience and practice type. In addition, there were marked differences in target hematocrit and platelet count among those surveyed. There continue to be variations in diagnosis and treatment of PV despite WHO guidelines and the JAK2 discovery. US-based guidelines for MPNs are needed to create consistency in the management of PV and other MPNs.

### Management of polycythaemia vera: a critical review of current data [^19431c34]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a chronic blood cancer; its clinical features are dominated by myeloproliferation (erythrocytosis, often leucocytosis and/or thrombocytosis) and a tendency for thrombosis and transformation to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukaemia. In the past 10 years the pathophysiology of this condition has been defined as JAK/STAT pathway activation, almost always due to mutations in JAK2 exons 12 or 14 (JAK2 V617F). In the same time period our understanding of the optimal management of PV has expanded, most recently culminating in the approval of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of PV patients who are resistant or intolerant to therapy with hydroxycarbamide. It has also been demonstrated that life expectancy for many patients with PV is not normal, nor is their quality of life. We critically explore these findings and discuss their impact. In addition, we highlight persisting gaps in our current management strategy; for example, what is the optimal first line cytoreductive therapy and, indeed, which patients need cytoreductive drugs.

### Polycythemia vera: past, present and future [^f5415ab6]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2024). Medium credibility.

There has been remarkable progress in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for patients with polycythemia vera (PV). Historically, therapy goals in PV were to mitigate thrombotic risks and control blood counts and symptoms. There is now increased focus on disease modification through progressive attrition of JAK2 -mutant stem/progenitor cells. The approval of ropeginterferon, a novel monoPEGylated interferon, coupled with findings from LOW-PV and longer-term data from CONTINUATION-PV that strongly support a disease-modifying effect for interferon therapy, have transformed the treatment paradigm for this disorder. Results from MAJIC-PV demonstrate that disease modification can also be induced with JAK inhibitors, suggesting an urgent need to incorporate prospective molecular monitoring into PV trials. Novel agents, such as hepcidin mimetics, aim to help patients with PV restore normal hematocrit levels and become phlebotomy-free. In this review, we will summarize past, current and future approaches to PV management and highlight findings from key clinical studies.

### How I treat polycythemia vera [^60f4f2d4]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with JAK2 mutations (V617F or exon 12) in almost all cases. The World Health Organization has defined the criteria for diagnosis, but it is still unclear which parameter (hemoglobin or hematocrit) is the most reliable for demonstrating increased red cell volume and for monitoring response to therapy; also, the role of bone marrow biopsy is being revisited. PV is associated with reduced survival because of cardiovascular complications and progression to post-PV myelofibrosis or leukemia. Criteria for risk-adapted treatment rely on the likelihood of thrombosis. Controlled trials have demonstrated that incidence of cardiovascular events is reduced by sustained control of hematocrit with phlebotomies (low-risk patients) and/or cytotoxic agents (high-risk patients) and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin. Hydroxyurea and interferon may be used as first-line treatments, whereas busulfan is reserved for patients that are refractory or resistant to first-line agents. However, there is no evidence that therapy improves survival, and the significance of reduction of JAK2 mutated allele burden produced by interferon is unknown. PV is also associated with a plethora of symptoms that are poorly controlled by conventional therapy. This article summarizes my approach to the management of PV in daily clinical practice.

### Polycythemia vera: historical oversights, diagnostic details, and therapeutic views [^e665d3d6]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a relatively indolent myeloid neoplasm with median survival that exceeds 35 years in young patients, but its natural history might be interrupted by thrombotic, fibrotic, or leukemic events, with respective 20-year rates of 26%, 16%, and 4%. Current treatment strategies in PV have not been shown to prolong survival or lessen the risk of leukemic or fibrotic progression and instead are directed at preventing thrombotic complications. In the latter regard, two risk categories are considered: high (age >60 years or thrombosis history) and low (absence of both risk factors). All patients require phlebotomy to keep hematocrit below 45% and once-daily low-dose aspirin, in the absence of contraindications. Cytoreductive therapy is recommended for high-risk or symptomatic low-risk disease; our first-line drug of choice in this regard is hydroxyurea but we consider pegylated interferon as an alternative in certain situations, including in young women of reproductive age, in patients manifesting intolerance or resistance to hydroxyurea therapy, and in situations where treatment is indicated for curbing phlebotomy requirement rather than preventing thrombosis. Additional treatment options include busulfan and ruxolitinib; the former is preferred in older patients and the latter in the presence of symptoms reminiscent of post-PV myelofibrosis or protracted pruritus. Our drug choices reflect our appreciation for long-term track record of safety, evidence for reduction of thrombosis risk, and broader suppression of myeloproliferation. Controlled studies are needed to clarify the added value of twice- vs once-daily aspirin dosing and direct oral anticoagulants. In this invited review, we discuss our current approach to diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of PV in general, as well as during specific situations, including pregnancy and splanchnic vein thrombosis.

### How I treat patients with polycythemia vera [^affef6e4]. Blood (2007). Low credibility.

The clinical course of polycythemia vera (PV) is marked by a high incidence of thrombotic complications; fibrotic and leukemic disease transformations are additional causes of morbidity and mortality. Major predictors of vascular events are increasing age and previous thrombosis; leukocytosis and high JAK2 V617F allele burden are currently being investigated for additional prognostic value in this regard. Myelosuppressive drugs can reduce the rate of thrombosis, but there is concern that their use raises the risk of transformation into acute leukemia. To tackle this dilemma, a risk-oriented management strategy is recommended. Low-risk patients should be treated with phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin. Cytotoxic therapy is indicated in high-risk patients, and the drug of choice is hydroxyurea because of its efficacy in preventing thrombosis and low leukemogenicity. Interferon-alpha should be reserved for selected categories of patients due to high cost and toxicity. The demonstration of JAK2 V617F mutation in the vast majority of PV patients opens the avenue for the development of promising new molecularly targeted drugs.

### Polycythemia vera: an appraisal of the biology and management 10 years after the discovery of JAK2 V617F [^f4070800]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm that is associated with a substantial symptom burden, thrombohemorrhagic complications, and impaired survival. A decade after the seminal discovery of an activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in nearly all patients with PV, new treatment options are finally beginning to emerge, necessitating a critical reappraisal of the underlying pathogenesis and therapeutic modalities available for PV. Herein, we comprehensively review clinical aspects of PV including diagnostic considerations, natural history, and risk factors for thrombosis. We summarize recent studies delineating the genetic basis of PV, including their implications for evolution to myelofibrosis and secondary acute myeloid leukemia. We assess the quality of evidence to support the use of currently available therapies, including aspirin, phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, and interferon. We analyze recent studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of JAK inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, and evaluate their role in the context of other available therapies for PV. This review provides a framework for practicing hematologists and oncologists to make rational treatment decisions for patients with PV.

### What are the current treatment approaches for patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia? [^8bbba0df]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms that are characterized by thrombohemorrhagic complications, symptom burden, and impaired survival mainly due to thrombosis, progression to myelofibrosis, and transformation to acute leukemia. In this manuscript, we will review the most recent changes in diagnostic criteria, the improvements in risk stratification, and the "state of the art" in the daily management of these disorders. The role of conventional therapies and novel agents, interferon α and the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, is critically discussed based on the results of a few basic randomized clinical studies. Several unmet needs remain, above all, the lack of a curative approach that might overcome the still burdensome morbidity and mortality of these hematologic neoplasms, as well as the toxicities associated with therapeutic agents.

### From leeches to personalized medicine: evolving concepts in the management of polycythemia vera [^9022c0e8]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. It manifests as an expansion of red cell mass. It is the most common chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. In virtually all cases, it is characterized by a V617F point mutation in JAK2 exon 14 or less common mutations in exon 12. The landmark discovery of the autonomously activated JAK/STAT signaling pathway paved the way for the clinical development of the first target drug, the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. This is now approved for patients with resistance or intolerance to hydroxyurea. Phlebotomies and hydroxyurea are still the cornerstone of treatment, and aim to prevent the first appearance or recurrence of cardiovascular events that, together with progression to post-polycythemia vera myelofibrosis and leukemia, represent the main causes of death. Interferon-α is an alternative drug and has been shown to induce molecular remissions. It is currently undergoing phase III trials that might eventually lead to its approval for clinical use. The last few years have witnessed important advances towards an accurate early diagnosis of polycythemia vera, greater understanding of its pathogenesis, and improved patient management. This review will focus on the most recent achievements and will aim to unify the different concepts involved in a personalized approach to the patient with polycythemia vera. In spite of many recent advances in the understanding of its pathogenesis and improved disease management, polycythemia vera remains a life-threatening myeloproliferative neoplasm for which there is no cure. This review will present a critical overview of evolving concepts in diagnosis and treatment of this disease.

### Recent advances in the treatment of polycythemia vera [^c7bf7a45]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2022). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) has long been recognized as a disease characterized by excess blood cell production leading to thromboembolic phenomena. While the focus of treatment is on prevention of thromboembolic complications, achieved by hematocrit control and administration of low dose aspirin, attention has begun to shift to other elements of this chronic neoplasm, namely symptom control and arrest of disease progression. Clearly, phlebotomy is not able to accomplish these goals, and the ability of cytoreductive agents such as hydroxyurea (HU), to influence these elements of the disease is limited. Novel and repurposed drugs have recently entered this space, based on promising initial studies demonstrating their effects on biologic outcomes such as JAK2 V617F variant allele frequency (VAF). In this review, we present updated results of randomized clinical trials of pegylated interferon (IFN) and ruxolitinib and summarize emerging data from early phase trials of novel agents in PV.

### Clinical outcomes under hydroxyurea treatment in polycythemia vera: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^8eafb52a]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Hydroxyurea is the standard treatment in high-risk patients with polycythemia vera. However, estimates of its effect in terms of clinical outcomes (thrombosis, bleeding, hematologic transformations and mortality) are lacking. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the absolute risk of events in recent cases of patients under hydroxyurea treatment. We searched for relevant articles or abstracts in the following databases: Medline, EMBASE,, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry, LILACS. Sixteen studies published from 2008 to 2018 reporting number of events using World Health Organization diagnosis for polycythemia vera were selected. Through a random effect logistic model, incidences, study heterogeneity and confounder effects were estimated for each outcome at different follow ups. Overall, 3,236 patients were analyzed. While incidences of thrombosis and acute myeloid leukemia were stable over time, mortality and myelofibrosis varied depending on follow-up duration. Thrombosis rates were 1.9%, 3.6% and 6.8% persons/year at median ages 60, 70 and 80 years, respectively. Higher incidence of arterial events was predicted by previous cardiovascular complication. Leukemic transformation incidence was 0.4% persons/year. Incidence of transformation to myelofibrosis and mortality were significantly dependent on age and follow-up duration. For myelofibrosis, rates were 5.0 at five years and 33.7% at ten years; overall mortality was 12.6% and 56.2% at five and ten years, respectively. In conclusion, we provide reliable risk estimates for the main outcomes in polycythemia vera patients under hydroxyurea treatment. These findings can help design comparative clinical trials with new cytoreductive drugs and prove the feasibility of using critical end points for efficacy, such as major thrombosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera (...) [^a794bd9c]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

More than 95% of patients have a JAK2 gene variant, which helps distinguish PV from secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as tobacco smoking or sleep apnea. Among 7 cohorts, the median survival from diagnosis was 14. 1 to
27. 6 years. Prior to or at the time of PV diagnosis, arterial thrombosis occurred in 16% of patients and 7% had venous thrombotic events, which could involve unusual sites, such as splanchnic veins. PV is also associated with an increased bleeding risk, especially in patients with acquired von Willebrand disease, which can occur with extreme thrombocytosis. All patients with PV should receive therapeutic phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin. Patients who are at higher risk of thrombosis include those aged 60 years or older or with a prior thrombosis.

These patients and those with persistent PV symptoms may benefit from cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon to lower thrombosis risk and decrease symptoms. Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor that can alleviate pruritus and decrease splenomegaly in patients who are intolerant of or resistant to hydroxyurea. About 12. 7% of patients with PV develop myelofibrosis and
6. 8% develop acute myeloid leukemia. Conclusions and Relevance PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by erythrocytosis and is almost universally associated with a JAK2 gene variant. PV is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, myelofibrosis, and acute myeloid leukemia. To decrease the risk of thrombosis, all patients with PV should be treated with aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit of less than 45%. Cytoreductive therapies, such as hydroxyurea or interferon, are recommended for patients at high risk of thrombosis.

Consensus guidelines have helped to standardize the care of patients with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera, focusing on reducing the risk of thrombosis, mitigating symptoms, and avoiding therapies that may accelerate disease progression. However, many unmet needs still exist ranging from the roll of antiplatelet therapy in ET to medications that reduce disease progression. Retrospective studies suggest an improvement in myelofibrosis-free survival for treatment with interferons; new agents are looking to also enact disease modification.

### Polycythemia vera treatment algorithm 2018 [^d539d11a]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Recently reported mature survival data have confirmed the favorable prognosis in polycythemia vera (PV), with an estimated median survival of 24 years, in patients younger than age 60 years old. Currently available drugs for PV have not been shown to prolong survival or alter the natural history of the disease and are instead indicated primarily for prevention of thrombosis. Unfortunately, study endpoints that are being utilized in currently ongoing clinical trials in PV do not necessarily target clinically or biologically relevant outcomes, such as thrombosis, survival, or morphologic remission, and are instead focused on components of disease palliation. Even more discouraging has been the lack of critical appraisal from "opinion leaders", on the added value of newly approved drugs. Keeping these issues in mind, at present, we continue to advocate conservative management in low-risk PV (phlebotomy combined with once- or twice-daily aspirin therapy) and include cytoreductive therapy in "high-risk" patients; in the latter regard, our first, second, and third line drugs of choice are hydroxyurea, pegylated interferon-α and busulfan, respectively. In addition, it is reasonable to consider JAK2 inhibitor therapy, in the presence of protracted pruritus or markedly enlarged splenomegaly shown to be refractory to the aforementioned drugs.

### Therapeutic options for patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia refractory / resistant to hydroxyurea [^b13882dd]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2014). Low credibility.

Hydroxyurea (HU) has traditionally been the first-line treatment for patients with polycythemia vera (PV) or essential thrombocythemia (ET) at high risk for vascular complications. However, approximately 20-25% of patients develop resistance or intolerance to HU and must be treated with second-line therapies. Resistance is associated with disease transformation and reduced survival. However, given the dearth of large-scale controlled clinical trials in this patient population, there is no clear consensus on how to best treat patients who develop resistance or intolerance to HU. Herein, we review current literature on treatment options for patients with HU-refractory/resistant PV or ET and provide recommendations for treating these patients.

### The diagnosis and management of polycythemia vera in the era since the polycythemia vera study group: a survey of American Society of Hematology members' practice patterns [^ff90e756]. Blood (2002). Low credibility.

The Polycythemia Vera Study Group (PVSG) was organized in 1967 to identify the optimal approach to the diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera (PV). Nevertheless, a systematic assessment of US physicians' approach to PV has not been performed. To determine practice patterns in the management of PV, a random sample of the US American Society of Hematology (ASH) membership was surveyed. Thirty-three percent of 3000 surveys were returned. Significant variations in diagnostic and therapeutic approach were evident by region, practice type, specialty, and clinical experience. Red cell volume determinations (78% of respondents), serum erythropoietin levels (76%), and arterial blood gases (75%) were the most frequent tests used in the diagnosis of PV. Sixty-nine percent of physicians use phlebotomy as their first choice for erythrocytosis. Phlebotomy plus hydroxyurea (27.8%) and hydroxyurea alone (10%) were used less often. Despite PVSG recommendations, almost 16% of physicians used a target hematocrit of 0.55 (50%) or 0.55 (55%) for phlebotomy therapy. Eighty-two percent of physicians treated thrombocytosis only when platelet counts exceeded 1000 x 10(9)/L (1 000 000/microL) or in the event of symptoms. Hydroxyurea (62.8%) and anagrelide (35.4%) were the primary agents used to treat thrombocytosis. Thus, this national survey of US hematologists and oncologists has identified substantial variation in the approach to the diagnosis and treatment of PV. A significant minority of physicians undertreat erythrocytosis, and little consensus exists regarding the treatment of thrombocytosis.

### Treatment of polycythemia vera-AAFP (...) [^f5980474]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is one of three chronic myeloproliferative disorders, along with essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. The incidence of PV is 2. 3 per 100, 000 patients, and the median age at diagnosis is 60 years. Tefferi recommends treatment options for PV. Polycythemia describes an increase in red blood cell mass. The increase in red blood cell mass may be caused by an actual increase in red blood cell mass or a spurious laboratory value. True polycythemia is classified as either primary or secondary. Primary polycythemia is caused by a myeloproliferation and is not mediated by excess erythropoietin. In contrast, secondary polycythemia can be caused by an external source, such as “smoker's polycythemia, ” or an internal disorder, such as renal cancer. Erythropoietin levels in secondary polycythemias vary depending on the etiology.

PV can have life-threatening complications, including stroke and evolution into either myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or acute leukemia. Treatment is directed according to patient risk stratification. Frequent phlebotomy and chemotherapy are the cornerstones of treatment. Hematocrit levels should be maintained below 45 percent in white men and 42 percent in women and blacks. Chemotherapy using hydroxyurea, busulfan, or pipobroman is indicated for high-risk patients. Interferon-alfa is another chemotherapeutic option for reducing red blood cell burden and treating PV-associated pruritus. Non-life–threatening sequelae include microvascular complications and aquagenic pruritus.

Microvascular complications may appear clinically as headache, light-headed-ness, transient neurologic abnormality, transient ocular disturbance, tinnitus, atypical chest pain, paresthesias, and erythromelalgia. Low-dose aspirin can be used to treat these disorders. Aquagenic pruritus is a generalized body itching often brought on by a hot bath. Treatment options include either selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or interferon-alfa.

### Platelet activation and inhibition in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^0f1069e6]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Persistently enhanced platelet activation has been characterized in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) and shown to contribute to a higher risk of both arterial and venous thrombotic complications. The incidence of major bleeding complications is also somewhat higher in PV and ET than in the general population. Although its efficacy and safety was assessed in just 1 relatively small trial in PV, low-dose aspirin is currently recommended in practically all PV and ET patients. Although for most patients with a thrombosis history the benefit/risk profile of antiplatelet therapy is likely to be favorable, in those with no such history this balance will depend critically on the level of thrombotic and hemorrhagic risks of the individual patient. Recent evidence for a chemopreventive effect of low-dose aspirin may tilt the balance of benefits and harm in favor of using aspirin more broadly, but the potential for additional benefits needs regulatory scrutiny and novel treatment guidelines. A clear pharmacodynamic rationale and analytical tools are available for a personalized approach to antiplatelet therapy in ET, and an improved regimen of low-dose aspirin therapy should be tested in a properly sized randomized trial.

### Cytoreduction for ET and PV: who, what, when, and how? [^84b71b83]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic complications are the primary contributor to morbidity and mortality in essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV). Cytoreductive therapy is the main tool for primary or tertiary thrombosis prevention in these diseases. In general, high-thrombotic-risk patients and those with symptoms that may be ameliorated from cytoreductive therapy are candidates for this treatment, although the decision is highly individualized. Approved options for cytoreduction in ET and PV include hydroxyurea, long-acting interferons, anagrelide in ET, and ruxolitinib in PV. Selecting the ideal agent requires careful consideration of the toxicity profiles and individual treatment goals. In this review the existing literature on cytoreductive decisions in ET and PV is summarized, with an emphasis on risk-stratification, highlighting the need for personalized care in order to maximize the benefit of these therapies while minimizing toxicities.

### Long-term efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib versus best available therapy in polycythaemia vera (RESPONSE): 5-year follow up of a phase 3 study [^a12cc9c5]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Background

Polycythaemia vera is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterised by excessive proliferation of erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic components in the bone marrow due to mutations in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene. Ruxolitinib, a JAK 1 and JAK 2 inhibitor, showed superiority over best available therapy in a phase 2 study in patients with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. We aimed to compare the long-term safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib with best available therapy in patients with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea.

Methods

We report the 5-year results for a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study (RESPONSE) that enrolled patients at 109 sites across North America, South America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region. Patients (18 years or older) with polycythaemia vera who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either ruxolitinib or best available therapy. Patients randomly assigned to the ruxolitinib group received the drug orally at a starting dose of 10 mg twice a day. Single-agent best available therapy comprised hydroxyurea, interferon or pegylated interferon, pipobroman, anagrelide, approved immunomodulators, or observation without pharmacological treatment. The primary endpoint, composite response (patients who achieved both haematocrit control without phlebotomy and 35% or more reduction from baseline in spleen volume) at 32 weeeks was previously reported. Patients receiving best available therapy could cross over to ruxolitinib after week 32. We assessed the durability of primary composite response, complete haematological remission, overall clinicohaematological response, overall survival, patient-reported outcomes, and safety after 5-years of follow-up. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01243944.

Findings

We enrolled patients between Oct 27, 2010, and Feb 13, 2013, and the study concluded on Feb 9, 2018. Of 342 individuals screened for eligibility, 222 patients were randomly assigned to receive ruxolitinib (n=110, 50%) or best available therapy (n=112, 50%). The median time since polycythaemia vera diagnosis was 8·2 years (IQR 3·9-12·3) in the ruxolitinib group and 9·3 years (4·9-13·8) in the best available therapy group. 98 (88%) of 112 patients initially randomly assigned to best available therapy crossed over to receive ruxolitinib and no patient remained on best available therapy after 80 weeks of study. Among 25 primary responders in the ruxolitinib group, six had progressed at the time of final analysis. At 5 years, the probability of maintaining primary composite response was 74% (95% CI 51-88). The probability of maintaining complete haematological remission was 55% (95% CI 32-73) and the probability of maintaining overall clinicohaematological responses was 67% (54-77). In the intention-to-treat analysis not accounting for crossover, the probability of survival at 5 years was 91·9% (84·4-95·9) with ruxolitinib therapy and 91·0% (82·8-95·4) with best available therapy. Anaemia was the most common adverse event in patients receiving ruxolitinib (rates per 100 patient-years of exposure were 8·9 for ruxolitinib and 8·8 for the crossover population), though most anaemia events were mild to moderate in severity (grade 1 or 2 anaemia rates per 100 patient-years of exposure were 8·0 for ruxolitinib and 8·2 for the crossover population). Non-haematological adverse events were generally lower with long-term ruxolitinib treatment than with best available therapy. Thromboembolic events were lower in the ruxolitinib group than the best available therapy group. There were two on-treatment deaths in the ruxolitinib group. One of these deaths was due to gastric adenocarcinoma, which was assessed by the investigator as related to ruxolitinib treatment.

Interpretation

We showed that ruxolitinib is a safe and effective long-term treatment option for patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. Taken together, ruxolitinib treatment offers the first widely approved therapeutic alternative for this post-hydroxyurea patient population.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in polycythemia vera [^8ceed3c7]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

The use of aspirin for the prevention of thrombotic complications in polycythemia vera is controversial.

Methods

We enrolled 518 patients with polycythemia vera, no clear indication for aspirin treatment, and no contraindication to such treatment in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy of prophylaxis with low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily). The two primary end points were the cumulative rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes and the cumulative rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, pulmonary embolism, major venous thrombosis, or death from cardiovascular causes. The mean duration of follow-up was about three years.

Results

Treatment with aspirin, as compared with placebo, reduced the risk of the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.41; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.15 to 1.15; P=0.09) and the risk of the combined end point of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, pulmonary embolism, major venous thrombosis, or death from cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.40; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.91; P=0.03). Overall mortality and cardiovascular mortality were not reduced significantly. The incidence of major bleeding episodes was not significantly increased in the aspirin group (relative risk, 1.62; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.27 to 9.71).

Conclusions

Low-dose aspirin can safely prevent thrombotic complications in patients with polycythemia vera who have no contraindications to such treatment.

### Appropriate management of polycythaemia vera with cytoreductive drug therapy: European LeukemiaNet 2021 recommendations [^f4844bc6]. The Lancet: Haematology (2022). High credibility.

Polycythaemia vera is associated with a reduced quality of life, a high rate of vascular events, and an intrinsic risk of disease evolution. The results of several randomised trials for the treatment of this disorder are now available, and both a new ropegylated formulation of interferon alfa-2b (ropeginterferon alfa-2b; 2018) and ruxolitinib (2015) have been approved in Europe. European LeukemiaNet (ELN) investigators have therefore deemed it appropriate to provide recommendations for the use of these drugs in clinical practice. An expert panel of 14 senior haematologists from ELN centres that had actively participated in previous ELN projects or relevant randomised trials, chaired by a member of the ELN Steering Committee, developed a list of clinical questions, and a methodologist established three patient, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) questions and systematically reviewed the evidence. Recommendations were approved by six Delphi consensus rounds and two virtual meetings (on Jan 26, 2021, and June 24, 2021). The expert panel recommended that patients with polycythaemia vera who are younger than 60 years and have not had previous thrombotic events should start cytoreductive drug therapy if at least one of the following criteria are fulfilled: strictly defined intolerance to phlebotomy, symptomatic progressive splenomegaly, persistent leukocytosis (>15×10 9 white blood cells per L), progressive leukocytosis (at least 100% increase if baseline count is <10×10 9 cells per L or at least 50% increase if baseline count is >10×10 9 cells per L), extreme thrombocytosis (>1500×10 9 platelets per L), inadequate haematocrit control requiring phlebotomies, persistently high cardiovascular risk, and persistently high symptom burden. Recombinant interferon alfa, either in the form of ropeginterferon alfa-2b or pegylated interferon alfa-2a, is the recommended cytoreductive treatment for these patients. The expert panel suggested that either interferon alfa or ruxolitinib should be considered for patients who are being treated with hydroxyurea but require a therapy change.

### Moving toward disease modification in polycythemia vera [^05ca4945]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) belongs to the BCR-ABL1-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms and is characterized by activating mutations in JAK2 and clinically presents with erythrocytosis, variable degrees of systemic and vasomotor symptoms, and an increased risk of both thromboembolic events and progression to myelofibrosis and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Treatment selection is based on a patient's age and a history of thrombosis in patients with low-risk PV treated with therapeutic phlebotomy and aspirin alone, whereas cytoreductive therapy with either hydroxyurea or interferon alfa (IFN-α) is added for high-risk disease. However, other disease features such as significant disease-related symptoms and splenomegaly, concurrent thrombocytosis and leukocytosis, or intolerance of phlebotomy can constitute an indication for cytoreductive therapy in patients with otherwise low-risk disease. Additionally, recent studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy (ie, reduction in phlebotomy requirements and molecular responses) of ropegylated IFN-α2b support its use for patients with low-risk PV. Additionally, emerging data suggest that early treatment is associated with higher rates of molecular responses, which might eventually enable time-limited therapy. Nonetheless, longer follow-up is needed to assess whether molecular responses associate with clinically meaningful outcome measures such as thrombosis and progression to myelofibrosis or AML. In this article, we provide an overview of the current and evolving treatment landscape of PV and outline our vision for a patient-centered, phlebotomy-free, treatment approach using time-limited, disease-modifying treatment modalities early in the disease course, which could ultimately affect the natural history of the disease.

### Do all patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia need cytoreduction? [^bacd8a16]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), characterized by expansion of normal blood counts, bleeding, thrombosis, and the potential for transformation to myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary goals of treatment for MPNs are to reduce the risk of thrombosis, alleviate systemic symptom burden (eg, fatigue, pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly), and to prevent transformation to MF/AML. Preventing transformation is clearly important, but not expected with current therapies. Currently, cytoreduction is advised based on vascular risk assessments, which include age and thrombosis history, as well as molecular profile in ET. Traditionally, cytoreduction has been advised only in patients with high vascular risk. Recently, a large prospective study evaluated the safety and efficacy of cytoreduction in patients with ET with less-than-high-risk vascular profiles. A larger question in the MPN field is whether cytoreduction is advisable for all patients with ET and PV, regardless of risk. This article reviews existing data on cytoreduction, evaluating hydroxyurea, interferons, and ruxolitinib in ET and PV. This review evaluates whether evidence supports a more liberal strategy of cytoreduction for all patients with ET and PV.

### Cardiovascular events and intensity of treatment in polycythemia vera [^f595cc19]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study CYTO-PV was published by Marchioli R and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Polycythemia and Polycythemia vera. In the CYTO-PV study, the trial question was: what is the role of hematocrit target < 45% in patients with polycythemia vera? In the CYTO-PV study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CYTO-PV study, the population was: 365 patients (138 female, 227 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera who were being treated with phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, or both. The key exclusion criteria were hypersensitivity or contraindication to study treatments, significant liver or renal disease, history of active substance or alcohol abuse within the last year, pregnant or lactating women, presence of any life-threatening condition or of any disease that is likely to significantly shorten life expectancy. In the CYTO-PV study, the interventions were: n=182 low-hematocrit targeted therapy (more aggressive therapy for a hematocrit target of < 45%) n=183 high-hematocrit targeted therapy (less aggressive therapy for a hematocrit target of 45-50%). In the CYTO-PV study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events (2.7% vs. 9.8%; HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.69). In the CYTO-PV study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in total cardiovascular events (4.4% vs. 10.9%; HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.84). In the CYTO-PV study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in rate of adverse events. In the CYTO-PV study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera who were being treated with phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, or both, low-hematocrit targeted therapy was superior to high-hematocrit targeted therapy with respect to death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events.

### Revised response criteria for polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: an ELN and IWG-MRT consensus project [^b6f6167e]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

Standardized response criteria to interpret and compare clinical trials are needed for approval of new therapeutic agents by regulatory agencies. The European LeukemiaNet (ELN) response criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) issued in 2009 have been widely adopted as end points in a number of recent clinical trials. However, evidence exists that they do not predict response or provide clinically relevant measures of benefit for the patients. This article presents revised recommendations for assessing response in ET and PV provided by a working group established by ELN and International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment. New definitions of complete and partial remission incorporate clinical, hematological, and histological response assessments that include a standardized symptom assessment form and consider absence of disease progression and vascular events. We anticipate that these criteria will be adopted widely to facilitate the development of new and more effective therapies for ET and PV.

### Rusfertide cuts number of needed blood draws to treat (...) [^57dc1b3b]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

Rusfertide Nearly Eliminates Need for Phlebotomies to Treat Polycythemia Vera, by Shana Spindler For people with polycythemia vera, treatment with the drug rusfertide appears to substantially reduce their reliance on blood draws to avoid serious health problems. That’s according to results of the first-ever clinical trial to test a drug like rusfertide—which blocks the production of iron-rich blood cells—in people with this chronic blood cancer. In people with polycythemia vera, the bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. This overproduction of cells thickens the blood and, if left untreated, increases the risk for blood clots, heart attack, and stroke. For decades, the main treatment for polycythemia vera has been regular blood draws, or phlebotomy, to remove excess red blood cells. But this rudimentary treatment has downsides, including debilitating fatigue and brain fog.

The need to make regular trips to a doctor’s office for the procedure is also time consuming and affects people’s quality of life. The trial, called REVIVE, included 70 people with polycythemia vera who required frequent phlebotomies to keep their red blood cell numbers low. Adding rusfertide to their ongoing treatment of phlebotomy had a major impact, Dr. Kremyanskaya said. For most participants who received rusfertide, “ need for phlebotomy was significantly reduced or eliminated, ” she said, dropping from an average of nine phlebotomies per year before the trial to less than one phlebotomy per year after starting rusfertide. Treatment options for polycythemia vera The percentage of blood volume that is composed of red blood cells is known as the hematocrit. For those living with polycythemia vera, the goal of treatment is to maintain a hematocrit below 45%.

People with polycythemia vera who are more likely to have problems like blood clots may receive additional treatments to reduce their red blood cell counts. But these treatments also have downsides, including low blood counts and infections. The bottom line, Dr. Kremyanskaya said, is that, beyond phlebotomy, “there are actually very few treatment options. ”.

### Where to turn for second-line cytoreduction after hydroxyurea in polycythemia vera? [^d26f5915]. The Oncologist (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The goals of therapy in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) are to improve disease-related symptoms, prevent the incidence or recurrence of thrombosis, and possibly delay or prevent the transformation into myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cytoreductive therapies have been used in older patients and those with a history of thrombosis to achieve these goals. Hydroxyurea (HU) remains the first-line cytoreductive choice; however, up to one in four patients treated with HU over time will develop resistance or intolerance to HU. More importantly, patients who fail HU have a 5.6-fold increase in mortality and a 6.8-fold increase risk of transformation to myelofibrosis or AML; therefore, alternative therapies are needed for these patients. Interferon-α has been used in PV and has shown significant activity in achieving hematologic responses and decreasing JAK2 V617F mutation allele burden. JAK inhibition has also been investigated and recently garnered regulatory approval for this indication. In this review, we will discuss the current treatment options that are available for patients after HU and the novel therapies that are currently under investigation.

Implications For Practice

The outcomes of PV patients who fail or who are intolerant of hydroxyurea are poor. Although pegylated interferon can be considered in younger patients, currently, ruxolitinib is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent in this setting, representing a viable option, leading to hematocrit control and a reduction in spleen size and constitutional symptoms. Although a small number of patients will achieve a molecular response with continuous treatment, the implications of such response on the clinical outcomes are still unknown. Patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with ruxolitinib, or who lose their response, can be treated with low-dose busulfan or pipobroman; however, they should be encouraged to participate in trials with novel therapies.

### Evidence and expertise in the management of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^49ecbb58]. Leukemia (2008). Low credibility.

Major causes of morbidity and mortality in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are represented by thrombosis and bleeding, progression to myelofibrosis and transformation to acute leukemia. Myelosuppressive therapy, preferentially with hydroxyurea, can reduce the rate of vascular complications, but there is some concern about an increased rate of leukemic transformation with this agent. Therefore, management of these disorders poses a significant challenge, and a risk-oriented therapeutic approach should be strictly followed to avoid inappropriate exposure to cytotoxic drugs on one side or suboptimal treatment on the other. Established risk factors for cardiovascular events are represented by older age and previous thrombosis, whereas impact of novel biological factors, including leukocytosis and JAK2V617F mutational status and/or mutational burden, is under active investigation. Low-risk PV patients should be managed only with phlebotomy and aspirin, whereas high-risk patients should also receive cytotoxic therapy. Regarding the management of ET, there is no clear indication for intervention in low-risk patients, whereas high-risk patients should be managed with chemotherapy. Other therapeutic options, such as interferon-alpha or anagrelide, may find place in selected patients including those who are resistant/intolerant to hydroxyurea. Finally, there is great expectation for novel drugs targeting the constitutively active JAK2/STAT pathway.

### Diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera: a review [^79425700]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Polycythemia vera (PV), a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an increased red blood cell mass and increased risk of thrombosis, affects approximately 65 000 people in the US, with an annual incidence of 0.5 to 4.0 cases per 100 000 persons.

Observations

Erythrocytosis (hemoglobin >16.5 mg/dL in men or >16.0 mg/dL in women) is a required diagnostic criterion, although thrombocytosis (53%) and leukocytosis (49%) are common. Patients may have pruritus (33%), erythromelalgia (5.3%), transient visual changes (14%), and splenomegaly (36%) with abdominal discomfort. More than 95% of patients have a JAK2 gene variant, which helps distinguish PV from secondary causes of erythrocytosis, such as tobacco smoking or sleep apnea. Among 7 cohorts (1545 individuals), the median survival from diagnosis was 14.1 to 27.6 years. Prior to or at the time of PV diagnosis, arterial thrombosis occurred in 16% of patients and 7% had venous thrombotic events, which could involve unusual sites, such as splanchnic veins. PV is also associated with an increased bleeding risk, especially in patients with acquired von Willebrand disease, which can occur with extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count, ≥1000×109/L). All patients with PV should receive therapeutic phlebotomy (goal hematocrit, <45%) and low-dose aspirin (if no contraindications). Patients who are at higher risk of thrombosis include those aged 60 years or older or with a prior thrombosis. These patients and those with persistent PV symptoms may benefit from cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea or interferon to lower thrombosis risk and decrease symptoms. Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor that can alleviate pruritus and decrease splenomegaly in patients who are intolerant of or resistant to hydroxyurea. About 12.7% of patients with PV develop myelofibrosis and 6.8% develop acute myeloid leukemia.

Conclusions and Relevance

PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by erythrocytosis and is almost universally associated with a JAK2 gene variant. PV is associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, hemorrhage, myelofibrosis, and acute myeloid leukemia. To decrease the risk of thrombosis, all patients with PV should be treated with aspirin and therapeutic phlebotomy to maintain a hematocrit of less than 45%. Cytoreductive therapies, such as hydroxyurea or interferon, are recommended for patients at high risk of thrombosis.

### Ruxolitinib versus best available therapy in patients with polycythemia vera: 80-week follow-up from the RESPONSE trial [^b2f8a5be]. Haematologica (2016). Low credibility.

RESPONSE is an open-label phase 3 study evaluating the Janus kinase 1/Janus kinase 2 inhibitor ruxolitinib versus best available therapy for efficacy/safety in hydroxyurea-resistant or intolerant patients with polycythemia vera. This preplanned analysis occurred when all patients completed the Week 80 visit or discontinued. Objectives included evaluating the durability of the primary response (Week 32 phlebotomy-independent hematocrit control plus ≥35% spleen volume reduction), its components, and that of complete hematologic remission; and long-term safety. Median exposure was 111 weeks; 91/110 (82.7%) patients randomized to ruxolitinib remained on treatment. No patients continued best available therapy (98/112 [87.5%] crossed over to ruxolitinib, most at/soon after Week 32). At Week 32, primary response was achieved by 22.7% vs. 0.9% of patients randomized to ruxolitinib and best available therapy, respectively (hematocrit control, 60.0% vs. 18.8%; spleen response, 40.0% vs. 0.9%). The probability of maintaining primary and hematocrit responses for ≥80 weeks was 92% and 89%, respectively; 43/44 spleen responses were maintained until Week 80. Complete hematologic remission at Week 32 was achieved in 23.6% of ruxolitinib-randomized patients; the probability of maintaining complete hematologic remission for ≥80 weeks was 69%. Among ruxolitinib crossover patients, 79.2% were not phlebotomized, and 18.8% achieved a ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume after 32 weeks of treatment. New or worsening hematologic laboratory abnormalities in ruxolitinib-treated patients were primarily grade 1/2 decreases in hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and platelets. The thromboembolic event rate per 100 patient-years was 1.8 with randomized ruxolitinib treatment vs. 8.2 with best available therapy. These data support ruxolitinib as an effective long-term treatment option for hydroxyurea-resistant or intolerant patients with polycythemia vera. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov identifier: 01243944.

### JAK2 V617F allele burden in polycythemia vera: burden of proof [^4a2fe775]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) neoplasm defined by activating somatic mutations in the JAK2 gene, characterized clinically by overproduction of red blood cells, platelets, and neutrophils. PV results in varying burdens of disease-specific symptoms, high rates of vascular events, and evolution to a myelofibrosis phase or acute leukemia. The pivotal discovery in 2005 that JAK2 V617F underlies nearly all PV transformed our understanding of the disease pathobiology and formed the basis for disease classification criteria and targeted therapeutics.Despite this, contemporary management of PV largely remains focused on normalization of peripheral blood cell counts with little regard to the clonal expansion of JAK2 mutant cells over time. Recent data from prospective clinical trials for PV have demonstrated the ability of some therapies to significantly decrease not only peripheral blood cell counts but also JAK2 V617F mutant allele burden. This review focuses on the role of JAK2 V617F clonal burden in PV outcomes, highlighting the prospective clinical trials where JAK2 V617F burden is measured.

### Polycythemia vera [^89f16fbc]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis of an elevated hematocrit and the criteria for the diagnosis of polycythemia vera present little or no problem; however, there is not a consensus on therapy. Spivak likened this to a conundrum--"an intricate and difficult problem." Nonetheless, it can be argued that on the basis of the following criteria--life expectancy, the absence of toxicity, and long remissions an average of 3.1 years or a median of 2 years--and with acute leukemia no more common than in other regimens except phlebotomy alone (a regimen that cannot be sustained), 32P should be the treatment of choice except in pregnant women. Others, but not all, share this view. This is in contrast to the statement, "Thus chemotherapy treatment of [polycythemia vera] patients is not as easy, innocuous, and well tolerated as it is generally believed". Patients treated with phlebotomy alone were subjected to an unacceptably high incidence of early thrombotic events. Unavailability of pipobroman eliminates this choice.

### A randomized phase 3 trial of interferon-α vs hydroxyurea in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^8aefb967]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The goal of therapy for patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) is to reduce thrombotic events by normalizing blood counts. Hydroxyurea (HU) and interferon-α (IFN-α) are the most frequently used cytoreductive options for patients with ET and PV at high risk for vascular complications. Myeloproliferative Disorders Research Consortium 112 was an investigator-initiated, phase 3 trial comparing HU to pegylated IFN-α (PEG) in treatment-naïve, high-risk patients with ET/PV. The primary endpoint was complete response (CR) rate at 12 months. A total of 168 patients were treated for a median of 81.0 weeks. CR for HU was 37% and 35% for PEG (P = .80) at 12 months. At 24 to 36 months, CR was 20% to 17% for HU and 29% to 33% for PEG. PEG led to a greater reduction in JAK2V617F at 24 months, but histopathologic responses were more frequent with HU. Thrombotic events and disease progression were infrequent in both arms, whereas grade 3/4 adverse events were more frequent with PEG (46% vs 28%). At 12 months of treatment, there was no significant difference in CR rates between HU and PEG. This study indicates that PEG and HU are both effective treatments for PV and ET. With longer treatment, PEG was more effective in normalizing blood counts and reducing driver mutation burden, whereas HU produced more histopathologic responses. Despite these differences, both agents did not differ in limiting thrombotic events and disease progression in high-risk patients with ET/PV. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01259856.

### Polycythemia vera [^8e6389cc]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The resultant hyperviscosity of the blood predisposes such patients to thrombosis. Polycythemia vera should be suspected in patients with elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, splenomegaly, or portal venous thrombosis. Secondary causes of increased red blood cell mass (e.g., heavy smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, renal disease) are more common than polycythemia vera and must be excluded. Diagnosis is made using criteria developed by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group; major criteria include elevated red blood cell mass, normal oxygen saturation, and palpable splenomegaly. Untreated patients may survive for six to 18 months, whereas adequate treatment may extend life expectancy to more than 10 years. Treatment includes phlebotomy with the possible addition of myelosuppressive agents based on a risk-stratified approach. Agents under investigation include interferon alfa-2b, anagrelide, and aspirin. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended.

### Ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus standard therapy for polycythaemia vera (PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV): a randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial and its extension study [^08faede6]. The Lancet: Haematology (2020). High credibility.

Background

The PROUD-PV and CONTINUATION-PV trials aimed to compare the novel monopegylated interferon ropeginterferon alfa-2b with hydroxyurea, the standard therapy for patients with polycythaemia vera, over 3 years of treatment.

Methods

PROUD-PV and its extension study, CONTINUATION-PV, were phase 3, randomised, controlled, open-label, trials done in 48 clinics in Europe. Patients were eligible if 18 years or older with early stage polycythaemia vera (no history of cytoreductive treatment or less than 3 years of previous hydroxyurea treatment) diagnosed by WHO's 2008 criteria. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to ropeginterferon alfa-2b (subcutaneously every 2 weeks, starting at 100 μg) or hydroxyurea (orally starting at 500 mg/day). After 1 year, patients could opt to enter the extension part of the trial, CONTINUATION-PV. The primary endpoint in PROUD-PV was non-inferiority of ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus hydroxyurea regarding complete haematological response with normal spleen size (longitudinal diameter of ≤12 cm for women and ≤13 cm for men) at 12 months; in CONTINUATION-PV, the coprimary endpoints were complete haematological response with normalisation of spleen size and with improved disease burden (ie, splenomegaly, microvascular disturbances, pruritus, and headache). We present the final results of PROUD-PV and an interim analysis at 36 months of the CONTINUATION-PV study (per statistical analysis plan). Analyses for safety and efficacy were per-protocol. The trials were registered on EudraCT, 2012-005259-18 (PROUD-PV) and 2014-001357-17 (CONTINUATION-PV, which is ongoing).

Findings

Patients were recruited from Sept 17, 2013 to March 13, 2015 with 306 enrolled. 257 patients were randomly assigned, 127 were treated in each group (three patients withdrew consent in the hydroxyurea group), and 171 rolled over to the CONTINUATION-PV trial. Median follow-up was 182·1 weeks (IQR 166·3-201·7) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b and 164·5 weeks (144·4-169·3) in the standard therapy group. In PROUD-PV, 26 (21%) of 122 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and 34 (28%) of 123 patients in the standard therapy group met the composite primary endpoint of complete haematological response with normal spleen size. In CONTINUATION-PV, complete haematological response with improved disease burden was met in 50 (53%) of 95 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus 28 (38%) of 74 patients in the hydroxyurea group, p=0·044 at 36 months. Complete haematological response without the spleen criterion in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group versus standard therapy group were: 53 (43%) of 123 patients versus 57 (46%) of 125 patients, p=0·63 at 12 months (PROUD-PV), and 67 (71%) of 95 patients versus 38 (51%) of 74 patients, p=0·012 at 36 months (CONTINUATION-PV). The most frequently reported grade 3 and grade 4 treatment-related adverse events were increased γ-glutamyltransferase (seven [6%] of 127 patients) and increased alanine aminotransferase (four [3%] of 127 patients) in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group, and leucopenia (six [5%] of 127 patients) and thrombocytopenia (five [4%] of 127 patients) in the standard therapy group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in three (2%) of 127 patients in the ropeginterferon alfa-2b group and five (4%) of 127 patients in the hydroxyurea group. One treatment-related death was reported in the standard therapy group (acute leukaemia).

Interpretation

In patients with early polycythaemia vera, who predominantly presented without splenomegaly, ropeginterferon alfa-2b was effective in inducing haematological responses; non-inferiority to hydroxyurea regarding haematological response and normal spleen size was not shown at 12 months. However, response to ropeginterferon alfa-2b continued to increase over time with improved responses compared with hydroxyurea at 36 months. Considering the high and durable haematological and molecular responses and its good tolerability, ropeginterferon alfa-2b offers a valuable and safe long-term treatment option with features distinct from hydroxyurea.

### Polycythaemia vera [^2b9e3f5a]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2025). High credibility.

Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a haematological malignancy in the myeloproliferative neoplasm family. PV is typically characterized by erythrocytosis and often leukocytosis and thrombocytosis 1 . Clinical features include reduced life expectancy due to hazards of thrombosis (often in atypical sites), haemorrhage and transformation to myelofibrosis and less frequently to a form of acute myeloid leukaemia called blast phase. Almost two decades ago, the JAK2 V617F mutation in exon 14 of JAK2 was described, and is known to be present in more than 95% of patients with PV. Testing for the JAK2 V617F mutation is used in the diagnosis of PV, and the quantity of the mutation (that is, the variant allele frequency) is linked to prognosis and the risk of complications. As such, reduction of JAK2 V617F variant allele frequency is currently being evaluated as a treatment target. Recommendations for PV treatment include control of vascular risk factors, therapeutic phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin in all patients. Currently, patients at higher risk of thrombosis (aged over 60 years and/or with a history of thrombosis) are offered cytoreductive agents. Hydroxyurea or interferons remain the preferred first-line cytoreductive agents, with the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, currently approved for the treatment of patients who are resistant to, or intolerant of, hydroxyurea. Future recommendations might be to treat the majority of patients with these agents as long-term benefits of treatment begin to emerge.

### Polycythemia vera: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^575b314b]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a JAK2-mutated myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal erythrocytosis; other features include leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, pruritus, constitutional symptoms, microcirculatory disturbances, and increased risk of thrombosis and progression into myelofibrosis (post-PV MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Diagnosis

A working diagnosis is considered in the presence of a JAK2 mutation associated with hemoglobin/hematocrit levels of >16.5g/dL/49% in men or 16g/dL/48% in women; morphologic confirmation by bone marrow examination is advised but not mandated.

Cytogenetics

Abnormal karyotype is seen in 15%-20% of patients with the most frequent sole abnormalities being +9 (5%), loss of chromosome Y (4%), +8 (3%), and 20q- (3%).

Mutations

Over 50% of patients harbor DNA sequence variants/mutations other than JAK2, with the most frequent being TET2 (18%) and ASXL1 (15%). Prognostically adverse mutations include SRSF2, IDH2, RUNX1, and U2AF1, with a combined incidence of 5%-10%.

Survival and Prognosis

Median survival is ⁓15years but exceeds 35years for patients aged ≤40years. Risk factors for survival include older age, leukocytosis, abnormal karyotype, and the presence of adverse mutations. Twenty-year risk for thrombosis, post-PV MF, or AML are ⁓26%, 16% and 4%, respectively.

Risk Factors For Thrombosis

Two risk categories are considered: high (age >60years or thrombosis history) and low (absence of both risk factors). Additional predictors for arterial thrombosis include cardiovascular risk factors and for venous thrombosis higher absolute neutrophil count and JAK2V617F allele burden.

Treatment

Current goal of therapy is to prevent thrombosis. Periodic phlebotomy, with a hematocrit target of <45%, combined with once- or twice-daily aspirin (81mg) therapy, absent contraindications, is the backbone of treatment in all patients, regardless of risk category. Cytoreductive therapy is reserved for high-risk disease with first-line drugs of choice being hydroxyurea and pegylated interferon-α and second-line busulfan and ruxolitinib. In addition, systemic anticoagulation is advised in patients with venous thrombosis history.

Additional Treatment Considerations

At the present time, we do not consider a drug-induced reduction in JAK2V617F allele burden, which is often incomplete and seen not only with peg-IFN but also with ruxolitinib and busulfan, as an indicator of disease-modifying activity, unless accompanied by cytogenetic and independently-verified morphologic remission. Accordingly, we do not use the specific parameter to influence treatment choices. The current review also includes specific treatment strategies in the context of pregnancy, splanchnic vein thrombosis, pruritus, perioperative care, and post-PV MF.

### Recommendations for best management of polycythemia vera in Italy: a Delphi consensus statement [^3ce4e9a5]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2025). Medium credibility.

A two-round Delphi panel study assessed consensus among Italian healthcare professionals on the management of polycythemia vera (PV). Six hematologists with expertise in PV developed an online questionnaire containing 39 statements covering PV diagnosis and prognosis, treatment, management of complications, patient referral between transfusionist and hematologist, and patient education/psychosocial support. An Expert Panel of 18 transfusionists/hematologists rated their level of agreement with each statement on a 5-point Likert scale. In round 1, all 18 panelists completed the questionnaire, achieving consensus on 28/39 statements (71.8%). In round 2, 16 panelists completed the questionnaire, reaching consensus on 32/38 statements (84.2%). Overall, 81.3% of the panelists agreed that PV diagnosis/prognosis relies on established classification systems. In cases of JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis and family history of erythrocytosis, additional mutational testing should be undertaken. Consensus was not achieved regarding the necessity of bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis. Almost all panelists (93.4%) agreed that a collaborative dialogue between transfusionists and hematologists is important.

### Ropeginterferon alfa-2b versus phlebotomy in low-risk patients with polycythaemia vera (low-PV study): a multicentre, randomised phase 2 trial [^d34a86a7]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Background

There is no evidence that phlebotomy alone is sufficient to steadily maintain haematocrit on target level in low-risk patients with polycythaemia vera. This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of ropeginterferon alfa-2b on top of the standard phlebotomy regimen with phlebotomy alone.

Methods

In 2017, we launched the Low-PV study, a multicentre, open-label, two-arm, parallel-group, investigator-initiated, phase 2 randomised trial with a group-sequential adaptive design. The study involved 21 haematological centres across Italy. Participants were recruited in a consecutive order. Participants enrolled in the study were patients, aged 18-60 years, with a diagnosis of polycythaemia vera according to 2008-16 WHO criteria. Eligible patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive either phlebotomy and low-dose aspirin (standard group) or ropeginterferon alfa-2b on top of the standard treatment (experimental group). Randomisation sequence was generated using five blocks of variable sizes proportional to elements of Pascal's triangle. Allocation was stratified by age and time from diagnosis. No masking was done. Patients randomly allocated to the standard group were treated with phlebotomy (300 mL for each phlebotomy to maintain the haematocrit values of lower than 45%) and low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily), if not contraindicated. Patients randomly allocated to the experimental group received ropeginterferon alfa-2b subcutaneously every 2 weeks in a fixed dose of 100 μg on top of the phlebotomy-only regimen. The primary endpoint was treatment response, defined as maintenance of the median haematocrit values of 45% or lower without progressive disease during a 12-month period. Analyses were done by intention-to-treat principle. The study was powered assuming a higher percentage of responders in the experimental group (75%) than in the standard group (50%). Here we report results from the second planned interim analysis when 50 patients had been recruited to each group. The trial is ongoing, and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03003325.

Findings

Between Feb 2, 2017, and March 13, 2020, 146 patients were screened, and 127 patients were randomly assigned to the standard group (n=63) or the experimental group (n=64). The median follow-up period was 12·1 months (IQR 12·0-12·6). For the second pre-planned interim analysis, a higher response rate in the experimental group was seen (42 [84%] of 50 patients) than in the standard group (30 [60%] of 50 patients; absolute difference 24%, 95% CI 7-41%, p=0·0075). The observed z value (2·6001) crossed the critical bound of efficacy (2·5262), and the stagewise adjusted p value early showed superiority of experimental treatment. Thus, the data safety monitoring board decided to stop patient accrual for overwhelming efficacy and to continue the follow-up, as per protocol, for 2 years. Under the safety profile, no statistically significant difference between groups in frequency of adverse events of grade 3 or higher was observed; the most frequently reported adverse events were neutropenia (four [8%] of 50 patients) in the experimental group and skin symptoms (two [4%] of 50 patients) in the standard group. No grade 4 or 5 adverse events occurred.

Interpretation

Supplementing phlebotomy with ropeginterferon alfa-2b seems to be safe and effective in steadily maintaining haematocrit values on target in low-risk patients with polycythaemia vera. Findings from the current study might have implications for changing the current management of low-risk patients with polycythaemia vera.

### Ruxolitinib for the treatment of inadequately controlled polycythaemia vera without splenomegaly (RESPONSE-2): a randomised, open-label, phase 3b study [^d00d8b68]. The Lancet: Oncology (2017). Medium credibility.

Background

In the pivotal RESPONSE study, ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2 inhibitor, was superior to best available therapy at controlling haematocrit and improving splenomegaly and symptoms in patients with polycythaemia vera with splenomegaly who were inadequately controlled with hydroxyurea. In this study, we assessed the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib in controlling disease in patients with polycythaemia vera without splenomegaly who need second-line therapy.

Methods

RESPONSE-2 is a randomised, open-label, phase 3b study assessing ruxolitinib versus best available therapy in patients with polycythaemia vera done in 48 hospitals or clinics across 12 countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) with polycythaemia vera, no palpable splenomegaly, and hydroxyurea resistance or intolerance were stratified by their hydroxyurea therapy status (resistance vs intolerance) and randomly assigned (1:1) by an interactive response technology provider using a validated system to receive either oral ruxolitinib 10 mg twice daily or investigator-selected best available therapy (hydroxyurea [at the maximum tolerated dose], interferon or pegylated interferon, pipobroman, anagrelide, approved immunomodulators, or no cytoreductive treatment). Investigators and patients were not masked to treatment assignment; however, the study sponsor was masked to treatment assignment until database lock. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving haematocrit control at week 28. Analyses were done according to an intention-to-treat principle, including data from all patients randomly assigned to treatment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02038036) and is ongoing but not recruiting patients.

Findings

Between March 25, 2014, and Feb 11, 2015, of 173 patients assessed for eligibility, 74 patients were randomly assigned to receive ruxolitinib and 75 to receive best available therapy. At randomisation, best available therapy included hydroxyurea (37 [49%] of 75 in the best available therapy group), interferon or pegylated interferon (ten [13%] of 75), pipobroman (five [7%] of 75), lenalidomide (one [1%] of 75), no treatment (21 [28%] of 75), and other (one [1%] of 75). Haematocrit control was achieved in 46 (62%) of 74 ruxolitinib-treated patients versus 14 (19%) of 75 patients who received best available therapy (odds ratio 7·28 [95% CI 3·43-15·45]; p<0·0001). The most frequent haematological adverse events of any grade were anaemia (ten [14%] of 74 in the ruxolitinib group vs two [3%] of 75 in the best available therapy group) and thrombocytopenia (two [3%] vs six [8%]). No cases of grade 3-4 anaemia or thrombocytopenia occurred with ruxolitinib; one patient (1%) reported grade 3-4 anaemia and three patients (4%) reported grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia in the group receiving best available therapy. Frequent grade 3-4 non-haematological adverse events were hypertension (five [7%] of 74 vs three [4%] of 75) and pruritus (0 of 74 vs two [3%] of 75). Serious adverse events occurring in more than 2% of patients in either group, irrespective of cause, included thrombocytopenia (none in the ruxolitinib group vs two [3%] of 75 in the best available therapy group) and angina pectoris (two [3%] of 74 in the ruxolitinib group vs none in the best available therapy group). Two deaths occurred, both in the best available therapy group.

Interpretation

RESPONSE-2 met its primary endpoint. The findings of this study indicate that ruxolitinib could be considered a standard of care for second-line therapy in this post-hydroxyurea patient population.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^577c4d04]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The previous BSH guideline for the management of erythrocytosis was published in 2005 (McMullin et al, 2005) and amended in 2007 (McMullin et al, 2007). Here, we re‐evaluate the literature formulate guidance on the management of specific situations encountered in polycythaemia vera (PV) and the management of the other types of secondary erythrocytosis. Recommendations for the diagnostic pathway of investigation of an erythrocytosis, risk stratification and management of PV are in the accompanying guideline (McMullin et al, 2018). We review evidence and outline guidance on management of acute thrombotic events and secondary prevention of thrombosis in PV. The unusual thrombotic events, splanchnic vein and cerebral vein thromboses are discussed and haemorrhage. The specific situations of surgery and pregnancy and guidance on management of pruritus are included. The evidence for the management of other causes of erythrocytosis, including idiopathic erythrocytosis, congenital erythrocytosis, hypoxic pulmonary disease and post‐transplant erythrocytosis, is reviewed and recommendations made.

### Impact of treatment for adolescent and young adults with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^711ff35e]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) belong to the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) category of the WHO classification. These disorders involve myeloid proliferation, presenting as thrombocytosis in ET, increased red cell mass in PV and varyingly mild leukocytosis, splenomegaly or general symptoms, and an elevated risk of arterial and venous thrombotic events. Additionally, there is a potential, albeit less common, progression to secondary myelofibrosis (sMF), acute leukemia (AL), and a reduction in life expectancy.

While ET and PV typically manifest in the sixth decade, approximately 20% of cases are diagnosed in individuals under 40, with limited available data on adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients. Current recommendations and risk classifications for ET and PV, such as ELN and IPSET-T, are primarily based on data from older patients. The primary objective in managing these conditions is thrombotic risk reduction, achieved through pharmacological cytoreduction. Hydroxycarbamide (HU), interferon (IFN), and anagrelide (ANA) are commonly employed as first-line treatments, with IFN uniquely demonstrating long-term disease modification potential, including allele burden reduction and the possibility of treatment discontinuation.

Our study aimed to explore long-term complications, evaluating the impact of treatment on thrombotic risk and sMF progression. This becomes particularly pertinent given the extended life expectancy of these patients spanning several decades.

Results

Literature search and study characteristics

The study selection process is detailed in Figure 1. The search on Medline and EMBASE retrieved a total 420 results; nine additional results were retrieved from different sources (, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry, references from relevant articles) for a total 429 results, which were reduced to 340 after removing duplicates. Abstract and full-text screening allowed for the exclusion of 291 articles, as they fell into the following categories: reviews, case reports, animal studies, patients aged <18 years or pregnant. Other studies were not considered as they had a total sample size < 20 patients, and/or they did not report incidence data or follow-up duration.

Figure 1. 
Study flowchart.

Consequently, a total 49 studies were selected for methodological evaluation. Thirty-three were excluded. Eleven had unclear reporting of data (e.g. it was impossible to distinguish data due to HU-treated patients from those due to other cytoreductive treatments, or PV from other myeloproliferative neoplasms). Seven did not meet the number of 20 HU-treated patients as required by our study protocol. Seven studies referred to cases diagnosed outside the time window (2008-2018) and not with WHO 2008-2016 criteria. In one, follow-up data were missing. One was specifically aimed at HU-resistant patients. In case of multiple studies from the same author(s), we inquired whether they referred to overlapping populations, by questioning authors when necessary, and excluded duplicates (6 studies) from review. The final selection comprised 14 full text articles and two conference abstracts to be included in the meta-analysis.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^d35369d9]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. Virtually all PV patients are iron deficient at presentation and/or during the course of their disease. The co-existence of iron deficiency and polycythemia presents a physiological disconnect. Hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism, is regulated by circulating iron levels, erythroblast secretion of erythroferrone, and inflammation. Both decreased circulating iron and increased erythroferrone levels, which occur as a consequence of erythroid hyperplasia in PV, are anticipated to suppress hepcidin and enable recovery from iron deficiency. Inflammation which accompanies PV is likely to counteract hepcidin suppression, but the relatively low serum ferritin levels observed suggest that inflammation is not a major contributor to the dysregulated iron metabolism. Furthermore, potential defects in iron absorption, aberrant hypoxia sensing and signaling, and frequency of bleeding to account for iron deficiency in PV patients have not been fully elucidated. Insufficiently suppressed hepcidin given the degree of iron deficiency in PV patients strongly suggests that disordered iron metabolism is an important component of the pathobiology of PV. Normalization of hematocrit levels using therapeutic phlebotomy is the most common approach for reducing the incidence of thrombotic complications, a therapy which exacerbates iron deficiency, contributing to a variety of non-hematological symptoms. The use of cytoreductive therapy in high-risk PV patients frequently works more effectively to reverse PV-associated symptoms in iron-deficient relative to iron-replete patients. Lastly, differences in iron-related parameters between PV patients and mice with JAK2 V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations suggest that specific regions in JAK2 may influence iron metabolism by nuanced changes of erythropoietin receptor signaling. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the clinical consequences of iron deficiency in PV, provide a framework for understanding the potential dysregulation of iron metabolism, and present a rationale for additional therapeutic options for iron-deficient PV patients.

### Ropeginterferon versus standard therapy for low-risk patients with polycythemia vera [^9805b0cb]. NEJM Evidence (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND: Whether phlebotomy alone can adequately maintain target hematocrit in patients with low-risk polycythemia vera (PV) remains elusive. METHODS: In a phase 2 open-label randomized trial, we compared ropeginterferon alfa-2b (ropeg; 100μg every 2 weeks) with phlebotomy only regarding maintenance of a median hematocrit level (≤45%) over 12 months in the absence of progressive disease (primary end point). In follow-up, crossover to the alternative treatment group was allowed if the primary end point was not met. RESULTS: In total, 127 patients were enrolled (ropeg: n=64; standard group: n=63). The primary end point was met in 81% and 51% in the ropeg and standard groups, respectively. Responders continued the assigned treatment until month 24 and maintained response in 83% and 59%, respectively (P=0.02). Ropeg responders less frequently experienced moderate/severe symptoms (33% vs. 67% in the standard group) and palpable splenomegaly (14% vs. 37%) and showed normalization of ferritin levels and blood counts. Nonresponders at 12 months crossed over to the standard (n=9) or ropeg (n=23) group; in patients switched to ropeg only, 7 of 23 met the response criteria in 12 months, and phlebotomy need was high (4.7 per patient per year). Discontinuation because of adverse events occurred in seven patients treated with ropeg. CONCLUSIONS: In this 24-month trial, ropeg was superior to phlebotomy alone in maintaining hematocrit on target. No dose-limiting side effects or toxicities were noted; 9.2% of patients on ropeg and no patients on standard treatment developed neutropenia.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2013 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^407d028b]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Polycythemia Vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) primarily characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively. Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis.

Diagnosis

Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation. When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation highly suggests the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of ET should include reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, prefibrotic myelofibrosis and RARS-T (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis). A JAK2 mutation is found in 50-70% of patients with ET, myelofibrosis or RARS-T and is capable of distinguishing reactive from clonal thrombocytosis.

Risk Stratification

Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age >60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Recent data considers JAK2V617F and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as additional risk factors for thrombosis. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count >1,000 × 10(9) /L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is <1%/1% in ET and <3%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In low risk patients, this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin in both PV and ET and phlebotomy (hematocrit target of <45%) in PV. In high risk patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally recommended, although not mandated in older patients without JAK2V617F or CV risk factors. Treatment with busulfan or interferon-α is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures. Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2019 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification and management [^e3ef1d46]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Disease Overview: Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms respectively characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis; other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombosis, bleeding, microcirculatory symptoms, pruritus, and risk of leukemic or fibrotic transformation. Diagnosis: Bone marrow morphology remains the cornerstone of diagnosis. In addition, the presence of JAK2 mutation is expected in PV while approximately 90% of patients with ET express mutually exclusive JAK2, CALR, or myeloproliferative leukemia mutations. In ET, it is most important to exclude the possibility of prefibrotic myelofibrosis. Survival: Median survivals are 14 years for PV and 20 years for ET; the corresponding values for younger patients are 24 and 33 years. Certain mutations (mostly spliceosome) and abnormal karyotype might compromise survival in PV and ET. Life-expectancy in ET is inferior to the control population. Driver mutations have not been shown to affect survival in ET. Risk of thrombosis is higher in JAK2-mutated ET. Leukemic transformation rates at 10 years are estimated at <1% for ET and 3% for PV. Thrombosis Risk: In PV, 2 risk categories are considered: high (age > 60 years or thrombosis history present) and low (absence of both risk factors); in ET, 4 risk categories are considered: very low (age ≤ 60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type), low (same as very low but JAK2 mutation present), intermediate (age > 60 years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type) and high (thrombosis history present or age > 60 years with JAK2 mutation). Risk-Adapted Therapy: The main goal of therapy in both PV and ET is to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. All patients with PV require phlebotomy to keep hematocrit below 45% and once- or twice-daily aspirin (81 mg), in the absence of contraindications. Very low-risk ET might not require therapy while aspirin therapy is advised for low-risk disease. Cytoreductive therapy is recommended for high-risk ET and PV but it is not mandatory for intermediate-risk ET. First-line drug of choice for cytoreductive therapy, in both ET and PV, is hydroxyurea and second-line drugs of choice are interferon-α and busulfan. We do not recommend treatment with ruxolutinib in PV, unless in the presence of severe and protracted pruritus or marked splenomegaly that is not responding to the aforementioned drugs.

### Polycythemia vera: new clinicopathologic perspectives [^3203dbe0]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease characterized by an erythroid dominant trilineage proliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells. Classified as a chronic myeloproliferative disease, PV represents a histopathologic spectrum of 2 recognized stages, the polycythemic and postpolycythemic phase. The clinical manifestations of hemorrhage, thrombosis, and increased red cell mass are directly related to primary bone marrow dysfunction. Prognosis is strongly associated with thrombosis risk and disease progression; thus, treatment is directed toward minimizing coagulopathic complications and preventing leukemic transformation. Recently, a specific point mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene was described in a majority of PV patients. The potential diagnostic and/or prognostic value of JAK2V617F is discussed.

Objective

To review important developments from the recent and historical literature. Modern diagnostic criteria and emerging molecular findings are emphasized.

Data Sources

A comprehensive review was performed of the relevant literature indexed in PubMed (National Library of Medicine) and referenced medical texts.

Conclusions

Modified clinical, histologic, and laboratory criteria have clarified the diagnosis of PV. Also, continuing studies on the recently discovered JAK2V617F gene mutation may significantly improve our understanding of PV pathogenesis and facilitate its medical management.

### Essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis: current management and the prospect of targeted therapy [^33a6178e]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

The recent discovery of JAK2 and/or MPL mutations in polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) has had a major impact on how we diagnose and treat these disorders. For instance, the presence of a JAK2 mutation is now considered conditio sine qua non for the diagnosis of PV and the World Health Organization classification system has recently revised its diagnostic criteria for PV, ET, and PMF to include JAK2 and MPL mutations as clonal markers. From the standpoint of treatment, JAK-STAT is now identified as a legitimate target pathway for drug development in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Herein, I will first outline my views regarding current management in ET, PV, and PMF and then discuss emerging data on preclinical and clinical activity of anti-JAK2 small molecule drugs. Am. J.

### Hemorrhage in patients with polycythemia vera receiving aspirin with an anticoagulant: a prospective, observational study [^bd2d5df8]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) usually involving a mutation of the Janus kinase 2 gene and characterized phenotypically by an increased risk of thrombosis and hemorrhage.Low-dose aspirin effectively reduces the rate of arterial and venous thrombosis and is recommended for primary thromboprophylaxis in patients diagnosed with PV. Despite the administration of antiplatelet and cytoreductive therapy, approximately 25% of patients with PV ultimately develop thrombotic complications.The optimal approach to the management of thrombosis in patients with MPN is undefined. Anticoagulation is recommended for the acute treatment of thrombosisbut is associated with a recurrent thrombosis incidence of 5-6 events per 100 patient-years, and major hemorrhage incidence of 1-3 events per 100 patient-years.Due to the high rates of recurrent thrombotic events, aspirin is often continued along with therapeutic anticoagulation, but the relative safety of combined anticoagulant-antiplatelet therapy is not established. We evaluated the rates of hemorrhage among patients with PV receiving anticoagulation with or without aspirin who were enrolled in a multicenter, prospective, observational study.

Our current diagnostic approach in polycythemia vera

PV is currently defined by an acquired increase in hemoglobin/hematocrit level above 16.5 gm/dL/49% in men and 16 g/dL/48% in women, in the context of a JAK2 mutation and characteristic bone marrow morphology. The 2016 WHO classification system for hematopoietic tumors recognizes the almost perfect association between PV and a JAK2 mutation, as well as the fact that JAK2 V617F is also detected in 50–70% of patients with either ET or PMF. The formal diagnostic table lists three major (Hb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dL/49% in men and 16 g/dL/48% in women or red cell mass >25% above mean normal predicted value; consistent bone marrow morphology; and presence of a JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutation) and one minor (subnormal serum erythropoietin (Epo) level) criteria; WHO-qualified diagnosis requires the presence of either all three major criteria or the first two major criteria plus the minor criterion. Our current approach to the diagnosis of PV is consistent with these fundamentals, with some modifications that accommodate clinical practice scenarios, which are further elaborated below (Fig. 1). In general, screening for other mutations through next-generation sequencing (NGS) or cytogenetic abnormalities is more useful in terms of prognostication (discussed below in the section of prognosis) rather than diagnosis.

JAK2 mutation screening

Virtually all patients with PV harbor either JAK2 V617F (exon 14; 97% sensitivity) or JAK2 exon 12 mutation (majority of JAK2 V617F-negative cases). Accordingly, the first step in approaching the diagnosis of PV should include JAK2 mutation screening, and we favor upfront targeting of both exons 14 and 12, in order to avoid undue delay in the diagnostic process; it should also be noted that peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are equally informative in detecting and quantifying JAK2 V617F. In order to address issues with inconclusive test results and also provide an additional layer of diagnostic comfort, we recommend concomitant measurement of serum Epo level, which is expected to be subnormal in more than 85% of patients with PV. JAK2 mutation screening might also be a more sensitive diagnostic tool, compared to bone marrow morphology, in patients presenting with “MPN-unclassifiable (MPN-U)” phenotype or splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), as discussed below.

### Impact of treatment for adolescent and young adults with essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera [^0147bf69]. Leukemia (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we focused on the largest well-defined cohort of individuals diagnosed with ET and PV before the age of 25. Our investigation focused on the risks of thrombosis, evolution to sMF, and the impact of treatment modalities.

Surprisingly, our findings revealed a significant thrombotic risk despite young age, with a rate of 1.9 per 100 patient-years, irrespective of the MPN subtype. This rate is comparable to those reported in contemporary cohorts of older patients with more comorbidities, although the time to the first thrombotic event appears to be longer in our cohort (median time of 4 years for ET and 3 years for PV) compared to adult cohorts (median time of 0.9 years for ET and 0.3 years for PV). Nevertheless, given that the incidence of thrombotic events appears to be as frequent in AYA patients as in older individuals, it remains a significant concern. These patients are expected to live for several decades, and the accumulation of additional thrombotic risk factors (age, cardiovascular conditions, additional mutations) may progressively heighten this risk. This highlights a substantial and emerging concern regarding thrombotic events in this younger demographic.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is currently classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system under the major category of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Although the WHO MPN category includes seven subcategories, the term “MPN” usually refers to the three JAK2 mutation-enriched clinicopathologic entities: PV, essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). PV and its sister diseases constitute stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation that is characterized by three mutually-exclusive “driver” mutations: JAK2, CALR, and MPL, with respective distribution frequency of ~99, 0, and 0% for PV, 55, 22, and 3% for ET and 65, 20 and 7% for PMF. The most frequent MPN-associated JAK2 mutation is the exon 14 JAK2 V617F, which is responsible for almost all the JAK2 mutations in ET and PMF, and 97% of those seen in PV; the remainder 3% of JAK2 mutations in PV are spread across exons 12, 13, and 14,.

Diagnosis of PV often requires the presence of a JAK2 mutation, in addition to documentation of increased hemoglobin/hematocrit, to a threshold level established by the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) revised criteria (>16.5 g/dL/49% for males and >16 g/dL/48% for females). In addition, bone marrow morphologic assessment is encouraged, in order to distinguish PV from JAK2 -mutated ET - and obtain cytogenetic information, which has recently been shown to be prognostically relevant –. Clinical features in PV include mild-to-moderate degree of splenomegaly, mild-to-moderate degree of constitutional symptoms, including fatigue and pruritus, symptoms of hyperviscosity, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, microvascular symptoms (e.g. headaches, lightheadedness, visual disturbances, atypical chest pain, erythromelalgia, paresthesia), thrombotic and bleeding complications, and risk of leukemic transformation or fibrotic progression.

### Characteristics and outcomes of patients with essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera diagnosed before 20 years of age: a systematic review [^97796906]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) are the most prevalent myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). However, the median age at diagnosis of both conditions is over 60 years. Patients with these diseases are particularly exposed to risks of thromboembolic events and evolution into more aggressive disorders (myelofibrosis, myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia), with a consequent heavy burden of morbidity and mortality.

Current clinical guidelines concerning the diagnosis and management of ET and PV are generally written for older patients and emphasize that testing for a driver mutation and a bone marrow biopsy are fundamental to diagnose an MPN and that treatment should be adapted according to a classification into low risk or high risk based on the patients’ age and history of thrombosis or hemorrhage (prescription of aspirin and cytoreductive drugs) in order to reduce the occurrence of thrombosis. –

Details of some large cohorts of young patients with MPN, defined sometimes as below 60 and at other times as below 40 years old, have already been published. – Notwithstanding these publications, there are only sparse data concerning very young patients with MPN (aged below 20 years at diagnosis), particularly regarding details such as initial characteristics (reason for consultation, clinical features, bone marrow biopsy features) and outcomes (thrombosis, pregnancy, disease evolution, incidence of second cancer and survival). Furthermore, the utilization of therapeutic modalities in this population is largely unknown. For example, the proportions of very young patients treated with antiplatelet and/or cytoreductive therapies and the therapeutic goals are very poorly defined and, furthermore, there is no information about the potential, long-term sequelae of the treatments.

Here we present a review of published cases of ET and PV patients below the age of 20 years at the time of diagnosis. The earliest data collection point we chose was 2005, coincident with important discoveries concerning the molecular pathogenesis of these conditions, so that we would have more information about the mutational status of the patients and to improve the likelihood of ruling out reactive conditions confounding the diagnosis. – We describe the biological and clinical characteristics at the time of diagnosis and the incidence of vascular and long-term complications during the follow-up.

### Indications and use of therapeutic phlebotomy in polycythemia vera: which role for erythrocytapheresis? [^d0626b0a]. Leukemia (2019). Medium credibility.

ECP is about 3.5-fold more expensive than phlebotomy, either due to the higher cost of devices or because of the indirect costs due to the longer time employed by specialized personnel ; the difference in the total costs is only partially mitigated by the longer interval after ECP. However, among hemochromatosis patients, ECP results in less hours of absence from work and less costs of lost production, with an overall cost per procedure lower by one-third in comparison with phlebotomy.

Up to 25% of PV patients perceive phlebotomies as having a negative impact on quality of life (QOL) and productivity, and up to 8% of patients discontinue phlebotomies because they feel worse after treatment, or for the inconvenient frequency of visits ; in this regard, lowering the frequency of procedures, likewise maintaining a control of hematocrit and of symptoms, is an important clinical need.

A randomized trial in PV patients managed by RBC withdrawal could be appropriate, investigating the different effects of ECP and phlebotomy on target hematocrit, frequency of procedures, disease-associated symptoms, vascular complications, working activity, and QOL, as well as iron deprivation and its clinical consequences. The cost–efficacy analysis of ECP should consider all these outcomes.
