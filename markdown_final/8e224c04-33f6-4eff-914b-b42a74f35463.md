## Question

What causes auditory hallucinations

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes auditory hallucinations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and the fact that hallucinations are perceptions without external stimuli. Then, I should verify the transdiagnostic nature of auditory hallucinations across psychiatric, neurological, and nonclinical populations. Next, I will examine convergent neurobiological mechanisms, followed by cognitive and computational models. After that, I need to consider phenomenological subtypes and contextual drivers. Finally, I will integrate these into a multilevel causal framework and outline clinical implications for assessment and treatment, making sure I double-check where the evidence is strong versus speculative.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definition so I don't jump to conclusions: auditory hallucinations are perceptual experiences of voices or sounds in the absence of corresponding external stimuli, and they can occur in psychiatric disorders, neurological conditions, and even in people without a diagnosable illness, which underscores their transdiagnostic nature and the need to avoid equating them solely with psychosis [^111NERuV] [^1142WfTY] [^112h7Rzh].

> Hold on, I should verify the neurobiological convergence before overcommitting to any single pathway; convergent evidence implicates increased baseline activity in associative auditory cortex, dopaminergic dysregulation in associative striatum, and disrupted salience and fronto-temporal connectivity, with lesion network mapping identifying a common hallucination network anchored in cerebellar vermis, inferior cerebellum, and right superior temporal sulcus, while modality-specific projections explain why lesions produce auditory versus visual hallucinations [^114foNYE] [^112JjFv1] [^113yZNN6].

> Wait, let me verify the predictive coding angle because it ties phenomenology to computation; both clinical and nonclinical voice-hearers show evidence of overweighted prior expectations relative to sensory evidence, with nonclinical individuals often having precise priors and clinical psychosis showing degraded sensory precision, together producing the same perceptual inference error of "voice" when none is present, which aligns with enhanced top-down effects observed in population studies and experimental paradigms [^114MkY3C] [^1112XywQ] [^113RRfDT].

> I need to check the inner speech and self-monitoring mechanisms next; impaired corollary discharge and forward models that normally suppress auditory cortex during self-generated speech appear defective in hallucinators, leading to reduced N100 suppression and misattribution of inner speech to external sources, and meta-analytic work shows robust self-recognition deficits in schizophrenia with hallucinations, supporting a failure to tag self-generated mental events as internal [^113pzkDK] [^115AZvnY].

> But wait, what if memory and salience are the primary drivers in some cases; phenomenology reveals that a substantial subset report voices as replays of prior conversations, and Bayesian accounts propose that trauma-related memories can act as strong priors shaping voice content, with salience and default-mode network dysregulation amplifying internal representations into conscious "voices", especially when bottom-up input is weak or ambiguous [^112ZQr5f] [^115rd8Lr] [^114EQhvv].

> Let me consider excitation–inhibition imbalance as a mechanistic substrate; emerging evidence suggests heightened excitatory tone with deficient inhibitory control in temporal speech regions, plausibly lowering the threshold for spontaneous activations to be perceived as voices, and this dovetails with the observation that sensory deprivation and social deafferentation can precipitate hallucinations in vulnerable brains, analogous to Charles Bonnet–type phenomena in the auditory domain [^112vBKzC] [^112Q9EHo].

> I should double-check the phenomenological heterogeneity because mechanism likely varies by subtype; cluster analyses support distinct subtypes including memory-replay voices, repetitive/commentary voices, thought-like voices, and nonverbal sounds, and recent work argues that the core in schizophrenia may be a loss of first-person authority rather than a requirement for perceptual "loudness", which reframes AVH as a belief-in-perception due to disrupted agency rather than purely an auditory percept [^112ZQr5f] [^111WR2Wx].

> Next, I should review contextual and population-level drivers; AVH occur on a continuum from nonclinical to clinical, with about 5–8% of healthy individuals endorsing attenuated psychotic experiences, and incidence studies show hallucinations across modalities cluster and co-occur with delusional ideation, while sensory loss, sleep deprivation, social isolation, and trauma exposure increase risk, supporting multifactorial etiologies that interact with pre-existing vulnerabilities [^115TB9NL] [^114fywmd] [^112h7Rzh].

> Let me integrate this into a multilevel causal framework so I don't oversimplify; trait vulnerabilities such as genetic liability, neurodevelopmental anomalies, and neurotransmitter tone set the stage, state triggers like dopamine surges, sleep loss, or sensory deprivation precipitate episodes, cognitive processes including predictive coding, self-monitoring, and working memory manipulate the content and salience, and the experiential output is shaped by beliefs, trauma, and culture, yielding equifinal "voices" via multiple mechanistic pathways [^114foNYE] [^115ABUrw] [^112h7Rzh].

> I will now examine clinical implications, but hold on, I should verify that I'm not conflating correlation with causation; assessment should be transdiagnostic and include hearing testing, sleep and substance review, neurological screening, and trauma history, and treatment should target the driving mechanism when known — antipsychotics for dopamine-mediated psychosis, hearing rehabilitation for sensory-loss hallucinations, trauma-focused therapy for trauma-linked voices, and CBT-based approaches that modify beliefs and coping, with rTMS to left temporoparietal junction offering evidence-based relief for refractory AVH in schizophrenia [^112nWi3H] [^114q66Ky] [^111huDxo] [^111HbEAk].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied dopamine is necessary for all AVH; I should correct that because nonclinical voice-hearers often lack striatal dopaminergic abnormalities, so while dopamine dysregulation is salient in psychosis-spectrum AVH, other pathways such as E/I imbalance, memory intrusions, or predictive coding shifts can suffice in different populations, reinforcing the need to match intervention to the causal layer active in each person [^113DEizf] [^112vBKzC] [^114foNYE].

> In summary, I need to ensure the message is precise: auditory hallucinations arise when multiple converging mechanisms — aberrant auditory cortex activity, dopaminergic dysregulation, disrupted salience and fronto-temporal connectivity, impaired self-monitoring of inner speech, and overweighted prior expectations — interact with individual vulnerabilities and environmental contexts to produce perceptions of voices without external stimuli, and this mechanistic pluralism explains their transdiagnostic occurrence and guides tailored, mechanism-informed care [^114foNYE] [^112JjFv1] [^113pzkDK] [^1112XywQ].

Auditory hallucinations arise from **multifactorial mechanisms** spanning neurobiological, cognitive, and environmental domains [^114foNYE]. Key drivers include **dopamine dysregulation** in mesolimbic pathways [^114foNYE], abnormal activity in auditory and language cortices [^117QEW2E], and disrupted self-monitoring that misattributes inner speech to external sources [^113pzkDK] [^115AZvnY]. Trauma, sensory deprivation, sleep disturbance, and substance use further increase risk [^113mzApL] [^114q66Ky] [^115XLvjo] [^113MvKKV], while genetic and neurodevelopmental factors contribute to vulnerability [^113CkGPs]. No single cause explains all cases; instead, hallucinations reflect the interaction of these factors across psychiatric, neurological, and nonclinical contexts [^11155cyv] [^1142WfTY].

---

## Neurobiological mechanisms

### Neurotransmitter dysregulation

Dopamine dysregulation reflects increased mesolimbic dopamine — especially in associative striatum — that enhances salience of internal representations, promoting hallucinations [^114foNYE]. Glutamatergic and GABAergic imbalances also contribute via excitation–inhibition dysregulation in auditory cortex [^112vBKzC].

---

### Structural and functional brain abnormalities

Auditory cortex hyperactivation involves elevated baseline activity in associative auditory cortex during hallucinations [^114foNYE]. Disrupted connectivity across frontal, temporal, and parietal regions impairs self-monitoring and source attribution [^notfound]. Modality-specific structural abnormalities include reduced gray matter in superior temporal and frontal language areas in schizophrenia with auditory hallucinations [^117RV5Bz].

---

### Neural networks and circuits

Default mode network (DMN) dysregulation reflects abnormal DMN coupling with auditory and salience networks, facilitating internally generated perceptions [^114EQhvv]. Thalamocortical dysconnectivity disrupts sensory gating, allowing internal signals to be perceived as external [^1174gMmz].

---

## Cognitive mechanisms

### Inner speech and self-monitoring deficits

Inner speech misattribution occurs when impaired self-monitoring mislabels inner speech as external voices [^113pzkDK]. Corollary discharge failure reduces suppression of auditory cortex during self-generated speech, increasing misattribution risk [^113pzkDK].

---

### Source monitoring errors

Impaired reality monitoring leads to difficulty distinguishing internal from external events, promoting hallucinations [^115AZvnY].

---

## Psychological and environmental factors

### Trauma and stress

Trauma-related hallucinations are linked to adverse life events, with trauma-related memories shaping voice content and increasing distress [^113mzApL].

---

### Sensory deprivation and sleep disturbance

Sensory deprivation from hearing loss increases auditory hallucination risk, consistent with deafferentation models [^114q66Ky]. Sleep disturbance, including deprivation and irregular sleep, also precipitates hallucinations [^115XLvjo].

---

### Substance use and withdrawal

Substance-induced hallucinations occur with intoxication or withdrawal (e.g. alcohol, stimulants, cannabis), often resolving with abstinence [^112h7Rzh].

---

## Genetic and neurodevelopmental factors

Genetic predisposition is suggested by familial aggregation and candidate genes (e.g. dysbindin) associated with hallucinations [^113cZBoD]. Neurodevelopmental abnormalities, including early brain injury and developmental deviations, increase vulnerability [^117K1VE1].

### Do we need multiple models of auditory verbal hallucinations? Examining the phenomenological fit of cognitive and neurological models [^111r6yur]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

The causes of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are still unclear. The evidence for 2 prominent cognitive models of AVHs, one based on inner speech, the other on intrusions from memory, is briefly reviewed. The fit of these models, as well as neurological models, to the phenomenology of AVHs is then critically examined. It is argued that only a minority of AVHs, such as those with content clearly relating to verbalizations experienced surrounding previous trauma, are consistent with cognitive AVHs-as-memories models. Similarly, it is argued that current neurological models are only phenomenologically consistent with a limited subset of AVHs. In contrast, the phenomenology of the majority of AVHs, which involve voices attempting to regulate the ongoing actions of the voice hearer, are argued to be more consistent with inner speech-based models. It is concluded that subcategorizations of AVHs may be necessary, with each underpinned by different neurocognitive mechanisms. The need to study what is termed the dynamic developmental progression of AVHs is also highlighted. Future empirical research is suggested in this area.

### A new phenomenological survey of auditory hallucinations: evidence for subtypes and implications for theory and practice [^112ZQr5f]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

A comprehensive understanding of the phenomenology of auditory hallucinations (AHs) is essential for developing accurate models of their causes. Yet, only 1 detailed study of the phenomenology of AHs with a sample size of N ≥ 100 has been published. The potential for overreliance on these findings, coupled with a lack of phenomenological research into many aspects of AHs relevant to contemporary neurocognitive models and the proposed (but largely untested) existence of AH subtypes, necessitates further research in this area. We undertook the most comprehensive phenomenological study of AHs to date in a psychiatric population (N = 199; 81% people diagnosed with schizophrenia), using a structured interview schedule. Previous phenomenological findings were only partially replicated. New findings included that 39% of participants reported that their voices seemed in some way to be replays of memories of previous conversations they had experienced; 45% reported that the general theme or content of what the voices said was always the same; and 55% said new voices had the same content/theme as previous voices. Cluster analysis, by variable, suggested the existence of 4 AH subtypes. We propose that there are likely to be different neurocognitive processes underpinning these experiences, necessitating revised AH models.

### How can the brain's resting state activity generate hallucinations? A' resting state hypothesis' of auditory verbal hallucinations [^114EQhvv]. Schizophrenia Research (2011). Low credibility.

While several hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) have been suggested, the exact role of the recently highlighted intrinsic resting state activity of the brain remains unclear. Based on recent findings, we therefore developed what we call the 'resting state hypotheses' of AVH. Our hypothesis suggest that AVH may be traced back to abnormally elevated resting state activity in auditory cortex itself, abnormal modulation of the auditory cortex by anterior cortical midline regions as part of the default-mode network, and neural confusion between auditory cortical resting state changes and stimulus-induced activity. We discuss evidence in favour of our 'resting state hypothesis' and show its correspondence with phenomenological accounts.

### The cognitive neuropsychology of auditory hallucinations: a parallel auditory pathways framework [^117A7V2x]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations are generally defined as false perceptions. Recent developments in auditory neuroscience have rapidly increased our understanding of normal auditory perception revealing (partially) separate pathways for the identification ("what") and localization ("where") of auditory objects. The current review offers a reexamination of the nature of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia using this object-based framework. First, the structural and functional organization of auditory what and where pathways is briefly described. Then, using recent functional neuroimaging data from healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, key phenomenological features of hallucinations are linked to abnormal processing both within and between these pathways. Finally, current cognitive explanations of hallucinations, based on intrusive cognitions and impaired source memory, are briefly outlined and set within this framework to provide an integrated cognitive neuropsychological model of auditory hallucinations.

### Auditory hallucinations in those populations that do not suffer from schizophrenia [^1142WfTY]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

The following article discusses the phenomenon of auditory hallucinations in those who do not suffer from schizophrenia. Research has shown the occurrence of auditory hallucinations in the general population to such an extent that they cannot be said to be pathognomonic of psychiatric illness. In addition, it has long been known that certain hallucinatory experiences occur in health, such as hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations. However, there are fundamental differences in the characteristics of these experiences. In the psychiatric population, these tend to be frequent, intrusive, and distressing. In contrast, in the nonclinical population, these are often predominantly positive and nonthreatening. The exact mechanism for the occurrence of auditory hallucinations is not yet known, but it is hoped that through the study of those in health, the mechanisms that underpin pathophysiologic processes in clinical conditions also can be elucidated.

### Auditory verbal hallucinations in persons with and without a need for care [^116GaW1G]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence Against a Single Continuum

Factors of individual difference, general psychological distress, and psychosis pronenesscould either determine where a person lies on a continuum of AVH or reflect different interacting continua (which give rise to an apparent single continuum). There is emerging evidence that a latent categorical structure of the population underlies the observed continuum of psychosis experience, with 1 group who are liable to psychosis and another group who are not. In the former, AVH are associated with other cognitive and emotional difficulties and a greater likelihood of need for care, while in the second group, AVH have reduced morbidity and possibly different etiology. This could partly explain why 2 people with the same level of AVH may differ in their clinical outcome. So, although AVH and other psychotic experiences seem to be continuous and distributed across the general population, the risk for developing psychosis might actually be discontinuous rather than truly continuous in the population. Further research is needed to understand these different continua and any underlying factors that could potentially serve as biomarkers.

### Auditory hallucinations, not necessarily a hallmark of psychotic disorder [^116KfgP4]. Psychological Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations (AH) are often considered a sign of a psychotic disorder. This is promoted by the DSM-5 category of Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum And Other Psychotic Disorder (OSSSOPD), the diagnostic criteria for which are fulfilled with the sole presence of persistent AH, in the absence of any other psychotic symptoms. And yet, persistent AH are not synonymous with having a psychotic disorder, and should therefore not be uncritically treated as such. Many people who seek treatment for persistent AH have no other psychotic symptoms, have preserved reality-testing capacities, and will never develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Instead, hallucinations may be the result of many different causes, including borderline personality disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), hearing loss, sleep disorders or brain lesions, and they may even occur outside the context of any demonstrable pathology. In such cases, the usage of the DSM-5 diagnosis of OSSSOPD would be incorrect, and it may prompt unwarranted treatment with antipsychotic medication. We therefore argue that a DSM-5 diagnosis of Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (or any other type of psychotic disorder) characterized by AH should require at least one more symptom listed under the A-criterion (i.e. delusions, disorganized speech, disorganized or catatonic behavior or negative symptoms). Adhering to these more stringent criteria may help to distinguish between individuals with persistent AH which are part of a psychotic disorder, for whom antipsychotic medication may be helpful, and individuals with AH in the absence of such a disorder who may benefit from other approaches (e.g. different pharmacological interventions, improving coping style, trauma-related therapy).

### Self-recognition deficits in schizophrenia patients with auditory hallucinations: a meta-analysis of the literature [^115AZvnY]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

Theories about auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia suggest that these experiences occur because patients fail to recognize thoughts and mental events as self-generated. Different theoretical models have been proposed about the cognitive mechanisms underlying auditory hallucinations. Regardless of the cognitive model being tested, however, experimental designs are almost identical in that they require a judgment regarding whether an action was self-originated or not. The aim of the current study was to integrate all available literature for a meta-analysis on this topic and reach conclusions about self-recognition performance in (1) patients with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls and (2) patients with auditory hallucinations compared with patients without these symptoms. A comprehensive literature review identified 23 studies that contrasted the performance of schizophrenia patients with healthy controls (1370 participants) and 9 studies that directly compared patients with and without auditory hallucinations (315 participants). We found significantly reduced self-recognition performance in schizophrenia patients, which was more pronounced in patients with auditory hallucinations compared with patients without. In patients with hallucinations, this pattern of performance was specific to self-recognition processes and not to the recognition of new external information. A striking finding was the homogeneity in results across studies regardless of the action modality, timing delay, and design used to measure self-recognition. In summary, this review of studies from the last 30 years substantiates the view that self-recognition is impaired in patients with schizophrenia and particularly those with auditory hallucinations. This suggests an association, perhaps a causal one, between such deficit and hallucinatory experiences in schizophrenia.

### Auditory verbal hallucinations in persons with and without a need for care [^117MFzqn]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Auditory hallucinatory phenomena occur on a spectrum ranging from auditory imagery and intrusive and vivid thoughts to fully developed hallucinations of hearing sounds and voices. Although traditionally associated with psychiatric and neurological diagnoses, hallucinations may also be present in healthy individuals without need for care. It has been observed that individuals with AVH vary widely in their need for care, and clinical status may change over a person's lifetime. Understanding the factors that are relevant in leading to or protecting from need for care can inform clinical interventions. This article brings together research findings on auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) in the general population and considers the clinical relevance of these experiences. We cover the different methodological approaches that have been adopted to elucidate the factors related to the process of "transition" to a need for care, including longitudinal epidemiological studies, as well as comparison of AVH present in persons with and without a need for care. In this review, we combine the various, often isolated, research streams on multiple aspects of AVH into a cross-disciplinary overview, which documents areas of emerging consensus as well as highlighting contentious and underresearched domains.

The article was initially prepared for the Second Meeting of the International Consortium on Hallucination Research (Durham, UK, September 2013). Beforehand, the authors created a list of topics considered important and/or neglected in the area of AVH in persons with and without a need for care. Then, the authors worked in small groups to expand on these areas, by analyzing the literature and drawing on their own expertise and research findings, in order to extract the key components in understanding the continuum of AVH experience and risk for clinical disorder.

### Are neuroanatomical abnormalities underlying hallucinations modality-specific? [^112Q9EHo]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite the problems in the existing literature, the current analysis makes significant contributions to both the clinical and scientific communities. To clinicians, this paper offers scientific validation of patients' hallucinatory experience. To patients, it offers a clear message: "The voices you hear are happening because of your neuroanatomy — it is not your fault". This counters the remaining arguments of adherents to the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s, who believed that schizophrenia and its symptoms were a choice and a reasonable response to an insane world.

To the scientific community, this paper confirms what some might have expected: Populations who principally experience visual hallucinations have structural deficits in visual areas (visual cortex); populations who principally experience auditory verbal hallucinations have deficits in speech-language areas (frontal-temporal lobes). In this regard, it is worth mentioning that modality-specific deafferentation can promote hyper-sensitivity in that modality. Hoffmanproposed the "social deafferentation" hypothesis of auditory verbal hallucinations. Analogous to visual hallucinations produced by visual deafferentation in Charles Bonnet syndrome, the social deafferentation hypothesis proposes that high levels of social isolation in individuals with vulnerability to schizophrenia produce spurious social meaning in the form of complex, emotionally compelling hallucinations representing other persons or agents. He notes that significant social withdrawal commonly occurs prior to the first onset of voices, and auditory verbal hallucinations were made worse by social isolation. There is a clear therapeutic message for patients and their families: Efforts could, and should, be made to decrease social isolation in people who suffer with auditory verbal hallucinations.

### A review of multimodal hallucinations: categorization, assessment, theoretical perspectives, and clinical recommendations [^113T7HjK]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical Implications

The clinical understanding of hallucinations has primarily focused on the auditory modality (exemplified by the fact that most interventions are predominantly for AHs), with limited considerations of other modalities or of MMHs.

Nevertheless, preliminary data indicate that MMHs are linked to higher levels of adverse mental health outcomes, being perceived as more distressing, frightening, and more veridical than unimodal hallucinations. For serial MMHs, related phenomena can make hallucinations appear to have the power to affect the person in different ways: for instance, tactile sensations or visions that are meaningfully connected to a disembodied voice can contribute to beliefs that a voice has power over the individual.

One should consider whether multimodal experiences are connected temporally (eg, "Do you usually see them when they are talking? Do you see them without hearing them?") because it would be of relevance in formulating how hallucinations impact on distress. In psychological interventions, clarifying the temporal sequencing of hallucinatory experiences in different modalities may inform how these episodes unfold over time. For instance, the beliefs that people hold about how different hallucinations are interconnected may be targets for cognitive therapy methods. Furthermore, assessing a person's response to the first hallucinatory episode, and their potential expectation for related experiences to occur, may indicate points of intervention via alternative coping strategies.

Finally, we need to evaluate if MMHs lead to poorer outcomes in treatment trials and research the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication for MMHs compared to unimodal ones. This is for 2 reasons: first, whilst antipsychotic medications have a broad effect on psychotic symptoms, and no drugs specifically target hallucinations, it is not known whether medication may differentially affect MMHs vs unimodal experiences within subjects. This is an area for further research. Second, given the role that antipsychotics have in the management of patients' potential distress caused by hallucinations (which is often what differentiates clinical from nonclinical cases), it is important to extend the investigation of such efficacy beyond unimodal experiences and to the distress experienced by those specifically with MMHs.

### Clinical practice guideline: tinnitus [^11587qMM]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope, exclusions, and target population — Patients with identifiable causative diagnoses of secondary tinnitus are excluded from this guideline, and clinicians should decide whether to apply these recommendations to patients with these conditions on an individualized basis; the guideline also excludes patients with pulsatile tinnitus, or tinnitus related to complex auditory hallucinations or hallucinations related to psychosis or epilepsy. The purpose of this guideline is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians managing patients with tinnitus, with the target audience being any clinician, including nonphysicians, and the target patient population limited to adults (18 years and older) with primary tinnitus that is persistent and bothersome. Regarding burden, in the United States the estimated prevalence of experiencing tinnitus at any time is 25.3% and experiencing frequent (almost always or at least once a day) tinnitus is 7.9%.

### Have we overlooked the significance of multinodal hallucinations in schizophrenia? [^115a23Sm]. Psychiatry Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Scant research attention has been devoted to the phenomenon of multimodal hallucinations, with majority of studies focusing on auditory hallucinations (AH) in psychosis. The current study aimed to explore the frequency and characteristics of these multisensory hallucinations in a primary AH cohort. It was concluded more than half of our sample reported comorbid hallucinations in one or more sensory modes. This conveys significant research and clinical implications, in terms of steps taken for adequate assessment and intervention.

### Are neuroanatomical abnormalities underlying hallucinations modality-specific? [^1142CQXh]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In this issue of EClinicalMedicine, Rollins and colleaguesreport that hallucinations in psychiatric and neurological patients have neuroanatomically distinct signatures. This conclusion followed a careful and systematic meta-analysis and review of the existing structural neuro-anatomical literature on hallucinations, across sensory modalities and diagnoses. We emphasize "existing" to underscore that fact that Rollins and colleagues are constrained by what has already appeared in the literature: By necessity, most of the papers in their analysis involve primarily auditory hallucinations in psychiatric patients (for example, schizophrenia), and mostly visual hallucinations in neurological patients (for example, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease). As the field becomes increasingly aware that voices are experienced by other diagnostic groups, more papers should be appearing soon that include neuro-structural correlates of hallucinations in these patients, as well. But, for now, the literature is limited.

Similarly, although non-clinical populations can also experience hallucinations, there is only one study of neuroanatomical correlates of hallucinations in healthy people, as Rollins et al. point out. This is an important growth area for the field: If the voices healthy young adults experience were the same as those experienced by neurological and psychiatric patients, we could study their neural basis without the confounds of aging, cognitive decline, and functional deterioration. To this point, Rollins et al. argue for more neuroimaging and cognitive research in non-clinical groups.

Rollins and colleagues required that studies included in their analysis compared patients who experienced hallucinations to patients who did not. Studies that compare patients who hear voices to healthy controls pose a tough interpretative problem: Are the effects reported due to the diagnosis or specifically to the presence of hallucinations? Rollins and colleagues' analysis allowed them to isolate the effects of hallucinations from the broader diagnosis. For example, in studies that simply report neuroanatomical differences between healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia who hallucinate, we cannot know if those differences were due to the tendency to hallucinate or to other features of the illness itself, including delusions, thought disorder, or cognitive deficits. Any neuroanatomical differences between them and healthy controls could be due to any, or all, of those features. Although this reduced the number of studies included in their meta-analysis, it was essential for firm conclusions to be drawn.

### From computation to the first-person: auditory-verbal hallucinations and delusions of thought interference in schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses [^115GbyXB]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses are highly complex and heterogeneous disorders that necessitate multiple lines of scientific inquiry and levels of explanation. In recent years, both computational and phenomenological approaches to the understanding of mental illness have received much interest, and significant progress has been made in both fields. However, there has been relatively little progress bridging investigations in these seemingly disparate fields. In this conceptual review and collaborative project from the 4th Meeting of the International Consortium on Hallucination Research, we aim to facilitate the beginning of such dialogue between fields and put forward the argument that computational psychiatry and phenomenology can in fact inform each other, rather than being viewed as isolated or even incompatible approaches. We begin with an overview of phenomenological observations on the interrelationships between auditory-verbal hallucinations (AVH) and delusional thoughts in general, before moving on to review several theoretical frameworks and empirical findings in the computational modeling of AVH. We then relate the computational models to the phenomenological accounts, with a special focus on AVH and delusions that involve the senses of agency and ownership of thought (delusions of thought interference). Finally, we offer some tentative directions for future research, emphasizing the importance of a mutual understanding between separate lines of inquiry.

### Auditory hallucinations, top-down processing and language perception: a general population study [^1112XywQ]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Studies investigating the underlying mechanisms of hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia suggest that an imbalance in top-down expectations v. bottom-up processing underlies these errors in perception. This study evaluates this hypothesis by testing if individuals drawn from the general population who have had auditory hallucinations (AH) have more misperceptions in auditory language perception than those who have never hallucinated.

Methods

We used an online survey to determine the presence of hallucinations. Participants filled out the Questionnaire for Psychotic Experiences and participated in an auditory verbal recognition task to assess both correct perceptions (hits) and misperceptions (false alarms). A hearing test was performed to screen for hearing problems.

Results

A total of 5115 individuals from the general Dutch population participated in this study. Participants who reported AH in the week preceding the test had a higher false alarm rate in their auditory perception compared with those without such (recent) experiences. The more recent the AH were experienced, the more mistakes participants made. While the presence of verbal AH (AVH) was predictive for false alarm rate in auditory language perception, the presence of non-verbal or visual hallucinations were not.

Conclusions

The presence of AVH predicted false alarm rate in auditory language perception, whereas the presence of non-verbal auditory or visual hallucinations was not, suggesting that enhanced top-down processing does not transfer across modalities. More false alarms were observed in participants who reported more recent AVHs. This is in line with models of enhanced influence of top-down expectations in persons who hallucinate.

### Musical hallucinations and their relation with epilepsy [^113KpoML]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Musical hallucinations are poorly understood phenomena. Their relation with epilepsy was first described over a century ago, but never systematically explored. We, therefore, reviewed the literature, and assessed all descriptions of musical hallucinations attributed to epileptic activity. Our search yielded 191 articles, which together describe 983 unique patients, with 24 detailed descriptions of musical hallucinations related to epilepsy. We also describe six of our own patients. Based on the phenomenological descriptions and neurophysiological data, we distinguish four subgroups of epilepsy-related musical hallucination, comprising auras/ictal, inter-ictal and post-ictal phenomena, and phenomena related to brain stimulation. The case descriptions suggest that musical hallucinations in epilepsy can be conceptualised as lying on a continuum with other auditory hallucinations, including verbal auditory hallucinations, and — notably — tinnitus. To account for the underlying mechanism we propose a Bayesian model involving top-down and bottom-up prediction errors within the auditory network that incorporates findings from EEG and MEG studies. An analysis of phenomenological characteristics, pharmacological triggers, and treatment effects suggests wider ramifications for understanding musical hallucinations. We, therefore, conclude that musical hallucinations in epilepsy open a window to understanding these phenomena in a variety of conditions.

### Meta-analytic evidence for the plurality of mechanisms in transdiagnostic structural MRI studies of hallucination status [^11155cyv]. EClinicalMedicine (2019). Medium credibility.

A significant issue in neuroimaging studies of hallucinations has been the lack of a clinical control group, thus confounding abnormalities specific to hallucination status with those of the broader phenotype. Equally challenging has been a tangled conceptual landscape, with numerous models proposed as cognitive or neurobiological accounts of auditory or visual hallucinations,(Fig. 1). Though an influential model of auditory hallucinations is the inner speech model, which proposes that AVHs arise from misattributing inner speech to a non-self source, alternative models posit the causal agent to be memory-related processes, spontaneous activation in auditory and related memory areas, inappropriate proximal salience, skewed balance of top-down/bottom-up control dynamics between secondary sensory cortices and frontal regions, or of inhibition/excitation at the physiological level, or the mismatch between processes comparing predictive representations of the external world to sensory evidence. While these models attempt to explain auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia and non-clinical populations, a separate array of models have been proposed for visual hallucinations in neurodegenerative disorders like PD and AD. Auditory and visual hallucination models overlap in alluding to deficits in reality monitoring, memory, salience, inhibition, and excitation. Additionally, hallucinations have been subcategorized by different neurocognitive mechanisms, or by differential contribution of a range of pharmacological systems. Obtaining differentiating evidence is difficult as these models are not mutually exclusive, each drawing upon a similar repertoire of constituents, making it non-trivial to derive corresponding predictions. However, specific morphological variation can differentiate patients who do and do not hallucinate, indicating that structural MRI can provide insights into why individuals hallucinate.

### An integrative framework for perceptual disturbances in psychosis [^114foNYE]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2019). High credibility.

Perceptual disturbances in psychosis, such as auditory verbal hallucinations, are associated with increased baseline activity in the associative auditory cortex and increased dopamine transmission in the associative striatum. Perceptual disturbances are also associated with perceptual biases that suggest increased reliance on prior expectations. We review theoretical models of perceptual inference and key supporting physiological evidence, as well as the anatomy of associative cortico-striatal loops that may be relevant to auditory perceptual inference. Integrating recent findings, we outline a working framework that bridges neurobiology and the phenomenology of perceptual disturbances via theoretical models of perceptual inference.

### Distinguishing neuroimaging features in patients presenting with visual hallucinations [^113WJZ9f]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Visual hallucinations are relatively uncommon presentations in medical and psychiatric clinics, where they are generally regarded as a marker of possible underlying "organic" brain disease. Thus, patients with visual hallucinations are often referred for imaging of the brain. This article presents a pragmatic approach for the radiologist reviewing such imaging. Because conditions that can present with visual hallucinations are legion, a familiarity with the features of the hallucinations themselves, which can serve as clues to the underlying cause, can be helpful in interpreting such cases. We consider the nature of visual hallucinations and the mechanisms underlying their formation. We then provide a framework to guide the search for their cause, first in terms of focal lesions along the visual pathway and then global conditions affecting > 1 region.

### Schizophrenia [^115TB9NL]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Diagnosis and differential diagnosis

Diagnosis is made clinically on the basis of history and by examination of the mental state; there are no diagnostic tests or biomarkers. Schizophrenia usually presents with psychosis and the main differential diagnoses, in DSM5, are affective psychoses (bipolar disorder with psychotic features and major depressive disorder with psychotic features), other, closely related, non-affective psychoses (schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder and psychotic disorder not otherwise specified), substance induced psychotic disorders (alcohol induced, other substance induced) and psychotic disorders due to a general medical condition. Differential diagnosis takes into account the duration of illness, the nature and pattern of associated substance abuse, the co-occurrence of depression or mania and the presence of somatic illness.

Schizophrenia, like the majority of psychiatric diagnoses, remains a syndromic concept. The use of operational criteria, such as those embodied in the Diagnostic or Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM), or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) of the World Health Organisationhas provided a reliable approach to making psychiatric diagnoses in the clinic. However, the assumption that the clinical syndromes defined in this way represent valid disease entities with distinct underlying aetiology and pathogenesis is increasingly seen as having impeded research. – Indeed psychiatric diagnoses have the unusual property of being simultaneously too broad and too narrow. Individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia vary greatly in predominant symptoms, response to treatment, course and outcome. However, attempts to resolve this heterogeneity into valid subtypes has repeatedly failed. On the other hand, many psychiatric diagnoses have symptoms in common (Box 1) and the boundaries between schizophrenia and other disorders are indistinct as are the boundaries between disorder and wellness. With regard to the latter there is an increasing realization that psychotic symptoms, such as auditory hallucinations and paranoid thinking, occur in attenuated form in 5–8% of the healthy population. This has led to suggestions that dimensional approaches to diagnosis and classification might replace or enhance current categorical approaches.

### Hallucinations in children and adolescents: an updated review and practical recommendations for clinicians [^114DjSRR]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Despite the often transient nature of hallucinations in children and adolescents, these experiences, even at a young age: (1) can cause severe distress and reduced functioning; (2) can occur across diagnostic boundaries; (3) often go together with comorbid psychopathology; and (4) may cause or coincide with increased risk of suicidality. This profile is somewhat contrary to the working group's proposition in 2014 to distinguish 2 types of hallucinations, those that occur in the presence of childhood psychosis and those that do not. Current insight suggests the application of a more general staging model, in which hallucinations can occur from a benign and transient phenomenon at one end to a symptom of severe psychopathology of several (interacting) domains at the other. Research since 2014 has not significantly advanced understandings of the etiology of hallucinations in youth, possibly attributable to: (1) the sparse amount of studies actually exploring the etiology and course of specifically hallucinations in youth (rather than UHR or psychosis' first-episode samples), (2) the lack of data-driven narrowing of definitions regarding hallucinations, and (3) given that hallucinations can be related to (the development of) different psychiatric disorders, findings regarding etiology may be expected to be closely aligned to actual (underlying) psychiatric comorbidity. As a consequence, hallucinations in both child and adult studies still represent a broad phenotype. Nevertheless, although hallucinations in youth are often transient and possibly a benign phenomenon, children and adolescents seeking help for hallucinations often suffer prolonged from their hallucinations and encounter difficulties in receiving the appropriate care. Since 2014, clinical care has improved with the recent knowledge and development of youth-specific questionnaires and intervention strategies. Finally, although the implementation of large hallucination detection programs in the general population is unnecessary, further knowledge is required on the extent and (early) identification of children and adolescents with hallucinations that might be in need for care.

### Hallucinations: a systematic review of points of similarity and difference across diagnostic classes [^112PbGoT]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

The present article attempts to meet this challenge through a systematic review of empirical studies that have made direct comparisons of hallucinations involving 2 or more population groups (one of which included schizophrenia). Our focus is on visual and auditory hallucinations, because these experiences figure more prominently in schizophrenia research than other modalities of hallucination. We place particular emphasis on whether hallucinations share points of commonality or divergence between different groups. Because diagnostic criteria inevitably focus on self-report rather than objective markers, the bulk of studies have reported on the phenomenological features of hallucinations. Too few studies have directly compared cognitive or neuroimaging variables between 2 and more groups for meaningful analyses, although helpful syntheses of the literature exist. In this article, we present a direct contrast of hallucination features across clinical groups with a view to identifying features specific to schizophrenia. First, we briefly consider the different conditions and groups in which hallucinations have been reported.

### Evidence for an interrelated cluster of hallucinatory experiences in the general population: an incidence study [^114fywmd]. Psychological Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Although hallucinations have been studied in terms of prevalence and its associations with psychopathology and functional impairment, very little is known about sensory modalities other than auditory (i.e. haptic, visual and olfactory), as well the incidence of hallucinations, factors predicting incidence and subsequent course.

Methods

We examined the incidence, course and risk factors of hallucinatory experiences across different modalities in two unique prospective general population cohorts in the same country using similar methodology and with three interview waves, one over the period 1996–1999 (NEMESIS) and one over the period 2007–2015 (NEMESIS-2).

Results

In NEMESIS-2, the yearly incidence of self-reported visual hallucinations was highest (0.33%), followed by haptic hallucinations (0.31%), auditory hallucinations (0.26%) and olfactory hallucinations (0.23%). Rates in NEMESIS-1 were similar (respectively: 0.35%, 0.26%, 0.23%, 0.22%). The incidence of clinician-confirmed hallucinations was approximately 60% of the self-reported rate. The persistence rate of incident hallucinations was around 20–30%, increasing to 40–50% for prevalent hallucinations. Incident hallucinations in one modality were very strongly associated with occurrence in another modality (median OR = 59) and all modalities were strongly associated with delusional ideation (median OR = 21). Modalities were approximately equally strongly associated with the presence of any mental disorder (median OR = 4), functioning, indicators of help-seeking and established environmental risk factors for psychotic disorder.

Conclusions

Hallucinations across different modalities are a clinically relevant feature of non-psychotic disorders and need to be studied in relation to each other and in relation to delusional ideation, as all appear to have a common underlying mechanism.

### Beyond trauma: a multiple pathways approach to auditory hallucinations in clinical and nonclinical populations [^112vBKzC]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

These mechanisms are also consistent with the observation that learning — or training — may alter voice-hearing experience, regardless of pathway. Voice-hearing embedded in an agreeable social world may become more manageable; distressing voice-hearing may improve in response to specific coaching; and voice-hearing in religious contexts, as discussed, may become more culturally appropriate over time.

With respect to the neurobiological mechanisms, we suggest that the classic dopaminergic hypothesis for schizophrenia and psychosis-like experience may not apply for the explanation of nonpsychosis hallucinations. Although presynaptic striatum dopaminergic hyperactivation is likely present in psychosis across diagnostic categories, and may be a factor behind trauma-related hallucinations, it may not be present in nonclinical voice-hearers in general. Therefore, it is possible that the trauma-related patterns (I and II) may differ from the non-trauma-related patterns (III and IV) in the degree to which they are dopaminergically mediated. The incidental murmuring and possibly other blurry speech experience most evident in patterns I and II may arise from a spontaneously hyperactivated cortex, whereas the clear voices in addition may represent intrusive memories that are not adequately suppressed by frontal regions of the brain. By contrast, some more incidental voice-hearing may be sleep relatedor perhaps also due to the deliberate spiritual practice with inner sensory imagery; hallucination events have been associated with practice in a range of traditions.

If dopamine is not involved in patterns III and IV, what other neurobiological process may be at play with the power to disrupt the balance between bottom-up and top-down processes and trauma-related memories? An excitation−inhibition (E/I) imbalance model at the neurochemistry level, following the suggestion by Jardri et al, proposes that excitatory transmitters, such as glutamate, cause spontaneous hyperactivation of temporal lobe speech areas, which are not inhibited due to hypoactivation of frontal lobe areas caused by aberrant function of inhibitory transmitters, particularly gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). An E/I imbalance model is indirectly supported by studies showing elevated glutamate levels in trait hallucinators, as well as studies in treatment-resistant patients having schizophrenia. It is possible that while nontrauma hallucinating individuals show abnormal glutamate levels, which could explain the spontaneous onset of a hallucinatory episode, individuals with a history of trauma in addition show abnormal GABA levels, which prevents them from cognitively inhibiting the voices once they occur, and which would let trauma-related memories flow freely.

### Hallucinations in the general population [^114BfTfZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2005). Low credibility.

Although hallucinations occur in a range of organic and psychiatric conditions, they are not invariably a sign of illness and also occur in "normal" individuals. Evidence indicates that psychotic hallucinations lie on a continuum with normal experiences, and many more people experience hallucinations than meet criteria for clinical psychosis. In addition to a symptomatic continuum between normal individuals and patients with psychosis, there is evidence that hallucinatory experiences in nonclinical and clinical samples may share the same underlying etiologic influences, including sociodemographic risk factors and neurocognitive mechanisms. Predictors of patient status include beliefs about hallucinations, negative mood, and perceived lack of control.

### Neurophysiological studies of auditory verbal hallucinations [^114XaNpJ]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2012). Low credibility.

We discuss 3 neurophysiological approaches to study auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH). First, we describe "state" (or symptom capture) studies where periods with and without hallucinations are compared "within" a patient. These studies take 2 forms: passive studies, where brain activity during these states is compared, and probe studies, where brain responses to sounds during these states are compared. EEG (electroencephalography) and MEG (magnetoencephalography) data point to frontal and temporal lobe activity, the latter resulting in competition with external sounds for auditory resources. Second, we discuss "trait" studies where EEG and MEG responses to sounds are recorded from patients who hallucinate and those who do not. They suggest a tendency to hallucinate is associated with competition for auditory processing resources. Third, we discuss studies addressing possible mechanisms of AVH, including spontaneous neural activity, abnormal self-monitoring, and dysfunctional interregional communication. While most studies show differences in EEG and MEG responses between patients and controls, far fewer show symptom relationships. We conclude that efforts to understand the pathophysiology of AVH using EEG and MEG have been hindered by poor anatomical resolution of the EEG and MEG measures, poor assessment of symptoms, poor understanding of the phenomenon, poor models of the phenomenon, decoupling of the symptoms from the neurophysiology due to medications and comorbidites, and the possibility that the schizophrenia diagnosis breeds truer than the symptoms it comprises. These problems are common to studies of other psychiatric symptoms and should be considered when attempting to understand the basic neural mechanisms responsible for them.

### Hallucinations: a systematic review of points of similarity and difference across diagnostic classes [^111gP9s6]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

The personal, cultural, and clinical significances of hallucinations have changed in the 200 years since they were defined by Esquirol as "the intimate conviction of actually perceiving a sensation for which there is no external object". There is a growing recognition that hallucinatory experiences attend a wide variety of psychiatric diagnoses and can be part of everyday experience for people who do not meet criteria for mental illness. For the experiencer, hallucinations can have important personal meanings, and for clinicians, they are also significant in varied ways, including as diagnostic symptom and as factors which may impact on functioning and prognosis, and therefore potentially the necessity of treatment.

Since the earliest clinical texts, auditory hallucinations have been closely linked to schizophrenia. Hallucinations constitute one of the 5 domains of abnormality of schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders in DSM-5. Although not diagnostic of schizophrenia when occurring in isolation, the presence of persistent auditory hallucinations is sufficient for a diagnosis of Other Specified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder, if it is combined with clinically significant distress or functional impairment (ref. p. 122).

The emphasis on the clinical significance of hallucinations in DSM-5requires closer examination given our growing understanding of hallucinations that feature outside of psychosis. It is increasingly recognized that hallucinations occur with significant frequency in other psychiatric (eg, post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD], personality disorders) and medical conditions (neurodegenerative conditions and eye disease) and that they are especially predictive of multimorbid psychopathology. A predominant view, however, is that some features of hallucinations may distinguish schizophrenia and related disorders from other conditions. Candidate distinguishing features that have become important diagnostically include negative and derogatory auditory hallucinations; command hallucinations; voices heard conversing about the individual in the third person; and location in external space.

Given the status of hallucinations as diagnostic markers in DSM-5, there is a pressing need to establish their specificity to psychotic disorders, particularly through comparison of their featural properties across different population groups. This exercise is also essential if we are to understand how hallucinations function in cognitive and neuroscientific models of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia.

### Reality of auditory verbal hallucinations [^117QEW2E]. Brain (2009). Low credibility.

Distortion of the sense of reality, actualized in delusions and hallucinations, is the key feature of psychosis but the underlying neuronal correlates remain largely unknown. We studied 11 highly functioning subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder while they rated the reality of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The subjective reality of AVH correlated strongly and specifically with the hallucination-related activation strength of the inferior frontal gyri (IFG), including the Broca's language region. Furthermore, how real the hallucination that subjects experienced was depended on the hallucination-related coupling between the IFG, the ventral striatum, the auditory cortex, the right posterior temporal lobe, and the cingulate cortex. Our findings suggest that the subjective reality of AVH is related to motor mechanisms of speech comprehension, with contributions from sensory and salience-detection-related brain regions as well as circuitries related to self-monitoring and the experience of agency.

### Hallucinations: a systematic review of points of similarity and difference across diagnostic classes [^115on94c]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Points of rarity for major diagnostic groups

We also examined points of rarity for each major group. A historical focus on the symptoms of psychosis has reinforced a "schizophrenia-centric" approach to hallucination descriptions, yet our analysis allows an examination of each disorder group individually. Specifically, table 1 enables an inspection of how hallucination features are shared among diagnostic groups, indicating possible points of rarity.

With regard to hallucinations in psychiatric disorders (particularly affective disorders, borderline personality disorder, dissociative identity disorder, and PTSD), table 1 suggests that no hallucination feature differentiated them from schizophrenia except age of onset (95% feature commonality). This supports findings of studies reporting on the overlap in genetic, neurobiological, and clinical features between schizophrenia and these psychiatric disorders.

Hallucinations caused by the abuse or withdrawal of substances (toxins, drugs, alcohol) differ from schizophrenia in the following features: visual hallucinations are more common than auditory hallucinations; the course is not recurrent but proximally related to substance ingestion; and hearing or vision loss is not a cause.

### Hallucinations in critically ill patients: understanding the unreal [^115XLvjo]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Hallucinations are perceptual experiences that occur in the absence of an external stimulus and can involve any of the five sensory modalities: visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile. Auditory and visual hallucinations are the most common forms encountered clinically. These phenomena may manifest as hearing voices, seeing images, or perceiving sensations that do not correspond with any external reality. Hallucinations are frequently associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, neurological disorders such as Parkinson disease, severe sleep deprivation, or substance intoxication and withdrawal. They may also occur in individuals with sensory impairments, such as hearing or vision loss, where the brain may generate internal stimuli in response to the sensory deficit. The content of hallucinations can vary significantly, from benign to distressing or threatening, and may cause substantial psychological distress to the patient. The pathophysiology underlying hallucinations is not fully understood but is believed to involve dysregulation of neurotransmitters, particularly dopamine, and abnormal activity in brain regions responsible for sensory processing. Common risk factors or hallucinations are presented in the Table 1.

Table 1
Risk factors for hallucinations

The ICU environment likely increases the risk of hallucinations due to multiple factors that disrupt normal cognitive function. Sleep deprivation is common in ICU patients, caused by frequent interruptions, noise, and continuous light exposure, which can precipitate delirium and hallucinations. Sensory overload from persistent alarms, machinery noise, and healthcare staff activity can overwhelm the sensory processing of patients, leading to perceptual distortions. Social and physical isolation in the ICU contributes to psychological stress and anxiety, further predisposing patients to hallucinations. Medications frequently administered in the ICU, including sedatives, analgesics, and anticholinergics, are known to have neuropsychiatric side effects, including hallucinations. Additionally, severe infections and metabolic disturbances, can impair cognitive function and contribute to delirium and associated hallucinations. The disorienting nature of the ICU — characterized by unfamiliar surroundings, lack of natural light, and frequent staff changes — further challenges patients' ability to distinguish between reality and hallucinations.

### Auditory verbal hallucinations in persons with and without a need for care [^114oJ3wD]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

What Methodological Issues Should be Addressed in Future Studies?

Studies of individuals with AVH without need for care often have varying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Including a diagnostic interview would be helpful, together with measures of other subclinical symptoms (eg, anxiety, depression, and delusional ideation), as their presence may have an impact on AVH (see). It would also be very helpful to learn more about the type, significance, and content of the voices experienced. More sensitive assessment tools (especially self-report) are needed to identify those with AVH who might be at risk of transitioning to a clinical disorder, and we recommended that studies follow up screening measures with detailed interviews. We need replications of findings in other samples of individuals with AVH without need for care because most of our knowledge about nonclinical, frequent AVH is based on the sample recruited by Iris Sommer's group. Combining longitudinal and cross-sectional methodologies may also be productive.

Overall, greater methodologial rigor is needed to advance our understanding of AVH in persons with and without a need for care. This involves using similar inclusion criteria and assessments of participants, and minimizing confounding variables, in order to improve the comparability of results across different studies. This action point will be taken forward by the Consortium.

### Symptom dimensions of the psychotic symptom rating scales in psychosis: a multisite study [^116sfinf]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

The Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales (PSYRATS) is an instrument designed to quantify the severity of delusions and hallucinations and is typically used in research studies and clinical settings focusing on people with psychosis and schizophrenia. It is comprised of the auditory hallucinations (AHS) and delusions subscales (DS), but these subscales do not necessarily reflect the psychological constructs causing intercorrelation between clusters of scale items. Identification of these constructs is important in some clinical and research contexts because item clustering may be caused by underlying etiological processes of interest. Previous attempts to identify these constructs have produced conflicting results. In this study, we compiled PSYRATS data from 12 sites in 7 countries, comprising 711 participants for AHS and 520 for DS. We compared previously proposed and novel models of underlying constructs using structural equation modeling. For the AHS, a novel 4-dimensional model provided the best fit, with latent variables labeled Distress (negative content, distress, and control), Frequency (frequency, duration, and disruption), Attribution (location and origin of voices), and Loudness (loudness item only). For the DS, a 2-dimensional solution was confirmed, with latent variables labeled Distress (amount/intensity) and Frequency (preoccupation, conviction, and disruption). The within-AHS and within-DS dimension intercorrelations were higher than those between subscales, with the exception of the AHS and DS Distress dimensions, which produced a correlation that approached the range of the within-scale correlations. Recommendations are provided for integrating these underlying constructs into research and clinical applications of the PSYRATS.

### Distinct processing of ambiguous speech in people with non-clinical auditory verbal hallucinations [^113RRfDT]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Auditory verbal hallucinations (hearing voices) are typically associated with psychosis, but a minority of the general population also experience them frequently and without distress. Such 'non-clinical' experiences offer a rare and unique opportunity to study hallucinations apart from confounding clinical factors, thus allowing for the identification of symptom-specific mechanisms. Recent theories propose that hallucinations result from an imbalance of prior expectation and sensory information, but whether such an imbalance also influences auditory-perceptual processes remains unknown. We examine for the first time the cortical processing of ambiguous speech in people without psychosis who regularly hear voices. Twelve non-clinical voice-hearers and 17 matched controls completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while passively listening to degraded speech ('sine-wave' speech), that was either potentially intelligible or unintelligible. Voice-hearers reported recognizing the presence of speech in the stimuli before controls, and before being explicitly informed of its intelligibility. Across both groups, intelligible sine-wave speech engaged a typical left-lateralized speech processing network. Notably, however, voice-hearers showed stronger intelligibility responses than controls in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and in the superior frontal gyrus. This suggests an enhanced involvement of attention and sensorimotor processes, selectively when speech was potentially intelligible. Altogether, these behavioural and neural findings indicate that people with hallucinatory experiences show distinct responses to meaningful auditory stimuli. A greater weighting towards prior knowledge and expectation might cause non-veridical auditory sensations in these individuals, but it might also spontaneously facilitate perceptual processing where such knowledge is required. This has implications for the understanding of hallucinations in clinical and non-clinical populations, and is consistent with current 'predictive processing' theories of psychosis.

### Do adverse life events at first onset of auditory verbal hallucinations influence subsequent voice characteristics? Results from an epidemiological study [^113mzApL]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

The onset of auditory hallucinations, as a symptom of a psychosis, has been linked to a number of risk factors, such as complications at birth, city birth, and adverse life events (see;). The focus of the present study was on adverse life events at first onset of auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). In a recent model of AVHs, describe the first onset of hallucinations to be triggered by a traumatic insult, in combination with emotional factors that could either increase severity and negative content of the AVHs or, in some cases, act as a buffer promoting less negative content. Indeed, negative content of AVHs has been identified as a factor that increases the risk of transition to a clinical condition and consequently need for care (e.g.;). Although traditionally associated with psychiatric and neurological diagnoses, AVHs can also be present in individuals in the general population without the need for professional health care, or without a psychiatric and/or neurological diagnosis. A recent epidemiological study conducted in the Norwegian general population reported a 7.3% lifetime prevalence of AVHs. In the present study, we used data from thestudy in order to compare individuals who had indicated a specific adverse life event at the first onset of their AVHs with individuals who had not indicated the presence of such events at the first onset of their AVHs, on a series of characteristics, such as voice severity, frequency, and emotional valence. We have called the first group the "adverse-trigger" group, and the second group the "no-adverse-trigger" group. Comparing these groups within a general population sample may yield clues about the etiology of AVHs and whether these groups represent different trajectories within a more general continuum ranging from non-clinical voices to clinical hallucinations (see). Moreover, studying individuals who experience AVHs in the general population allows for exploring the role of adverse life events at first onset of their AVHs albeit without the confounding factors related to the development of psychiatric diagnosis. Another advantage is that non-clinical individuals may provide us with a better understanding of the factors that are relevant in leading to, or protecting from, a diagnosis and consequent need for professional health care. Such protective factors have been identified previously (e.g. in studies comparing individuals with and without the need for care) and include intact cognitive functioning, adaptive coping strategies, and beliefs about voices (see).

### Hallucinations: a systematic review of points of similarity and difference across diagnostic classes [^114vXeED]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical applications

This review yields an important conclusion with regard to the diagnostic value of hallucinations. It concludes that it is inadvisable to give weight to the presence of any featural properties of hallucination alone when making a diagnosis. For example, negative and hostile voices talking in the third person and causing distress may equally be present in a patient with schizophrenia, epilepsy, brain tumor, or PTSD. However, this conclusion does not entail that hallucinations are clinically uninformative. First, clinical observation suggests that some conditions have their own distinctive hallucination signature providing clues regarding their underlying causes (eg, "cocaine bugs"). Second, the greater clinical significance of hallucinations may lie in their value in designating the severity of psychopathology. The presence of hallucinations indicates increased risk of poor outcomes transdiagnostically, including multimorbid nonpsychotic disorders, suicidality, neurocognitive deficits, and low functioning. Functional disability is also higher in those with hallucinations than those without hallucinations in the context of psychiatric disorders such as dissociative identity disorder, PTSD, anorexia nervosa, and narcolepsy. In such cases, hallucinations may point to a more severe form of the disorder. Alternatively, hallucinations may be an experience that restricts patients' recovery while not being intrinsic to that particular disorder, just as other factors such as educational level and social support will influence prognosis. Altogether, the value of hallucinations may be greater as an indicator of vulnerability or risk than as a diagnostic marker.

### On the non-significance of internal versus external auditory hallucinations [^114qi3Vu]. Schizophrenia Research (2004). Low credibility.

Traditionally, auditory hallucinations (AHs) heard outside the head have been regarded as more pathological than those heard inside, partly on the basis that internal AHs are conceptually closer to normal thinking than external AHs. Our data show that many patients hear AHs both internally and externally, and there were very few associations between location and demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients or with other characteristics of the AHs themselves. There was evidence that AHs heard internally were associated with better insight than those heard externally. Of those patients whose AHs included commands, greater proportions of those who heard them externally said they could resist than those who heard them internally or in both locations. There appears to be no consistent differential impact and effect of internal and external AHs, and there was no support for the historical view that internal AHs are more benign.

### Hearing a voice in the noise: auditory hallucinations and speech perception [^115UEsdC]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

It has recently been suggested that auditory hallucinations are the result of a criterion shift when deciding whether or not a meaningful signal has emerged. The approach proposes that a liberal criterion may result in increased false-positive identifications, without additional perceptual deficit. To test this hypothesis, we devised a speech discrimination task and used signal detection theory (SDT) to investigate the underlying cognitive mechanisms.

Method

Schizophrenia patients with and without auditory hallucinations and a healthy control group completed a speech discrimination task. They had to decide whether a particular spoken word was identical to a previously presented speech stimulus, embedded in noise. SDT was used on the accuracy data to calculate a measure of perceptual sensitivity (Az) and a measure of response bias (beta). Thresholds for the perception of simple tones were determined.

Results

Compared to healthy controls, perceptual thresholds were higher and perceptual sensitivity in the speech task was lower in both patient groups. However, hallucinating patients showed increased sensitivity to speech stimuli compared to non-hallucinating patients. In addition, we found some evidence of a positive response bias in hallucinating patients, indicating a tendency to readily accept that a certain stimulus had been presented.

Conclusions

Within the context of schizophrenia, patients with auditory hallucinations show enhanced sensitivity to speech stimuli, combined with a liberal criterion for deciding that a perceived event is an actual stimulus.

### Common mechanisms of auditory hallucinations-perfusion studies in epilepsy [^114HjBFS]. Psychiatry Research (2013). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations (AH) occur in various neurological and psychiatric disorders. In psychosis, increased neuronal activity in the primary auditory cortex (PAC) contributes to AH. We investigated functional neuroanatomy of epileptic hallucinations by measuring cerebral perfusion in three patients with AH during simple partial status epilepticus. Hyperperfusion in the temporal lobe covering the PAC occurred in all patients. Our perfusion data support the hypothesis of PAC being a constituting element in the genesis of AH independent of their aetiology.

### Occurrence and phenomenology of hallucinations in the general population: a large online survey [^114NQXqG]. Schizophrenia (2022). Medium credibility.

Fourthly, previous studies in the general population have demonstrated an association between the concurrent presence of hallucinations and delusions, a finding that we were able to replicate within our sample. This finding corresponds with neurobiological models of the interaction between hallucinations and delusions in psychosis. Altogether, our findings suggest that even when applying a very broad definition of hallucinations, they can be closely entwined with the presence of delusions in the general population.

Fifthly, in each sensory modality, we recognized subgroups of participants with more severe phenomenological presentations. From a clinical perspective, these subgroups are of specific interest, since they might be in need of care. Among these subgroups are individuals who experience distress or disfunctioning due to their hallucinations, those who experience hallucinations with a high frequency and/or a long duration, those who experience hallucinations with a negative content, those who have a tendency to comply to dangerous commands issued by their voices, those who report hallucinations associated with previous bothersome experiences, those who present with comorbid delusions, and those who report a lack of insight. For scientific purposes, these subgroups, as well as those experiencing highly specific hallucination types (e.g. musical hallucinations, auditory-verbal hallucinations, complex visual hallucinations, bereavement hallucinations, or hypnagogia,) can provide important anchor points for advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying hallucinations. Hallucinations are increasingly approached as a phenomenon that occurs across diagnoses, with heterogeneous origins (e.g. increased striatal dopamine, decreased cholinergic activity, social deafferentation, sensory deafferentation). Indeed, rather than one 'typical' phenomenological presentation of hallucinations per disorder, as depicted in Supplementary Table 2, increasing evidence on hallucination phenomenology shows both overlap between diagnostic groups, as well as within-group heterogeneity. Therefore, the chances of finding common underlying pathways of hallucinations are likely to increase by grouping people with phenomenologically homogeneous presentations (i.e. 'subtyping'), regardless of diagnosis, and studying and comparing biomarkers within and between these groups (i.e. 'deep phenotyping'). We, therefore, recommend to incorporate phenomenological measures in future hallucination research, preferably aided by extensive phenomenological subtyping.

### Bodily self-disturbances and hallucinations in schizophrenia [^112boNBK]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Hypothesis

Auditory verbal hallucinations experienced by people with schizophrenia are primarily described in terms of unusual perceptual experiences. However, they also involve profound self-disturbances. More specifically, they are deeply intertwined with disorders of the sense of bodily self. Sometimes hallucinations in schizophrenia are experienced as invading the body, whereas other times they seem to help to delineate a frontier between oneself and others.

Study Design

As one of the working groups at the 2023 biennial meeting of the International Consortium on Hallucination Research (ICHR), here we review the disorders of the sense of bodily self in schizophrenia and delineate the link between these disturbances and auditory verbal hallucinations.

Study Results

We report findings suggesting that peripersonal space, interoception, timing, and the vestibular system may all be disturbed in schizophrenia and that there may be reciprocal influences between bodily self-disturbances and hallucinations in this condition.

Conclusions

Schizophrenia is associated with multiple sensory disturbances that contribute to the sense of bodily self. How these disturbances interact remains to be explored. The relationship between weakened sense of the bodily self and hallucinations in schizophrenia is rather complex, with some evidence suggesting that hallucinations in schizophrenia may both contribute to disturbances in the sense of self and, in some cases, temporarily restore self-other boundary. Future studies are needed to establish the causal and bidirectional aspects of these relationships. We can envisage several therapeutic approaches based on the available findings, which will likely have to be adapted to the patients' own needs.

### Lesions causing hallucinations localize to one common brain network [^112JjFv1]. Molecular Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The brain regions responsible for hallucinations remain unclear. We studied 89 brain lesions causing hallucinations using a recently validated technique termed lesion network mapping. We found that hallucinations occurred following lesions to a variety of different brain regions, but these lesion locations fell within a single functionally connected brain network. This network was defined by connectivity to the cerebellar vermis, inferior cerebellum (bilateral lobule X), and the right superior temporal sulcus. Within this single hallucination network, additional connections with the lesion location dictated the sensory modality of the hallucination: lesions causing visual hallucinations were connected to the lateral geniculate nucleus in the thalamus while lesions causing auditory hallucinations were connected to the dentate nucleus in the cerebellum. Our results suggest that lesions causing hallucinations localize to a single common brain network, but additional connections within this network dictate the sensory modality, lending insight into the causal neuroanatomical substrate of hallucinations.

Other biopsychosocial drivers

A host of other biopsychosocial drivers are known to contribute to voices/APE. A genetic basis for voices in psychosis has been proposed, with dysbindin variants linked to auditory, visual, and olfactory hallucinations in a modality-specific manner. Increased striatal dopamineor inter-regional excitatory/inhibitory imbalancesoffer credible neurotransmitter dysregulation accounts for voices, while identification of shared familial history of diagnostic conditions (although inconclusive) points towards possible heritability effects. Personality factors, involving absorption,– or schizotypy, may directly shape voices/APE, albeit in culturally distinct and meaningful ways. Environmental determinants, ranging from grief/bereavementto sensoryor sleepdeprivation, and social withdrawal, exert myriad influences. These elements operate collectively across individuals within their broader sociocultural milieu to ultimately determine how voices/APE are perceived and managed. Table 4 summarises existing empirical support (or lack thereof) for these biopsychosocial mechanisms, illustrating how mechanistic research involving the non-auditory modalities is still largely lacking.

### The clinical spectrum of musical hallucinations [^116odWg5]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2004). Low credibility.

Musical hallucinations are a well known although rare phenomenon in neurological and psychiatric patients. Many case reports have been published to date. However, an accepted common theory on the classification and on the pathophysiology of musical hallucinations is still missing. We analysed all cases published to date, including two own cases, with respect to their demographic and clinical features and to the possible pathomechanisms underlying the hallucinations. In total, 132 cases could be analysed statistically and separated into five groups according to their aetiology (hypacusis; psychiatric disorder; focal brain lesion; epilepsy; intoxication). There was a female preponderance of 70% and a mean age of 61.5 years. Patients with focal brain lesions were significantly younger than the other groups, the hemisphere of the lesion did not play a major role. No systematic studies on treatment are available. However, anticonvulsant and antidepressive substances were reported to be effective most consistently. The pathophysiology of musical hallucinations is discussed considering the theories of deafferentiation including the concept of auditory Charles-Bonnet syndrome, of sensory auditory deprivation, of parasitic memory, and of spontaneous activity in a cognitive network module. In conclusion, musical hallucinations are a phenomenon with heterogeneous clinical and pathophysiological backgrounds.

### Hallucinations: a systematic review of points of similarity and difference across diagnostic classes [^117XJomg]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Finally, we consider implications for cognitive and neuroscientific models of hallucinations. We noted at the outset that there is very limited evidence in the cognitive and neuroscientific domains on which to base transdiagnostic comparisons of hallucinations. A further issue concerns the problem of mapping cognitive profiles of different groups to specific features of hallucinations, as opposed to their mere presence or absence. Mostly such research compares diagnostic groups with healthy controls or (increasingly) uses hallucination incidence as an independent variable within a particular diagnostic group: eg, comparing schizophrenia patients with and without hallucinations.

For these and other reasons, a discussion and comparison of cognitive and neurobiological models across diagnostic groups is beyond the scope of the present article. There are well-developed models of hallucinations in schizophrenia, and in neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease. A complication is that the models for these disorder groups are rather divergent, with some schizophrenia models proposing hyperactivity of the auditory cortex mediated by dopamine release and Parkinson's models proposing underactivity of the occipital cortex mediated by acetylcholine. No such models have been developed for other conditions except for nonclinical hallucinations, which some continuum approaches propose can be best understood as variants of schizophrenia models. Given the many featural similarities of hallucinations among the disorders discussed here, further effort is needed in developing and integrating neurocognitive models across diagnostic groups.

### Musical hallucinations [^112jTR7S]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Musical hallucinations have been described in numerous neurologic and psychiatric patients, but their pathophysiologic background is not understood. Analyzing the published cases, five subgroups can be separated according to their etiology: hypacusis, psychiatric disorders, focal brain lesions, epilepsy, and intoxication. There is a female preponderance of about 70%. Musical hallucinations most often occur in patients over age 60 years, although patients whose hallucinations are caused by focal brain lesions are significantly younger. Hemispheric dominance seems to play no major role in the pathogenesis of musical hallucinations, but hypacusis is present in the majority of all patients. Anticonvulsant and antidepressive agents have been effective in the treatment of some musical hallucinations. The discussion on the pathophysiology of musical hallucinations comprises theories of deafferentation (including auditory Charles Bonnet syndrome), of sensory auditory deprivation, of parasitic memory, and of spontaneous activity in a cognitive network module.

### Fifteen minute consultation on children' hearing voices': when to worry and when to refer [^116reCLn]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

Auditory hallucinations are uncommon paediatric presentations, but they can be alarming and lead to emergency consultations. This review outlines the phenomenology of auditory hallucinations, their assessment and clinical significance. Auditory hallucinations are seen in the course of acute medical disorders, often together with decreased levels of consciousness, as in febrile illness and in toxic, neurologically compromised states; they can also be a feature of episodic neurological conditions such as migraine and temporal lobe epilepsy. Auditory hallucinations are key symptoms in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenic and other psychotic states, but they can also present with depressive and anxiety disorders, and in the context of virtually every psychiatric disorder of childhood. In fact hallucinations — usually simple and transient — are common in the general child populations. Auditory hallucinations become clinically significant when they occur as part of a medical disorder or in the context of acute psychotic states and schizophrenia, when they are frequent, complex, distressing and cause impairment. The treatment of clinically relevant hallucinations is that of the primary medical or psychiatric disorder. Occasionally they require treatment in their own right with psychological treatments, and only when these have been tried and fail, a careful trial of antipsychotic medication may be appropriate.

### Multi-modal hallucinations across diagnoses: what relationships do they have with voice-related distress? [^112mt85n]. Schizophrenia Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Research into hallucinatory experiences has focused primarily upon hallucinations within the auditory modality, to the relative neglect of other modalities. Furthermore, the exploration of auditory hallucinations (or 'voices') has focused primarily upon the experiences of people with a diagnosis of psychosis. The presence of multi-modal hallucinations may have implications across diagnoses for levels of distress, formulation and the targeting of psychological interventions.

Methods

This study presents a cross-sectional analysis of observational data from the PREFER survey (N = 335). Linear regression was used to explore the relationships between voice-related distress and the presence, number, type and timing of multi-modal hallucinations.

Results

Simple relationships were not found between distress and the presence of hallucinations in visual, tactile, olfactory or gustatory modalities, or in the number of modalities experienced. When considering the degree to which another modality hallucination was experienced simultaneously with voices, there was some evidence that the degree of co-occurrence with visual hallucinations was predictive of distress.

Conclusions

The co-occurrence of voices with visual hallucinations may be associated with relatively greater distress, but not consistently, and the association between multimodal hallucinations and clinical impact appear complex and potentially variable from individual to individual. Further study of associated variables such as perceived voice power may further illuminate these relationships.

### Modality-general and modality-specific processes in hallucinations [^1117pL7w]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Contributing significantly to the distress of psychotic illness and increasingly recognized as part of the healthcare burden in other disorders, hallucinations cut across nosological boundaries with limited diagnostic specificity (Waters and Fernyhough). While the understanding of auditory hallucinations (AHs; 'hearing voices') has progressed in recent decades, non-auditory modalities, such as visual, tactile, and olfactory, have tended to be neglected in empirical psychosis research (Langdon et al; Waters et al; McCarthy-Jones et al.). While this is likely due to their lower frequency, it is known that visual hallucinations (VHs) are reasonably common in psychotic disorders, with one recent review putting their incidence at 27% (weighted mean prevalence; Waters et al.). Although individuals often experience hallucinations in more than one modality, there is only limited information on hallucinations in which the same entity is perceived at the same time in more than one modality: so-called 'fused' or simultaneous multimodal hallucinations (Goodwin et al; Hoffman and Varanko).

### Verbal working memory deficits predict levels of auditory hallucination in first-episode psychosis [^112itetw]. Schizophrenia Research (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Auditory verbal hallucinations are a characteristic symptom in schizophrenia. Recent causal models of auditory verbal hallucinations propose that cognitive mechanisms involving verbal working memory are involved in the genesis of auditory verbal hallucinations. Thus, in the present study, we investigate the hypothesis that verbal working memory is a specific factor behind auditory verbal hallucinations.

Methods

In the present study, we investigated the association between verbal working memory manipulation (Backward Digit Span and Letter-Number Sequencing) and auditory verbal hallucinations in a population study (N = 52) of first episode psychosis. The degree of auditory verbal hallucination as reported in the P3-subscale of the PANSS interview was included as dependent variable using sequential multiple regression, while controlling for age, psychosis symptom severity, executive cognitive functions and simple auditory working memory span.

Results

Multiple sequential regression analyses revealed verbal working memory manipulation to be the only significant predictor of verbal hallucination severity.

Conclusions

Consistent with cognitive data from auditory verbal hallucinations in healthy individuals, the present results suggest a specific association between auditory verbal hallucinations, and cognitive processes involving the manipulation of phonological representations during a verbal working memory task.

### Auditory verbal hallucinations: neuroimaging and treatment [^111HbEAk]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) are a frequently occurring phenomenon in the general population and are considered a psychotic symptom when presented in the context of a psychiatric disorder. Neuroimaging literature has shown that AVH are subserved by a variety of alterations in brain structure and function, which primarily concentrate around brain regions associated with the processing of auditory verbal stimuli and with executive control functions. However, the direction of association between AVH and brain function remains equivocal in certain research areas and needs to be carefully reviewed and interpreted. When AVH have significant impact on daily functioning, several efficacious treatments can be attempted such as antipsychotic medication, brain stimulation and cognitive-behavioural therapy. Interestingly, the neural correlates of these treatments largely overlap with brain regions involved in AVH. This suggests that the efficacy of treatment corresponds to a normalization of AVH-related brain activity. In this selected review, we give a compact yet comprehensive overview of the structural and functional neuroimaging literature on AVH, with a special focus on the neural correlates of efficacious treatment.

### Modality specific neural correlates of auditory and somatic hallucinations [^114rX3aA]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Somatic hallucinations occur in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, although auditory hallucinations are more common. Although the neural correlates of auditory hallucinations have been described in several neuroimaging studies, little is known of the pathophysiology of somatic hallucinations. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to compare the distribution of brain activity during somatic and auditory verbal hallucinations, occurring at different times in a 36 year old man with schizophrenia. Somatic hallucinations were associated with activation in the primary somatosensory and posterior parietal cortex, areas that normally mediate tactile perception. Auditory hallucinations were associated with activation in the middle and superior temporal cortex, areas involved in processing external speech. Hallucinations in a given modality seem to involve areas that normally process sensory information in that modality.

### Abnormal connectivity between the default mode and the visual system underlies the manifestation of visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease: a task-based fMRI study [^117Hi6hP]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The results of this study provide the first direct evidence of the abnormalities in neuronal activity and connectivity within the hallucinating brain during elicited visual misperceptions. With evidence from multiple studies converging to support the notion of a common neural mechanism for visual hallucinations irrespective of disease, the path is clear for future studies, which should investigate the precise spatiotemporal mechanisms at the basis of the impairments in attentional flexibility that underlie hallucinations. Although we have shown that Parkinson's disease can act as an effective neural model for the interrogation of visual hallucinations, it bears mention that there are many other clinical disorders, each with vastly different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, in which individuals experience hallucinations. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences are actually most commonly reported in the auditory domain, particularly in disorders such as schizophrenia. Interestingly, the results of our analysis are broadly consistent with findings from the schizophrenia literature, in which multiple groups have linked abnormal activity within the DMN to positive symptoms of the condition. Based on our results, we hypothesize that these alterations in the DMN are likely related to increased connectivity with cortical regions responsible for auditory processing during auditory hallucinations, a proposal consistent with neuroimaging results in schizophrenia. Regardless, it follows that there is great potential for a trans-diagnostic approach comparing individuals with different disorders that nonetheless share hallucinatory symptoms, which may then lead to the creation of novel therapeutics, with direct clinical benefits across multiple disorders.

### A review of multimodal hallucinations: categorization, assessment, theoretical perspectives, and clinical recommendations [^113S8teE]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Misattribution Biases

One candidate process for explaining hallucinations across modalities is a general bias to misattribute internally generated representations (of any modality) to an externally generated source. This concept stems from the inner speech misattribution theory of AHs in schizophrenia, which posited that such experiences are the outcome of misattributing one's inner speech to an external entity. As Fernyhoughsuggested, the same mechanism could be translated to other modalities, with evidence for its analog in vision: PD patients with VHs have stronger visual imagery than those without hallucinations. Furthermore, someone's tendency to be a visualizer or verbalizer relates to their proneness to MMHs. Whether this stronger visual imagery is coupled with internal representations being unusually compelling — as is the case in the auditory domain — remains to be further investigated. It is unclear whether one can have internal smells or internal gustatory sensations equivalent to having internal speech. Further issues with this model's explanatory power for MMHs are that, in its current form, it cannot explain the different rates of hallucinations across modalities in several disorders, as it would predict that all sensory systems will be equally affected, resulting in similar rates of hallucinatory experiences across them. Nevertheless, this discrepancy could be due to the fact that some sensations might not be equally salient across senses — as suggested earlier — or because some senses might have a different role/weight in perception in distinct scenarios. Thus, MMHs pose interesting challenges to misattribution bias theories that warrant further attention.

### Occurrence and co-occurrence of hallucinations by modality in schizophrenia-spectrum disorders [^111pMAdb]. Psychiatry Research (2017). Low credibility.

It is not only unclear why hallucinations in schizophrenia occur with different prevalence by modality, but also to what extent they do. Reliable prevalence estimates of hallucinations by modality in schizophrenia are currently lacking, particularly for non-auditory hallucinations. Studies have also tended to report lifetime, not point prevalence by modality. This study assessed the prevalence and co-occurrence of hallucinations, for both lifetime and point prevalence, across the auditory, visual, olfactory, and tactile modalities, in people diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia-spectrum disorders in Ireland (N = 693) and Australia (N = 218). Lifetime prevalence was 64–80% auditory, 23–31% visual, 9–19% tactile, and 6–10% olfactory. Past month prevalence was 23–27% auditory, 5–8% visual, 4–7% tactile, and 2% olfactory. The majority of participants had only hallucinated in one modality, with this nearly always being the auditory. Approximately one-third had hallucinated in two modalities, most commonly the auditory and visual. Most currently hallucinating patients also hallucinated in a single modality, again, nearly always the auditory. Whereas 30–37% of patients with lifetime auditory hallucinations had experienced visual hallucinations, 83–97% of patients with experience of visual hallucinations had experienced auditory hallucinations. These findings help delineate the modality distribution of hallucinations in schizophrenia, and provide an explanatory target for theoretical models.

### Experiences of hearing voices: analysis of a novel phenomenological survey [^117PjXqo]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Auditory hallucinations — or voices — are a common feature of schizophrenia. They also occur in other disorders and in individuals with no psychiatric history. Understanding of subjective experiences of hallucination — and how they vary between different populations — is a central concern of psychiatry, and can help with the development of new causal accounts of auditory hallucination and more effective therapeutic interventions.

Although various resources document first-person experiences of voice-hearing, systematic empirical research on the phenomenology of auditory hallucinations remains scarce. Nayani and David's 1996 studyanalysed clinical interview data from 100 patients with psychosis with auditory hallucinations (61% of 100 individuals had ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnoses). The investigators concluded that auditory hallucinations in this population are typically repetitive emotive utterances that increase in number and complexity over time. In 2014, McCarthy-Jones and colleaguesanalysed auditory hallucination descriptions from 199 patients (81% of individuals had a diagnosis of DSM-III-R schizophrenia), obtained through the Mental Health Research Institute (MHRI) Unusual Perceptions Scale. Cluster analysis of these findings suggested four common factors: voices that were repetitive, commanding or involved running commentary (86%); voices similar to a person's own thoughts (36%); voices that were clearly reminiscent of specific memories (12%); and non-verbal auditory hallucinations (42%).

Although such surveys provide insight into the experience of auditory hallucinations, the focus on psychosis, particularly schizophrenia, leaves the potential cross-diagnostic features of auditory hallucinations unexplored. Additionally, the semi-structured interviews and closed-ended approaches often used make several a priori assumptions about the key features of auditory hallucinations, which prioritise some structural characteristics (eg, loudness) over others (eg, voice identity). Clinical terminology is often itself loaded and might prime or encourage participants to describe their experiences in particular ways (eg, as auditory or linguistic). From a phenomenological perspective, these approaches might constrain understanding of auditory hallucinations in potentially serious ways.

To address these concerns, and as part of the Hearing the Voice project and Lived Experience Network, we developed a questionnaire on voices and voice-like experiences. We drew on the expertise of philosophers, psychologists, medical humanities scholars, and researchers with lived experience of auditory hallucination, in consultation with clinicians and people who hear voices, from the project's advisory group. We aimed to record a detailed and diverse collection of experiences, in the words of the people who hear voices themselves.

### Hallucinations in older adults: a practical review [^1127BZkK]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2020). Medium credibility.

Whilst our understanding, assessment, and treatment of hallucinations in older adults have improved in the last decade, greater priority needs to be given to communicating these advances to clinicians so that clinical care can be grounded in the best available evidence. The International Consortium of Hallucinations Research Working Group on Hallucinations in Older Adults was set up to respond to this challenge. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to highlight the key issues for the workforce caring for older adults with hallucinations; critically review current assessment tools, management guidelines, and treatment approaches for this population; and offer recommendations and resources to support best practice.

### Soundless voices, silenced selves: are auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia truly perceptual? [^111WR2Wx]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

In much contemporary psychiatric training and practice, there is a strong emphasis on the audible or perceptual quality and externality of auditory verbal hallucinations in clinical assessments. A typical question during clinical assessment is asking whether the voices that a person hears sound identical to the way the clinician's voice is heard. In this Personal View, we argue that the most important factor in auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia spectrum psychoses is a loss of first-person authority, and that a perceptual quality is not required for it to be this kind of hallucination. We draw on evidence from cognitive neuroscience showing that the activation of brain networks retrieved during capture of auditory verbal hallucinations that were experienced when a patient was in a functional MRI scanner does not match activation of networks retrieved during auditory perception. We propose that, despite early writings by Esquirol and Schneider that defined auditory verbal hallucinations as beliefs in perception rather than true perception, cognitive neuroscience, psychiatric training and practice, and patients adopting clinical vocabulary have been strongly influenced by the progression of the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, which increasingly place emphasis on language, such as the "full force" of a true perception. We hold that this change has resulted in an unhelpful top-down influence on the field, imposing perceptual qualities on auditory verbal hallucinations, and leading to misunderstandings and inaccuracies in clinical practice and patients' self-reports, and misinterpretations in cognitive neuroscience. We encourage a revision of the definition of auditory verbal hallucinations to move away from the necessity for auditory perception, and towards beliefs in perception due to the loss of first-person authority.

Disorders and conditions in which hallucinations present

There are many disorders and conditions (including nonpathological cases) in which hallucinations have been reported (, adapted).

Psychotic experiences occur in around 4%–7% of the general population, proving transitory in around 80% of cases. In this group, incidence of hallucinations varies with developmental stage, appearing with relatively high prevalence in children (8%) and older adults (community 1%–5%; residential care 63%), and some adults on a continuum of hallucination proneness. Hallucinations also occur transiently in situations causing extreme physiological or psychological stress (fatigue, sensory deprivation, bereavement, etc.).

Hallucinations co-occur with toxin-, alcohol-, and drug-related conditions that affect the central nervous system and involve the cortical sensory areas. These include intoxication with stimulants, hallucinogenic drugs, and cannabis, and withdrawal from substances including alcohol. Medication-induced hallucinations also result from drug abuse or occur as side effects of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder drugs, antimalarial medication, and antiparkinsonian drugs. In these cases, hallucinations usually disappear after withdrawal of the substance.

Hallucinations are associated with a range of medical conditions. Conditions causing interference with, or damage to, the peripheral sensory pathways can produce hallucinations. For example, acquired deafness is a common cause for (auditory) hallucinations, as is eye disease or lesions of afferent visual pathways for visual hallucinations. Endocrine-related metabolic disorders including disorders of thyroid functionand Hashimoto diseasecan produce hallucinations, as can deficiencies in D and B12 vitamins. Other medical conditions associated with hallucinations include chromosomal disorders such as Prader–Willi syndrome, autoimmune disorders, and acquired immunodeficiency disorders such as HIV/AIDS, and sleep disorders such as narcolepsy. Neurological events such as tumors, traumatic brain injuries, epilepsy, and cardiovascular events may also cause hallucinations where activity involves the brainstem regions and areas involving the temporal, occipital, or temporo-parietal pathways. Hallucinations are also fairly common in neurodegenerative conditions, particularly in Parkinson's diseaseand dementia with Lewy bodies.

### Variables influencing conditioning-evoked hallucinations: overview and future applications [^1159jd79]. Psychological Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Hallucinations occur in the absence of sensory stimulation and result in vivid perceptual experiences of nonexistent events that manifest across a range of sensory modalities. Approaches from the field of experimental and cognitive psychology have leveraged the idea that associative learning experiences can evoke conditioning-induced hallucinations in both animals and humans. In this review, we describe classical and contemporary findings and highlight the variables eliciting these experiences. We also provide an overview of the neurobiological mechanisms, along with the associative and computational factors that may explain hallucinations that are generated by representation-mediated conditioning phenomena. Through the integration of animal and human research, significant advances into the psychobiology of hallucinations are possible, which may ultimately translate to more effective clinical applications.

### Recognition and differential diagnosis of psychosis in primary care [^112nWi3H]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Psychosis is a symptom complex that may include hallucinations, delusions, disorders of thought, and disorganized speech or behavior. Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.

### Disrupted network cross talk, hippocampal dysfunction and hallucinations in schizophrenia [^113yZNN6]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Hallucinations characterize schizophrenia, with approximately 59% of patients reporting auditory hallucinations and 27% reporting visual hallucinations. Prior neuroimaging studies suggest that hallucinations are linked to disrupted communication across distributed (sensory, salience-monitoring and subcortical) networks. Yet, our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie auditory and visual hallucinations in schizophrenia remains limited. This study integrates two resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis methods - amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional network connectivity (FNC) - to explore the hypotheses that (1) abnormal FNC between salience and sensory (visual/auditory) networks underlies hallucinations in schizophrenia, and (2) disrupted hippocampal oscillations (as measured by hippocampal ALFF) beget changes in FNC linked to hallucinations. Our first hypothesis was supported by the finding that schizophrenia patients reporting hallucinations have higher FNC between the salience network and an associative auditory network relative to healthy controls. Hippocampal ALFF was negatively associated with FNC between primary auditory cortex and the salience network in healthy subjects, but was positively associated with FNC between these networks in patients reporting hallucinations. These findings provide indirect support favoring our second hypothesis. We suggest future studies integrate fMRI with electroencephalogram (EEG) and/or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) methods to directly probe the temporal relation between altered hippocampal oscillations and changes in cross-network functional communication.

### A neuropsychiatric model of biological and psychological processes in the remission of delusions and auditory hallucinations [^113NP2ou]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

This selective review combines cognitive models and biological models of psychosis into a tentative integrated neuropsychiatric model. The aim of the model is to understand better, how pharmacotherapy and cognitive-behavior therapy come forward as partners in the treatment of psychosis and play complementary and mutually reinforcing roles. The article reviews the dominant models in literature. The focus in this review is on one hand on neural circuits that are involved in cognitive models and on the other hand on cognitive processes and experiences involved in biological models. In this way, a 4-component neuropsychiatric model is tentatively constructed: (1) a biological component that leads to aberrant perceptions and salience of stimuli, (2) a cognitive component that attempts to explain the psychic abnormal events, (3) a mediating component with psychological biases which influences the reasoning process in the direction of the formation of (secondary) delusions, and (4) a component of psychological processes that maintains delusions and prevents the falsification of delusional ideas. Remission consists actually of 2 processes. Biological remission consists of the dampening of mesolimbic dopamine releases with antipsychotic medication and decreases the continuous salient experiences. Psychological remission consists of the reappraisal of primary psychotic experiences. Both forms of remission are partially independent. We expect that a full remission including biological and psychological remission could prevent relapse.

### Phenomenological and cognitive features associated with auditory hallucinations in clinical and nonclinical voice hearers [^114MkY3C]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2023). Medium credibility.

Do the striking similarities of AVH in NCVH and PSZ suggest that these phenomena arise from the same mechanism? Speculatively, the predictive coding model of AVH may provide an account for the AVH of both groups. Predictive coding models of perception emphasize that it is a highly active process where our prior beliefs are combined with incoming sensory evidence to make an inference about the source of our current experience. The reliability (or precision) of both priors and sensory evidence are evaluated in coming to a perceptual inference. For example, prior evidence would have greater precision than incoming sensory evidence when entering a darkened, but familiar room. In contrast, incoming sensory evidence offers greater precision than priors when entering a new, unfamiliar environment. Several influential theoretical accounts suggest that the experience of hallucinations and delusions might be explained by an overweighting of prior beliefs relative to sensory input. It is important to note that there is more than 1 pathway to overweighting of priors relative to sensory input. This can occur when the priors are more precise/strong than the sensory input and therefore receive greater weighting as in the darkened room example. This could also happen if the precision of sensory input is degraded, thereby increasing the relative weighting of priors. We speculate that the first path is more common in NCVH, many of whom experience great meaning from, and welcome, their AVH. In contrast, we suggest that degradation of sensory inputs maybe more common in PSZ given evidence for impaired auditory processing in PSZ. Both paths lead to the same outcome where perceptual inference is driven by priors that dominate sensory input, a mechanism contributing to AVH that we believe is shared across NCVH and PSZ. This speculative explanation would be consistent with the shared sensory experiences between the 2 groups, coupled with the differences in cognitive performance suggesting widespread cortical compromise in PSZ, and the absence of such compromise in NCVH.

Purpose of Treatment

For some disorders, such as intoxication, psychotic depression, and schizophrenia, hallucinations may respond well to treatment of the underlying disorder. However, in other disorders, such as dementia, vision or hearing loss, or Parkinson's disease, this is not the case. In such instances, additional treatment aimed specifically at hallucinations may be indicated. For the treatment of hallucinations, the most important question is what the aim of treatment should be. There are a number of answers frequently given to this question:

I want to understand why I experience these hallucinations.
I want to be competent to handle these hallucinations.
I want to get rid of these hallucinations.

For Purpose 1: Psychoeducation.

If the response to this question is in line with answer 1, then psychoeducation is the treatment of choice. In one or more sessions, the patient and his/her loved one can be provided with information about how perception is accomplished in the brain, how this process can go awry, and which factors can precipitate hallucinations. A good start for psychoeducation is to ask the patient what he/she already knows and which explanation he/she currently uses for this experience. From there, unhelpful explanations can be corrected and new knowledge can be added to improve disease insight.

### Musical hallucinations and their relation with epilepsy [^115DQUvg]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Summary

Summing up, musical hallucinations in the context of epilepsy can be divided into three subtypes, comprising aura/ictal phenomena, post-ictal phenomena, and inter-ictal phenomena, and even into four, if we also include post-ECT phenomena. Since our analysis of the phenomenological and neurophysiological data from extant case descriptions indicates that musical hallucinations lie on a continuum with other nonverbal auditory hallucinations, verbal auditory hallucinations, and notably tinnitus, we propose a Bayesian model involving top-down prediction errors and bottom-up error-prediction errors that incorporates findings from EEG and MEG studies to explain the mediation of musical hallucinations from within the auditory network. As we demonstrated, this electrophysiological auditory-network hypothesis also has ramifications for musical hallucinations in their relation to pharmacological substances. We, therefore, suggest that musical hallucinations associated with epilepsy can teach us important lessons on how some other types of musical hallucination are produced, i.e. through alterations in wide-ranging networks, through (functional and structural) disruptions in connections, through abnormal (de-)synchrony between different frequencies, and through changes in their power in a Bayesian predictive coding hierarchy.

### Hallucinations beyond voices: a conceptual review of the phenomenology of altered perception in psychosis [^1155zEf1]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

This review suggests some key ways in which research on hallucinations can evolve. First, there are a number of identifiable subjective experiences co-occurring with hallucinations that do not fit the conventional definition of hallucinations. These are in need of greater research attention, both on their own and in relation to hallucinatory phenomena. As part of this working group, ongoing and future projects will systematically inquire into the full range of experiential modalities that are involved in participants' hallucinations, while other investigations may be facilitated by wide-ranging phenomenologically oriented interviews. Second, patterns of covariation with hallucinations need to be understood, and if clustering together, explanatory and etiological models of hallucinations need to be able to account for their co-occurrence. For example, several researchers are already exploring the relationship between phenomena like thought insertion and voice hearing. In addition, dissociation among voice hearers may moderate various outcomes associated with hallucinations; addressing this factor may reduce unnecessary variability within samples. Third, the breadth of phenomena suggests reconsidering how hallucinations should be defined. Traditional definitions have emphasized sensory qualities and their realness and distinctiveness from mental imagery and verbal thought. The importance of this boundary is questionable when considering findings on this range of experiential transformations. For example, future research on hallucinations may also benefit from including subjects who experience thought insertion or thought passivity (rather than limiting recruitment to those who meet a narrower definition of hallucinations). There may be value in incorporating other elements into a definition of a broader construct of hallucinations, such as changes in agency or ownership of thought, separation from self-experience, uncertainty about internal vs external phenomena, and anomalous awareness of the presence of others.

### Auditory hallucinations in a cross-diagnostic sample of psychotic disorder patients: a descriptive, cross-sectional study [^114sHXNb]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Auditory hallucinations (AH) are a cardinal feature of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. They are not disease specific, however, and can occur in other conditions, including affective psychoses.

Methods

In this descriptive, cross-sectional study, we examined AH in relation to other psychotic symptoms, mood symptoms, illness severity, and functional status in 569 patients with psychosis (n = 172 schizophrenia, n = 153 schizoaffective disorder, n = 244 bipolar disorder with psychotic features).

Results

A total of 323 (56.7%) patients reported a lifetime history of AH (75.6% of patients with schizophrenia, 71.9% schizoaffective disorder, and 34.0% bipolar disorder). The mean score for the hallucinations item (P3) of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale in the AH group was 3.66 ± 1.79, indicating mild to moderate state hallucinations severity. Auditory hallucinations were strongly associated with hallucinations in other sensory modalities and with the first-rank symptoms of delusions of control, thought insertion, and thought broadcasting. Multivariate analysis showed that AH were associated with lower education even after controlling for diagnosis, age, and sex. There was no association between AH and functional status as measured by the Multnomah Community Ability Scale.

Conclusions

Auditory hallucinations are associated with specific clinical features across the continuum of both schizophrenic and affective psychoses independent of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnosis.

### Reduced neural connectivity in the caudate anterior head predicts hallucination severity in schizophrenia [^115SdAUR]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Patients with schizophrenia (SZ) suffer from profound positive psychotic symptoms, such as auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), which often occur in the form of spoken words and are experienced in the absence of external auditory stimuli. SZ typically misattribute hallucinations as being externally-derived voices, and as being separate and distinct from their own inner self-generated thoughts, revealing severe impairments in self-agency (i.e. impairments in the awareness of being the originator of one's own thoughts and actions). One theory is that such impairments in self-agency that manifest as AVH symptoms may result from sensory gating impairments, described as an inability to filter out distracting and irrelevant information from internal and external sensory sources, and likely represents a central component of the underlying pathophysiology of hallucinations. One possible locus of this sensory gating impairment is the caudate nucleus, a region of the basal ganglia that plays a critical role in sensory gating. Typically, the caudate interfaces with multiple subdivisions of the basal ganglia (globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus) and acts as a "gate" for receiving sensory inputs from the thalamus to select salient and relevant information and send to temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices underlying working-memory. Ample evidence exists not only for dysfunctional caudate structure and function in SZ, but also for its relation to hallucinations, suggesting that caudate functional abnormalities may underlie the pathophysiology of hallucinations in SZ. Caudate functional abnormalities are also a distinguishing feature in patients with tinnitus, who experience bothersome auditory phantom percepts, posited to be the consequence of impaired sensory gating of internal auditory sound sources by the striatum.

### Bodily self-disturbances and hallucinations in schizophrenia [^111iJce5]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hallucinations are common in schizophrenia (SZ), occurring in approximately 70%-80% of individuals with this condition. Although hallucinations in SZ can occur in any sensory modality, auditory hallucinations, most notably auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) — or voices — are the predominant type experienced.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed; DSM-5)defines hallucinations as clear perceptual experiences that occur in the absence of corresponding external stimuli. It is notable that this standard definition of hallucinations does not reference what seems to be a core feature of how they are experienced in psychosis, namely self-disturbances. Indeed, the exclusive focus on the perceptual aspects of hallucinations, along with an emphasis on unimodal sensory experiences, belie the complexity, heterogeneity, and nuances of hallucinations in psychosis. It is our aim here to delineate the link between AVH and the sense of bodily self and to describe how there may be reciprocal influences between bodily self-disturbances and hallucinations, in SZ.

### Musical hallucinations and their relation with epilepsy [^1176qLWo]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Between musical hallucinations and epilepsy a connection exists that was already suspected when neurology was still struggling to comprehend either phenomenon. In 1883, Ormerod wrote an article in Brain, entitled On epilepsy, in its relation to ear-disease, in which he mused that, 'it needs no very extended observation to show that these two phenomena frequently co-exist'. In this pioneering paper, he described a 61-year-old woman with longstanding deafness and epilepsy. The deafness progressed with increasing tinnitus, and gradually the woman also began to hear words, names, street sounds, and songs. Ormerod quoted Schwartze, who had said that, 'subjective aural sensations, which are caused by demonstrable affections of the ear, may in predisposed persons (.) become the direct cause of aural hallucinations'. Well over a century later, the relation between epilepsy and musical hallucinations still puzzles us. Musical hallucinations are auditory hallucinations characterised by songs, tunes, melodies, harmonics, rhythms, and/or timbres. They are different from earworms or 'tunes in the head', in the sense that they are perceptual in nature, whereas earworms are not. First described by Baillarger in 1844, musical hallucinations have traditionally been considered rare. However, several studies in designated populations suggest that they are probably merely underreported. In a large sample (n = 1007) of patients attending an audiology clinic, for example, auditory hallucinations were common in the last four weeks (n = 114), with musical hallucinations (n = 52) increasing in frequency with increasing hearing loss, and correlating with tinnitus and female sex. Musical hallucinations are commonly divided into two groups. When they occur in the absence of any associated pathological abnormalities — with the exception of hearing impairment (hypoacusis) — they are called idiopathic musical hallucinations. When they occur in the presence of associated pathological abnormalities, they are called symptomatic musical hallucinations. The most relevant etiological factors for musical hallucinations are brain injuries, epilepsy, psychiatric disorders, and the use of illicit substances or medicines. Recent insights into the neurophysiology of musical hallucinations, as well as the application of Bayesian prediction models, provide a window on these complex phenomena, and allow us to catch a glimpse of their pathophysiology.

### Hallucinations: a systematic review of points of similarity and difference across diagnostic classes [^116QyLto]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

How do hallucinations present across diagnostic classes?

In this section, we consider data as they inform on points of commonality and divergence across diagnostic classes of psychiatric illness, with a particular focus on comparisons with schizophrenia spectrum disorders. A predominant aim is to determine which, if any, features of hallucinations are pathognomonic: that is, specific to schizophrenia (as the "prototypical" psychotic disorder) and not reported in any other population group.

### Hallucinations in children and adolescents: an updated review and practical recommendations for clinicians [^111YCdMD]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Hallucinations in children and adolescents are now known to occur on a continuum from healthy to psychopathology-related phenomena. Although hallucinations in young populations are mostly transient, they can cause substantial distress. Despite hallucinations being widely investigated, research so far has had limited implications for clinical practice. The present article has 3 main aims: (1) to review research findings since 2014 (when the last major review of the area was published); (2) to present assessment tools validated to measure hallucinations in children and adolescents; and (3) to discuss therapeutic strategies and clinical issues. We conclude by presenting a tailored care model for clinicians and outline future challenges for research.

### The relationship between visual hallucinations, functioning, and suicidality over the course of illness: a 10-year follow-up study in first-episode psychosis [^113CkGPs]. Schizophrenia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

In contrast to the vast research on auditory hallucinations in psychotic disorders, comparatively little attention has been devoted to visual hallucinations. This may be because auditory hallucinations appear to be more common in psychotic disorders –, whereas visual hallucinations have traditionally been linked to organic and neurodegenerative conditions. However, recent meta-analyses indicate that visual hallucinations are less rare in psychosis than previously assumed, with a weighted mean prevalence of 33% in first-episode psychosis (FEP)and 27% in schizophrenia. Empirical studies point toward similar or higher prevalence estimates in samples with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, and FEP –. Accordingly, visual hallucinations are a common and transdiagnostic phenomenon in psychotic disorders.

Visual hallucinations tend to co-occur with hallucinations in other, especially auditory modalities, and are often experienced as simultaneous-multimodal hallucinations (e.g. talking images). Notably, they are associated with a range of illness severity markers, including higher global, as well as domain-specific symptom severity, a larger number of psychiatric comorbidities, longer time spent in acute psychosis, higher administered doses of antipsychotic medication, and a lower age at onset. Visual hallucinations have also been linked to decreased cognitive and social functioning, and increased suicidality both in individuals with psychosis, and in help-seeking adolescents with newly occurred mental health problems.

These associations between visual hallucinations and illness severity markers may be explained by shared genetic and neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities. Specifically, it has been suggested that the same genetic and neurodevelopmental factors that underlie a more severe psychopathology also increase the propensity for visual hallucinations and that visual hallucinations in psychosis may be related to larger detrimental neurodevelopmental changes. This assumption is supported by findings of remarkably high prevalence rates of visual hallucinations in childhood-onset schizophrenia, a condition that is most often associated with poor long-term outcomes and with more pronounced genetic and neuroanatomical abnormalities. Functional and structural brain imaging studies of schizophrenia patients substantiate these interpretations, with aberrations observed in those with visual hallucinations, and regions implicated in visual hallucinations affected in poor-outcome schizophrenia. The association between visual hallucinations and a lower age at onset has also been interpreted to support a neurodevelopmental hypothesis of visual hallucinations.

### Hallucinations: a systematic review of points of similarity and difference across diagnostic classes [^115Dt3CL]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2017). Low credibility.

Methods

To answer these questions, a search was carried out in Medline for English-language articles and book chapters containing the following terms (Hallucinat* OR Psychot* Symptom*) AND (Compar* OR Differen* OR Similarit* OR Contrast*), without date restrictions. Inclusion criteria included empirical articles involving direct contrasts between 2 and more population groups with hallucinations, where one of these groups included schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Exclusion criteria were as follows: single case studies and reviews, studies reporting on "hallucination proneness" as a continuous variable, and publication in languages other than English. The search was conducted on June 20, 2016, and revealed 165 articles, to which 21 additional articles were added from known articles and cross-referencing. Title and abstracts, and subsequently the entire articles, were scanned to ascertain whether they fulfilled the criteria (see figure 1 for PRISMA diagram). A total of 56 articles met the criteria.

Fig. 1.
PRISMA diagram.

The great majority of articles (90.1%) demonstrated a focus on featural or clinical characteristics of hallucinations. The remaining articles reporting solely on imaging data (n = 4) or cognitive processes (n = 2) were excluded. Seven further articles were excluded for not involving a schizophrenia group or not reporting on hallucinations specifically.

In total, 43 articles were reviewed (see table 1). Articles involving direct comparisons with schizophrenia included the following 4 major groups: (1) nonclinical groups (general population, religious experiences; total 7 studies); (2) drug- or alcohol-related (substances) conditions(9 studies); (3) medical and neurological conditions (tinnitus, epilepsy, narcolepsy, other medical and neurological causes; total 9 studies); and (4) psychiatric disorders (affective disorders, borderline personality disorder, PTSD, dissociative identity disorder, anorexia; total 18 studies). There were a further 2 articles on attenuated psychosis (ultra high risk [UHR]), which were classed in the psychiatric group. Noticeably absent were direct comparisons with Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Given this important gap, we chose to include one recent review comparing visual hallucinations in schizophrenia to those in Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, and eye disease(classed in the medical and neurological category).

### Deviations in cortex sulcation associated with visual hallucinations in schizophrenia [^117K1VE1]. Molecular Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Hallucinations, and auditory hallucinations (AH) in particular, constitute the most typical and disabling schizophrenia symptoms. Although visual hallucinations (VH) have been largely neglected in psychiatric disorders, a recent review reported a 27% mean prevalence of VH in schizophrenia patients. The pathophysiology underlying VH in schizophrenia remains elusive. Several schizophrenia studies reported a significant effect of age on VH; therefore, we tested the hypothesis that the neurodevelopmental model of schizophrenia may explain VH occurrence. We analyzed cortex sulcation, a marker of brain development, in healthy controls (HCs) and two subgroups of carefully selected schizophrenia patients suffering from hallucinations: patients with only AH (that is, patients who never reported VH) and patients with audio-visual hallucinations (A+VH). Different cortical sulcation and left-right sulcal asymmetry were found between A+VH and AH patients, with decreased sulcation in both A+VH and AH patients in comparison with the HCs. Although a specific association between VH and neurodegenerative mechanisms, for example, in Body-Lewy Dementia or Parkinson's Disease, has previously been reported in the literature, the current study provides the first neuroimaging evidence of an association between VH and neurodevelopmental mechanisms.

### Auditory hallucinations in adults with hearing impairment: a large prevalence study [^114q66Ky]. Psychological Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Similar to visual hallucinations in visually impaired patients, auditory hallucinations are often suggested to occur in adults with hearing impairment. However, research on this association is limited. This observational, cross-sectional study tested whether auditory hallucinations are associated with hearing impairment, by assessing their prevalence in an adult population with various degrees of objectified hearing impairment.

Methods

Hallucination presence was determined in 1007 subjects aged 18–92, who were referred for audiometric testing to the Department of ENT-Audiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands. The presence and severity of hearing impairment were calculated using mean air conduction thresholds from the most recent pure tone audiometry.

Results

Out of 829 participants with hearing impairment, 16.2% (n = 134) had experienced auditory hallucinations in the past 4 weeks; significantly more than the non-impaired group [5.8%; n = 10/173; p < 0.001, odds ratio 3.2 (95% confidence interval 1.6–6.2)]. Prevalence of auditory hallucinations significantly increased with categorized severity of impairment, with rates up to 24% in the most profoundly impaired group (p < 0.001). The corrected odds of hallucination presence increased 1.02 times for each dB of impairment in the best ear. Auditory hallucinations mostly consisted of voices (51%), music (36%), and doorbells or telephones (24%).

Conclusions

Our findings reveal that auditory hallucinations are common among patients with hearing impairment, and increase with impairment severity. Although more research on potential confounding factors is necessary, clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon, by inquiring after hallucinations in hearing-impaired patients and, conversely, assessing hearing impairment in patients with auditory hallucinations, since it may be a treatable factor.

### Hallucinations beyond voices: a conceptual review of the phenomenology of altered perception in psychosis [^115ABUrw]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have considered a range of experiential features and hypothesized mechanisms associated with psychosis, with attention to one commonly researched feature of psychosis, hallucinations. In doing so, we hope to have demonstrated not only the variety of manifestations of psychosis, but also the intricate intertwining of experiential domains and the interplay between phenomenology, neurocognitive factors, and environment.

It is unlikely that hallucinations or any other experiential alterations traditionally associated with psychosis will be experienced as discrete or static phenomena. Indeed, the findings presented above suggest that hallucinations may occur in multiple perceptual modalities and may be continuous with nonhallucinatory experiences (eg, thought insertion, out-of-body experiences, dissociation, alterations in perception). It is similarly unlikely that the development of hallucinations can be attributed to one core process or causal factor. Genetics, neurocognitive processes, subjective experience, cognitive styles or patterns of interpretation, and cultural and social environments are likely to interact in complex ways, with hallucinations as an equifinal outcome. Given this complexity, it is understandable that research, diagnostic criteria, and clinical interventions would attempt to simplify the defining characteristics of hallucinations. However, doing so risks ignoring a diverse array of associated or interwoven experiences, focusing instead on symptoms with narrow, concrete, and easily agreed-upon definitions.

### Musical hallucinations and their relation with epilepsy [^111HApN6]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Limitations

The cases of epilepsy in musical hallucinations described above have often no documentation of hearing loss, as well as other incomplete data. The patients have many different causes of their epilepsy, including structural abnormalities. The numbers are small, and there is insufficient data on the influence of pharmacological agents or environmental stimuli on the neurophysiology in patients with musical hallucinations.

### Hearing voices and other altered perceptual experiences across psychotic, mood, and anxiety disorders: from phenomenology and mechanisms to future directions [^114cYy47]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Neurocognition

Another area of prolific research into voices (and non-verbal sounds) relates to neurocognitive correlates. Full consideration of this extensive literature is beyond the present scope. However, authoritative reviews pertaining to the domains of executive function and inhibition, linguistic processing, neuroanatomical correlatesand resting state connectivity, prediction errors/overdominance of priors, as well as self- or source-monitoringexist (also see Table B pertaining to aetiological models). A paradox emerges, in that an apparent lack, yet also an over-specificity of investigations relating to voices. This is exemplified by emphasis on a broad disorder level (e.g. schizophrenia), alongside neglect of nuanced consideration regarding how these mechanisms may operate for non-auditory hallucinations. There is also a question of whether neurocognitive mechanisms are truly aetiological or perhaps stem from other illness effects, which merely perpetuate voices following onset.

Studies into neurocognitive mechanisms associated with non-auditory hallucinations in psychosis (or other psychiatric conditions) remain scant. Aberrant source-monitoring, visual processing, and hippocampal connectivityor conversely intact attentionaland visual recognitionperformance have been tentatively documented in relation to visual hallucinations. Preliminary evidence of socioemotional/decision-making deficits related to orbitofrontal cortex functionas well as modality-specific source-monitoring difficultiesin olfactory hallucinations have likewise been recorded. Psychiatric research comparing multisensory processingand general cognitive function linked to multisensory/multimodal hallucinations appears lacking. An inclusive viewpoint, encompassing how existing neurocognitive processes may be selectively applied to aid mechanistic explanations of multisensory hallucinations (i.e. modality-general versus modality-specific) has been proposed, and warrants conceptual and empirical corroboration.

### Local versus long-range connectivity patterns of auditory disturbance in schizophrenia [^111N28c7]. Schizophrenia Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Auditory hallucinations are a debilitating symptom of schizophrenia. Effective treatment is limited because the underlying neural mechanisms remain unknown. Our study investigates how local and long-range functional connectivity is associated with auditory perceptual disturbances (APD) in schizophrenia. APD was assessed using the Auditory Perceptual Trait and State Scale. Resting state fMRI data were collected for N = 99 patients with schizophrenia. Local functional connectivity was estimated using regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis; long-range connectivity was estimated using resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis. Mediation analyses tested whether local (ReHo) connectivity significantly mediated associations between long-distance rsFC and APD. Severity of APD was significantly associated with reduced ReHo in left and right putamen, left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and right hippocampus-pallidum. Higher APD was also associated with reduced rsFC between the right putamen and the contralateral putamen and auditory cortex. Local and long-distance connectivity measures together explained 40.3% of variance in APD (P < 0.001), with the strongest predictor being the left TPJ ReHo (P < 0.001). Additionally, TPJ ReHo significantly mediated the relationship between right putamen - left putamen rsFC and APD (Sobel test, P = 0.001). Our findings suggest that both local and long-range functional connectivity deficits contribute to APD, emphasizing the role of striatum and auditory cortex. Considering the translational impact of these circuit-based findings within the context of prior clinical trials to treat auditory hallucinations, we propose a model in which correction of both local and long-distance functional connectivity deficits may be necessary to treat auditory hallucinations.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113MvKKV]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol hallucinosis — clinical presentation and classification — is described as hallucinations that occur in the absence of other clinically prominent withdrawal signs and symptoms such as clear delirium, and hallucinosis consists of primarily auditory hallucinations but may include visual hallucinations and delusions. It is unclear if alcohol hallucinosis is part of alcohol withdrawal syndrome or a complication of chronic alcohol use unrelated to withdrawal, and alcohol hallucinosis is currently diagnosed as Alcohol-Induced Psychotic Disorder using the DSM-5.

### From computation to the first-person: auditory-verbal hallucinations and delusions of thought interference in schizophrenia-spectrum psychoses [^115rd8Lr]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2019). Medium credibility.

Another key phenomenological difference is the emotionally negative content (usually) associated with clinical or psychotic voice-hearers; although this has not yet been systematically studied under the Bayesian framework, there is accumulating evidence pointing toward the roles played by past memories (eg, of trauma), which may act as top-down expectations relating to voice content, especially in memory-related subtypes of AVH.

This model makes predictions that cohere with empirical investigations: (1)Loss of NMDA receptor function on inhibitory interneurons in temporal areas might lead to an increase in resting activity (it is harder to suppress "noise") but a decrease in task-related (including prediction error-related) activity (task-related activity is inversely correlated with the baseline level) — both of which have been demonstrated in functional magnetic resonance imaging studies with schizophrenia patients with AVH, but are hard to explain using the "comparator" model.(2)Inhibitory interneuron dysfunction in schizophrenia may make it harder for auditory cortex to generate γ oscillations in response to 40-Hz tones (which depend on interactions between pyramidal cells and interneurons).(3)Voice-hearers ought to demonstrate more precise empirical priors than controls — this has been shown in both hallucinating patients with schizophrenia and healthy voice-hearers, using tasks in which learned contexts influence uncertain sensory data(see figure 1; also Cassidy et al).

### Dopaminergic function in the psychosis spectrum: an [18F]-DOPA imaging study in healthy individuals with auditory hallucinations [^113DEizf]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The psychosis phenotype appears to exist in the population as a continuum, but it is not clear if subclinical psychotic symptoms and psychotic disorders share the same neurobiology. We investigated whether the dopaminergic dysfunction seen in psychotic disorders is also present in healthy, well-functioning people with hallucinations.

Methods

We compared dopamine synthesis capacity (using 6-[(18)F]fluoro-L-DOPA [[(18)F]-DOPA] positron emission tomography imaging) in 16 healthy individuals with frequent persistent auditory verbal hallucinations (hallucinating group) with that in 16 matched controls.

Results

There was no significant difference in dopamine synthesis capacity in the striatum, or its functional subdivisions, between groups and no relationship between subclinical psychotic symptom severity or schizotypal traits and dopamine synthesis capacity in the hallucinating group.

Conclusions

Altered dopamine synthesis capacity is unlikely to underlie subclinical hallucinations, suggesting that although there may be a phenomenological psychosis continuum, there are distinctions at the neurobiological level.

### A review of multimodal hallucinations: categorization, assessment, theoretical perspectives, and clinical recommendations [^111NERuV]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Various definitions have been advanced for "hallucinations", but there is general consensus that a hallucination can be defined as a sensory experience that resembles veridical perception without having a corresponding sensory stimulation from the external environment. Hallucinations can occur in all senses, including auditory, visual, olfactory, kinesthetic, and more. Hallucinatory experiences span nosological categoriesand are a clinical manifestation of many psychiatric disorders (schizophreniaand bipolar), neurodegenerative diseases (dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB]), and Parkinson's disease psychosis [PDP]), as well as sensory disorders like hearing impairment or eye disease.

Traditionally, hallucinations are often assumed to occur in one modality at a time (unimodal) and can be associated with different disorders — auditory hallucinations (AHs) in schizophreniaand visual hallucinations (VHs) in DLB. Where hallucinations do occur in different modalities, the predominant understanding is that they occur at different times (ie, they are not fused/simultaneous, like seeing and hearing a talking head; though see). Consequently, clinical assessments have had a focus on single modalities, thus biasing data collection toward unimodal hallucinations in potentially problematic ways. Nevertheless, growing recognition that hallucinations may occur in multiple modalities has shifted the attention to a systematic search for such multimodal phenomena.

Despite the lack of in-depth scrutiny in the field, accounts of hallucinations across all senses can be traced through time. Historical examples include medieval descriptions of spiritual voice hearing, such as those by Margery Kempe, who did not just hear the "voice of God" but also had visions and other sensory experiences. A recent case studyshows the experience of Mr T. A. a patient with schizophrenia who saw and heard humanoid creatures associated with a foul smell and who could go through his body, causing him unpleasant coenesthetic sensations (disorder of bodily perception). Such examples challenge the notion that unimodal hallucinations are the overwhelmingly prevalent clinical manifestations of psychiatric and organic disorders, and highlight the need for more accurate clinical assessment and management.

While hallucinations across multiple senses are starting to attract increasing research interest, several outstanding questions need to be addressed. This review, therefore, focuses on "multimodal hallucinations" (MMHs), ie, hallucinations that co-occur in different modalities, either in a simultaneous or in a sequential (serial) manner, with the overall objective of providing an overview of the field, highlight areas that require further scrutiny and identify issues of potential clinical importance.

### Reduced neural connectivity in the caudate anterior head predicts hallucination severity in schizophrenia [^111MosC4]. Schizophrenia Research (2023). Medium credibility.

The caudate is one region that is thought to be an integral component that mediates the self-prediction mechanisms underlying agency. The caudate is rich in dopaminergic innervations, that are necessary for modulating this self-prediction ability to enable individuals to make reliable predictions about the expected outcome of one's own actions. In this sense, the caudate is thought to play a fundamental role in the emergence of self-agency, that results from a minimal prediction error between the predicted sensory consequence of a self-generated action and the actual outcome. In SZ however, the caudate is considered to be one critical region, whose aberrant functional connectivity with other critical sensory gating regions, such as the thalamus, is thought to result in an impaired sense of agency, and the trigger of hallucinations. For example, the dopamine hypothesis in SZ advocates that abnormal DA densities in the caudate observed in postmortem studies leads to impairments in information-gating, resulting in more permissive lax gating that may lead to an overflow of 'noisier' irrelevant information from internal sources during inner speech, making it more difficult for SZ to make reliable self-predictions about the expected outcome of one's own actions, in order to generate self-agency judgments.

One powerful way to understand whether a given anatomical region causally underlies a specific brain function or symptom (e.g. psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations) is to examine lesion studies. While psychotic symptoms following brain lesions are rare, prior case reports have provided evidence of patients without previous psychiatric disorders who developed psychotic symptoms following caudate infarction. These studies revealed that the caudate abnormalities represent a critical neural correlate underlying the pathogenesis of hallucinations. Together, these studies provide transdiagnostic convergent evidence across distinct lesion, postmortem, neuroimaging, molecular PET imaging and neuromodulation studies for the role of the caudate in the gating of auditory phantom hallucinations. In light of these prior convergent findings, here, for the first time, we tested the hypothesis as to whether functional connectivity abnormalities in distinct caudate subdivisions implicated in sensory gating and auditory phantom percepts in tinnitus which are currently being localized for neuromodulation targeting at the individual level using deep brain stimulation trials, would be associated with auditory phantom hallucination severity in SZ.

### MR and genetics in schizophrenia: focus on auditory hallucinations [^117RV5Bz]. European Journal of Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Although many structural and functional abnormalities have been related to schizophrenia, until now, no single biological marker has been of diagnostic clinical utility. One way to obtain more valid findings is to focus on the symptoms instead of the syndrome. Auditory hallucinations (AHs) are one of the most frequent and reliable symptoms of psychosis. We present a review of our main findings, using a multidisciplinary approach, on auditory hallucinations. Firstly, by applying a new auditory emotional paradigm specific for psychosis, we found an enhanced activation of limbic and frontal brain areas in response to emotional words in these patients. Secondly, in a voxel-based morphometric study, we obtained a significant decreased gray matter concentration in the insula (bilateral), superior temporal gyrus (bilateral), and amygdala (left) in patients compared to healthy subjects. This gray matter loss was directly related to the intensity of AH. Thirdly, using a new method for looking at areas of coincidence between gray matter loss and functional activation, large coinciding brain clusters were found in the left and right middle temporal and superior temporal gyri. Finally, we summarized our main findings from our studies of the molecular genetics of auditory hallucinations. Taking these data together, an integrative model to explain the neurobiological basis of this psychotic symptom is presented.

Management and Treatment Approaches

Current guidelines and treatment recommendations are largely based on expert consensus. The focus is typically on the overall management of a specific clinical condition, with hallucinations one of the symptoms covered, eg, NICE Guidelines for Parkinson's disease. To date, few guidelines have focused on hallucinations specifically (eg,) and the forthcoming SHAPED (Study of Hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, Eye disease, and Dementia) consensus guidelines will be the first to focus on visual hallucinations in older adults.

All guidelines for hallucinations take the view that different treatments for hallucinations are required at different disease or hallucination stages and that experiencing hallucinations may not, in itself, require a specific treatment beyond general measures (eg, education, reassurance, physical, and medication review). For example, the SHAPED guidelines suggest including a review of cognitive and ophthalmological health, given that these may be masked by other conditions: ie, cognitive impairment may be missed in a patient with eye disease with their decline in functional ability attributed to visual loss. Early provision of information about the risk of hallucinations is emphasized as a way of reducing stigma and for healthcare professionals to routinely ask about hallucinations — to shift the onus of reporting hallucinations away from the patient. The point at which specific pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for hallucinations are required is not clearly defined in guidelines but based on clinical judgment.

Differential Diagnosis

Before commencing treatment, it must be clear that hallucinations are causing distress, ie, that there is a need for treatment. If this is the case, the second point of attention is whether it is indeed hallucinations. Especially in older adults with cognitive dysfunction, it can be difficult to disentangle hallucinations from obsessions, misperceptions/misunderstandings (ie, illusions), or involuntary mental imagery, such as the so-called "earworms" (ie, songs in the mind that continually repeat).

### Five year follow-up of non-psychotic adults with frequent auditory verbal hallucinations: are they still healthy? [^112WExz5]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Previously, we described 103 adults (mean age 41 years) who experienced frequent, auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH), in the absence of a need for mental healthcare. Importantly, these adults were largely past the peak incidence age for psychosis (15–35 years). It is unclear if these older individuals with AVH are still at increased risk for psychosis or other psychopathology. To address this question, we conducted a 5-year follow-up of previously included individuals (103 with AVH, 60 controls).

Method

Eighty-one adults with AVH (78.6%) and forty-nine controls (81.7%) could be contacted and were willing to participate. Participants were screened for psychosis and a need for mental healthcare at follow-up using the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History interview (CASH). Need for mental healthcare was defined as a clinical diagnosis as identified using the CASH and/or treatment by a mental healthcare specialist. Phenomenology of AVH was assessed with the PSYRATS Auditory Hallucinations Rating Scale.

Results

Five individuals with AVH (6.2%) had developed psychosis and 32 (39.5%) had developed a need for mental healthcare. Voice-related distress at baseline significantly predicted need for mental healthcare. AVH persisted in most individuals (86.4%), without significant changes in phenomenology. None of the controls had developed psychotic symptoms, and need for mental healthcare (n = 6, 12.2%) was significantly lower in this group.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that frequent AVH in non-psychotic adults past the peak incidence age for psychosis constitute a rather static symptom and that individuals with AVH may be best viewed as situated on a need for care continuum.

Psychosis: a consequence of network dysfunction

Psychosis is a condition that features a range of behavioural alterations that relate to a loss of contact with reality and a loss of insight. People with psychosis experience hallucinations (primarily auditory in schizophrenia) and delusions. In schizophrenia, auditory hallucinations have been associated with altered connectivity between the hippocampus and thalamus. During hallucinations, increased activation of the thalamus, striatum and hippocampus have also been observed. Thus, altered thalamocortical connectivity, especially with the hippocampus, may impede internal/external representations of auditory processing. In contrast, delusions in people with schizophrenia have been associated with overactivation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and diminished deactivation of striatal and thalamic networks. Thus, the complexity of psychotic symptoms is congruent with the highly connected nature of implicated brain regions.

Although we still know little about the underlying neurobiology of psychosis, focal brain lesions allow for a better understanding of the networks involved without the confounds of medication and unrelated neuropathology. Generally speaking, lesions that induce hallucinations are often in the brain networks associated with the stimulus of the hallucination (i.e. auditory, visual or somatosensory). Visual hallucinations have been associated with dysfunction of the occipital lobe, striatum and thalamus, whereas auditory hallucinations are associated with dysfunction of the temporal lobe, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. Insight is generally maintained after focal brain lesions that produce hallucinations and subcortical dopamine function is normal, unlike what is observed in schizophrenia. In contrast, a loss of insight (which can manifest as delusionary beliefs) is associated with alterations in cortico-striatal networks. For example, people with basal ganglia or caudate lesions can present with both hallucinations and delusions. Furthermore, a case study of religious delusions in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy was associated with overactivity of the PFC, and there are multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the PFC is integral for delusionary beliefs. Therefore, while impairing networks specific to certain sensory modalities can lead to hallucinations, dysfunctional integration of PFC input to the associative striatum may be especially important for delusional symptoms in schizophrenia.

### Hallucinations in parkinson disease [^113bnmpL]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2009). Medium credibility.

Patients with Parkinson disease (PD) can experience hallucinations (spontaneous aberrant perceptions) and illusions (misinterpretations of real perceptual stimuli). Of such phenomena, visual hallucinations (VHs) and illusions are the most frequently encountered, although auditory, olfactory and tactile hallucinations can also occur. In cross-sectional studies, VHs occur in approximately one-third of patients, but up to three-quarters of patients might develop VHs during a 20-year period. Hallucinations can have substantial psychosocial effects and, historically, were the main reason for placing patients in nursing homes. Concomitant or overlapping mechanisms are probably active during VHs, and these include the following: central dopaminergic overactivity and an imbalance with cholinergic neurotransmission; dysfunction of the visual pathways, including specific PD-associated retinopathy and functional alterations of the extrastriate visual pathways; alterations of brainstem sleep-wake and dream regulation; and impaired attentional focus. Possible treatments include patient-initiated coping strategies, a reduction of antiparkinson medications, atypical neuroleptics and, potentially, cholinesterase inhibitors. Evidence-based studies, however, only support the use of one atypical neuroleptic, clozapine, and only in patients without dementia. Better phenomenological discrimination, combined with neuroimaging tools, should refine therapeutic options and improve prognosis. The aim of this Review is to present epidemiological, phenomenological, pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects of hallucinations in PD.

### An approach to the nature of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia… [^115Jky2R]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Although the symptom of auditory hallucinations is variegated, it is assumed that there are common characteristics to its form and structure, which if understood would considerably enrich our knowledge of the psychopathology of schizophrenia. With this view in mind, I wish to summarize and discuss an intensive and systematic phenomenological investigation of auditory hallucinations. This study has been presented elsewhere in more detail from the point of view of its implications for psychoanalytic theory. 9 Here observations that might help to clarify the meaning of hallucinations as a symptom of schizophrenia are described. There is a parallelism between the psychoanalytic concept of hallucinations in schizophrenia as formulated by Freud3 and the viewpoint of clinical psychiatry as expressed chiefly by Bleuler. 2 Both of these men viewed auditory hallucinations as a secondary symptom, that is, a symptom that resulted from and as a MODELL AH.

### Auditory elementary hallucinations in alcohol withdrawal psychosis… [^114MP1ru]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Bleuler, in 1924, 1 wrote of delirium tremens. "one. observes elementary hallucinations, especially in the form of reports and shots, but also buzzing, roaring, hissing, etc. " Of alcoholic hallucinosis he said, ". especially in the beginning one seldom fails to note sounds, such a buzzing, snapping of gun triggers, striking of rifle bullets, cracking, and sounds of horses' hoofs". By the term "elementary hallucinations" in the acoustic field he means "the simple noises such as murmurs, knocks, and shooting. " It has been generally held that there is no basic difference between elementary and formed hallucinations2, 3 and that the former evolve into the latter as the psychosis unfolds. 3 Gross and his co-workers, 4, 5 in the first systematic studies of the buzzing, humming, and similar noises often experienced in acute alcohol withdrawal psychoses, concluded that these phenomena are not hallucinations but examples of.

### Relationship of imprecise corollary discharge in schizophrenia to auditory hallucinations… [^113pzkDK]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

This results in suppression of auditory cortex to the self-produced sound, as can be seen by a reduced N100 amplitude. When the actual feedback does not match the predicted feedback, the discrepancy increases and so does the likelihood that the sound is externally produced. As a result, the cortical suppression decreases and the N100 amplitude increases. Such a system would allow the individual to cancel out the effects of self-produced speech and thereby distinguish sounds due to self-produced speech from auditory feedback caused by the environment. Support for such forward models comes from animal electrophysiologic studies of the auditory system: corollary discharges from motor speech commands prepare auditory cortex for self-generated speech, linking regions of frontal lobes where speech is generated to regions of temporal lobes where it is heard.

Early evidence of the effect of vocal production on attenuation of auditory responses came from studies of bats and monkeys. In bats, a 15-dB attenuation of responses in the lateral lemniscus of midbrain is seen during vocalization. 6, 7 Similarly, in monkeys, activity in the auditory cortex is inhibited during vocalizations. 8, 9. Similarly, when voice feedback was pitch-shifted during speaking37 or substituted by an alien voice, 38 delusional patients attributed the voice to external sources. Although all patients made more errors than controls, hallucinators were particularly prone to misattribute their distorted voice to an external source, which the authors interpreted as reflecting impaired awareness of internally generated verbal material. The mean sound pressure level of the subject's utterances was 76 dB measured 5 cm from the subject's mouths.

During both the speaking and listening tasks, mean sound pressure level of speech sounds played back over the headphones was increased 15 dB over the average sound pressure level of the subject's speech. This was necessary to mask the effect of bone conduction during vocalization. The 2 patient groups differed significantly in their responses to their own pitch-shifted voice and the feedback of the unaltered alien voice. In both conditions, hallucinators made more misattribution errors than the nonhallucinators, ie, hallucinators responded by pushing the "other" button when their own voice was distorted and the "self" button in the alien, unaltered condition.

### Schizophrenia… [^112pBzWw]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of people worldwide. People with schizophrenia often have hallucinations, which are false perceptions that occur when a stimulus is not actually present. Types of hallucinations include auditory, visual, and tactile hallucinations. Auditory hallucinations are the most common and may be experienced as hearing people talking. Auditory hallucinations can be stressful to the person experiencing them. For example, the voices may cause difficulty with concentration, they may insult the person experiencing them, or they may tell the person to do something that the person does not want to do. Delusions are another common symptom of schizophrenia. Delusions are false beliefs that are held even though there is evidence that they are not true.

Like hallucinations, delusions have the potential to be quite distressing to the person experiencing them. One type of delusion is a paranoid delusion, in which a person believes that they are being persecuted. For example, the person may believe that someone is attempting to stalk or poison them. Other symptoms of schizophrenia include disorganized speech, poor hygiene, decreased motivation, difficulty expressing emotions, and decreased interest in socializing with friends and family. Cognitive symptoms, such as those that interfere with working memory, frequently cause disability. People with schizophrenia can experience symptoms of mania, depression, or anxiety. Additionally, people with schizophrenia may have problems with using illicit drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes. Symptoms associated with other psychiatric disorders as well as use of illicit substances tend to worsen schizophrenia.

Causes, Diagnosis, and Treatment Environmental and genetic factors play a role in the development of schizophrenia. A doctor diagnoses schizophrenia by interviewing and observing the patient and by obtaining information about the patient's current and past symptoms. Because patients with schizophrenia sometimes struggle to describe their symptoms, obtaining information from family and friends is often essential. The doctor may prescribe an antipsychotic medication. Antipsychotic medications are particularly helpful in decreasing hallucinations and delusions. Potential side effects include restlessness, muscle spasms, abnormal movements, and weight gain. If a patient experiences unwanted side effects, the doctor may change the medication, adjust the dosage, or add another medication to control the symptoms. Because many patients have poor adherence to oral medication, injections that last for multiple weeks are often recommended to patients to avoid relapse.

### Repetitive TMS for auditory verbal hallucinations in schizophrenia… [^111huDxo]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The findings of this study indicate that imaging-navigated rTMS is an effective and safe treatment for AVH in patients with schizophrenia. Importance Auditory verbal hallucinations are a common symptom of schizophrenia, increasing the patient's risks of suicide and violence. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation is a potential treatment for AVH. Auditory verbal hallucinations, generally defined as hearing nonexistent spoken voices, are a typical symptom of schizophrenia. 1 Approximately 70% to 80% of patients with schizophrenia have AVH at initial presentation, 2, 3 and of these, 25% to 30% of AVH are nonresponsive to antipsychotic medications. 4 The persistence of AVH can significantly diminish the quality of life5 and elevate the risk of suicide6 and violence. 7 Consequently, effective alternative therapies are urgently needed to treat AVH in patients with schizophrenia.

Sham treatments were delivered with the same rTMS protocol using a sham coil that was identical in appearance to the real one. The only difference was that the sham coil generated only sound and sensations on the scalp similar to those of the real coil but no current, which prevented patients from identifying the rTMS group. One was the TPJ. The other was the dorsal prefrontal cortex, which was confirmed by another clinical trial. 48 Future studies may adopt the precise locations of the TPJ and DLPFC in these studies13, 48 and perform dual-site trials to enhance clinical efficacy. This phenomenon has also been found in a transcranial direct-current stimulation study. 49 Second, this stimulation protocol designed for AVH also modulated the neural correlates of other schizophrenia symptoms because the left TPJ is a hub region of AVH and also a part of the schizophrenia network.

47 The high connectivity between the TPJ and prefrontal cortex may also mediate the modulation effect to the DLPFC hub regions of negative symptoms. 50, 51 However, the reduction in PANSS scores in the active group was below the minimum clinically meaningful difference.
52. In this randomized clinical trial, imaging-navigated rTMS on the TPJ significantly alleviated the AVH in patients with schizophrenia compared with sham treatment. The rTMS protocol was also effective for positive and negative symptoms. Future studies should consider the role of individual e-fields in individualized sym.
