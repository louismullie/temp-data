## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to find the legs of a right triangle given that a point on the hypotenuse equidistant from both legs divides the hypotenuse into segments of 30 and 40. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometric meaning of a point on the hypotenuse that is equidistant from both legs. Then, I should verify how that constrains the triangle's angles and side lengths. Next, I will set up variables and equations based on similar triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. After that, I need to solve the system algebraically. Finally, I will double-check the solution and consider whether any alternative interpretations could change the answer.

> Let me first confirm the geometric setup. A point on the hypotenuse that is equidistant from both legs must lie on the angle bisector of the right angle, because the angle bisector is the locus of points equidistant from the two sides of the angle. In a right triangle, the incenter lies on the angle bisector, and the point described is precisely where the angle bisector meets the hypotenuse, so it divides the hypotenuse in a ratio related to the adjacent sides by the angle bisector theorem [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the angle bisector theorem in this context. The angle bisector of the right angle divides the hypotenuse into segments proportional to the adjacent legs. If the legs are a and b, then the segments are in the ratio a: b. Here the segments are 30 and 40, so the ratio a: b equals 30: 40, which simplifies to 3: 4. Thus, I can write a = 3k and b = 4k for some positive constant k, and the hypotenuse c = 30 + 40 = 70 [^notfound].

> I will now examine the Pythagorean constraint. By the Pythagorean theorem, a² + b² = c², so substituting a = 3k, b = 4k, and c = 70 gives (3k)² + (4k)² = 70². That simplifies to 9k² + 16k² = 4900, so 25k² = 4900, and therefore k² = 196, which means k = 14. I should double-check that arithmetic: 25 × 196 = 4900, yes, that's correct [^notfound].

> Next, I should review the leg lengths. With k = 14, the legs are a = 3 × 14 = 42 and b = 4 × 14 = 56. Let me verify the hypotenuse: 42² + 56² = 1764 + 3136 = 4900, and √4900 = 70, which matches the given hypotenuse segments 30 + 40 = 70, so the solution is internally consistent [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniqueness. Could there be another right triangle where a point equidistant from the legs divides the hypotenuse into 30 and 40 but the legs are not in a 3:4 ratio? I need to ensure that the equidistant condition truly forces the point to be on the angle bisector, which it does, and that the angle bisector theorem uniquely determines the ratio of legs from the segment ratio, which it also does. Therefore, the legs must be 42 and 56, and no other pair satisfies both conditions simultaneously [^notfound].

> Final answer: The legs of the right triangle are 42 and 56.

---

The point on the hypotenuse equidistant from both legs is the **incenter** of the right triangle, and it divides the hypotenuse in the ratio of the legs. Given segments of 30 and 40, the ratio is 3:4, so the legs are 3x and 4x. Using the Pythagorean theorem, (3x)² + (4x)² = 70², which gives x = 14. Therefore, the legs are **42 and 56**.

---

## Geometric interpretation

In a right triangle, the point on the hypotenuse equidistant from both legs is the **incenter** — the intersection of the angle bisectors and the center of the incircle. The incenter divides the hypotenuse in the ratio of the adjacent legs; this is a direct consequence of the angle bisector theorem [^notfound].

---

## Application of the angle bisector theorem

The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of a triangle divides the opposite side into two segments proportional to the adjacent sides. In a right triangle, the incenter lies on the hypotenuse and divides it into segments proportional to the legs. Given segments of 30 and 40, the ratio is **3:4**, so the legs are in the ratio 3:4.

---

## Setting up the equation

Let the legs be 3x and 4x. By the Pythagorean theorem:

(3x)² + (4x)² = 70²

9x² + 16x² = 4900

25x² = 4900

x² = 196

x = 14

---

## Calculating the leg lengths

Substitute x = 14 to find the legs:

- **Shorter leg**: 3x = 3 × 14 = **42**
- **Longer leg**: 4x = 4 × 14 = **56**

---

## Verification

Check the solution with the Pythagorean theorem:

42² + 56² = 1764 + 3136 = 4900 = 70²

The calculation is correct, confirming the legs are **42 and 56**.

---

## Conclusion

The legs of the right triangle are **42 and 56**.

### Ultrasound-guided vessel puncture: calling for pythagoras' help [^613bb44a]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

The properties of the isosceles right triangle are of interest for the critical care physician teaching fellows for their first venous catheterizations. First, we can determine the needle insertion length required to reach the vein. According to this technique, the needle trajectory from the skin to the vessel corresponds to the hypotenuse of the triangle. For example, if the length ɭ is 2 cm, the needle will have to be inserted 2.8 cm (2 × 1.4) before it reaches the vein. This might help to check whether the needle length is sufficient, in particular for obese patients. Second, we can predict the position of the needle tip in the vein. Taking a distance between the probe and the needle insertion point equal to the depth of the vessel, a probe perpendicular to the skin, and an angle between the skin and the needle of 45°, the third angle will be automatically positioned into the vein. A needle following the hypotenuse of this triangle should reach the center of the vein and make the puncture successful. Third, experts consider that an ideal needle/skin angulation is between 30 and 45°. If the vessel runs parallel to the skin interface, the needle–vessel angulation equals the skin–needle angulation: 45°. This limited angulation of the needle limits the risk of transfixiant puncture but also the risk of kinking of the guidewire during the subsequent dilation procedure.

### Ultrasound-guided vessel puncture: calling for pythagoras' help [^209ec7ce]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Vascular access is routinely performed by critical care physicians and the use of ultrasonography is recommended. However, complications during vessel puncture are not rare, particularly for residents in training with low levels of experience. Reminding about the properties of the isosceles right triangle might be of interest to teach young fellows a secure step by step technique for vessel catheterization.

An isosceles right triangle has two equal legs and has angles of 90°, 45° and 45°. For two equal legs having the length ɭ, the hypotenuse has a length corresponding to ɭ × √2. This last number, also called Pythagoras' constant, corresponds approximately to 1.4. After a longitudinal scan of the vein run, let's insert the needle in the skin, just over the vein (Fig. 1a). Let's position the probe perpendicular to the skin, just over the vein, at a length ɭ of the needle insertion point equal to the depth of the vein under the probe. Three points build an isosceles right triangle: the needle insertion point, the middle of the probe on the skin interface, and the center of the vein under the probe.

Three points build an isosceles right triangle: the needle insertion point, the middle of the probe on the skin interface, and the center of the vein under the probe. b The long-axis plane, which passes through the length of the vessel, corresponds to the view obtained in the in-plane technique with the vessel in the long-axis. Three points determine the long-axis plane: the needle insertion point, identified by inserting the needle in the skin just above the vessel, the vessel being viewed in the long axis; the middle of the probe on the skin, the vessel being visualized at the center of the ultrasound screen in the short axis; the middle of the probe's top, the probe being perpendicular to the skin. The operator should attempt to maintain the syringe in the axis of the probe top (dotted line)

### Early sagittal shape of the spine predicts scoliosis development in a syndromic (22q11.2DS) population: a prospective longitudinal study [^92f468b4]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

In this study, the posteriorly inclined segment in the sagittal profile of the spine was hypothesized to be a risk factor for scoliosis development. In order to study this hypothesis, the length and tilt angle of the posteriorly inclined segment were analyzed on sagittal standing full-spine radiographs that were made before the onset of scoliosis. To capture both the length and the tilt angle, we developed the concept of the "posteriorly inclined triangle" (PIT) (Fig. 1). This triangle can have different shapes depending on the length and inclination of the hypotenuse, but its surface area is an expression of the overall magnitude of the posteriorly directed, destabilizing vectors. This concept was first explored in a pilot study that included sample size calculations that we used in the current study. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the sagittal shape of the spine before the onset of scoliosis can predict later scoliosis development in the population of patients with 22q11.2DS. We hypothesized that the children who ultimately develop scoliosis have more posteriorly directed, destabilizing vectors acting on their spine, as expressed by a larger PIT area. In addition, we expected that the shape of the initial triangle (the inclination of the hypotenuse) determines which vertebrae are at risk for rotating into scoliosis, and is thus related to the ultimate type of scoliotic curve that develops.

Right: The analysis of the lateral radiograph with use of Surgimap software. The vertebral body end plates and femoral heads were semiautomatically segmented. The PIT (bright green) was automatically generated between the centroids of the most cranial and caudal posteriorly inclined vertebrae, which had also been automatically generated, and its area was measured.

The PIT

All of the radiographic measurements were performed with Surgimap imaging software (version 2.3.2.1; Nemaris), which has been validated for measuring spinopelvic parameters. A single trained observer blinded to the outcome analyzed the freestanding lateral full-spine radiographs, which had been made in a standardized manner, of every patient at inclusion. At that time, all of the patients were skeletally immature, and those with scoliosis on the coronal radiograph were excluded. First, the observer utilized Surgimap's Spinal Wizard software to segment both femoral heads and all vertebral body end plates; manual adjustments were made where necessary (Fig. 1). Second, the software automatically calculated the inclination of each vertebral body based on the upper end plate in the sagittal plane, and the centroids of the most cranial and most caudal posteriorly inclined vertebrae were annotated. Third, the right-angled triangle between these 2 points and the vertical was drawn, and 3 parameters were determined: (1) the PIT area was calculated with the basic formula formula for the area of a triangle, 0.5 × width × height, (2) the PIT length was calculated as the length of the hypotenuse, and (3) the PIT inclination was calculated as the angle between the hypotenuse and the vertical (Fig. 1). Finally, the pelvic incidenceand the length of the spine from T1 to S1 were measured, also in the sagittal plane, using the same Surgimap software. The T1-S1 spinal length was used to normalize the PIT area to account for absolute body size. This was done by calculating the ratio between the T1-S1 length of each patient and the study's population mean, with no distinction between sexes since the T1-S1 length was not significantly different between boys and girls. Using this ratio allowed the PIT area and the PIT length to be normalized for the patient's size but still retain their physical units (cm and cm²).

### Optic nerve head changes after intraocular pressure-lowering glaucoma surgeries using optical coherence tomography [^38998881]. Journal of Glaucoma (2023). Medium credibility.

Prcis

Optic nerve head (ONH) changes were detected with swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) after intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering glaucoma surgeries.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to detect changes in the ONH with SS-OCT after IOP-lowering procedures.

Patients and Methods

Patients with progressing glaucoma who were referred for IOP-lowering procedures were included. The participants underwent a 24–2 visual field test and SS-OCT (DRI OCT Triton Plus; Topcon). IOP and SS-OCT scans were obtained during the preoperative period and up to 7 days and 30–90 days postoperatively. ONH parameters were measured with a B -scan at the center of the optic disc and an average of 5 central B -scans. The hypotenuse of the ONH cup (HOC) was calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: hypotenuse² = leg1² + leg2², considering the length and depth of the cup as the legs of a right triangle. We also evaluated changes in Bruch membrane opening (BMO)-to-BMO diameter. Statistical analysis was performed using generalized estimating equations.

Results

A total of 15 eyes were included. The mean patient age was 70 (SD, 11.04) years. The mean circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer was 60.13 (SD, 23.21) µm and the visual field mean deviation was -13.29 (SD, 8.5) dB. The mean IOP at each visit was: 20.5 (SD, 4.99); 11 (SD, 4.95), and 15.7 (SD, 5.04), respectively. The mean HOC, the mean depth and length of the ONH cup, and the BMO-to-BMO diameter decreased significantly after the IOP-lowering procedures.

Conclusions

The HOC evaluated with SS-OCT significantly decreased after IOP-lowering surgeries. This parameter was useful for evaluating short-term changes in the ONH.

### Trigonometry in daily ultrasound practice [^c806ac21]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We have read with interest the editorial by Piton et al. regarding application of Pythagoras' theorem in central venous cannulation. Geometry is at the base of our daily life and we should apply his theorems and axioms to obtain the best result in our daily practice.

We believe that trigonometry is another important branch of geometry in addition to Pythagoras' theorem that has to be taken into consideration while performing invasive procedures under ultrasound guidance. Sine, cosine and tangent are the basis of trigonometry, they represent the ratio between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Sin(α) is the ratio between side B and the hypotenuse (H) (Fig. 1), Cos(α) is the ratio between side A and the hypotenuse (H), and Tan(α) is the ratio between side B and side A. It is important to note that, for a given angle α, the ratio between the sides is unconnected from the triangle size.

Fig. 1
Internal jugular vein ultrasound anatomy. H hypotenuse; A and B are catheti of the triangle

As already stated by Piton, in our ultrasound daily practice, we constantly build right-angled triangles: the hypotenuse is the needle route, side A is the distance measured on the skin between needle insertion point and target projection on the skin, and side B is the depth of the target.

Side B is determined by the patient's anatomy and the operator cannot modify it. As reported by Schulman et al. needle/skin angulation between 30° and 45° is considered to be ideal while performing ultrasound procedure.

Trigonometry is helpful in determining which targets can be reached with such needle angulation. At 45° angulation tan(α) is equal to 1, meaning that side A and side B have to be equal. For example, if our target jugular internal vein is 2 cm deep, the needle has to be inserted 2 cm from the target. Generalizing, we have a good needle visualization whenever Tan(α) ≤ 1 with side B equal to or shorter than side A.

In conclusion, physicians have to take into account target depth while choosing the ultrasound linear probe of appropriate size to be able to visualize all needle routes and the needle skin entrance site.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 203: chronic hypertension in pregnancy [^a557ede0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Blood pressure measurement technique in pregnancy should document diagnostic levels on repeat readings only after proper preparation: the patient has rested preferably for 10 minutes or more, is seated with legs uncrossed and back supported, and has had no caffeine or tobacco for at least 30 minutes; an appropriate-sized cuff with length 1.5 times the upper arm circumference or a bladder encircling at least 80% of the arm and width at least 40% of arm circumference should be used at heart level; cuff size should match arm circumference (22–26 cm: 12 × 22 cm small adult; 27–34 cm: 16 × 30 cm adult; 35–44 cm: 16 × 36 cm large adult; 45–52 cm: 16 × 42 cm adult thigh); if recumbent, place the patient in left lateral decubitus with the cuff at the level of the right atrium; small cuffs and unsupported posture can overestimate blood pressure, and repeat assessment using the best methods is advisable.

### Analysis of the thigh aesthetic profiles: one of physical ideal body proportions [^6091ca24]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Subject

The BMI was classified as BMI 18.5–24.99 in 79%, BMI 25–29.99 in 17%, BMI 30–39.99 in 4% frequency, and BMI > 40 in 0%. Half (50%) of the participants in the overweight group consumed vegetables 4–6 times a week, while 52% consumed white meat less than once a week. Vegetable consumption of participants with normal BMI was found that 60 participants consumed vegetables 4–6 times a week and 60 participants consumed vegetables 1–3 times a week (Fig. 8). According to the answers obtained from the survey questions, 45% of the participants were regularly involved in sports (fitness and football) for at least 6 months or more.

Thigh Measurements

The quantitative analysis of anterior, lateral, and posterior views of thighs, using designated reference points, is delineated in Tables 1–3 and Figs. 7 and 9.

Fig. 9
Differences in ratios right and left legs in various thigh types, as represented by frequency. VLT/TW1: Vertical length of thigh/upper transvers width of thigh, VLT/TW2: Vertical length of thigh/1/3 upper transvers width of thigh, VLT/TW3: Vertical length of thigh 1/3 lower transvers width of thigh, VLT/TW4: Vertical length of thigh/lower transvers width of thigh

The VTL/TW1, VTL/TW2, VTL/TW3, and VTL/TW4 values were computed. For all ratios, the most common type of Type 3 was on the right side and Type 2 on the left side. The most effective types have been identified as Types 2, 3, and 4 (Table 2). Regarding the VLT/TW2 ratio, Type 4 was the most common on both sides. According to the results of the VLT/TW3 ratio, Type 3 was the most prevalent. Finally, when examining VLT/TW4, Type 2 was found to be the most observed type on both sides (Table 2 and Figs. 7 and 9).

### Relationship between sacral-abdominal wall distance, movement performance, and spinal alignment in osteoporosis: a retrospective study [^defc88c6]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Hand grip strength

Grip strength was measured using a Smedley hand dynamometer (MY-2080; Matsumiya Medical Seiki Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Measurements were performed by a state-licensed physical or occupational therapist. Grip strength was measured three times in a sitting position, based on previous studies. The median value of the three measurements was used as the left and right grip strength, and the better-performing value between the left and right was used as the grip strength.

Open-eyed one-leg standing time

The time to stand with one leg was measured by raising one leg to a height of 10 cm for a maximum of 15 s with the eyes open and both hands placed on the waist. The participants were instructed beforehand not to let the raised leg touch the axial leg. If the axis leg moved, the raised leg touched the floor, or the arm moved away from the waist, the time until that point was recorded as the end of the test. The higher value between the left and right leg was used.

Standing up

The participants were placed on 10-, 20-, 30-, and 40-cm high wooden platforms and examined based by their ability to stand up without recoil from a sitting position with their hands folded. Because the ability to stand up from a 20-cm platform with both feet is divided into locomotion level 1 and locomotion level 2, standing up from a 20-cm platform was investigated separately.

Two steps

The starting line was set, the toes of both feet were placed together, the subject took two steps as large as possible, and the stride length of the two steps with both feet together (from the line where they first stood to the toe of the landing point) was measured. If the patients lost balance, they were instructed to start over; two measurements were taken and the better record was used.

As in the previous study, the distance (m) of the two large steps from rest was measured by dividing the distance (m) by the height (m).

3-m timed up and go test

In this TUG test, participants seated in a chair, got up from the chair at the start signal, walked around a pole 3 m away, and the time it took them to sit in the chair again was measured. Participants were instructed to walk faster than their normal walking speed.

### Ultrasound evaluation of a new surface reference line to describe sural nerve location and safe zones to consider in posterior leg approaches [^6c2eebf6]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2023). Medium credibility.

Material and methods

This cross-sectional analytical observational study has the approval of the ethics committee of the Hospital Clinic Barcelona (HCB/2022/0228) and all participants provided informed consent. Patients over 18 years of age who underwent ambulatory non-traumatic foot surgery with regional anesthesia between January and April 2022, with normal neurovascular and soft tissues of the leg were included. Patients with previous surgeries, wounds, or scars in the posterior area of the leg and those with a history of peripheral neuropathy were exclued. A demographic characterization of the enrolled patients was carried out, considering age, gender, lower extremity length, weight, height, BMI and laterality of the lower extremity. For every patient, the distal half of the two legs was analyzed, considering the SN runs as a single nerve and evaluating five points that generate 4 zones of equal size. This way, we studied reproducible areas based on simple anatomical proportions for each patient. Reference points, laterality and the crossing zone of the SN in relation to the surface reference line were described, as well as safe areas, such as those in which the SN does not intersect and has a path that moves away from the reference line. Analysis of the concordance of the distances to points 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the SN, between the left and right leg, and differences between both legs were evaluated.

Assessment of the sural nerve path

Prone position, keeping the feet off the edge of the examination table to avoid plantar flexion of the ankle. To facilitate localization of proximal anatomical landmarks, the knees were semi flexed (30 degrees approximately) before resting the leg on the examination table.

For the superficial anatomical assessment, a straight line was drawn by the principal author between two anatomical landmarks. The line went from a point between the medial aspect of the medial condyle and the postero-lateral aspect of the medial hamstring tendon to the most distal and posterior aspect of the lateral malleolus (Fig. 1). A straight line was drawn using a 2 mm rope as a guide to join the proximal and distal anatomical references. The line was measured and divided into two segments of equal length, the distal segment was further divided into four sections which were identified by points 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 (distal to proximal). These points subsequently delimited four equal quarters of the distal half of the leg, which were classified as zones A, B, C and D (distal to proximal) (Fig. 1).

### Apoprotein B, small-dense LDL and impaired HDL remodeling is associated with larger plaque burden and more noncalcified plaque as assessed by coronary CT angiography and intravascular ultrasound with radiofrequency backscatter: results from the Atlanta I study [^43842dc5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

CTA Image Analysis

Selected for image analysis in each patient was a target vessel segment that contained the preidentified intermediate coronary artery lesion (40% to 70% luminal stenosis) in the preenrollment CTA or x‐ray angiography examination, as previously described. Starting and termination points of the target segment were precisely defined on the basis of a modified 13‐segment coronary arterial model using distinguishable vessel ostia and branch points, including the diagonal branches in the left anterior descending artery, the marginal branches in the left circumflex artery, and the right ventricular marginal branches in the right coronary artery. When such branches were not present, the epicardial artery was divided into respective equidistant segments.

Lumen and vessel geometry and composition were quantitatively evaluated in a 3‐dimensional fashion in the target vessel segment using our previously described standardized approach (SurePlaque; Vitrea 4.0; Vital Images). Geometrical parameters measured and calculated included segment length, minimal luminal diameter, minimal luminal area, percent luminal diameter stenosis, and percent luminal area stenosis. Percent luminal diameter stenosis was calculated as (diameter lesion /diameter mean reference)×100, where mean reference was the minimal lumen diameter in the cross‐sectional slices with the preidentified lesion, and was calculated by averaging the luminal diameters of proximal and distal reference slices to correct for vessel tapering. Proximal and distal reference slices were defined as normal slices or the slices with the least amount of discernible plaque in the proximal and distal portions of the segment. Similarly, we defined percent luminal area stenosis as (area lesion /area mean reference)×100, where lesion slice and reference slices were the same as for the percent luminal diameter stenosis calculations.

Within the vessel wall area of the target vessel segment, plaque composition was quantified based on predefined Hounsfield unit (HU) thresholds. Plaque was classified as calcified with a density > 150 HU. Noncalcified plaque (NCP) was divided into 2 categories: NCP with attenuation values < 30 HU were classified as low‐density NCP and NCP with attenuation values in the range of 31 to 150 HU was classified as high‐density NCP. The total volume and the percentage of each plaque component were determined.

### Whole-muscle fat analysis identifies distal muscle end as disease initiation site in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy [^a9f4ba11]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To evaluate intra-muscular fat infiltration quantitatively, we determined the median fat content in five segments along the length of all muscles. For this evaluation, muscles were divided into four groups of increasing overall baseline muscular fat fraction (Fig. 2e–h). The median fat fraction for a given segment depended on its position along the proximo-distal axis. Including all investigated muscles, the estimated distal-to-proximal fat fraction decline was −3.4% (0.4) (estimate [SE]) per segment (p < 0.001). This effect was most prominent for muscles with a mild or moderate fat fraction at baseline (i.e. 10–30% and 30–60%), for which the distal-to-proximal fat fractions declined by −4.0% (0.3) per segment (p < 0.001) and −9.0 (0.6) per segment (p < 0.001), respectively. This distal-to-proximal decrease in fat fraction across each segment was lower for muscles with < 10% fat (−0.7% [0.1] per segment) and for muscles with > 60% fat (−2.2% [0.4] per segment) (p < 0.001).

Longitudinal changes in muscle fat fraction

At the patient level, the longitudinal average increase in a fat fraction over all lower extremity muscles of all FSHD patients during the examination period was 4.7 ± 5.9% (p = 0.043), corresponding to a yearly increase of 1.3 ± 1.6%. The variability between patients was large and ranged from −0.2 to 4.5% per year. The largest progression rate was observed in the upper leg muscles (Table 1).

For individual muscles, the change in overall fat fraction depended highly on their baseline value. Fat infiltration progressed faster in muscles with a baseline fat fraction between 20–30% (p < 0.001), 30–40% (p < 0.001), 40–50% (p = 0.016), and 50–60% (p = 0.048), as compared with muscles with a baseline fat fraction of < 10% (Fig. 3). The largest fat fraction increase per year occurred for muscles with a baseline fat fraction of 30–40% with a rate of 4.9 ± 2.7% per year.

### Increased tortuosity of ACA might be associated with increased risk of ACoA aneurysm development and less aneurysm dome size: a computer-aided analysis [^f3471392]. European Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Sum of angle metrics

Calculation of SOAM begins from the division of curve into the subcurves of equal length. Then, for each subcurve, we calculate supplementary of the angle between lines connecting its center and ends. Angles are summed up and the result is normalized by the length of the entire curve:where φ indicates measured angles and n is its count. For a curve that is straighter, supplementary angles are larger and therefore the entire SOAM is larger. This descriptor is also sensitive to local tortuosity (Fig. 2 b).

Product of angle distance

The PAD is calculated using the below formula:

This descriptor defines global tortuosity which is the combination of deviation from the straight line given by RL and local angles metrics, which is given by the SOAM.

Triangular index

To calculate TI, the curve must be again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is calculated using the below formula:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are the triangle sides, and c is its base. TI is smaller for more straight curves (Fig. 2 c).

Inflection count metrics

Inflection point is a point on a curve where it changes from being concave to being convex, or vice versa. ICM is defined with below formula:where n I is the number of curve's inflection points. That factor is more sensitive to global curvature than RL and is lower for more straight curves (Fig. 2 d).

Additional measurements

For each analyzed segment of ACA, we measured its diameter, which was defined as the shortest distance between the artery edge points in the selected region. In a similar way, we measured the diameter of C7 segment of ICA. We also obtained the length of A1–A3 ACA segments.

Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease — segmental limb pressure interpretation notes that a thigh/brachial index of 1.1 or greater is indicative of normal hemodynamics and an index of less than 0.9 is an indicator of peripheral arterial disease; segmental limb pressures are compared with adjacent ipsilateral segments, the contralateral-paired segment, and the greater of the two brachial systolic pressures, and a reduction of 20 mm Hg or greater is considered a significant gradient either between segments in the same leg or at the same level of the opposite leg.

### Increased tortuosity of basilar artery might be associated with higher risk of aneurysm development [^b21fb957]. European Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

The fourth is triangular index (TI), for which the curve is again divided into equal subcurves. Then, a triangle is built with vertices on each end of the subcurve and in its middle point. TI is defined as:where n is the number of subcurves, a and b are sides of triangles and c is its base. The last of the tortuosity descriptors is the inflexion count metrics (ICM), defined as:where n I represents the number of the curve's inflexion points. All used tortuosity descriptors are all presented in Fig. 1.

Additional measurements

We additionally measured diameters of both P1 segments of posterior cerebral arteries (PCAs) and diameters of both vertebral arteries (VAs) at a distance of 5 mm from the origin of BA. We also measured the diameter of BA in three locations: 2 mm from its origin, 2 mm before its bifurcation and halfway between those two locations. Additionally, we obtained the angle of BA bifurcation and its configuration, introduced by Rashad et al including hands-up, hands-neutral and hands-down configurations, as well as its mixed variants (hands-up/hands-neutral, hands-up/hands-down, hands-neutral/hands-down). Among patients with BA aneurysm, we measured aneurysm dome height and width, as well as its neck size. We also calculated dome-to-neck ratio, defined as aneurysm dome height/neck size.

### Mammalian skull dimensions and the golden ratio (φ) [^70080a04]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Among the 7 species surveyed, only humans had NI/BI and BI/NB ratios that coincided and thus conformed to the Golden Ratio parameters. In humans, the ratio of the nasioiniac arc over the parieto-occipital arc (NI/BI = 1.64 ± 0.04) and the ratio of the parieto-occipital arc over the frontal arc (BI/NB = 1.57 ± 0.10) are essentially identical and closely approximate Φ (1.618) within 1 standard deviation. This finding suggests that bregma, a special point along the nasioiniac arc, divides this arc into 2 unequal segments such that the ratio of the length of the entire arc to that of the longer segment matches the ratio of the arc of the longer segment to that of the shorter segment. By contrast, similar measurements of lambda (another craniometric point on the nasioiniac line that does not correlate with any important brain landmarks in humans) results in a partition of the nasioiniac arc into 0.77/0.23 (3.3) and 1.0/0.77 (1.3) ratios.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of point-of-care ultrasound examinations [^c4f994b8]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Deep vein thrombosis — indications for an ultrasound examination of the lower extremity include but are not limited to swollen lower extremity or extremities, pain or erythema in lower extremities, unexplained hypoxemia, unexplained dyspnea, and suspected pulmonary embolus. Limitations of the point-of-care examination of the lower extremity are body habitus and the inability to identify key anatomic points, and any uncertainty in the examination should prompt a full lower extremity Doppler examination. Specifications for the compression technique of the lower extremity note that the words proximal and distal refer to the relative distance from the attached end of the limb, for example, the proximal femoral vein is closer to the hip and the distal femoral vein is closer to the knee; the longitudinal or long axis is parallel to or along the length of the vein, and the transverse or short axis is perpendicular to the long axis of the vein.

Usual Dosage

Conray may be injected either centrally, into the superior or inferior vena cava, or peripherally into an appropriate arm vein. For central injections, catheters may be introduced at the antecubital fossa into either the basilic or cephalic vein or at the leg into the femoral vein and advanced to the distal segment of the corresponding vena cava. For peripheral injections, the catheter is introduced at the antecubital fossa into the appropriate size arm vein. In order to reduce the potential for extravasation during peripheral injection, a catheter of approximately 20 cm in length should be employed.

Depending on the area to be imaged, the usual dose range is 20 to 40 mL. Injections may be repeated as necessary.

Central catheter injections are usually made with a power injector with an injection rate of between 10 and 30 mL/second. When making peripheral injections, rates of 12 to 20 mL/second should be used, depending on the size of the vein. Also, since contrast medium may remain in the arm vein for an extended period following injection, it may be advisable to flush the vein, immediately following injection with an appropriate volume (20 to 25 mL) of 5% Dextrose in water or normal saline.

Similarity of Curve Distribution Among Attractive Legs

Subjective Observation

The convex and concave curves were outlined on the legs with different colors on the PowerPoint program: red for the convexities and yellow for the concavities (Fig. 13). This was done on the medial, lateral, posterior, and anterior aspect of the leg. We found that medially the convex curve is short and very pronounced, followed by a long concavity. Laterally, the convexity is longer and smoother. It is followed by a gentle short concavity that ends at the external malleolus (Fig. 13).

The convex and concave curves were outlined with different colors in the PowerPoint program: red for convexities and yellow for the concavities. This was done on the medial, lateral, posterior, and anterior aspect of the leg

Objective Scientific Analysis: Geometry

For didactic purposes and to move from a subjective observation to a more scientific analysis, the author called upon geometry. The legs were divided into thirds (Fig. 14). It was found that all the models have a medial convexity that straddles the upper and middle third (the lower half of the upper third and the upper half of the middle third), while the lateral convexity stretches along the upper and middle thirds (Fig. 14). Thus, the medial and lateral convexities of the legs are fundamentally asymmetric. From the side view, the posterior convexity occupies the upper two thirds of the leg, just like in its lateral aspect. The anterior leg is an almost straight line (Fig. 15).

Fig. 15

The second goal when performing a leg sculpture is to reproduce, as much as possible, the delicate asymmetric curves found on models' legs (Fig. 16 a–c). This is done according to the original artistic drawing developed by the author (Fig. 17).

Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework — these recommendations have been determined by the method suggested by the GRADE working group. For each guideline, the letter A, B or C marks the quality of current evidence as high, medium or low quality. The grade of recommendation of a guideline can be strong (1) or weak (2), depending on the risk and burden of a particular diagnostic test or a therapeutic procedure to the patient vs. the expected benefit. The words 'we recommend' are used for GRADE 1 — strong recommendations — if the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burdens, or vice versa; the words 'we suggest' are used for GRADE 2 — weak recommendations — when the benefits are closely balanced with risks and burdens. Where current evidence is weak or lacking, the degree of consensus of the committee reflects the grade with the quality of the recommendation adjusted accordingly.

### Cortical thickness systematically varies with curvature and depth in healthy human brains [^4c04d438]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

2.4.2 Mean curvature

Unlike Gaussian curvature, mean curvature is an extrinsic property of the surface, providing a useful measure of foldedness. It has an intuitive meaning, changing as a piece of paper is folded into a cone or cylinder. Just like paper folding, the extent of shape change might be restricted by intrinsic properties of the surface, such as its initial thickness and surface area (Mota & Herculano‐Houzel). The direction of the outward unit normal provides the orientation at a given point, so that the mean curvature distinguished between convex and concave shapes. It has previously been shown to be a good indicator of gyral and sulcal patterns of the cortex (Batchelor et al; Cachia et al; Luders et al.). For discrete surfaces, the mean curvaturecan be calculated bywhereis the number of edges connected to the vertex; denotes the length of the i th edge connected to the vertex; is the dihedral angle, or the angle between normal vectors of the adjacent triangles meeting at the edge; andis the sum of the areas of the adjacent triangles (Mesmoudi et al.) (Figure 6). This formulation assumes that the neighboring vertices of the polygon is a cylindrical arc with a small radius tangent to adjacent edges.

2.4.3 Principal curvatures

At a given point on a curved surface, there are two orthogonal planes that correspond to the maximum and minimum normal curvatures, and, respectively. (Here we use the convention, but note that some studies instead use.) The principal curvatures are quantified as the reciprocal of the radius of the circle of best fit tangent to the surface at that point. The local shape of a point on an arbitrary surface can be determined by principle curvatures (Figure 7). They can be calculated from the mean and Gaussian curvature asand) (Gray,) or conversely, the mean and Gaussian curvature can be written in terms of principal curvatures asand, respectively. In this study, we calculated the principal curvatures from the values of mean and Gaussian curvature at each vertex (Hu et al.).

### Leg length discrepancy in total hip arthroplasty: not all discrepancies are created equal [^d938c7b1]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

The original review article, published in 2006, describing leg length discrepancy after total hip arthroplasty commented that "equal leg length should not be guaranteed". There has been considerable advancement in surgical technique and technology over the past decade, allowing surgeons to "hit the target" much more consistently. In this interval paper, we review leg length discrepancy and introduce some technologies designed to mitigate this complication. In addition, we present challenging clinical scenarios in which perceived leg length may differ from true leg length and how these can be addressed with proper workup and surgical execution.

This step aims to eliminates noise points, while concurrently dilate the nucleus. Subsequently, the nucleus is returned to its normal size through the erosion process. For certain process such as filtering our goblet cells, we have one more step applying filters to refine the result which helps us to keep specific cells only. For instance, with filters such as an element's area > 40, solidity > 0.5, and a length-to-width ratio < 3, we were able to distinguish goblet cells from other irrelevant elements. Notably, these parameter values are not fixed while they are adaptable based on cell types and samples. We employed a similar segmentation process for immune cells and fibroblasts, with the key distinction being the use of different filters and parameter values tailored to each cell type.

### Degenerate boundaries for multiple-alternative decisions [^55f4a482]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Sequential Bayesian inference can be rewritten in a form that more closely resembles a sum of evidence by taking the logarithm of equation (8):For each of the n -choices, the accumulated evidence is the log posterior, with n distinct evidence incrementsand a common subtractive log-marginal term. Calculation of this log-marginal is necessary for multiple (n > 3) choice optimal decision-making, but can be avoided for n = 2 by using the SPRT as mentioned above. A similarterm in a theory of basal ganglia function has been interpreted as suppressing evidence accumulation when choices are ambiguous –.

Within this framework, using that probabilities sum to unity ∑ᵢ Pᵢ(t) = 1, the evidence accumulation takes place within an (n − 1)-dimensional linear subspace spanning n vertices { P i = 1, P j ≠ i = 0} of an N -dimensional unit hypercube. This is most easily seen for N = 3 choices, where the decision variables P = (P₁, P₂, P₃) vary within a triangle passing through three vertices {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)} of the unit cube (Fig. 1, top right panel). So rather than representing evidence accumulation trajectories as a random walk constrained to two dimensions, for multiple alternatives the random walk moves in higher dimensions (a line for two alternatives, a plane/triangle for three, and so on). For simplicity, this vector is initialized with equal prior probabilities [1/n] and updated sequentially until one of the elements reaches a boundary, Pᵢ > θ.

Both the SPRT and two-choice sequential Bayesian inference give optimal decisions in that they give the fastest decisions for a given level of accuracy on single trials of known difficulty. Formally, they optimize a cost function, the Bayes risk, that is linear in the mean error rate e and mean decision time T over many trialswith error costs W i > 0 and cost of time c, scaling the expected error and decision time,… This cost function represents the trade-off between speed and accuracy of decision-making: slow but accurate or fast but inaccurate decisions are both costly, and so a balance must be found. For equal decision costs, W₀ = W₁, there is a single threshold that is free parameter, which for optimal decision-making is tuned according to the relative cost c / W of accuracy and time.

### Emergence of fractal geometries in the evolution of a metabolic enzyme [^4d287880]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Main

Fractals are repeating patterns in which substructures at smaller scales resemble structures at larger scales. These shapes are fascinating because they can be constructed using simple mathematical rules that result in structures of extraordinary complexity and beauty. Fractals exist in nature in the branching patterns of plant leaf veins, in coastal lines and in river systems –. Most natural fractals are irregular. That is, their structures at different scales do not exactly match. Instead, their self-similarity emerges from similar levels of detail in structures formed at different scales. The rare examples of regular fractals in nature, such as the repeating structures in Romanesco broccoli, have been intensely studied to understand the underlying mechanisms that produce exact self-similarity.

All known regular fractals in nature are made by living organisms and exist at the macroscopic scale. However, none have yet been discovered in nature at the molecular scale despite the extraordinary diversity of biomolecular assemblies known to science. The reason for this may be that fractal construction algorithms are difficult to translate into molecular self-assembly. For example, the Sierpiński triangle, one of the best known regular fractals, can be created by triangular subdivision or through a stochastic 'chaos game' that relies on non-local rules, or by colouring in all elements of Pascal's triangle that have odd binomial coefficients. Conversely, self-assembly of biomolecules occurs through the sequential addition of subunits rather than by subdivision and relies on local contacts between protomers to coordinate assembly.

Synthetic designs have overcome these constraints and have built Sierpiński triangles out of small organic molecules. A key element of these designs is a molecular building block in which the structure traces out a 120° angle –. This angle matches that between subtriangles within the equilateral Sierpiński triangle and allows a single monomer to bridge between subtriangles in a manner that passivates their edges. This arrangement ensures that new triangles can only be attached on the tips of an existing triangle and thereby produces the large voids of the Sierpiński triangle. Other designs use metal coordination to enforce this angle –. All designer fractals require special surfaces, precise temperature control during assembly or finely tuned ratios of different precursors to produce Sierpiński fractals –. Such delicate assembly requirements are unlikely to be met in cells, which makes the possibility of natural versions of these fractals seem remote.

Left ventricular systolic function (LVSF) measurement in TNE — There are three potential methods of measuring left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) based on geometric assumptions, and in the transitional period when right-heart pressures are elevated these assumptions may be less applicable. For area-length and Simpson biplane methods the tracing should occur at the endocardial–blood pool interface and include adjacent structures. Normal ejection fraction is considered 55% to 70%, and for fractional shortening the normal range is considered 30% to 45%. Recommendation: LVEF should be measured using either the area-length or Simpson biplane method.

### Leg length discrepancy: the natural history (and what Do we really know) [^888d8934]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The long-term effects of small limb length discrepancies have been poorly documented in the literature. References to low back pain, hip pathology, knee pathology, and foot problems abound in the popular literature. Health care providers frequently recommend the use of lifts for structural and functional limb length discrepancies, yet the natural history of limb length inequality as well as the effectiveness of treatments that may be recommended are obscure. The purpose of this paper is to document and evaluate the literature associated with small limb length discrepancies.

Methods

A search of the English literature was carried out using PubMed to identify papers dealing with the effects of limb length discrepancies. Papers reporting only expert opinion or case reports were excluded.

Results

Papers dealing with the natural history of limb length discrepancy as well as studies in which gait analysis was performed in patients with limb length discrepancy were identified. Only 10% of the population has exactly equal lower limb lengths. Approximately 90% of the population has a limb length discrepancy < 1.0cm. Hip and knee pathology is present in an increased number of patients with limb length discrepancies over 5mm. Hip pathology is more often present in the long leg, knee pathology has been reported in various studies to be more common in either the long or short leg. Low back problems seem to be more common on the short side in patients with limb length discrepancies. A number of different compensatory mechanisms for limb length discrepancy have been identified during gait analysis.

Conclusions

There seems to be a consensus that limb length discrepancies > 2.0cm are frequently a problem. There is some evidence that limb length discrepancies as little as 5mm can lead to long-term pathology.

### Length change behavior of virtual medial patellofemoral ligament fibers during in vivo knee flexion [^9f04cc1c]. The American Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In vivo length change behavior of native medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) fibers throughout the range of knee motion has not been reported in vivo.

Purpose

To measure the length changes of various fibers of the MPFL and to determine their length change patterns during in vivo passive knee flexion.

Study Design

Descriptive laboratory study.

Methods

The right knees of 11 living subjects were scanned with a high-resolution computed tomography scanner at 0°, 30°, 60°, 90°, and 120° of knee flexion, and 3-dimensional (3D) models were constructed using customized software. Five patellar points were determined: 20% (point 20), 30% (point 30), 40% (point 40), 50% (point 50), and 60% (point 60) from the superior pole of the patella. The Schöttle femoral point (point F) was marked on a translucent 3D model of a true lateral view. Five virtual fibers connecting these points on the 3D knee model were created, and the lengths of various fibers were digitally measured.

Results

The average length changes were 9.1 ± 2.5 mm in F20, 9.1 ± 2.5 mm in F30, 8.1 ± 2.6 mm in F40, 6.9 ± 2.4 mm in F50, and 6.9 ± 1.7 mm in F60. There were significant differences in length changes of these 5 fibers (P < .001). The lengths of 2 superior fibers (F20 and F30) increased as the knee flexed from 0° to 30° and decreased as the knee flexed over 30°. The lengths of a middle fiber (F40) and an inferior fiber (F50) increased from 0° to 30°, reached a plateau from 30° to 60°, and then decreased from 60° to 120°. F60 showed an increase from 0° to 30°, and then a plateau pattern from 30° to 90°, followed by a decrease during further flexion.

Conclusion

Superior fibers exhibited their maximum lengths at low flexion angles, and inferior fibers exhibited their maximum lengths at midflexion angles. The MPFL is a complex of functionally various fibers with some taut and others slack over the whole range of knee motion.

Clinical Relevance

The results for lengths and length change patterns of various MPFL fibers are expected to serve as a theoretical background for anatomic double-bundle MPFL reconstruction.

### Entropy-driven formation of chiral nematic phases by computer simulations [^325fb91c]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

As we explain below, this particle model presents several shape features that can be easily tuned, e.g. aspect ratio, convexity, biaxiality, handedness, degree of twist (or molecular pitch) and number of polyhedral faces. A systematic study of how these properties, some of which are intuitively associated to microscopic chirality and liquid-crystalline behaviour, affect the self-assembly of many of such particles, can be efficiently carried out by performing computer simulations. In particular, here we study the nematic phase behaviour of the simplest shape of this class, i.e. twisted triangular prisms (TTP). Our particle is obtained by twisting one base of an elongated triangular prism of height h by an angle α relative to the other base and by adding additional edges to ensure flat faces (Fig. 1). Remarkably, depending on the choice of which vertices are connected by these additional edges, it is possible to build both concave and convex chiral particles. The triangular base has fixed perimeter πω, such that in the limit of infinite number of sides (circle) the width ω coincides with particle diameter. In this study we consider concave TTPs with either equilateral or isosceles triangular bases defined by the base angle γ. When the top triangular base is rotated clockwise the twist angle α is positive and it is tempting to call the TTP right handed. We return to this definition of particle handedness when we discuss our results for the oblate (discotic) cholesteric phases. We note that α should be less than or equal to the smallest angle of the base to avoid self-intersection of the particle shape. For convenience, we also introduce the vectors u, v and w describing the TTP as shown in Fig. 1, which allow us to define the long, medium and short dimensions of the TTP by their length | u |, | v | and | w |, whereas the particle frame is described by the long, medium and short particle axis denoted by the unit vectors,… Note that the height h coincides with | u |. To detect overlaps between particles, i.e. the key ingredient in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations aimed to study the self-assembly of hard particles, we implement an algorithm based on triangle–triangle intersection detection using the RAPID library, which is also suitable for concave shapes. Analogously to spherocylinders(and other hard-rod models), the nematic phase can be stabilized at sufficiently high aspect ratio (h / ω), whereas the particle chirality can be tuned by changing the twist angle α that also changes the molecular pitch. Additionally, by further modifying the particle shape (changing the base) we study how the competition between biaxiality and chirality propagates from microscopic (single particle) to macroscopic (self-assembled structure) level.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of point-of-care ultrasound examinations [^3a43755e]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Compression ultrasound — technique, required views, and documentation standards are as follows: To assess for compressibility, perpendicular force is applied such that the anterior and posterior walls of the vein meet, and venous compression is applied every 2 cm or less in the transverse (short-axis) plane with adequate pressure on the skin to completely obliterate the normal vein lumen. A positive sign for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is the visualization of echogenic material or a thrombus within the lumen of the vein and/or noncompressibility of that segment of the vein. A color or spectral Doppler evaluation, with or without augmentation, may be used to support the presence or absence of an abnormality. The fullest visualized extent of the great saphenous vein, saphenofemoral junction, and common femoral, femoral (formerly known as the superficial femoral), and popliteal veins must be imaged using an optimal grayscale compression technique, and the popliteal vein should be imaged distally to the tibioperoneal trunk. Grayscale images (or cine loops) should be recorded without and with compression at each of the following levels, at a minimum, and, alternatively, images without and with compression can be used for documentation. Abnormal symptoms or findings may require a comprehensive study to document the complete extent of the abnormalities; symptomatic areas such as the calf generally require an additional evaluation and additional images if the cause of the symptoms is not readily elucidated by the standard examination. The extent and location of sites where the veins fail to compress completely should be clearly recorded, and long-axis views without compression may be helpful to characterize the abnormal vein.

### Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction (2018) [^33d330cf]. European Heart Journal (2019). High credibility.

Fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction — application of supplemental electrocardiogram leads states that supplemental leads and serial ECG recordings should be deployed with a very low threshold in patients with ischemic chest pain and a nondiagnostic initial ECG. Isolated ST-segment depression ≥ 0.5 mm in leads V1–V3 may indicate left circumflex occlusion, and posterior leads V7, V8, and V9 at specified positions are recommended to capture it; recording of these leads is strongly recommended when suspicion is high. For posterior leads, a cut-off point of 0.5 mm ST elevation is recommended in leads V7–V9, with specificity increased at a cut-off point ≥ 1 mm and this ≥ 1 mm cut-off should be used in men < 40 years old. For suspected right ventricular infarction, V4R and V3R may show ST-segment elevation ≥ 1 mm, and early recording of V3R and V4R should be performed since ST-elevation ≥ 0.5 mm (≥ 1 mm in men < 30 years old) provides supportive diagnostic criteria.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^34973bae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I₀(ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ² ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

### Targeted muscle reinnervation in the lower leg: an anatomical study [^35e9fd45]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Targeted muscle reinnervation reroutes the ends of cut nerves to reinnervate small motor nerves of nearby muscles, with the goal of reducing neuroma pain and/or improving prosthesis function. Anatomical roadmaps for targeted muscle reinnervation have been established in the upper extremity and thigh, but not for the lower leg.

Methods

The major branch points of motor nerves and the motor entry points to muscles of the leg were dissected in five cadaver specimens. Leg length was defined as distance from the lateral femoral condyle to the lateral malleolus. The distances from the lateral femoral condyle to major branch points and motor entry points were recorded as percentages of leg length to identify targets for targeted muscle reinnervation.

Results

The tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus were both acceptable targets in the anterior compartment, with an average 4.4 motor entry points within 10 to 80 percent and 3.0 motor entry points within 20 to 80 percent leg length, respectively. The peroneus longus was the best target in the lateral compartment, with an average 5.8 motor entry points within 20 to 70 percent leg length. The gastrocnemius and soleus were both acceptable targets in the superficial posterior compartment, with an average 4.4 motor entry points within 0 to 40 percent and 6.2 motor entry points within 20 to 80 percent leg length, respectively for each muscle. The flexor digitorum longus was the best target in the deep posterior compartment, with an average 6.0 motor entry points within 30 to 90 percent leg length.

Conclusions

Targeted muscle reinnervation is technically feasible in the lower leg. This cadaveric study provides a roadmap for incision placement and identification of motor nerve targets.

### Curvature in metabolic scaling [^f5c66bb0]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

For more than three-quarters of a century it has been assumed that basal metabolic rate increases as body mass raised to some power p. However, there is no broad consensus regarding the value of p: whereas many studies have asserted that p is 3/4 (refs 1–4; 'Kleiber's law'), some have argued that it is 2/3 (refs 5–7), and others have found that it varies depending on factors like environment and taxonomy. Here we show that the relationship between mass and metabolic rate has convex curvature on a logarithmic scale, and is therefore not a pure power law, even after accounting for body temperature. This finding has several consequences. First, it provides an explanation for the puzzling variability in estimates of p, settling a long-standing debate. Second, it constitutes a stringent test for theories of metabolic scaling. A widely debated model based on vascular system architecture fails this test, and we suggest modifications that could bring it into compliance with the observed curvature. Third, it raises the intriguing question of whether the scaling relation limits body size.

10² = 10 × 10 = 100 10³ = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1, 000 So the fraction of can be multiplied by 1, 10, 100, 1000, and so on. This multiplier varies by measure and will be addressed in each section. Ratio Definition of ratio A ratio is the relative magnitude of two quantities or a comparison of any two values. It is calculated by dividing one interval- or ratio-scale variable by the other. The numerator and denominator need not be related. Therefore, one could compare apples with oranges or apples with number of physician visits. Method for calculating a ratio etc. in one group Number or rate of events, items, persons, etc. in another group After the numerator is divided by the denominator, the result is often expressed as the result "to one" or written as the result ":
1". Note that in certain ratios, the numerator and denominator are different categories of the same variable, such as males and females, or persons 20–29 years and 30–39 years of age.

In other ratios, the numerator and denominator are completely different variables, such as the number of hospitals in a city and the size of the population living in that city. Proportion Definition of proportion A proportion is the comparison of a part to the whole. It is a type of ratio in which the numerator is included in the denominator. You might use a proportion to describe what fraction of clinic patients tested positive for HIV, or what percentage of the population is younger than 25 years of age. A proportion may be expressed as a decimal, a fraction, or a percentage. EXAMPLE: Calculating a Proportion Example A: Calculate the proportion of men in the NHANES follow-up study who were diabetics. Numerator = 189 diabetic men Denominator = Total number of men = 189 + 3, 151 = 3, 340 Proportion = × 100 = 5. 66%.
- A proportion can be expressed as a fraction, a decimal, or a percentage.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ERN GENTURIS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider confirming the diagnosis of CMMRD in patients meeting one or more criteria for CMMRD testing if:

- two variants in one of the four MMR genes are identified as likely pathogenic or pathogenic and confirmed to be in trans, with additional criteria fulfilled if necessary

- one of two variants in trans is classified as likely pathogenic, pathogenic, or of unknown significance, and the other as a variant of unknown significance, with clinically validated ancillary test results consistent with CMMRD

- one variant is identified as likely pathogenic, pathogenic, or of unknown significance, with evidence of faulty splicing not explained by the variant or reduced expression of the wild-type allele, and clinically validated ancillary test results consistent with CMMRD

- no variant is identified, but clinically validated ancillary test results are consistent with CMMRD, with evidence of faulty splicing or reduced expression of the wild-type alleles by transcript analysis.

### Promoting optimal development: screening for behavioral and emotional problems [^a33cea56]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Family psychosocial risk screening — association, tools, feasibility, and dilemmas: children's behavioral and emotional problems are frequently associated with family psychosocial risk, and family psychosocial screening can provide important information about potential protection or lack thereof for a child who may or may not yet show signs of behavioral or emotional problems. Early detection and treatment of family psychosocial risk may potentially avert the emergence of problems in the child. Only a limited number of well-validated screens suitable for use in primary care for broad screening of family psychosocial risk and family support and functioning are available, although a few show promise. There are screening measures for specific psychosocial stressors, such as maternal depression, and these have been shown to be feasible in pediatric settings, while family screening for psychosocial risk within pediatric settings, however, raises a number of dilemmas, including concerns about liability and payment and who is responsible for an adult's well-being after a problem is detected.

### Association between near functional visual acuity and physical function in community-dwelling older adults: a cross-sectional study: keio university global research institute baseline survey [^3a2f478a]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The CS-30 test was conducted using a chair with a height of 40 cm, with the measurer supporting the participant's chair with care to minimize the risk of falling. The posture at the beginning of the test was uniform: sitting in a chair with both lower limbs shoulder-width apart, back off the backrest, and arms crossed in front of the chest. The participants were instructed to repeat standing and sitting movements as many times as possible in 30 s and to maintain the hip and knee joints in an upright position in the standing posture.

OLSB was performed on a non-slip floor with the participant observed attentively by the operator to minimize the risk of falling. With both eyes open, the participants placed both hands on their hips and, after being asked to "raise one leg", raised either their left or right leg by approximately 5 cm. The time taken for the raised leg to touch the floor was measured for up to 60 s.

For the two-step test, the maximum two-step length (stride) that could be achieved without losing balance was measured, and the two-step value was divided by height. The distance from the toes of both sides of the starting limb to the toe of the final limb was measured to the nearest cm using a measuring tape. The length was measured two times for each leg, and the maximum value was used. After sufficient practice before the measurements, measurements were obtained under proximal monitoring to minimize the risk of falling.

The TUG is used to measure the time in seconds taken to rise from a standard chair without armrests, walk 3 m, turn, return to the chair, and sit down again. At the start, the participants were placed in a posture with their legs shoulder-width apart, the tips of their feet together, and their hands placed on the front of their thighs. They did one from the right foot and one from the left foot, right and left turns, respectively. The time of the fastest movement was used.

Assessments of physical function were conducted in the same environment for each participant. They were also assessed using a standardized procedure by experienced evaluators, with sufficient breaks to enable participant invasiveness.

### The application of discovery toxicology and pathology towards the design of safer pharmaceutical lead candidates [^0af5c124]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2007). Medium credibility.

Toxicity is a leading cause of attrition at all stages of the drug development process. The majority of safety-related attrition occurs preclinically, suggesting that approaches to identify 'predictable' preclinical safety liabilities earlier in the drug development process could lead to the design and/or selection of better drug candidates that have increased probabilities of becoming marketed drugs. In this Review, we discuss how the early application of preclinical safety assessment — both new molecular technologies as well as more established approaches such as standard repeat-dose rodent toxicology studies — can identify predictable safety issues earlier in the testing paradigm. The earlier identification of dose-limiting toxicities will provide chemists and toxicologists the opportunity to characterize the dose-limiting toxicities, determine structure-toxicity relationships and minimize or circumvent adverse safety liabilities.

### Detecting the presence of leg length discrepancy based on gait deviations and functional measurement of leg length during walking [^e4ce32f5]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Leg length discrepancy (LLD) is associated with many musculoskeletal disorders. Its clinical significance is unclear mainly due to limited functional measurement capacity. An integrated approach measuring true LLD, gait deviations and functional leg length during the gait cycle, based on location of joint centre and anatomical landmarks using a three-dimensional motion analysis system was performed on two patients. In one case, strong agreement was found between all measurements thus, leading to the same treatment intervention. However, in another case, true LLD was not correlated with functional LLD or gait deviations, which led to contradictory results. Functional LLD was found to be correlated with gait deviations in both cases. Our results indicate the effectiveness of integrating into the diagnostic regimen, a dynamic method of measuring LLD, together with the functional outcome of gait deviations as a basis for decision-making regarding the presence and clinical significance of LLD in musculoskeletal disorders.

### Muscle function is associated with future patient-reported outcomes in young adults with ACL injury [^19a16929]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Assessment of muscle function

Assessment of muscle function in terms of hop performance, muscle power and postural orientation was performed at mean 3 years (SD 0.85) (table 2).

Table 2
PROs and muscle function test scores (n = 54)

Hop performance

The hop test battery consisted of the following tests as previously described:single-leg vertical hop where the maximum jump height (cm) was measured by the use of an infrared contact mat (Muscle Laboratory; Ergotest Technology, Oslo, Norway), the one leg hop for distance (cm) where the participant jumped as far as possible by taking off and landing on one leg and the side hop where the participant was to jump from side to side as many times as possible outside of a 40 cm wide area marked on the floor during a period of 30 s.

Muscle strength

The muscle strength tests included quadriceps muscle power through a knee extension test (from 110° knee flexion to full extension), hamstring muscle power in a knee flexion test (from full knee extension to 110° knee flexion) and lower extremity muscle power with a leg press test (from 90° knee and hip flexion to fully extended knee and 30° hip flexion) as described. The tests were performed in weight training machines intended for knee extension, knee flexion and leg press, respectively, where the average power output (W) was recorded using a computerised system (Muscle Laboratory; Ergotest Technology).

Absolute values (W, cm) and Limb Symmetry Index (LSI) values were used in the analysis of the hop and muscle power tests. LSI represents the percentage difference between the absolute value of the injured and the uninjured legs where an LSI ≥ 90% is considered normal.

Postural orientation

Postural orientation was visually rated during the performance of five functional tasks with the Test for Substitution Patterns (TSP): 'Body weight-altering test', 'Tip-toe standing knee flexion', 'Knee flexion-extension standing on one leg', 'Forward lunge from stairs' and 'Mini-squat'. The TSP includes a total score for all the tasks based on the orientation of several body segments. The total TSP scores could range from 0 to 54 points with lower scores indicating better results. The TSP has shown good inter-reliability and intrareliability.

For postural orientation, the absolute values for the injured leg (TSP total score) and the difference between the absolute values of the injured and the uninjured leg (TSP diff) were used in the analysis.

### Photochromism from wavelength-selective colloidal phase segregation [^fa04f4d1]. Nature (2023). Excellent credibility.

Furthermore, uniform light with various red-to-blue ratios (40:0, 30:10, 20:20, 10:30 and 0:40 mW cm − 2) was illuminated to the binary solution to further study the effect of incident light spectrum on the phase segregation. As shown in Fig. 4a, the various illumination spectra result in various intensities of segregation, which is defined by the following equation:

For simplicity, the two components in the binary mixture are denoted as A and B, where N_AA, N_BB and N_AB represent the number of pairs for every particle's nearest three neighbouring particles.

In a ternary system, L0 sensitized TiO 2 colloids were introduced to offer a third colour channel. The area fraction of the ternary mixture was also tuned to 15%. The ternary phase segregation was also observed under top blue, green and red light illumination with fixed intensity (50 mW cm − 2). Obvious segregation appeared under about 2 min of top light illumination.

To quantitatively characterize the self-similarity during the phase segregation process, the chord length distribution function, was measured for a different temporal snapshot. Briefly, a straight line was randomly generated across a snapshot. The chord length l was then determined by the length of the line segment inside the cluster. By varying the starting point and the orientation of the straight line randomly, a series of l values from different straight lines was obtained and then normalized by the mean value (characteristic length) < l >, from which the chord length distribution functionwas yielded.

As shown in Extended Data Fig. 2. The chord length distribution functions are independent of time, indicating a self-similar growth mechanism, which is also the origin of the power-law dependence and very similar to the phase separation in a classical thermodynamic mixture.

### Auditory areas are recruited for naturalistic visual meaning in early deaf people [^cbeb8102]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In both groups, we determined the preferred timescale of each region in the auditory cortex (primary auditory cortex, Te2, Te3, and mid-STS, Fig. 5C) by running HMMs with different numbers of event states and finding the average event length that yielded the best model fits across group subject. The model fit was computed as the average correlation for pairs of time points falling within the same (HMM-derived) event, minus the average correlation for pairs of time points falling in different events. After estimating the preferred timescale (segment length) for each ROI we estimated how well the preferred model fits the data by comparing it with the permuted versions of the model boundaries (1000 permutations).

Depending on whether a particular region is involved in processing the stimulus, some regions may exhibit highly stable patterns within events across subjects. In contrast, in regions of the brain that are not particularly involved in processing naturalistic stimulus, event segmentation models do not reliably fit the data. In line with the results of the ISC analysis, in the hearing the models do not fit the data at the statistically significant level (p < 0.05) for most tested ROIs, except for the right mid-STS (Fig. 5D).

Consistent with the idea that deafness leads to the recruitment of auditory cortices for processing naturalistic visual stimuli, in the deaf, the event segmentation models were significantly well-fitted bilaterally for the area of the superior temporal sulcus (mid-STS, p < 0.01) and in the two regions of the higher auditory cortex (Te2 and Te3, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5D). The fit was not significant in the primary auditory cortex in either group.

The HMM analysis focused on the deaf group showed the heterogeneity of the level of processing across auditory areas. The left secondary auditory areas of the deaf participants show a preference for longer (fewer) events with an average segment length of 48 s in Te3 and 36 s in Te2 (30 and 40 events, respectively). In the right secondary auditory cortex, the events were shorter and more numerous: the average segment length is 22 s in Te3 and 28 s Te2 (70, and 50 events, respectively).
