## Question

Does genetic testing replace hemoglobin electrophoresis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether genetic testing replaces hemoglobin electrophoresis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining the methods and what each actually measures. Then, I should verify what major guidelines recommend regarding test selection and sequencing. Next, I will compare strengths and limitations of protein-based methods versus DNA-based methods. After that, I should review context-specific workflows such as newborn screening, carrier identification, prenatal diagnosis, and evaluation of affected individuals. I will then consider resource and setting constraints, examine proficiency testing and yield data to avoid overgeneralization, and finally synthesize a clear bottom line on complementarity versus replacement, with a pragmatic testing algorithm and quality safeguards.

> Let me first confirm the foundational definitions so I do not conflate phenotype with genotype. Hemoglobin electrophoresis, often complemented by HPLC or capillary electrophoresis, separates and quantifies hemoglobin fractions, providing the phenotypic protein pattern including HbA2 and HbF that is crucial for thalassemia screening and variant identification, whereas genetic testing interrogates α- and β-globin genes and regulatory regions to detect point variants and deletions with methods such as ARMS, Sanger, NGS, and MLPA, thereby defining the genotype directly [^113VNYBf] [^112Bqx85] [^1123tSoD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before checking guidelines. Multiple best-practice statements emphasize an algorithmic, combined approach rather than substitution: EMQN explicitly states that carrier detection should be performed by hematological and biochemical tests first, with DNA analysis reserved for complex or inconclusive cases and always interpreted in relation to the hematology screen to ensure genotype–phenotype concordance, and obstetric guidance has long noted that most hemoglobinopathies can be initially diagnosed using protein-based techniques even though molecular methods are vital for prenatal applications and complex scenarios [^1133XZGx] [^113M5u29] [^112XXdej].

> Let me consider the strengths and pitfalls of protein-based methods so I do not overstate their capabilities. Protein methods directly measure the functional product, are standardized and scalable for screening, quantify HbA2/HbF for thalassemia evaluation, and remain the backbone for phenotype–genotype correlation, yet they can miss α-thalassemia silent carriers, be confounded by recent transfusion, and are susceptible to certain analytical interferences such as bilirubin mimicking Barts peaks on HPLC, all of which underscore the need for careful interpretation and, when indicated, reflex molecular testing [^113VNYBf] [^112XXdej] [^115tervd] [^115N6nSv].

> Wait, let me verify the complementary advantages and limitations on the DNA side so I avoid overstating "definitiveness". Molecular testing provides definitive genotype identification, detects complex or deletional alleles that can be equivocal on protein methods, is unaffected by transfusions, and enables prenatal diagnosis and accurate family studies, but it can uncover variants of uncertain significance, may miss structural changes without appropriate assays, and still requires correlation with hematologic phenotype to prevent misinterpretation, with newer approaches like third-generation sequencing or validated targeted panels improving breadth and sensitivity while not obviating the need for phenotypic context [^112Bqx85] [^113VNYBf] [^113G4vP5] [^113dYHn2] [^112GAPSf].

> I should double-check clinical pathways where each modality is primary versus adjunct so the algorithm reflects real-world workflows. In newborn screening programs, HPLC or CE is used for primary screening with electrophoresis and genotyping for confirmation and resolution of ambiguous or rare patterns, including the use of PCR assays to clarify deletions such as HPFH in follow-up, which reinforces that molecular tests support rather than replace initial protein-based screening in this context [^113MJTr3] [^114fxFHv] [^111wrMGj]. For carrier identification, first-line evaluation is CBC with red cell indices and hemoglobin fractionation, with DNA testing when HbA2 is borderline, results are discordant, or precise genotyping is needed for counseling, even though studies in pan-ethnic cohorts show molecular testing can detect more carriers than recommended hematologic methods, which argues for reflex or concurrent strategies in select settings rather than wholesale replacement [^1133XZGx] [^1123WfX1] [^112pofts]. In prenatal diagnosis, accurate variant characterization in both parents and molecular analysis of fetal samples are essential, but laboratories still require parental hematology and phenotype confirmation to avoid misdiagnosis and to interpret fetal genotypes correctly, especially in compound heterozygous or unusual cases [^111XZugH] [^115pzYby]. For symptomatic individuals with atypical hemolysis or suspected unstable variants, sequencing can be decisive, yet even here the hemoglobin pattern and red cell indices remain critical to guide and validate molecular findings [^111ejCYa] [^112XXdej].

> I need to ensure the recommendations are feasible across settings, because resource constraints change the front-line test. In low-resource environments, validated point-of-care immunoassays like HemoTypeSC and Sickle SCAN provide inexpensive, rapid detection of common Hb variants and can expand early diagnosis where HPLC or CE is not readily available, but they do not detect thalassemia genotypes comprehensively and still require confirmatory hemoglobin fractionation and, when indicated, molecular testing within a tiered system, aligning with broader public health efforts to integrate low-cost screening with laboratory confirmation [^115evCNV] [^1147j86x] [^116CQ539]. Conversely, in high-resource laboratories, integrated workflows routinely pair hemoglobin fractionation with targeted or panel-based molecular testing to resolve complex or discordant cases, underscoring complementarity rather than replacement [^113VNYBf].

> Hold on, I should verify performance and yield data so I do not overstate any single method. Proficiency testing across hundreds of laboratories shows substantial error rates for complex hemoglobinopathy case interpretations, especially with compound genotypes, reinforcing that relying on a single modality invites misclassification and that combined methods with robust genotype–phenotype correlation are safer, while advances like third-generation sequencing and curated NGS panels increase detection yield versus limited PCR, yet these gains enhance but do not supplant initial hematologic screening and careful clinical correlation [^114L4LHf] [^113dYHn2] [^112GAPSf] [^1133XZGx] [^112XXdej].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I am not missing any edge cases. Genetic testing does not replace hemoglobin electrophoresis; rather, the standard of care is a complementary, stepwise algorithm in which hemoglobin fractionation by electrophoresis, HPLC, or CE remains the mandatory first-line test for screening and initial characterization, followed by reflex or concurrent molecular testing when results are borderline, discordant, or clinically decisive for counseling, prenatal diagnosis, or complex phenotypes, and molecular results must always be interpreted alongside hematology to ensure genotype–phenotype concordance and to minimize diagnostic error, with clear reporting and quality safeguards to prevent misdiagnosis [^1133XZGx] [^1123WfX1] [^112XXdej] [^113QBwuA] [^113M5u29].

No, genetic testing does not replace hemoglobin electrophoresis; the two are **complementary** and should be used together for accurate diagnosis and management of hemoglobinopathies [^113M5u29] [^1133XZGx] [^113VNYBf]. Electrophoresis provides a **rapid, cost-effective assessment of hemoglobin variants** and quantifies **HbA2/HbF** [^1123WfX1] [^1123tSoD], whereas genetic testing **confirms specific mutations** [^113dYHn2], detects silent or rare variants [^112ZLNZQ], and is essential for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling [^111XZugH]. Electrophoresis can miss silent or rare variants and can be confounded by recent transfusion or high HbF [^115tervd], whereas genetic testing may not detect all variants [^112Bqx85] [^112GAPSf] and is more expensive [^notfound]. Current guidelines recommend electrophoresis as the initial test, with genetic testing for confirmation, complex cases, or prenatal diagnosis [^1133XZGx] [^111XZugH].

## Hemoglobin electrophoresis: clinical utility and limitations

### Clinical utility

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a **first-line** test that separates hemoglobin variants by charge, enabling rapid, cost-effective detection and quantification of common variants (HbS, HbC, HbE, HbD) and measurement of HbA2 and HbF — critical for screening and initial diagnosis [^1123tSoD] [^1123WfX1] [^111Woecy].

- **Rapid, cost-effective screening**: Quickly identifies common variants and quantifies HbA2/HbF [^1123WfX1] [^113MJTr3].
- **Initial diagnosis**: Useful for sickle cell disease, thalassemias, and other hemoglobinopathies [^1133XZGx] [^113MJTr3].
- **Monitoring**: Tracks HbS levels in sickle cell disease and HbA2/HbF in thalassemias [^1123WfX1] [^1123tSoD].

---

### Limitations

Despite its utility, electrophoresis has important **limitations**:

- **Silent or rare variants**: May miss silent mutations or rare variants that co-migrate with normal hemoglobin [^113VNYBf] [^114L4LHf].
- **Transfusion interference**: Recent transfusion or high HbF can confound results [^115tervd].
- **Limited specificity**: Cannot precisely identify specific genetic mutations [^114L4LHf] [^113VNYBf].

---

## Genetic testing: clinical utility and limitations

### Clinical utility

Genetic testing (PCR, Sanger, NGS) detects specific mutations in globin genes, providing **definitive** identification of silent or rare variants and enabling precise prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling [^113VNYBf] [^113dYHn2] [^112ZLNZQ] [^111XZugH].

- **Definitive diagnosis**: Identifies specific mutations, including silent or rare variants [^113VNYBf] [^113dYHn2].
- **Prenatal diagnosis**: Essential for accurate fetal diagnosis and counseling [^111XZugH].
- **Carrier detection**: Detects carriers missed by electrophoresis [^112pofts].

---

### Limitations

Genetic testing also has **limitations**: it may miss unknown or rare mutations not covered by panels [^112Bqx85] [^112GAPSf], is more expensive and less available in resource-limited settings [^111RLD39], and can yield variants of uncertain significance that complicate interpretation [^113G4vP5] [^113VNYBf].

---

## Complementary roles in clinical practice

Electrophoresis and genetic testing are complementary and **should be used together** for accurate diagnosis and management [^113M5u29]. Electrophoresis is recommended first for rapid, cost-effective screening [^1133XZGx] [^111Woecy], while genetic testing confirms and clarifies complex or ambiguous cases [^113dYHn2] and is essential for accurate prenatal diagnosis and counseling [^111XZugH].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize a **stepwise approach**: use electrophoresis first for rapid, cost-effective screening [^1133XZGx] [^1123WfX1], followed by genetic testing to confirm and clarify complex or ambiguous cases [^113dYHn2] and for accurate prenatal diagnosis and counseling [^111XZugH] [^113M5u29].

---

## Practical considerations

### Cost-effectiveness

Electrophoresis is more **cost-effective** for initial screening, whereas **genetic testing** costs more but is necessary for definitive diagnosis and prenatal testing [^1133XZGx] [^111RLD39] [^111XZugH].

---

### Accessibility

Electrophoresis is **widely available**, including in resource-limited settings, whereas **genetic testing** has more limited availability in some settings [^1133XZGx].

---

### Turnaround time

Electrophoresis yields **rapid results**, whereas **genetic testing** typically has a longer turnaround due to its complexity [^1133XZGx] [^113MJTr3].

---

Genetic testing **does not replace** hemoglobin electrophoresis; the tests are **complementary** and should be used together for accurate diagnosis and management. Electrophoresis is the initial screening tool, and genetic testing confirms specific mutations, detects silent or rare variants, and is essential for prenatal diagnosis and counseling [^113M5u29] [^1123WfX1].

The objectives of this review are to describe the use of molecular diagnostic techniques for patients with hemoglobin disorders. A clinical scenario is presented in which molecular diagnosis is vital for genetic counseling. Globin disorders, techniques for their diagnosis, and the role of molecular genetic testing in managing patients with these disorders are discussed in detail.

Hemoglobin disorders, including thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies, are among the most common genetic diseases, and the clinical laboratory is crucial for the diagnosis of patients with these abnormalities. Most disorders can be diagnosed with protein-based techniques such as electrophoresis and chromatography. Since severe syndromes can result from the inheritance of combinations of globin genetic disorders, genetic counseling is important to prevent adverse outcomes. Protein-based methods cannot always detect potentially serious thalassemia disorders; in particular, α-thalassemia may be masked in the presence of β-thalassemia. Deletional forms of β-thalassemia are also sometimes difficult to diagnose definitively with standard methods.

Molecular genetic testing plays a significant role in identifying individuals carrying thalassemia traits that can lead to adverse outcomes in offspring. Furthermore, prenatal genetic testing can identify fetuses with severe globin phenotypes.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^1133XZGx]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Laboratory diagnosis is pivotal in managing the health burden of haemoglobinopathies, as its primary role is to identify carrier couples and provide them with reproductive choices. Uniquely, the detection of carriers for haemoglobinopathies is achievable through haematological and biochemical tests, rather than DNA analysis. Therefore, it is recommended that, with current technologies, carrier detection should be mandatory through haematological and biochemical tests. In complex cases, or when haematological/biochemical results are inconclusive, DNA analysis should be used to determine carrier status.

At-risk couples can then be offered reproductive choices based on acceptable practices in each society. They may choose options to avoid having affected children: before marriage, through partner choice alteration; or after marriage, by remaining childless, or opting for gamete donation or adoption. However, these options are seldom chosen. More frequently, at-risk couples avoid the birth of an affected child by pursuing conventional prenatal diagnosis in early pregnancy, or by choosing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) before pregnancy. Both procedures involve prior variant characterization in the parents and subsequent fetal (or embryo) DNA analysis. Consequently, genetic services for haemoglobinopathies necessitate close collaboration.

### Systematic follow-up and case management of the abnormal newborn screen can improve acceptance of genetic counseling for sickle cell or other hemoglobinopathy trait [^114L9hFT]. Genetics in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Sickle cell or other hemoglobinopathy trait detected on the newborn screen provides an opportunity for genetic counseling of families at risk of having a child with a major hemoglobinopathy. However, follow-up of hemoglobinopathy trait is often fragmented and acceptance of counseling is low. This study describes the results of systematic follow-up and case management of abnormal newborn screens and the effect on the acceptance of counseling.

- **Methods**: From July 1997 to June 2002, families of a newborn with hemoglobinopathy trait were notified by mail. In April 2003, an intensive trait follow-up protocol, including letters, telephone calls, educational videos, and genetic counseling, was implemented. Demographic information and follow-up activity were documented and tracked using an electronic database.

- **Results**: From July 1997 to June 2002, 3095 families were notified by letter of a newborn with hemoglobinopathy trait and were offered genetic counseling. Of these, 165 (5.3%) received counseling by telephone and 60 (2%) underwent extended family testing. From April to December 2003, 694 families with a newborn with hemoglobinopathy trait were notified by mail. Of these, 362 (52%) families were reached by telephone. Of those contacted by telephone, 92% received genetic counseling via telephone, 57% were interested in family testing, and 12% scheduled an appointment. Additionally, 27% of families were mailed an educational video. Among those declining extended family testing, 26% preferred to consult their pediatrician.

- **Conclusions**: Systematic follow-up and case management of abnormal newborn screen and case management of abnormal newborn screen and case management of abnormal newborn screen and case management of abnormal newborn screen and case management of abnorm

### EMQN best practice guidelines for the molecular genetic diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) [^1117fCik]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2016). Low credibility.

It is important to note that other genetic causes of severe iron overload exist, but these should be distinguished from HH because of their distinct clinical and pathological presentation. These include iron-loading anemias due to ineffective erythropoiesis (thalassemia syndromes, hemoglobinopathies, sideroblastic anemias, congenital dyserythropoietic anemia) or due to hemolysis; defects in iron acquisition by the erythroid precursors (hypotransferrinemia, defect in DMT1, aceruloplasminemia); or repeated blood transfusions. All these disorders demand a distinct clinical and molecular diagnosis workup that is out of the scope of the present document.

- **Clinical presentation and reasons for genetic testing referral**: Early symptoms of HH are non-specific and may include weakness, lethargy, weight loss, and arthralgia. Other suggestive, but also not specific, signs of more advanced disease include skin pigmentation, liver cirrhosis, chondrocalcinosis, arthritis, diabetes, hypogonadism, hepatocarcinoma, or cardiomyopathy. If any of these conditions are related to HH, they will necessarily be associated with biochemical evidence of iron overload, namely an increased transferrin saturation (TS) and elevated serum ferritin. Biochemical disease expression is usually present in presymptomatic disease stages, where elevated TS is the first indicator of iron overload. Therefore, patients with consistently increased TS and serum ferritin in the absence of hematological diseases are suspected to have HH.

### Diagnosis and clinical relevance of co-inheritance of haemoglobin D-Punjab/β+-thalassemia traits in an immigrant Afghan family [^1164zpXf]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2022). Low credibility.

In many countries with high carrier rates, nationwide screening programs for hemoglobinopathies have been established. In 2014, a pan-European expert consensus recommended newborn screening in Europe to target only sickle cell disease, specifically Hb S. In previously non-endemic countries with high rates of multi-ethnic immigration, antenatal screening programs may be absent. In these countries, primary care professionals can play an important role in identifying individuals and families at risk by taking a detailed family medical history and offering screening and genetic counseling.

A high index of suspicion is required to differentiate between thalassemias and iron deficiency anaemia (IDA), especially when microcytic anaemia is accompanied by normal iron studies. Many mathematical indices have been used to discriminate thalassemia trait from IDA (e.g. Mentzer's index suggests mean corpuscular volume/red blood cell 14 for IDA). A meta-analysis found that although these indices lack diagnostic accuracy to confirm thalassemia, they are valuable for identifying subjects in whom further diagnostic testing is indicated, especially when combined with other factors such as age, ethnicity, or family history.

In resource-limited countries with a high prevalence of thalassemias, red cell osmotic fragility testing is used for population screening. For the NESTROFT test we used, Singh et al. reported 97.7% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity for detecting the β-thalassemia trait.

The hemoglobinopathies are a heterogeneous group of single-gene disorders that include the structural hemoglobin variants and the thalassemias. More than 270 million people worldwide are heterozygous carriers of hereditary disorders of hemoglobin, and at least 300,000 affected homozygotes or compound heterozygotes are born each year. The purpose of this document is to review the most common hemoglobinopathies and to provide recommendations for the screening and clinical management of hemoglobinopathies during pregnancy.

- **Hb A2 quantification**:

	- Important points for the interpretation of results for Hb A2 quantification include the following:

	- Hb A2 levels above 3.5% is the standard cut-off value, above which heterozygosity for β-thalassaemia is indicated. Borderline levels of 3.1–3.5% Hb A2, depending on the method, the laboratory reference range, and coefficient of variation, indicate further investigation is required (see Tables 5, 6 and Supplementary Table 3). Reference intervals in normal subjects are usually between 2.0 and 3.3% but have been observed to differ slightly depending on the method and population group. Rare genetic and acquired factors that may increase or reduce Hb A2 levels are reported in Supplementary Table 3.

- **Quantification of Hb F**:

	- Methods reliable for the measurement of Hb F levels include alkali denaturation, HPLC, and CE, with the latter two methods being more recent and much more accurate. More details on these methods are outlined in the Supplementary Information.

### The diagnostic dilemma of congenital unstable hemoglobinopathies [^111ejCYa]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2010). High credibility.

Unstable hemoglobin variants represent a rare etiology of congenital hemolytic anemia. Without a high index of suspicion, plus proper laboratory testing and interpretation, the correct diagnosis can be elusive. We report on five children who were initially thought to have other congenital disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis or thalassemia before β-globin gene sequencing led to the definitive diagnosis. Recognizing the variable clinical presentation and laboratory data reported will aid clinicians in the diagnosis of unstable hemoglobin variants in children with atypical forms of hemolytic anemia, particularly those with low pulse oximetry values or whose hemoglobin electrophoresis suggests β-thalassemia trait.

### DNA diagnosis confirms hemoglobin deletion in newborn screen follow-up [^111wrMGj]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2003). Low credibility.

Molecular genetic confirmatory testing with polymerase chain reaction amplification is integral to neonatal hemoglobinopathy screening programs. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of polymerase chain reaction-based testing for the common deletions in Blacks responsible for hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. This approach will provide rapid diagnostic clarification in newborn screening follow-up.

### Validation of a novel point of care testing device for sickle cell disease [^1147j86x]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Sickle SCAN™ will be the first POC device able to diagnose and differentiate the most common forms of sickle cell disease and trait, as well as HbC disease and trait. It is designed as a sensitive, rapid, and low-cost test to be used as the primary diagnostic tool for sickle cell disease and sickle trait in sub-Saharan Africa, India, and other regions of the developing world. The company has already received CE mark approval and has commenced commercialization in these regions.

Currently, there are two noted limitations in the Sickle SCAN™ test. At present, the limit of detection (LoD) for hemoglobin A is set at 40%. This configuration is intended to capture persons with HbSβ+ disease (which appear as HbS alone on the test results). However, it is important that testers do not conflate the weak HbA line seen in persons with HbAS as indicating a low quantity of hemoglobin. The intensity of the line does not correlate with the quantity of hemoglobin. Thus, results demonstrating bands at HbS and HbA are consistent with sickle cell trait, despite the fact that the band at S is darker than the band at A. This limitation can be overcome with proper instruction on test interpretation.

Additionally, the Sickle SCAN™ test only shows hemoglobin A, S, and C. It cannot identify thalassemia carriers, a condition that can impact genetic counseling. Furthermore, the test cannot identify all hemoglobin variants but is instead heavily reliant on the most common forms. Results of hemoglobin A cannot be definitively correlated to the HbAA genotype based solely on this test.

Further studies using the Sickle SCAN™ are needed to enhance its utility and detection capabilities.

### Diagnosis of inherited bleeding disorders in the genomic era [^114tLbSF]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Inherited bleeding disorders affect a wide range of individuals, from 1 in 1000 for the most common disorder, von Willebrand Disease, to only 8 reported cases worldwide of alpha-2-antiplasmin deficiency. Individuals with an identifiable abnormality can be categorized into disorders of coagulation factors (87%), platelet count and function (8%), and the fibrinolytic system (3%). In the UK, 2% of patients registered with a bleeding disorder remain unclassifiable.

In addition to bleeding symptoms, patients with an inherited bleeding disorder may exhibit other abnormalities, making it crucial to achieve an accurate and complete diagnosis that reflects the underlying molecular pathology. While some inherited bleeding disorders can still be accurately diagnosed through a combination of careful clinical assessment and laboratory assays, many require more than conventional approaches.

Improvements in phenotyping assays have enhanced our diagnostic capabilities; however, genotyping now offers the most accurate and complete diagnosis for certain conditions. The advent of next-generation sequencing technology has made it possible for numerous genes to be routinely analyzed in clinical practice. This discussion elucidates the various diagnostic tools currently available for inherited bleeding disorders and advocates for the early incorporation of genotyping in the diagnostic pathway.

### Blood transfusions leading to apparent hemoglobin C, S, and O-Arab hemoglobinopathies [^115tervd]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Apparent hemoglobinopathies caused by blood transfusions have rarely been reported in the scientific literature. The objective was to interpret the abnormal hemoglobins appearing as small peaks on hemoglobin chromatograms or electrophoresis membranes.

- **Design**: In the clinical laboratories of a university hospital and a metropolitan hospital affiliated with a medical school, we interpreted hemoglobin chromatograms and electrophoresis membranes. We correlated them with patients' medical, laboratory, and transfusion records; and, when possible, identified the abnormal hemoglobin in the donors' transfusion segments.

- **Results**: We detected 52 incidences of apparent hemoglobinopathies in 32 recipients caused by blood transfusion, of which 46 were hemoglobin C, 4 were hemoglobin S, and 2 were hemoglobin O-Arab. When first detected, the abnormal hemoglobins in recipients ranged from 0.8% to 14% (median, 5.6%). Multiple transfusions with abnormal hemoglobins occurred in 11 patients, with 2 patients receiving hemoglobin C blood 5 separate times. One patient received hemoglobin C and later S, and another patient received C and later O-Arab.

- **Conclusions**: Apparent hemoglobinopathies caused by blood transfusions are far more common than previously reported and represent diagnostic challenges. Misdiagnosis could lead to unnecessary testing, treatment, and counseling. If a hemoglobinopathy from a unit of transfused blood is identified in a recipient, we recommend notifying the donor of that abnormality.

Following the very sad news about the premature death of Professor Renzo Galanello in May 2013, the authors of these best practice guidelines have decided unanimously to dedicate them to him, as he made substantial contributions to all sections. Renzo was a pioneer in the field of thalassaemia research, diagnosis, and prevention, and also in the treatment and management of patients with haemoglobinopathies.

### Ethical considerations in genomic testing for hematologic disorders [^113G4vP5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

As our technological capacities improve, genomic testing is increasingly integrating into patient care, and the field of clinical hematology is no exception. Genomic testing carries great promise, but several ethical issues must be considered whenever such testing is performed. This review addresses these ethical considerations, including issues surrounding informed consent, the uncertainty of genomic test results, the challenge of incidental findings, and possible inequities in access to and benefits from such testing. Genomic testing is likely to transform the practice of both benign and malignant hematology, but clinicians must carefully consider these core ethical issues in order to make the most of this exciting and evolving technology.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^115EFe8U]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

For genotype characterization in carriers, optimal DNA analysis results can be achieved by adhering to the following recommendations:

- **Evaluation of haematology**: Before DNA analysis, evaluate haematology to direct the most appropriate molecular analysis for each sample. Post DNA analysis, co-evaluate haematology to preclude a serious misinterpretation of results, such as misdiagnosis.

- **Family history**: Evaluate family history and haematology in some cases if relevant.

- **DNA analysis protocols**: Preferably, have available more than a single DNA analysis protocol for characterizing the genotype in carriers (prospective parents) to support cross-checking of results.

- **Sanger sequencing method**: If Sanger sequencing is the only method available for characterizing nucleotide variations, it is recommended that the target region in the gene of interest be analyzed in duplicate, in both the forward and reverse directions. Ideally, the Sanger sequencing reaction should be performed on templates amplified by two alternative sets of primers. If this is not feasible, at least conduct it on duplicate templates independently amplified from the original DNA sample. In the latter case, prevent false-negative results by careful co-evaluation of haematology results mentioned above.

- **GAP-PCR analysis**: If a GAP-PCR analysis produces a negative result in individuals with haematology otherwise indicating a carrier status involving a likely deletion-variant (for example, α-thalassaemia), it is recommended that either MLPA or aCGH be used to further investigate the DNA sample.

### Genetic counseling following the detection of hemoglobinopathy trait on the newborn screen is well received, improves knowledge, and relieves anxiety [^113XiqeW]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The primary purpose of newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies is the presymptomatic diagnosis and early treatment of sickle cell disease. Hemoglobinopathy traits detected on the newborn screening provide an opportunity for genetic counseling of families regarding the trait and information that may impact reproductive decisions of the parents. We describe the results of a study to determine the impact of newborn screening and genetic counseling on the lives of families in which an abnormal hemoglobin trait had been identified.

From June 2003 to December 2009, families of children with the trait attending a clinic visit and receiving professional genetic counseling were asked to participate in a semistructured follow-up survey regarding their experience and the impact of genetic counseling on their families.

Of the 300 patients seen in clinic during the specified time period, 209 consented to be recontacted, and 114 have completed the survey. Eighty-five percent of responders reported knowing that the newborn screen had been performed, but only 55% understood the purpose of newborn screening. When asked about the effect of finding out that the trait was present in their baby, 19% reported feeling guilty or upset, whereas 4% believed that their partner blamed them for the child's results. The genetic counseling was found to be beneficial as indicated by the fact that 99% reported that their questions were answered, 82% reported feeling less anxious, and 78% discussed the trait with their partner after the appointment.

### Heart failure in haemoglobinopathies: pathophysiology, clinical phenotypes, and management [^116Hxye8]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2017). Low credibility.

Hereditary haemoglobinopathies, mainly beta-thalassemia and sickle cell disease, constitute the most common monogenic disorders in humans. Although once geographically confined, these disorders are currently globally distributed. They are demanding clinical entities that require multidisciplinary medical management. Despite their genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity, haemoglobinopathies share several similarities in pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, therapeutic requirements, and complications, among which heart failure (HF) represents a leading cause of mortality and morbidity.

Haemoglobinopathies have generally been addressed in a rather fragmentary manner. A unifying approach, focusing on the underlying similarities of HF attributes in the two main entities, might contribute to better understanding, characterization, and management. In the present review, we attempt such an approach to the pathophysiology, clinical phenotypes, and management of HF in haemoglobinopathies.

### Detection of sickle cell hemoglobin in Haiti by genotyping and hemoglobin solubility tests [^1161Jrch]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease is a growing global health concern because infants born with the disorder in developing countries are now surviving longer with little access to diagnostic and management options. In Haiti, the state of sickle cell disease/trait in the population is unclear. To inform future screening efforts in Haiti, we assayed sickle hemoglobin mutations using traditional hemoglobin solubility tests (HST) and add-on techniques, which incorporated spectrophotometry and insoluble hemoglobin separation. We also generated genotype data as a metric for HST performance.

We found that 19 of 202 individuals screened with HST were positive for sickle hemoglobin, five of whom did not carry the HbS allele. We show that spectrophotometry and insoluble hemoglobin separation add-on techniques could resolve false positives associated with the traditional HST approach, with some limitations. We also discuss the incorporation of insoluble hemoglobin separation observation with HST in suboptimal screening settings like Haiti.

### Comparison of third-generation sequencing and routine polymerase chain reaction in genetic analysis of thalassemia [^113dYHn2]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Thalassemia is the most widely distributed monogenic autosomal recessive disorder in the world. Accurate genetic analysis of thalassemia is crucial for its prevention.

- **Objective**: To compare the clinical utility of a third-generation sequencing-based approach, termed comprehensive analysis of thalassemia alleles, with routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in genetic analysis of thalassemia and explore the molecular spectrum of thalassemia in Hunan Province.

- **Design**: Subjects in Hunan Province were recruited, and hematologic testing was performed. Five hundred four subjects positive on hemoglobin testing were then used as the cohort. Third-generation sequencing and routine PCR were utilized for genetic analysis.

- **Results**: Of the 504 subjects, 462 (91.67%) had the same results, whereas 42 (8.33%) exhibited discordant results between the two methods. Sanger sequencing and PCR testing confirmed the results of third-generation sequencing. In total, third-generation sequencing correctly detected 247 subjects with variants, whereas PCR identified 205, indicating an increase in detection of 20.49%. Moreover, α triplications were identified in 1.98% (10 of 504) hemoglobin testing-positive subjects in Hunan Province. Seven hemoglobin variants with potential pathogenicity were detected in nine hemoglobin testing-positive subjects.

- **Conclusions**: Third-generation sequencing is a more comprehensive, reliable, and efficient approach for genetic analysis of thalassemia than PCR. It allowed for a detailed characterization of the thalassemia spectrum in Hunan Province.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^113M5u29]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Haemoglobinopathies constitute the most common recessive monogenic disorders worldwide, and the treatment of affected individuals presents a substantial global disease burden. Carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis are valuable procedures that identify couples at risk for having affected children so that they can be offered options to have healthy offspring. Molecular diagnosis facilitates prenatal diagnosis and definitive diagnosis of carriers and patients, especially 'atypical' cases who often have complex genotype interactions. However, haemoglobin disorders are unique among all genetic diseases in that identification of carriers is preferable by haematological (biochemical) tests rather than DNA analysis. These best practice guidelines offer an overview of recommended strategies and methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies, emphasizing the importance of appropriately applying and interpreting haematological tests to support the optimum application and evaluation of globin gene DNA analysis.

### Point-of-care screening for sickle cell disease in low-resource settings: A multi-center evaluation of HemoTypeSC, a novel rapid test [^115evCNV]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). High credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common, life-threatening genetic disorder that is best managed when diagnosed early by newborn screening. However, SCD is most prevalent in low-resource regions of the world where newborn screening is rare and diagnosis at the point-of-care is challenging. In many such regions, the majority of affected children die, undiagnosed, before the age of 5 years. A rapid and affordable point-of-care test for SCD is needed. The diagnostic accuracy of HemoTypeSC, a point-of-care immunoassay for SCD, was evaluated in individuals who had SCD, hemoglobin C disease, the related carrier (trait) states, or a normal hemoglobin phenotype.

Children and adults participated in low-, medium-, and high-resource environments (Ghana [n = 383], Martinique [n = 46], and USA [n = 158]). Paired blood specimens were obtained for HemoTypeSC and a reference diagnostic assay. HemoTypeSC testing was performed at the site of blood collection, and the reference test was performed in a laboratory at each site. In 587 participants across all study sites, HemoTypeSC had an overall sensitivity of 99.5% and specificity of 99.9% across all hemoglobin phenotypes. The test had 100% sensitivity and specificity for sickle cell anemia. Sensitivity and specificity for detection of normal and trait states were over 99%.

HemoTypeSC is an inexpensive (< $2 per test), accurate, and rapid point-of-care test that can be used in resource-limited regions with a high prevalence of SCD to provide timely diagnosis and support newborn screening programs.

### Evaluation of low-cost techniques to detect sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia: An open-label, international, multicentre study [^116CQ539]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

When screening for HbS in communities, it is essential to also identify other commonly prevalent hemoglobin variants, such as β-thalassemia, which is prevalent in the Middle East, Mediterranean countries, and South Asia, or HbC, prevalent in West Africa. Such identifications help prevent genetic transmissions that result in severe forms of SCD (compound heterozygous or homozygous HbS). After screening, individuals identified with disease states can be provided with the appropriate treatment or medical attention, while individuals with trait conditions can be provided with genetic counseling to understand the risks of passing variant genes to children.

In this study, we evaluated six low-cost tests against the local gold standard, hemoglobin high-performance liquid chromatography (Hb HPLC). The low-cost tests included two conventional tests (conventional sickling test, solubility test), three recently commercialized techniques (HemoTypeSC, Sickle SCAN, Gazelle Hb variant test), and one newly developed technique (automated sickling test). The purpose of this study was to determine the accuracy of the low-cost point-of-care techniques for screening and detecting SCD, SCT, and β-thalassemia, and to evaluate their feasibility to supplement or replace gold standard tests. Here, we report the first combined comparison of several low-cost techniques, using identical blood samples for all tests (including Hb HPLC) from each participant, to detect HbS and β-thalassemia in participants from Nepal and Canada.

### Spurious hemoglobin Barts caused by bilirubin: A common interference mimicking an uncommon hemoglobinopathy [^115N6nSv]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is replacing electrophoresis for the identification of hemoglobin variants. Our objective was to identify unknown tall peaks, with elution times and shapes of hemoglobin Barts, found on hemoglobin chromatograms that could not be confirmed by alkaline and acid gel electrophoresis. Of 90 specimens identified with this peak, 86 were from patients with hemoglobin SS. Regression of the height of the unknown peaks to serum bilirubin concentrations, diminution of the unknown peaks by washing the specimens, and chromatographic similarity of a total bilirubin serum calibrator, a bilirubin proficiency testing specimen, and three patients' serum samples with markedly elevated bilirubin to hemoglobin Barts provide evidence that the peak was bilirubin. We suggest the exclusion of bilirubin before HPLC results are reported as consistent with hemoglobin Barts.

### Evaluation of low-cost techniques to detect sickle cell disease and β-thalassemia: An open-label, international, multicentre study [^116cE8Hb]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). High credibility.

Sickle haemoglobin or haemoglobin S (HbS) results from a single point mutation (β6 Glu→Val) in the β-globin gene and presents an increasing global health problem, particularly in resource-limited environments. The prevalence of sickle cell disease (SCD) increased by 41.4% from 5.46 million cases in 2000 to 7.74 million cases in 2021, with the highest mortality burden in children. The most common and severe form of SCD is sickle cell anaemia (SCA), which results from homozygous inheritance of HbS. Other compound heterozygous forms of SCD exist (most notably with the β-globin variants, haemoglobin C, and with β-thalassemia) and have variable phenotypes.

SCD is a multi-system disorder affecting nearly every organ in the body. Polymerisation of deoxygenated HbS distorts red blood cells (RBCs) into characteristic sickle-shaped cells, promoting chronic vaso-occlusion, haemolysis, inflammation, and progressive organ damage. Morbidity and mortality improve with early diagnosis, infection prevention, and disease-modifying therapy, including RBC transfusions and hydroxyurea. On the other hand, the heterozygous form of HbS, known as sickle cell trait (SCT), has an estimated annual prevalence and birth rate of 300 million and 5.48 million, respectively. SCT is typically not associated with haematological abnormalities, thus may go undetected without effective screening programmes.

### Characteristics of a rapid, point-of-care lateral flow immunoassay for the diagnosis of sickle cell disease [^111hmfJo]. American Journal of Hematology (2016). Low credibility.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common and life-threatening hematological disorder, affecting approximately 400,000 newborns annually worldwide. Most SCD births occur in low-resource countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where limited access to accurate diagnostics results in early mortality. We evaluated a prototype immunoassay as a novel, rapid, and low-cost point-of-care (POC) diagnostic device (Sickle SCAN) designed to identify HbA, HbS, and HbC. A total of 139 blood samples were scored by three masked observers and compared to results using capillary zone electrophoresis. The sensitivity (98.3–100%) and specificity (92.5–100%) to detect the presence of HbA, HbS, and HbC were excellent. The test demonstrated 98.4% sensitivity and 98.6% specificity for the diagnosis of HbSS disease and 100% sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of HbSC disease. Most variant hemoglobins, including samples with high concentrations of HbF, did not interfere with the ability to detect HbS or HbC. Additionally, HbS and HbC were accurately detected at concentrations as low as 1–2%. Dried blood spot samples yielded clear positive bands, without loss of sensitivity or specificity, and devices stored at 37°C gave results that are reliable. These analyses indicate that the Sickle SCAN POC device is simple, rapid, and robust with high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of HbA, HbS, and HbC. The ability to obtain rapid and accurate results with both liquid blood and dried blood spots, including those with newborn high-HbF phenotypes, suggests that this POC device is suitable for la…

### Comparison of methodologies to detect hemoglobinopathy carriers in a multi-ethnic sperm donor population [^112pofts]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2021). Low credibility.

An estimated 7% of the world's population are carriers for a hemoglobin disorder. Guidelines recommend carrier screening by complete blood count, with follow-up hemoglobin electrophoresis or fractionation based on abnormal results or ethnicity. Advances in molecular genetic testing are thought to increase carrier detection. This study compares carrier screening methodologies in a multi-ethnic sperm donor population.

A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from a US sperm bank. All men underwent carrier screening for hemoglobin disorders via complete blood count, hemoglobin fractionation, and molecular testing. Results were compared using counts and percentages. McNemar's exact test was used to examine differences in the marginal probabilities of screening methodologies. Of the 438 tested, 25 (5.7%) were identified as carriers of at least one hemoglobin disorder by molecular testing. Seventeen (68%) of those carriers were missed by recommended methods. No identified carriers were detected by recommended methods but missed by molecular testing. The difference between these discordant pairs was significant (p-value < 0.001). The majority (44%) of carriers were of mixed ethnicity, followed by 36% White. Results indicate that molecular screening methodologies have a greater ability to detect carriers of hemoglobin disorders compared to currently recommended methods in a multi-ethnic population.

### An 18-year review of hemoglobinopathy proficiency testing: Recommendations from the College of American Pathologists Hematology and Clinical Microscopy Committee [^114L4LHf]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The College of American Pathologists Hematology and Clinical Microscopy Committee implemented a hemoglobinopathy proficiency testing and education program to monitor and assess the performance of participating laboratories.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the performance of clinical laboratories for hemoglobinopathy proficiency testing from 2005 to 2023.

- **Design**: The hemoglobinopathy challenges are composed of clinical case summaries and electrophoretic and chromatographic gel and tracing images. The participants are asked to determine (1) what hemoglobin chain is affected and (2) the hemoglobinopathy diagnosis.

- **Results**: A total of 365 to 676 laboratories were enrolled in the proficiency testing program each year. Overall, the error rates for determination of the affected globin chain and a hemoglobinopathy diagnosis ranged from 0.6% to 56.5% and 0.5% to 86.5%, respectively. Twenty-three of 66 surveyed hemoglobinopathies (34.8%) had an error rate exceeding the consensus threshold of 20%. The globin gene detection error rate of the compound hemoglobinopathies was significantly higher when compared with just the α (P = 0.01) and β (P = 0.003) gene disorders. However, the error rate for the overall compound α/β-globin interpretation, although high at 23%, was not statistically significant when compared with just the α- or β-globin chain disorders. In repeat testing of the variants, there was no consistent improvement in performance.

- **Conclusions**: The program participants demonstrated variable performance with one-third of the surveys exceeding the 20% error rate.

### A novel 33-gene targeted resequencing panel provides accurate, clinical-grade diagnosis and improves patient management for rare inherited anaemias [^112GAPSf]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). High credibility.

Accurate diagnosis of rare inherited anaemias is challenging, requiring a series of complex and expensive laboratory tests. Targeted next-generation sequencing has been used to investigate these disorders, but the selection of genes on individual panels has been narrow and the validation strategies used have fallen short of the standards required for clinical use. Clinical-grade validation of negative results requires the test to distinguish between the lack of adequate sequencing reads at the locations of known mutations and a real absence of mutations.

To achieve a clinically reliable diagnostic test and minimize false-negative results, we developed an open-source tool (CoverMi) to accurately determine base coverage and the "discoverability" of known mutations for every sample. We validated our 33-gene panel using Sanger sequencing and microarray. Our panel demonstrated 100% specificity and 99.7% sensitivity. We then analyzed 57 clinical samples; molecular diagnoses were made in 22 out of 57 (38.6%), corresponding to 32 mutations of which 16 were new. In all cases, accurate molecular diagnosis had a positive impact on clinical management. Using a validated-based platform for routine molecular diagnosis of previously undiagnosed congenital anaemias is feasible in a clinical diagnostic setting, improves precise diagnosis, and enhances management and counselling of the patient and their family.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^111XZugH]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Fetal sampling involves three possible procedures for obtaining fetal samples: chorionic villus sampling (CVS), amniocentesis, and fetal blood sampling. The risk of miscarriage is low if the fetal sampling is performed in an experienced center.

- **Chorionic villus sampling**: Prenatal diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies is preferably carried out by analyzing a chorionic villus sample during the first trimester of pregnancy, starting from 11 weeks. The CVS provides a source of high-quality DNA in more than sufficient quantity to complete the prenatal DNA analysis. The risk of maternal contamination is low, especially if careful microscopic dissection is performed to remove contaminating maternal decidua before DNA extraction and analysis. However, there is a risk of maternal contamination if the sample is cultured, although this should not be necessary if the sample is of adequate size.

- **Amniocentesis**: Amniocytes can be used for molecular analysis directly spun down from the amniocentesis sample (amniotic fluid, AF). Although the DNA yield is generally lower than from CVS samples, it is usually sufficient for analysis with PCR-based methods. Direct analysis from uncultured amniotic fluid cells should be carried out with caution as fetal cells can be contaminated with maternal cells. Culturing the sample for 10–14 days may increase the amount of fetal DNA obtained and decrease the risk of maternal contamination, although, on very rare occasions, the reverse has been observed. For these reasons, it is recommended that all samples are evaluated by the laboratory.

Reporting must adhere to local legislation, regulations, and acceptable practices. The report should be written clearly to prevent misinterpretation. If possible, it should be accompanied by relevant informational materials, particularly important for health practitioners in non-endemic countries who may lack experience with haemoglobinopathies. The report should advise the referral of carrier couples or affected children to appropriate healthcare professionals and encourage testing for additional family members.

Recommended formats for reporting haematology results can be found in the UK NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia: Handbook for Laboratories.

### Patient acceptability of genotypic testing for hemochromatosis in primary care [^113SN5f7]. Genetics in Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Genetic screening can enable timely detection and treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis (HH). Little is known about patient acceptability of DNA testing compared to conventional phenotypic testing.

Within the HEIRS Study, a large primary-care screening study of HH and iron overload, we randomly assigned participants to receive brief information on either HH genotypic or phenotypic testing and assessed the willingness to accept this test. The study was designed to recruit an equal number of African Americans and Caucasians.

A total of 2500 participants were recruited from the waiting rooms of primary care practices; 2165 participants who self-identified as African Americans and Caucasians were included in the analyses. Overall, 56% accepted a genotypic test versus 58% for a phenotypic test. Adjusting for Field Center (FC), age, gender, race, educational attainment, global health rating, and knowledge of the test, the odds ratio of accepting a genotypic versus phenotypic test was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.02; P = 0.078).

- **Characteristics associated with test acceptance**: Age 45–64 years, female gender, Caucasian race, self-rated health less than "very good", and knowledge of the test.
- **Motivations for test acceptance**: Interest in knowing more about health (81%) and in helping family members (71%).
- **Reasons for refusal**: A need to talk with a doctor (44%), concern about privacy (32%), and dislike of blood drawing (29%).

In this diverse sample of primary care patients, stated acceptance of genotypic testing for HH mutations was observed.

Of the 182,465 individuals screened for HBA1/2 and HBB, 15,694 (8.60%) screened positive for α-thalassemia and 5972 (3.27%) screened positive for a β-hemoglobinopathy. Of those individuals positive for HBA1/2, 14,064 (89.61%) were silent carriers (-α/αα), and 1630 (10.39%) were classified as carriers or affected with hemoglobin H disease (typically -α/-α, --/αα, --/-α). Among β-hemoglobinopathy carriers, 358 (6.01%) had a mild/silent (β+) variant, while the remainder (93.99%) had either a major (β0) or structural HBB variant.

### Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^11195ASM]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder of iron metabolism. Diagnosis is usually based on a combination of various genetic or phenotypic criteria. Decisions regarding screening are complex due to the variable penetrance of mutations of the HFE gene and the lack of definitive trials addressing the benefits and risks of therapeutic phlebotomy in asymptomatic patients or those with only laboratory abnormalities. The purpose of this guideline is to increase physician awareness of hereditary hemochromatosis, particularly the variable penetrance of genetic mutations; aid in case finding; and explain the role of genetic testing. It provides recommendations based on a review of evidence in the accompanying background paper by Schmitt and colleagues. The target audience is internists and other primary care physicians, and the target patient population includes all persons with a probability or susceptibility of developing hereditary hemochromatosis, including relatives of individuals who already have the disease.

### EMQN best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^111i3Mhb]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

In many populations, β-thalassaemia syndromes (and related conditions caused by haemoglobin variants such as Hb S and Hb E) are clinically more relevant than α-thalassaemias, as the severe forms are more common and require lifelong treatment and clinical management. However, in populations with a high prevalence of α°-thalassaemia defects, such as the Chinese and many Southeast Asian populations, or in countries with significant immigrant populations from these areas, α-thalassaemias are also relevant. The severest form of α-thalassaemia, Hb Bart's Hydrops Fetalis, is usually fatal; infants either die in utero (23–38 weeks) or shortly after birth unless subjected to intrauterine blood transfusion therapy. Even with perinatal treatment, it is a very severe condition, with these patients requiring lifetime transfusion therapy and iron chelation. Additionally, some children have long-term neurological complications. Furthermore, hydropic pregnancies are frequently associated with serious complications in the mother, and most pregnancies in which the fetus is diagnosed as affected are terminated due to the increased risk of both fetal and maternal morbidity.

- **The genes and disease-causing variants**: The major haemoglobin in adult life is Hb A, a tetramer composed of two alpha and two beta globin chain subunits (α₂β₂). Each subunit consists of a globin chain wrapped around a haem group containing iron to which O₂ can bind. The single gene encoding β-globin chains is located on the short arm of chromosome 11 (11p15.5), within the so-called β-globin gene cluster.

Gene scanning methods such as DGGE or HRMA are also useful for locating (or excluding) possible variants within the β-globin gene, HBB. They are advantageous because they provide a means to reduce the effort and cost of targeted assays or sequencing and have proved reliable and relatively inexpensive to run. However, since they do not definitively characterize nucleotide changes, when used within a diagnostic setting, it is imperative to subsequently characterize any nucleotide variation indicated, using either targeted direct variant assays or automatic sequencing.

Small deletions can be detected by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of an amplified β gene product. Some known larger deletions that remove the β-globin gene may be identified by gap-PCR (including Hb Lepore, some δβ-thalassaemia and HPFH deletions) or more recently by MLPA using one of the commercially available kits.

- **Common Hb variants**: The clinically important variants, Hb S, Hb C, Hb E, Hb D-Punjab, and Hb O-Arab, can be diagnosed by dot blot hybridization, the ARMS technique, or direct sequencing. All except Hb C can also be diagnosed by RE-PCR. For the many other haemoglobin variants, positive identification at the DNA level is achieved by selective globin gene amplification and DNA sequence analysis.

- **Reporting molecular genetic (DNA) analysis results**: It is strongly recommended that molecular genetic analysis for all haemoglobinopathy cases be reported in relation to the haematology screening results, confirming that the genotype and phenotype are consistent.

### Expanded carrier screening: Counseling and considerations [^116ivoCs]. Human Genetics (2020). Low credibility.

The primary goal of carrier screening is to identify asymptomatic individuals who carry variants associated with genetic diseases, to inform them about the risk of having a child with a genetic disease. Carrier screening can be accomplished through different approaches, including ethnicity-based screening, pan-ethnic screening, and expanded carrier screening (ECS). The decision to pursue carrier screening is voluntary. ECS takes a broad approach by screening for a large number of genetic diseases irrespective of ethnic background and ideally is performed prior to conception.

ECS has many benefits, including that it does not depend on the accuracy of reported ancestry, as well as its greater yield of information that can be used for reproductive decision-making. However, there are also many important limitations of ECS to consider, ranging from the yield of unexpected information, uncertainty about the phenotype of a particular disease for which an individual is a carrier, and greater downstream costs associated with further testing and genetic counseling. Detailed genetic counseling both prior to and after ECS is essential in order for patients to understand the breadth of this approach, potential and actual results, and limitations.

Hemoglobinopathies, including sickle cell disease and related disorders, are a group of single gene diseases with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. These diseases are characterized by a heterogeneous range of symptoms related to the risk of hemolysis due to mutations that cause malformation or reduced synthesis of hemoglobin or its subunits. Hemoglobinopathies are now the most common life-threatening, monogenic group of disorders worldwide. An estimated 3.0% of people in the Americas are carriers of a hemoglobinopathy variant that can contribute to clinically recognized disease.

Population-wide newborn screening (NBS) for sickle cell disease has been implemented in many jurisdictions in recent decades. Pre-symptomatic identification of sickle cell disease by NBS facilitates early initiation of preventive interventions to reduce the occurrence and consequences of acute crises. These interventions include, for example, penicillin prophylaxis, pneumococcal vaccination, and counselling of parents to manage symptoms and monitor for signs of acute crises. In addition to identifying children with sickle cell disease, NBS also incidentally identifies children with other hemoglobinopathies such as alpha- and beta-thalassemia, as well as a much larger group of children in the screened population who are unaffected carriers of pathogenic hemoglobin mutations. In this way, sickle cell disease screening differs from NBS for most other inherited diseases that are screening targets, for which only a fraction of carriers are identified in the screening process.

### An accurate and affordable test for the rapid diagnosis of sickle cell disease could revolutionize the outlook for affected children born in resource-limited settings [^111RLD39]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Key to tackling the early mortality of children with SCD is prompt diagnosis. This allows for the education of parents on how best to care for their affected children and recognize important danger signs. It also facilitates the prevention of complications through targeted use of vaccinations, antibiotics, and anti-malarial drugs. Such measures, which could be easily afforded by many countries within the region, have been successful in reducing high early mortality previously seen in other parts of the world. There is no reason to suspect that the same should not be true if widely implemented in resource-limited settings. However, at the time of writing, diagnostic facilities for SCD remain poor throughout many such regions, often limited to private facilities and beyond the reach of the majority who would benefit.

A number of different methods can be used to diagnose SCD, of which the most common are haemoglobin electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), isoelectric focusing, and molecular approaches such as PCR. However, all require well-trained staff working with well-maintained equipment in reasonable laboratory facilities, a reliable supply of power, and systems for the delivery and storage of reagents. The commercial costs of these alone can typically run to $5–10 per test. Moreover, laboratory-based approaches require functional systems for sample transport and the return of results. Although pilot newborn screening studies in a number of resource-limited countries have used such approaches, diagnostic facilities remain inadequate.

### Practical and ethical issues with genetic screening [^115fqFFT]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology Education Program (2005). Low credibility.

Clinical hematologists are currently facing an expanding array of genetic-based tools designed to identify a patient's disease risk. While many of these disease-specific tests are readily available, validation studies are necessary. Moreover, genetic-based tests are reaching their technical limits, such as testing a single cell prior to embryo selection and transfer for couples at risk of genetic disease. Consequently, there is a potential for misdiagnosis or data misinterpretation.

As new genetic testing opportunities proliferate, hematologists must be cognizant of the medical and legal issues associated with their use. They must also consider the psychological, ethical, and social implications inherent in this burgeoning field of genomic-based medicine.

### Emqn best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^115pzYby]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Blood samples should be obtained from both parents to confirm the phenotype of the parents by a full blood count and a haemoglobinopathy screen, such as electrophoresis, and as a source of control DNA for molecular analysis. Copies of haematology results should be sent to the molecular diagnostic laboratory. This process should be repeated with every prenatal diagnosis that a couple undergoes, unless the identity of both parents is absolutely certain.

There are cases where a carrier woman requests prenatal diagnosis although her partner is unavailable for testing. In such situations, it is important to evaluate the risk of a major haemoglobinopathy in the fetus. If the fetal DNA diagnosis identifies the sickle cell or thalassaemia variant inherited from the mother, then it is recommended that the entire β-globin gene of the fetal DNA is sequenced to exclude a second HBB variant. In the report, it should be stated that the paternal genotype is unknown and that DNA analysis cannot exclude all haemoglobin disorders.

### Clinical utility of next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of hereditary haemolytic anaemias [^111H77xK]. British Journal of Haematology (2016). Low credibility.

Hereditary haemolytic anaemias are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorders characterized by increased red cell destruction, with consequences ranging from innocuous to severe, life-threatening anaemia. Diagnostic laboratories endeavour to assist clinicians in reaching the exact patient diagnosis by using tests based principally on morphological and biochemical techniques. However, these routine studies may be inconclusive, particularly in newborn infants and when transfusions have recently been administered. The large number and size of the potentially involved genes also pose a practical challenge for molecular diagnosis using routine sequencing approaches.

To overcome these diagnostic shortcomings, we have utilized next-generation sequencing to provide a high-throughput, highly sensitive assay. We developed a panel interrogating 28 genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins and enzymes, with sequencing coverage of the coding regions, splice site junctions, deep intronic, and regulatory regions. We then evaluated 19 samples, including infants with unexplained extreme hyperbilirubinaemia and patients with transfusion-dependent haemolytic anaemia. Where possible, inheritance patterns of pathogenic mutations were determined by sequencing immediate relatives. We conclude that this next-generation sequencing panel could be a cost-effective approach to molecular diagnosis of hereditary haemolytic anaemia, especially when the family history is uninformative or when routine laboratory testing fails to identify the causative haemolytic process.

### Common α-globin variants modify hematologic and other clinical phenotypes in sickle cell trait and disease [^116164YY]. PLoS Genetics (2018). Low credibility.

SCT is associated with lower HbA1c measured using standard high-performance liquid chromatography assays, thereby limiting the clinical utility of HbA1c in screening and monitoring of glucose intolerance. In general, African Americans have higher HbA1c levels for the same level of fasting glucose compared to whites. Our findings in JHS suggest that the −α3.7 deletion may account, at least in part, for the higher HbA1c levels among African Americans. Since the glycated residues of HbA1c reside on the N-terminus of the hemoglobin β-chain, the relative increase in the proportion of β-chain synthesis among α-thalassemia carriers may constitute a possible mechanism for the apparent increase in HbA1c. Similar to CKD and anemia, co-inheritance of α-thalassemia attenuated the HbA1c-lowering effect of SCT, suggesting that a lower HbS percentage may be associated with less interference with the HbA1c assay or result in improved erythrocyte survival.

### Molecular characterization and PCR detection of a deletional HPFH: Application to rapid prenatal diagnosis for compound heterozygotes of this defect with beta-thalassemia in a Chinese family [^111tnqEK]. American Journal of Hematology (2000). Low credibility.

Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) is one of the hemoglobinopathies in which the fetal gamma-globin genes remain active in adult life. Most HPFHs are caused by a large deletion involving a variable extent of the DNA segment on the beta-globin gene cluster. We report the molecular defects associated with a deletional HPFH, which has previously been described in Cambodians and Vietnamese, in two unrelated Chinese individuals.

To define the sequence around the breakpoints of the deletion, both the deletion junction fragment and the normal DNA across the breakpoints were cloned by PCR and sequenced. We found that the 5' breakpoint is located between nucleotides 986 and 987 upstream from the start point of the beta-globin gene, which further confirmed the Southeast Asian (SEA) HPFH deletion previously determined. The 3' breakpoint, clarified for the first time by us, lies approximately 2.3 kb downstream from the 3' HS1 site of the beta-globin gene. It is suggested that deletions result from a non-homologous recombination event.

Based on our novel sequence data, we designed a PCR amplification method with three primers bridging the 3' breakpoint. Using this method and reverse dot blot (RDB) for detecting beta-thalassemia mutations, a Chinese family with a 6-year-old propositus with severe thalassemia intermediate was found to be compound heterozygotes of HPFH defects with beta-thalassemia. The fetal genomic DNA diagnosis showed the same results as those in the propositus.

### β-thalassemias: Paradigmatic diseases for scientific discoveries and development of innovative therapies [^116vNx3d]. Haematologica (2015). Low credibility.

β-thalassemias are monogenic disorders characterized by defective synthesis of the β-globin chain, one of the major components of adult hemoglobin. A large number of mutations in the β-globin gene or its regulatory elements have been associated with β-thalassemias. Due to the complexity of the regulation of the β-globin gene and the role of red cells in many physiological processes, patients can manifest a large spectrum of phenotypes, and clinical requirements vary from patient to patient. It is important to consider the major differences in the light of potential novel therapeutics. This review summarizes the main discoveries and mechanisms associated with the synthesis of β-globin and abnormal erythropoiesis, as well as novel therapies.

### Challenging the dogma of the healthy heterozygote: Implications for newborn screening policies and practices [^1111XkMt]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Heterozygous (carrier) status for an autosomal recessive condition is traditionally considered to lack significance for an individual's health, but this assumption has been challenged by a growing body of evidence. Carriers of several autosomal recessive disorders and some X-linked diseases are potentially at risk for the pathology manifest in homozygotes. This minireview provides an overview of the literature regarding health risks to carriers of two common autosomal recessive conditions on the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel: sickle cell disease [sickle cell trait (SCT)] and cystic fibrosis (CF). We also consider and comment on bioethical and policy implications for newborn blood screening (NBS).

Health risks for heterozygotes, while relatively low for individuals, are often influenced by intrinsic (e.g. other genomic variants or co-morbidities) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, which present opportunities for personalized genomic medicine and risk counseling. They create a special challenge, however, for developing screening/follow-up policies and for genetic counseling, particularly after identification and reporting of heterozygote status through NBS.

Although more research is needed, this minireview of the SCT and CF literature at the time of writing leads us to propose that blanket terms such as "healthy heterozygotes" or "unaffected carriers" should be superseded in communications about NBS results, in favor of a more nuanced paradigm of setting expectations for health outcomes with "genotype-to-risk". In the molecular era of NBS, it remains clear that public health need…

### NGS4THAL, a One-Stop Molecular Diagnosis and Carrier Screening Tool for Thalassemia and Other Hemoglobinopathies by Next-Generation Sequencing [^112ZLNZQ]. The Journal of molecular diagnostics (2022). Low credibility.

Thalassemia is one of the most common genetic diseases and a major health threat worldwide. Accurate, efficient, and scalable analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is much needed for its molecular diagnosis and carrier screening. We developed NGS4THAL, a bioinformatics analysis pipeline analyzing NGS data to detect pathogenic variants for thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies. NGS4THAL realigns ambiguously mapped NGS reads derived from the homologous Hb gene clusters for accurate detection of point mutations and small insertions/deletions. It uses a combination of complementary structural variant (SV) detection tools and an in-house database of control data containing specific SVs to achieve accurate detection of the complex SV types. Detected variants are matched with those in HbVar (A Database of Human Hemoglobin Variants and Thalassemia Mutations), allowing recognition of known pathogenic variants, including disease modifiers. Tested on simulation data, NGS4THAL achieved high sensitivity and specificity. For targeted NGS sequencing data from samples with laboratory-confirmed pathogenic Hb variants, it achieved 100% detection accuracy. Application of NGS4THAL on whole genome sequencing data from unrelated studies revealed thalassemia mutation carrier rates for Hong Kong Chinese and Northern Vietnamese that were consistent with previous reports. NGS4THAL is a highly accurate and efficient molecular diagnosis tool for thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies based on tailored analysis of NGS data and may be scaled for population carrier screening.

### Prenatal diagnosis of Hbe-lepore and Hb lepore-β-thalassemia: The importance of accurate genotyping of the couple at risk [^113LXUmf]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2012). Low credibility.

To accurately define unusual genotypes in compound heterozygotes for hemoglobinopathies before undergoing prenatal diagnosis, the study employed several methods. **Methods**: The HPLC results demonstrated one parent in both Case A and Case B, as well as a child in Case C, to be HbE-beta-thalassemia. However, this finding did not align with molecular findings. Consequently, additional screening of their grandparents and DNA analysis for HbLepore were conducted.

- **Results**: A notable hump in the peak within the HbA₂ window (10–15%) observed in one of the grandparents raised suspicions of a large deletion. Further molecular screening for HbLepore determined that Case A was compound heterozygous for HbLepore-Hollandia-(δ22/β50) and HbE; Case B for HbLepore-Boston-Washington-(δ287/β116) and IVS-I-5(G > C); and Case C for HbLepore-Hollandia-(δ22/β50) and HbE. The fetuses were identified as HbE trait in Case A and HbLepore trait in Cases B and C.

- **Conclusion**: Accurate genotyping of the couple at risk referred for prenatal diagnosis is crucial to recognizing uncommon genotypic combinations in compound heterozygous cases. Extended family studies are often beneficial to prevent fetal misdiagnosis.

### Newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies in California [^113MJTr3]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Newborn screening (NBS) for hemoglobinopathies facilitates early identification of affected individuals to ensure the prompt institution of comprehensive medical care for affected newborns in California. When linked to extensive follow-up and education, NBS has been shown to significantly reduce mortality in children with sickle cell disease. Due to changing immigration patterns from Asia and Latin America, the State of California has witnessed an increased prevalence of clinically significant hemoglobin (Hb) disorders, including those resulting from novel genotypes. In 1999, newborn screening for Hb H disorders was incorporated into the statewide hemoglobinopathy screening program.

- **Procedure**: Primary screening for hemoglobin variants was performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Confirmatory testing on hemoglobinopathy mutations was performed using electrophoresis techniques and genotyping methods.

- **Results**: Of 530,000 newborn samples screened annually in California, 2,118 samples were referred to the Hemoglobin Reference Laboratory (HRL) for confirmatory testing between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2006 (0.05%). Sickle cell disease was most frequently observed (1 in 6,600 births), followed by alpha-thalassemia (1 in 9,000 births) and beta-thalassemia disease (1 in 55,000 births). The confirmatory analysis modified the initial screening in 5% of cases and revealed 25 rare or new genotypes. Diverse ethnicities were associated with hemoglobin mutations, including Southeast Asian, Black, Indian/Asian, Middle Eastern, and Hispanic.

- **Conclusions**: The Califor

### Emqn best practice guidelines for molecular and haematology methods for carrier identification and prenatal diagnosis of the haemoglobinopathies [^112Bqx85]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Methods for DNA analysis

Almost all methods for DNA analysis of haemoglobinopathies currently in use are based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There are many different PCR-based techniques that can be used to detect globin gene variants. Those used for detecting and/or characterizing nucleotide variations include the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), restriction-endonuclease PCR (RE-PCR), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), high-resolution melting analysis (HRMA), Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, real-time PCR, reverse dot blot analysis, and microarrays (the latter two usually as commercially available systems rather than as in-house protocols).

For detecting and/or characterizing deletions, Southern blot analysis has been largely replaced by PCR-based methods, including gap-PCR, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), and array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH). Each method is recommended in the context of best practice, having its own advantages and limitations. The particular methods chosen by a laboratory for diagnosing globin gene nucleotide variants or deletions depend not only on the technical expertise available but also on the type and variety of variants likely to be encountered in the individuals (population groups) being tested. All molecular genetic methods should be validated before clinical use.

It is paramount that all DNA diagnostic laboratories take appropriate measures to preclude false-positive and especially false-negative results.

### Health services use by children identified as heterozygous hemoglobinopathy mutation carriers via newborn screening [^117UpkGN]. BMC Pediatrics (2021).

While generally considered clinically benign, sickle cell trait (i.e. carrier status for the HbS variant) has been associated in some studies with a risk of sickling symptoms in particular circumstances, such as during extreme physical exertion and/or increased altitude. While uncertainty remains about the nature, severity, and extent of the risk associated with carrier status for sickle cell disease, particularly for the general population of carriers, it is relevant to a broader debate concerning the disclosure of carrier results incidentally identified by newborn screening (NBS).

Specifically, while most NBS programs have opted for disclosure of all carrier status results to families, some have argued that this may impose an undue burden, requiring families to be informed of incidentally generated and clinically ambiguous findings when they may neither need nor prefer to know. Studies of family preferences regarding the disclosure of carrier status identified by NBS, including preferences about communicating this information to the children themselves once they reach adolescence, have yielded inconsistent findings.

Our research group previously conducted surveys and focus groups among healthcare providers, parents of carrier infants, and new parents to evaluate consumer and provider attitudes to inform policies on carrier status disclosure. Responses were mixed, with most new parents considering the carrier status to be a benign finding; however, uncertainty persisted among some parents, and disclosure preferences varied.
