## Question

Toe paralysis after sting ray attack

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing toe paralysis after a stingray attack. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and analgesia, including hot water immersion and basic wound care. Then, I should verify the focused diagnostic workup for new paralysis, including neurovascular exam, compartment assessment, imaging for retained barbs, and labs with cultures. Next, I will map the differential diagnosis mechanisms for paralysis and match them to targeted interventions. Finally, I need to confirm evidence-based management including antibiotics, surgery when indicated, rehabilitation, prevention, prognosis, and structured follow-up, while checking key data points against the literature at each step.

> Let me first confirm priorities in the acute phase: get the patient out of the water safely, secure the airway, breathing, and circulation, and treat pain rapidly, since stingray envenomation is profoundly painful and early systemic manifestations, though uncommon, must be excluded; hot water immersion up to about 45°C for 30–90 minutes is first-line to inactivate heat-labile venom components and provides rapid analgesia, with one ED series showing 88% complete relief within 30 minutes in acute presentations, so I should initiate this while monitoring to avoid scald burns and verifying temperature and duration at the bedside [^112WE39u] [^1153xPdY] [^115A2ZRp].

> I need to ensure meticulous wound care: copious irrigation to remove debris, visual inspection for sheath or spine fragments, and avoidance of harmful measures such as suctioning the wound or applying tourniquets, as these either introduce pathogens or worsen ischemia; I should also confirm tetanus status and update prophylaxis when indicated because these are penetrating marine injuries with contamination risk [^114MBbj5] [^115A2ZRp].

> Next, I should review the history and focused exam for paralysis: the timing of weakness matters because immediate paralysis raises concern for direct nerve laceration or evolving compartment syndrome, whereas delayed deficits suggest retained foreign body, infectious complications, or inflammatory neuropathy; on exam, I must document motor and sensory deficits in named distributions, palpate distal pulses, assess capillary refill, and test for pain with passive stretch to screen for compartment syndrome, while also looking for infection signs and remembering vascular trauma such as posterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm has been reported after stingray injuries [^1111zd4i].

> Now, imaging — let me think this through and verify assumptions: I will start with plain radiographs to look for retained radiopaque fragments, but wait, I should verify that not all stingray materials are visible on X-ray, so if suspicion remains despite negative radiographs, I will escalate to ultrasound for small retained material or abscess and to MRI for deep space infection, osteomyelitis, or nerve compression; case reports highlight that retained fragments can persist for months and drive chronic inflammation and neuropathy until surgically removed, so I should not discount this possibility even with initially normal films [^111gwUfa] [^1111zd4i] [^112TM2wf].

> I should double-check the laboratory workup: obtain CBC, ESR, and CRP to support or refute infection, and collect wound cultures if drainage is present or debridement is planned, ensuring media and stains capture typical marine organisms such as Vibrio, Aeromonas, Mycobacterium marinum, and Erysipelothrix; given the marine environment and puncture mechanism, early empiric coverage that anticipates these organisms is prudent while awaiting culture-directed narrowing [^117Ck2rP] [^114MBbj5] [^112TM2wf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without a structured differential: direct nerve injury from the barb can cause immediate anesthesia and weakness in a digital nerve distribution; evolving compartment syndrome can present with severe pain out of proportion and pain on passive stretch followed by progressive sensory and motor loss; retained foreign body with granulomatous reaction can compress nerves and present weeks to months later with recurrent swelling and neuropathic symptoms; deep infection, including Vibrio or Aeromonas, can rapidly destroy tissue and involve nerves; vascular injury such as posterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm or transection can cause ischemic neuropathy and cool, pale digits; and although stingray venom is primarily painful and myotoxic, I should consider venom-associated inflammatory neuropathy by analogy to other fish envenomations like stonefish, where late peripheral neuropathies are reported, albeit less commonly in stingrays [^112TM2wf] [^111gwUfa] [^1111zd4i] [^114HTPHb].

> If imaging identifies a retained barb or sheath, I will now examine the indications for operative management: surgical exploration and removal are indicated to eliminate the nidus for ongoing inflammation, infection, and nerve compression, and I should plan anesthesia and hemostasis carefully in the toe to protect neurovascular structures while ensuring complete extraction of foreign material confirmed intraoperatively or with post-procedure imaging if needed [^111gwUfa] [^112TM2wf].

> For suspected or confirmed infection, I should verify that empiric antimicrobials cover marine Gram-negatives and atypical organisms, for example doxycycline plus a fluoroquinolone, or ceftazidime plus clindamycin for initial coverage, with transition to culture-directed therapy; if Mycobacterium marinum is isolated, prolonged multidrug therapy such as doxycycline with rifampin for 3–6 months alongside debridement is often required, and I need to counsel that invasive NTM infections may necessitate multiple staged surgeries for cure [^117Ck2rP].

> If compartment syndrome is on the table, this is a surgical emergency, and I need to confirm the diagnosis clinically rather than delaying for pressures in the setting of clear findings; prompt fasciotomy of involved foot compartments is required to prevent irreversible nerve and muscle injury, and I should not let the marine envenomation context distract from standard compartment syndrome principles [^112TM2wf].

> For vascular complications, I will now examine perfusion critically and, if abnormal, obtain urgent vascular surgery consultation because pseudoaneurysms and arterial injuries after stingray punctures can demand operative or endovascular repair to restore flow and mitigate downstream neuropathy and tissue loss [^1111zd4i].

> Supportive care for nerve injury requires early rehabilitation; let me consider maintaining joint range of motion, edema control, desensitization, and neuropathic pain strategies such as gabapentinoids when indicated, alongside orthotic support if weakness impairs gait, while I continue to reassess for reversible causes like retained fragments or compressive lesions that would shift management back toward surgery [^112TM2wf].

> To prevent long-term complications, I should confirm that retained fragments have been excluded with appropriate imaging when symptoms persist, encourage cautious early mobilization once pain is controlled to avoid stiffness, educate patients to return promptly for signs of infection or delayed neurologic change, and arrange multidisciplinary follow-up with orthopedics, infectious diseases, and rehabilitation medicine for complex or nonresolving cases, recognizing that delayed surgical exploration may still be curative months after injury when foreign material is present [^111gwUfa] [^112TM2wf].

> Prognosis-wise, I need to think in terms of mechanism: transient neuropraxia from edema or pain inhibition may improve over weeks with supportive care, while direct nerve transection, severe infection, or missed compartment syndrome confer a guarded outlook and risk of permanent deficits; chronic neuropathic sequelae and contractures have been more clearly described after other venomous fish like stonefish, underscoring the importance of early, mechanism-directed management in stingray injuries and the need for structured follow-up at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months, with repeat electrodiagnostics at 6–8 weeks if weakness persists to refine prognosis and guide therapy [^114HTPHb] [^112TM2wf] [^111gwUfa].

> Summarizing the algorithm in my head before closing, and let me double-check the sequence: in the acute phase, provide hot water immersion, analgesia, wound irrigation, tetanus update, and early imaging for retained spines; when paralysis is present, immediately assess vascular status and compartment signs and obtain surgical consultation; if paralysis is delayed, escalate to ultrasound or MRI to uncover retained material, abscess, or osteomyelitis and initiate culture-directed antibiotics; and in the chronic phase, combine rehabilitation and neuropathic pain control with targeted operative interventions when a mechanical or infectious driver is identified, reaffirming these steps against the ED series on hot water immersion effectiveness and contemporary reviews of marine envenomation management [^112WE39u] [^112TM2wf].

Toe paralysis following a stingray injury is most often due to **direct nerve trauma** from the barb, with contributions from venom-induced neurotoxicity, ischemia, and secondary infection [^112TM2wf] [^115A2ZRp]. Immediate management includes **hot water immersion**, thorough wound exploration for retained barbs, and **empiric antibiotics targeting marine pathogens** [^112WE39u] [^112TM2wf]. Early **surgical intervention** is critical when foreign bodies or infection are present [^111gwUfa] [^114MBbj5]. Prognosis depends on the **extent of nerve injury** and the **promptness of care**; persistent deficits may occur if nerve damage is severe or treatment is delayed [^112TM2wf].

## Pathophysiology of toe paralysis after stingray envenomation

Toe paralysis after stingray envenomation results from a **combination of mechanisms**:

- **Direct nerve trauma**: The barb can lacerate or transect digital nerves, causing immediate paralysis [^116cykW8] [^112TM2wf].

- **Venom-induced neurotoxicity**: Stingray venom contains neurotoxic components that disrupt nerve conduction, leading to paralysis [^115A2ZRp].

- **Ischemic injury**: Venom-induced vasoconstriction or thrombosis can cause ischemia, resulting in nerve damage and paralysis.

- **Secondary infection**: Marine bacteria (e.g. Vibrio, Aeromonas) can cause severe infections, leading to nerve damage and paralysis [^114MBbj5] [^1111zd4i].

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation

Typical presentation includes:

- **Immediate severe pain**: At the sting site [^112WE39u].

- **Swelling and erythema**: Localized inflammation [^112TM2wf].

- **Puncture wound**: Often with retained barb fragments [^111gwUfa].

- **Neurological deficits**: Numbness, tingling, or paralysis of the affected toe [^115A2ZRp].

Diagnostic evaluation includes:

- **Physical examination**: Assessing neurological function and identifying retained foreign bodies [^112TM2wf].

- **Imaging studies**: X-rays or ultrasound to detect retained barbs or foreign bodies [^111gwUfa].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, CRP, ESR, and wound cultures to assess infection and inflammation [^114MBbj5] [^112TM2wf].

---

## Immediate medical management

Immediate management focuses on **pain control**, **wound care**, and **infection prevention** [^112TM2wf]:

- **Hot water immersion**: Immersing the affected limb in 43–45°C water for 30–90 minutes to inactivate venom and relieve pain [^112WE39u] [^1153xPdY].

- **Wound exploration and debridement**: Thoroughly explore and debride the wound to remove retained barbs or foreign bodies [^111gwUfa] [^112TM2wf].

- **Empiric antibiotic therapy**: Initiate antibiotics covering marine bacteria (e.g. doxycycline plus ceftazidime or fluoroquinolone) [^114HTPHb] [^117Ck2rP] [^114MBbj5].

- **Tetanus prophylaxis**: Administer tetanus vaccine if indicated [^115A2ZRp].

---

## Long-term management and rehabilitation

Long-term management focuses on **neurological recovery** and preventing **complications**. Physical therapy maintains joint mobility, prevents contractures, and improves muscle strength, while occupational therapy enhances functional independence and supports adaptation to any permanent deficits. Pain management includes NSAIDs, gabapentin, or pregabalin for neuropathic pain. Severe nerve injuries may require surgical repair or grafting [^112TM2wf].

---

## Prognosis and potential complications

Prognosis depends on the **severity of nerve injury** and the **promptness of medical intervention**. Mild nerve injuries typically recover within weeks to months with conservative management, whereas severe injuries may result in permanent paralysis or chronic neuropathic pain [^112TM2wf]. Complications include chronic neuropathic pain, recurrent or chronic infections, and permanent loss of toe function [^111gwUfa].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive measures include wearing **protective footwear** in shallow water and **shuffling the feet** to alert stingrays and avoid stepping on them [^112TM2wf]. Individuals should seek prompt medical care following a stingray injury [^112WE39u].

Toe paralysis after stingray envenomation is primarily due to **direct nerve trauma**, with additional contributions from venom-induced neurotoxicity, ischemic injury, and secondary infection. Immediate management includes **hot water immersion**, wound exploration, and **empiric antibiotics**, while long-term care focuses on **neurological recovery** and preventing **complications** [^112WE39u] [^112TM2wf].

### Finger flexor tenosynovitis from stonefish envenomation injury [^117Ck2rP]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The rates of surgical necessity for non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infections of the hand approach 100%. Additionally, multiple surgeries are often required for the eradication of invasive infections, with up to seven repeat surgeries reportedly required for a single patient. Patients should always be counseled on this possible need for multiple surgeries at the time of diagnosis.

Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics for a marine puncture wound should include coverage for Vibrio, Aeromonas, Mycobacterium marinum, and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae species. An empirical regimen includes doxycycline in combination with a fluoroquinolone or ceftazidime and clindamycin for the initial 48 hours, followed by an additional week of Augmentin and doxycycline. If an overt infection exists, the antibiotic regimen should be based on culture sensitivity results. If Mycobacterium marinum has been identified as the infectious agent, a two- or three-drug regimen may be used and anti-tuberculous drugs such as ethambutol or rifampin should be considered. The duration of antibiotic therapy ranges from 3 to 6 months when adjunctive surgical therapy has been performed.

Stonefish envenomation injuries present a unique medical challenge for physicians. Initial treatment should be focused on the acute envenomation toxicity, followed by empiric prophylactic antibiotics tailored to a marine bacterial profile. Should a delayed secondary infection arise, the physician needs to maintain a high level of suspicion for an NTM species as the causative agent. Invasive infections may require a combination of serial surgical debridement and a multidrug antibiotic approach.

### Stingray envenomation: a retrospective review of clinical presentation and treatment in 119 cases [^112WE39u]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). High credibility.

Stingray stings are common along coastal regions of this country and the world. The tail of the stingray contains a barbed stinger attached to a venom gland and enclosed within an integumentary sheath. During a sting, the stinger and sheath can become embedded in the soft tissue of the victim, injecting venom into the wound. Stingray venom most often causes severe pain on contact, although the exact mechanism of toxicity is not certain. Hot water immersion of the affected extremity has been reported to be effective in relieving pain associated with envenomation, but large studies of this therapy have not been performed.

We retrospectively reviewed stingray stings presenting to our Emergency Department (ED) over an 8-year period. Cases were divided into acute (group 1, within 24 hours of the sting) and subacute (group 2, 24 hours or more after the sting) presentations. Charts were abstracted for information concerning the victim's history, physical examination, treatment, diagnostic imaging, and outcome, including the effectiveness of hot water immersion as analgesia and the use of antimicrobials.

A total of 119 cases were identified and abstracted, 100 in group 1 and 19 in group 2. Of the group 1 patients initially treated with hot water immersion alone, 88% had complete relief of pain within 30 minutes without the administration of any other analgesic. In the patients who initially received a dose of analgesic along with hot water immersion, none required a second dose of analgesics, and all had complete pain relief before discharge. There were no adverse effects reported, such as thermal burns.

### Finger flexor tenosynovitis from stonefish envenomation injury [^114HTPHb]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

The venom consists of four biologically active factors: hyaluronidase fraction, capillary permeability factor, toxic fraction, and a pain-producing factor. As a whole, the venom is an unstable, heat-labile, high molecular weight protein with both myotoxic and neurotoxic properties. Acute manifestations are characterized by intense pain at the wound site, erythema, ecchymosis, lymphedema, and paresthesias. However, chronic symptoms of the venom manifest as slowly healing ulcers at the wound site, continuing allodynic manifestations, and joint contractures. Late complications may include secondary infections, foreign body granulomas, and peripheral neuropathies.

First-line treatment of scorpaenid envenomation should include immediate immersion of the affected extremity in nonscalding hot water of up to 45°C for 30 to 90 minutes to inactivate the heat-labile components of the venom. Grossly contaminated or infected wounds should be cultured, and the use of special culture media for Vibrio species or acid-fast stains for marine aquatic mycobacteria should be considered. Antibiotics are recommended for marine envenomation wounds of the hand or foot due to the high incidence of ulceration, necrosis, and secondary infection. Commonly, patients sustaining envenomation injuries to the hand demonstrate complete resolution of symptoms within 1 to 2 weeks and may require an average hospital admission stay of 4 days.

### Probable irukandji-like syndrome in the US Florida Keys [^116BhGmd]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Sixteen of the world's 50 known species of box jellyfish are associated with Irukandji syndrome, which involves a multitude of delayed reactionary and potentially life-threatening symptoms. The most common species associated with Irukandji syndrome is Carukia barnesi (C. barnesi), a very small member of the Carybdeid family. These box jellyfish are native to Australian waters, where most cases of Irukandji syndrome occur. However, cases of Irukandji-like syndrome have been reported worldwide after envenomation by species other than C. barnesi, including non-Carybdeid jellyfish. Herein, we report a probable new case of Irukandji-like syndrome in the US Florida Keys, a region where C. barnesi has not been recorded. Although it is unclear exactly which jellyfish are the causal organisms, a clustering of four incidents in the western Florida Keys suggests that jellyfish other than C. barnesi, or possibly non-Carybdeid jellyfish, are causing Irukandji-like syndromes in this area.

### Marine envenomation in Okinawa: Overview and treatment concept [^113ufgMr]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Okinawa Prefecture is a popular tourist destination due to its beaches and reefs. The reefs host a large variety of animals, including a number of venomous species. Because of the popularity of the reefs and marine activities, people are frequently in close contact with dangerous venomous species and, thus, are exposed to potential envenomation.

Commonly encountered venomous animals throughout Okinawa include:

- **Invertebrates**: Cone snail, sea urchin, crown-of-thorns starfish, blue-ringed octopus, box jellyfish, and fire coral.
- **Vertebrates**: Stonefish, lionfish, sea snake, and moray eel.

Treatment for marine envenomation can involve first aid, hot water immersion, antivenom, supportive care, regional anesthesia, and pharmaceutical administration. Information on venomous animals, their toxins, and treatment should be well understood by prehospital care providers and physicians practicing in the prefecture.

### Identification and characterization of a novel botulinum neurotoxin [^111HW4m8]. Nature Communications (2017). Low credibility.

BoNT/X induced flaccid paralysis in vivo in mice.

We next sought to determine whether BoNT/X is active in vivo using a well-established non-lethal assay in mice, known as the Digit Abduction Score (DAS) assay, which measures local muscle paralysis following injection of BoNTs into mouse hind limb muscles. BoNTs cause flaccid paralysis of limb muscles, which is manifested as the failure to spread the toes in response to a startle stimulus. We injected ligated X-FL (0.5 μg, activated by trypsin treatment) into the gastrocnemius muscles of the right hind limb in mice, which induced typical flaccid paralysis and the failure of toes to spread (Fig. 4f), indicating that BoNT/X is capable of causing flaccid paralysis in vivo. We note that the potency of ligated X-FL appears to be much lower than other BoNTs in this assay. To further confirm the low toxicity of ligated X-FL, we injected mice with 1 μg of ligated X-FL intraperitoneally (n = 3). No mice showed any systemic effects, and all survived at this dose. Thus, ligated X-FL has a rather low toxicity in vivo in mice compared with other native BoNTs, which usually have lethal doses at low picogram levels per mouse.

### Do nerve resection, amputation, and immunotherapy relieve causalgia in the long term [^116fnNfb]. Pain (2025). Low credibility.

Reported here is the unpublished long follow-up (22 years and 14 years) of two patients with longstanding causalgia, initially successfully treated by nerve resection and previously reported in detail in this journal. There is very little such long-term data available for causalgia of this nature. This represents a rare opportunity to reevaluate these two patients, who began their stories not too differently but followed very different paths.

One of these patients (CH) experienced causalgia following a traumatic right infraorbital nerve injury. His pain was relieved by nerve resection with no recurrence of facial pain for over 22 years. The other patient (HG) endured many years of intractable complex regional pain syndrome type 2 of the common peroneal and sural nerves following a left leg injury in childhood. HG experienced 4 years and 4 months of good relief following nerve resection. Subsequently, severe pain recurrence and incipient gangrene of the left leg necessitated amputation, which saved the leg but did not alleviate the pain. Additionally, HG suffered from a worsening severe skin rash and frequent respiratory infections.

The pathology of the amputated limb suggested an autoimmune response, and further tests confirmed the presence of autoimmune antibodies and immunoglobulin deficiency. It was only after immunotherapy that these problems resolved, with improvement persisting for 4 years and 9 months. There are few long-term assessments of causalgia treated by nerve resection, amputation, and/or immunotherapy. Short-term failures of these treatments may be attributed to treatable conditions, such as immunological abnormalities.

### Genetic neurological channelopathies: Molecular genetics and clinical phenotypes [^111bEJPv]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). High credibility.

Management of periodic paralysis primarily involves trigger avoidance. Oral potassium can expedite attack resolution in Hypo PP, whereas the intake of sweets and mild exercise can hasten attack resolution in Hyper PP. Inhaled salbutamol has been demonstrated to be effective in treating attacks of Hyper PP. Occasionally, prophylactic treatment is necessary. Acetazolamide is frequently a first-line treatment for both Hyper PP and Hypo PP; it has shown to increase muscle strength and endurance in a small randomized controlled trial. Dichlorphenamide was observed to reduce attack frequency in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving both Hyper PP and Hypo PP. An additional option for Hypo PP includes potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone or amiloride. Pinacidil, a potassium channel agonist, was found to enhance muscle strength in a small randomized controlled trial.

- **Electrophysiology in skeletal muscle channelopathies**: The functional consequences of ion channel mutations in skeletal muscle can be analyzed using electrophysiology. Myotonia on needle EMG is detected in all forms of NDM, though severity may vary. The duration of myotonic discharges on EMG can help distinguish between sodium and chloride channel myotonias. Measurement of compound action potential amplitudes before and after exercise, along with the short and long exercise tests, aids in differentiating various skeletal muscle channelopathies.

- **MRI in skeletal muscle channelopathies**: MRI has been recently developed for diagnostic and monitoring purposes in skeletal muscle channelopathies. A hyperintense central pattern on MRI is indicative of these conditions.

### Stingray envenomation in a returning traveller: A complicated disease course [^111gwUfa]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

We report the case of a returning traveller, a woman in her early 20s, who presents with chronic inflammation and infection of her left foot following a stingray strike. Surgery was performed to remove foreign material a remarkable nine months after the initial injury. The case highlights the importance of the initial assessment and early management of stingray attacks and illustrates the potential need for exploration and debridement of problematic stingray wounds.

### Managing snakebite [^1151nyLU]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Bites from venomous snakes can result in bleeding, paralysis, long-term disability, and death. Immobilize the bitten limb when transporting the patient to a medical facility; the universal use of pressure immobilization is controversial, and tourniquets are not recommended. The 20-minute whole blood clotting test is a simple bedside test to screen for and monitor coagulopathy in resource-limited settings. Assess vital parameters and initiate resuscitation measures if the patient is clinically unstable with signs of bleeding, shock, paralysis, or respiratory distress. Intravenous antivenom is recommended in patients with systemic symptoms; the dose and type depend on the likely snake species, local guidelines, and availability.

Snakebite affects between 1.8 to 2.7 million people worldwide each year, and it is estimated to cause between 80,000 and 138,000 deaths. A mixture of toxins (venom) is injected into the body following a bite by a venomous snake. Envenoming can be a highly dynamic clinical event, and symptoms can progressively worsen to a life-threatening emergency. Snakebites can have long-term physical sequelae such as amputation, paralysis, and disability, as well as psychological health consequences.

Snakebite envenoming is more common in South and South-East Asia (2 million annually), sub-Saharan Africa (420,000), and Latin America (150,000). These regions also report a high burden of deaths from snakebite (100,000, 32,000, and 5,000 deaths respectively) possibly due to poor access to medical aid. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can worsen prognosis.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^116neao9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Bell's palsy, named after the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell, is the most common acute mono-neuropathy, or disorder affecting a single nerve, and is the most common diagnosis associated with facial nerve weakness or paralysis. It is characterized by rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. This condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face.

Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis or paralysis that occurs in Bell's palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, which can lead to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes also occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell's palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, resulting in variations in care.

Moreover, numerous diagnostic tests are available for evaluating patients with Bell's palsy, although many of these tests are of questionable benefit. It is important to note that while patients with Bell's palsy present with facial paresis or paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with such symptoms have Bell's palsy. This raises concerns that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or may experience unnecessary delays in diagnosis. These quality concerns provide an important context for understanding the management and treatment of Bell's palsy.

### Haemotoxic snake venoms: Their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise [^113AE7bB]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease. Venomous snakes bite up to 5.5 million people every year. These bites are responsible for causing as many as 1.8 million envenomings and 125,000 deaths annually, with three to five times that number of people thought to suffer from long‐term morbidity. Consequently, snakebite is one of the world's most lethal neglected tropical diseases. Despite this, snakebite receives little attention from global health agencies, charities, or governments. This is perhaps best exemplified by the World Health Organization (WHO) currently omitting snakebite from their formal list of neglected tropical diseases. Nevertheless, the snakebite community continues to lobby for greater recognition surrounding this issue, and recent progress has led to the WHO formally considering recognizing snakebite as a neglected tropical disease at the upcoming World Health Assembly in 2017.

### Snakebite: An exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis of adjunct treatment strategies [^114f5EGN]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of disease due to snakebite in developing countries is high and poorly recognized. Globally, an estimated 125,000 deaths per year are attributable to snakebite. The Million Deaths Study in India estimated 45,900 deaths attributable to snakebite in India in 2005, which translates to one in 200 deaths (even though governmental reporting is much lower). There is a strong negative correlation across countries between gross domestic product per capita and the incidence of snakebite. Rural farmers are at the greatest risk because of time spent in the fields, where they often incur snakebites on the feet, legs, or hands. The limb deformities and amputations caused by snakebite lead to life-altering disabilities, which in turn contribute to the cycle of poverty. Adding to these factors are the prohibitively high costs of the treatments for snakebite — advanced hospital care and antivenom. To address these issues, the World Health Organization (WHO) included snakebite on its list of neglected tropical diseases in 2017.

Patients who receive antivenom in the presence of supportive care are not likely to die of snakebite, but currently, such treatments can only be given in a clinic or hospital setting and can be prohibitively expensive. Many victims of snakebite do not survive long enough to reach definitive treatment, either because of geographical or economic constraints that can cause morbidity and mortality through delays in care. In India and Nepal, more than 75% of snakebite deaths occur outside the hospital setting. A household survey in Tamil Nadu indicated similar trends.

### Neurologists and the threat of bioterrorism [^116DSRYy]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Neurologists are most likely to become involved in primarily diagnosing those bioterrorist attacks utilizing botulinum toxin. Oral ingestion, or possibly inhalation, are likely routes of delivery. The characteristic descending paralysis starts in the extraocular and bulbar muscles, with associated autonomic features. Repetitive nerve stimulation usually shows an incremental muscle response. Treatment is supportive. The differential diagnosis is from naturally occurring paralysing illnesses such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic crisis, or diphtheria; from paralysing seafood neurotoxins (tetrodotoxin, saxitoxin), snake envenomation; and from chemical warfare poisoning by organophosphates. Primary neurological infections are less feasible for use as bioweapons.

There are theoretical possibilities of Venezuelan equine encephalitis transmission by inhalation and secondary zoonotic transmission cycles sustained by horses and mosquitoes. Severe haemorrhagic meningitis regularly occurs in anthrax, usually in the aftermath of severe systemic disease likely to have been transmitted by spore inhalation. Panic and psychologically determined "me-too" symptomatology are likely to pose the biggest diagnostic and management burden on neurologists handling bioterrorist attacks on an institution or a random civilian population. Indeed, civilian panic and disablement of institutional operations are likely to be prominent intentions of any bioterrorist attack.

### An unusual neurological consequence of massive wasp stings [^114U7EcR]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Although rare, central and peripheral neurological manifestations after single or multiple wasp stings have been reported. The authors describe a 45-year-old man who developed periods of sudden loss of consciousness with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 6 after being stung by fifty wasps. These periods were observed directly after being stung and continued for months afterward. Different mechanisms and pathophysiological findings of neurological sequelae reported after wasp stings are being reviewed.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pit viper envenomation, specifically with respect to monitoring before discharge, the WMS 2015 guidelines recommend monitoring dry bites showing no progression beyond the simple wound for a minimum of 8 hours. It is advised to obtain repeated laboratory studies during observation to monitor for possible delayed onset of venom effects.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^116i6cPE]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

A progressive strategy should be employed, beginning with patient education and lifestyle modifications to minimize triggers of periodic paralysis (PP). This should be followed by potassium therapy (either supplement or avoidance), and subsequently, the use of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Initially, discussing triggering factors, particularly diet-related ones, is beneficial in reducing the frequency of attacks. Seeking professional advice from a dietician may also be advantageous. Understanding the episodic nature of the disease is essential, especially for children. Health officials should be informed at schools where children with periodic paralysis are enrolled. For cases where the potassium level during attacks is unknown, behavioral strategies for managing acute attacks, such as undertaking mild exercise at the onset, should be implemented.

Pharmacological interventions include therapy to abort acute attacks and chronic preventive therapy to reduce attack frequency. Treatment options for periodic paralyses are limited. Aside from the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of dichlorphenamide, options are primarily based on anecdotal experience.

- **General approach to treatment**:
	- Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (particularly acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide) have been used as empirical treatments for nearly 50 years for both hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP). The mechanism of action in periodic paralyses remains incompletely understood. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors facilitate kaliuresis and induce non-anion gap acidosis by increasing urinary bicarbonate excretion. The resultant systemic acidosis may play a role in symptom reduction.

### Case report: Iatrogenic infection from traditional treatment of stingray envenomation [^114MBbj5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old man was stung on the left ankle by a stingray while on vacation on the Island of Bubaque, Guinea-Bissau. The affected limb was initially treated with an attempt to suck out the venom and the application of a chewed plant root. Over the following three days, local pain gradually diminished, but then a high fever erupted, accompanied by generalized symptoms and intense pain from the ankle. After initiating antibiotic treatment, the patient was evacuated. Due to sustained symptoms and fever, the wound was surgically debrided, and culture revealed an infection with oral flora bacteria. Attempts to suck out venom are not recommended.

### Oral varespladib for the treatment of snakebite envenoming in India and the United States (BRAVO): A phase II randomised clinical trial [^114jYYVY]. BMJ Global Health (2024). High credibility.

The timing of outcome assessments is also important. Based on findings from studies of varespladib in animal models with lethal doses of venoms, we selected a primary outcome measured 6 and 9 hours after randomisation. The results of this trial confirm that, regardless of treatment arm, some toxicities resolve within 9 hours (e.g. cardiovascular) and some are unchanged over the first 48 hours (e.g. local wound and blood components that do not normally regenerate in 6–9 hours). The challenge of identifying a time frame for recovery that captures benefit for different toxicities is a study design issue that will need to be addressed in future global SBE studies. A measure that integrates differences observed over time, such as AUC, may provide a practical solution to this challenge.

Patient-reported physical function during recovery from SBE is an important patient-centred aspect of SBE that has been incorporated into prior studies. More specifically, the PSFS is an extensively validated, patient-reported measure that has had an in-depth psychometric evaluation in SBE. In patients treated within 5 hours, the point estimate for the increase in PSFS at day 3 for varespladib versus placebo exceeded the established minimum clinically important difference of 1.0 on the 11-point PSFS scale. We augmented this analysis of recovery by performing a post-hoc evaluation of the proportion of patients achieving complete recovery, defined as an SSS of 0. This outcome provides an intuitive and unambiguous clinical endpoint that approximates the condition under which a patient has had resolution.

### Haemotoxic snake venoms: Their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise [^114eFS9N]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Venom components are gaining renewed interest as potential sources of new pharmacological compounds relevant for human therapeutics and diagnostics. Such developments are not limited to snake venoms, with toxins isolated from the toxic secretions of cone snails, sea anemones, spiders, and scorpions. These toxins exhibit bioactivities relevant for managing chronic pain, stroke, and various autoimmune diseases. Nonetheless, snake venoms represent the most comprehensively studied of all venomous lineages and, consequently, have the most numerous lead compounds associated with them. Due to the specificity of many snake venom toxins and their activity in targeting specific components related to cardiovascular processes, almost all of the snake venom-derived pharmaceuticals available today have therapeutic or diagnostic indications relevant to haemostasis.

The first blockbuster drug developed from a venom toxin was Captopril (Capoten). Captopril was developed following the identification of an ACE inhibitor in the venom of the jararaca pit viper (Bothrops jararaca). This bradykinin potentiating peptide (BPP) inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, thereby reducing systemic blood pressure by preventing the production of a crucial vasoconstrictor. Consequently, Captopril was developed in the 1970s as a synthetic analogue of this toxin and indicated for use as a hypotensive drug. It achieved US Food and Drug Administration approval in the early 1980s, subsequently becoming Squibb's first billion-dollar drug.

### Managing snakebite [^111vseKs]. BMJ (2022). Low credibility.

Guidelines from the WHO recommend antivenom treatment for patients who present with shock, spontaneous systemic bleeding, uncoagulable blood, neurotoxicity, black urine, acute kidney injury, rapidly progressive local swelling, and bites by species known to cause local necrosis and digital bites.

Antivenoms are whole or fragmented immunoglobulins fractionated from the plasma of domesticated animals hyper-immunized with venom from one or more snake species over variable periods. They are highly specific and will neutralize only the venoms used in their production and those of a few closely related species. Polyspecific antivenoms are raised against a mixture of venoms from more than one species, whereas antivenoms raised against venom from a single species are monospecific.

Early administration of antivenom prevents or limits hemodynamic alterations, progression of coagulopathy to clinically overt bleeding, postsynaptic neurotoxicity, myotoxicity, acute kidney injury, and local tissue damage. Physiological levels of clotting factors are at least partially restored within a median of six hours with sufficient doses of specific antivenoms.

Robust clinical data on the safe and effective initial dose of antivenom are lacking for most products. Clinicians often rely on manufacturers' recommendations provided as package inserts or labels, but these can be unreliable. We suggest following national protocols or standard regional guidelines for dosage. Administration is always intravenous, as a bolus or diluted in saline solution over 10–60 minutes, at the same dose for adults and children.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^117Cghr9]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

The management of hump-nosed pit viper (HNPV) bites has sparked significant debate, particularly regarding the use of antivenom. The recognition of antivenom's ineffectiveness for pit viper bites represents a major shift in snakebite management, crucial for minimizing antivenom wastage and emphasizing the importance of accurate snake species identification. Diverse factors including ancestral origins, microhabitat preferences, and prey-predator interactions of HNPV have influenced its potency and the higher casualty rates observed in Sri Lanka and Karnataka compared to Kerala.

- **Controversies in plasmapheresis**: The role of plasmapheresis in treating snakebite complications like capillary leak syndrome remains a topic of debate. Although its role in capillary leak syndrome is controversial in studies, it is considered when a patient develops bilateral parotid swelling, periorbital edema, hemoconcentration, and refractory shock. In some centers, plasmapheresis has been used when antivenom was ineffective or not indicated, showing potential mortality benefits. However, in regions like Southern Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Goa, where hump-nosed pit vipers cause more severe complications and higher mortality rates, plasmapheresis often proves ineffective for these patients. There are no methodological studies supporting the use of plasmapheresis for snakebite complications.

### Repurposed drugs and their combinations prevent morbidity-inducing dermonecrosis caused by diverse cytotoxic snake venoms [^113vsi5E]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Estimates suggest that 1.8–2.7 million people are envenomed due to snakebite every year, resulting in 81,000–138,000 deaths and 400,000 cases of morbidity annually, predominantly affecting those in the tropics and sub-tropics. One of the leading causes of snakebite-induced morbidity is local tissue necrosis, which can develop around the bite site and result in amputation of the affected digit or limb in survivors. Snakebite has been labeled 'the most neglected of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)', with the late UN Secretary General Kofi Annan calling it 'the biggest public health crisis you have likely never heard of'. In 2017, snakebite envenoming was added to the World Health Organization (WHO)'s formal list of NTDs; the WHO has since elevated snakebite to a 'priority category A NTD' and has created a roadmap with the goal of reducing the global burden of snakebite by one-half by the year 2030. One of the proposed methods to accomplish this is to develop novel treatments for snakebite, an ambitious task considering the myriad issues associated with developing snakebite therapies, including the variability and complexity of toxins that make up different snake venoms.

### Treatment for periodic paralysis [^111kxrfE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Primary periodic paralyses are rare inherited muscle diseases characterized by episodes of flaccid weakness affecting one or more limbs. These episodes can last several hours to several days and are caused by mutations in skeletal muscle channel genes.

- **Objectives**: The objective of this review was to systematically assess the treatment of periodic paralyses.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Trials Register, MEDLINE (from January 1966 to July 2007), EMBASE (from January 1980 to July 2007), and other available international medical library sources from the University of Milan for randomized trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized (including cross-over studies) and quasi-randomized trials in participants with primary periodic paralyses. These studies compared any form of treatment, including physical therapy and alternative therapies, to a placebo or another treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Our primary outcome measure was the change in attack severity or frequency by eight weeks from the start of treatment. Secondary outcome measures included change in muscle strength and mass, change in Quality of Life using Short Form 36 (SF36) or similar assessments, preference of treatment strategy, and adverse effects at eight weeks.

- **Main results**: Three studies met our inclusion criteria. In one study, dichlorphenamide (DCP) vs. placebo was tested in two groups of participants: 42 with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and 31 with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), based on clinical criteria. Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed the study.

### Interventions for the symptoms and signs resulting from jellyfish stings [^117DZUo4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Jellyfish envenomation is common in many coastal regions and varies in severity depending upon the species. Stings cause a variety of symptoms and signs, including pain, dermatological reactions, and, in some species, Irukandji syndrome (which may include abdominal, back, or chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, cardiac phenomena, and, rarely, death). Many treatments have been suggested for these symptoms, but their effectiveness is unclear. This is an update of a Cochrane Review last published in 2013.

- **Objectives**: To determine the benefits and harms associated with the use of any intervention, in both adults and children, for the treatment of jellyfish stings, as assessed by randomized and quasi-randomized trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science up to October 27, 2022. We searched clinical trials registers and the grey literature and conducted forward-citation searching of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention given to treat stings from any species of jellyfish. Interventions were compared to another active intervention, placebo, or no treatment. If co-interventions were used, we included the study only if the co-intervention was used in each group.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane.

- **Main results**: We included nine studies (six RCTs and three quasi-RCTs) involving a total of 574 participants. We found one ongoing study. Participants were either stung accidentally or were h

We searched the Cochrane Library, Google, and PubMed using the MeSH terms: "(snakebite, diagnosis and treatment guidelines) and (snake, scientific names of individual snake species, snakebite, envenoming, venom, and antivenom)". Research papers and case reports from Latin America, South and South-East Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa were retrieved. There were no language restrictions. Additional articles were obtained by citation tracking of review and original articles. Although the search focused on key papers published in the past five years, older publications of importance have been included. The review also drew from the widely established African and South-East Asian regional guidelines on the treatment and prevention of snakebite envenoming.

### Venomous bites, stings, and poisoning [^117DUETa]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

This article discusses the epidemiology, prevention, clinical features, first aid, and medical treatment of venomous bites by snakes, lizards, and spiders; stings by fish, jellyfish, echinoderms, and insects; and poisoning by fish and molluscs, in all parts of the world. Of these envenomings and poisonings, snake bites cause the greatest burden of human suffering, killing 46,000 people each year in India alone and more than 100,000 worldwide, resulting in physical handicap in many survivors. Specific antidotes (antivenoms/antivenins) are available to treat envenoming by many of these taxa, but supply and distribution are inadequate in many tropical developing countries.

### Symptoms and management of painful progressive swelling in Eswatini snakebite patients: A prospective observational study [^111HfJyF]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation, management, and outcomes of local tissue destruction have long been poorly understood and under-researched, despite many venomous snakes inflicting bites on humans and possessing myriad cytotoxic venom components implicated in necrosis and swelling. This is particularly true for Eswatini, where snakebites in humans are primarily caused by snakes with cytotoxic venom, such as N. mossambica, B. arietans, and, less frequently, H. hemachatus and A. bibronii. Nevertheless, prospective clinical data on the progression of local tissue damage after cytotoxic snakebites are extremely limited globally, and no such studies are available from Eswatini at the time of writing.

Furthermore, efficacy endpoints for antivenom in nonhuman preclinical studies and the few existing snakebite trials are most commonly related to survival, whereas outcome measures for tissue damage are less widely used and employ heterogeneous pathology criteria. Understanding the relative frequency and quantifying the extent of local tissue complications is an essential prerequisite for defining endpoints related to tissue damage in future clinical snakebite studies.

### Clinical management of North American snake and marine envenomations [^112TM2wf]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). High credibility.

Envenomations rank as the 23rd most common reason for calls to US poison control centers, with over 35,000 incidents reported annually. Snake bites account for over 20% of these calls, while marine envenomations are likely underreported at 3% to 4%. While these types of envenomations may not be encountered on a daily basis by many physicians, they warrant unique management strategies based on the offending creature and symptom presentation. This text serves as a review of the epidemiology, clinical presentations, and management of endemic North American species of snakes and marine vertebrate and invertebrate envenomations.

### DOG bites and diabetic peripheral neuropathy: A dangerous combination [^11148xnm]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

All animal bites have the potential to cause significant infection. In the UK, dogs are the most common source of bites, and the incidence of hospital attendances attributable to dog bites has risen over the last decade. Patient groups at particular risk of bites and/or complications from infection include those at extremes of age, the immunosuppressed, and patients with diabetes.

We report the case of a patient with diabetic peripheral neuropathy who was admitted on two separate occasions with unprovoked bites to his toes while asleep, inflicted by his pet dog. He ultimately required terminalization of the affected digits. Although unusual, this mechanism of injury has been previously described in the literature; however, we are unaware of cases reporting multiple separate incidences involving the same patient and animal.

We present this case to highlight the perils of untrained pet ownership in diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathy and the importance of prompt medical and surgical treatment of injuries.

### Snakebites reported to the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Centers for the years 2012–2016 [^11645Qa7]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Snake envenomations cause significant morbidity and mortality. The goals of this study were to assess the epidemiology of snakebites in Kentucky and the treatment strategies used by physicians reporting to the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Centers.

- **Methods**: This was a descriptive epidemiologic study compiling clinical data on snakebites reported to the Kentucky Regional Poison Control Centers from 2012 to 2016. We built a database of patient demographics, treatment, and the clinical course of each snakebite reported in the study period. Attention was paid to all antivenom interventions and the use of contraindicated therapies.

- **Results**: We compiled 674 total records. Patient age was 34 ± 18 years (mean ± SD), with males (71%) predominating. Most (97%) bites were to a distal upper or lower extremity. The majority (78%) occurred at a private residence. Most reports came between May and September (88%). Of the 674 patients, 24% (n = 159) were classified as moderate or severe. Two hundred thirty (34%) patients were admitted to the hospital. Forty-six patients (7%) received surgical consultation, and 12 (2%) underwent surgical intervention. One hundred fifty-three patients received antivenom, with 6 ± 3 vials used per patient. Length of stay was 3 ± 2 days when antivenom was administered and 2 ± 2 days when not administered. Six cases of coagulopathy were noted. Multiple contraindicated therapies were noted.

- **Conclusions**: Snake envenomations are a prevalent public health concern for residents of Kentucky, chiefly during summer months. Significant medical intervention is being performed for those affected.

### Global mortality of snakebite envenoming between 1990 and 2019 [^116n1E7R]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

We started by reviewing GBD 2019 mortality estimates for venomous animal contact. The GBD study and its methodological framework to estimate mortality due to injuries have been described in detail elsewhere.

In brief, we used a subset of the data for venomous animal contact to identify snakebite-specific mortality, as well as other animal-specific mortality, and evaluated these data using models that captured spatiotemporal patterns to estimate mortality for four different animals (snakes, bees, scorpions, spiders) and for a fifth residual category (other venomous animal contact). We adjusted each animal-specific mortality estimate so that their sum equaled the GBD 2019 overall venomous animal contact mortality estimates, thus preserving internal consistency. To account for uncertainty in the primary data, data processing, measurement error, and choice of model, every model in the process was run 1,000 times to produce final estimates with 95% uncertainty intervals, which comprise the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of 1,000 draws.

- **GBD 2019 venomous animal contact estimation**: We used published GBD 2019 estimates for overall venomous animal contact mortality as a platform for our analysis. A summary of the GBD 2019 estimation approach for mortality from venomous animal contact follows. The case definition for a venomous animal contact death in GBD 2019 was death resulting from unintentionally being bitten by, stung by, or exposed to a non-human venomous animal. We identified deaths in VR and VA cause of death data using ICD-9 codes E905-E905.99 and ICD-10 codes.

### Stingray injury complicated by Vibrio alginolyticus wound infection and posterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm in a returning traveler [^1111zd4i]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2025). Low credibility.

Stingray injury is common in temperate and tropical waters worldwide. The majority of injuries are minor and can be managed with simple first aid at the shoreline; however, serious complications can occur. We report a case of Vibrio alginolyticus wound infection, retained foreign body, and posterior tibial artery pseudoaneurysm after stingray envenomation in a returning traveler. The patient presented with severe pain and dysesthesia associated with a puncture wound in the left lower leg 1 week after injury in Seychelles. Clinician awareness of infection and trauma-related complications of stingray and other penetrating marine injuries is important.

### Snakebite envenoming [^111YvdEQ]. Nature Reviews Disease Primers (2017). Low credibility.

Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease that kills over 100,000 people and maims more than 400,000 people every year. Impoverished populations living in the rural tropics are particularly vulnerable, as snakebite envenoming perpetuates the cycle of poverty. Snake venoms are complex mixtures of proteins that exert a wide range of toxic actions. The high variability in snake venom composition is responsible for the various clinical manifestations in envenomings, ranging from local tissue damage to potentially life-threatening systemic effects. Intravenous administration of antivenom is the only specific treatment to counteract envenoming.

- **Additional treatments**: Analgesics, ventilator support, fluid therapy, haemodialysis, and antibiotic therapy are also used.

- **Research and development**: Novel therapeutic alternatives based on recombinant antibody technologies and new toxin inhibitors are being explored.

Confronting snakebite envenoming at a global level demands the implementation of an integrated intervention strategy involving the WHO, the research community, antivenom manufacturers, regulatory agencies, national and regional health authorities, professional health organizations, international funding agencies, advocacy groups, and civil society institutions.

### Snake antivenom for snake venom induced consumption coagulopathy [^11674zVM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Snake venom-induced consumption coagulopathy is a major systemic effect of envenoming. Observational studies suggest that antivenom improves outcomes for venom-induced consumption coagulopathy in some snakebites and not others. However, the effectiveness of snake antivenom in all cases of venom-induced consumption coagulopathy is controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of snake antivenom as a treatment for venom-induced consumption coagulopathy in people with snake bites.

- **Search methods**: The search was conducted on 30 January 2015. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), Ovid MEDLINE(R), Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE(R) Daily and Ovid OLDMEDLINE(R), Embase Classic+Embase (OvidSP), three other sources, clinical trials registers, and we also screened reference lists.

- **Selection criteria**: All completed, published or unpublished, randomised, controlled trials with a placebo or no treatment arm, where snake antivenom was administered for venom-induced consumption coagulopathy in humans with snake bites.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors reviewed the identified trials and independently applied the selection criteria.

- **Main results**: No studies met the inclusion criteria for this review.

- **Authors' conclusions**: Randomised placebo-controlled trials are required to investigate the effectiveness of snake antivenom for clinically relevant outcomes in patients with venom-induced consumption coagulopathy resulting from snake bites.

### Lionfish envenomation [^1153xPdY]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Lionfish (Pterois volitans) are venomous fish most often found as aquarium pets throughout the United States. Envenomations frequently occur on the upper extremities, with pain as the predominant symptom. Immersing the injured part in warm (45 degrees C) water is considered the first and foremost important treatment, as it is reported to relieve pain and inactivate the venom. Other methods of analgesia are discussed. We present a case of lionfish envenomation that failed to respond to warm water immersion.

### Global mortality of snakebite envenoming between 1990 and 2019 [^116wc1rj]. Nature Communications (2022). Low credibility.

After the GBD 2019 venomous animal contact mortality was estimated, we undertook the following steps to estimate snakebite-specific mortality.

We first reviewed all cause-of-death data that could be mapped directly to snakebites or other venomous animals. The ICD codes used for each animal are listed in Supplementary Table 3, along with the volume and type of data used in snakebite modeling. The snakebite-specific model had 10,636 location-years of data. See Supplementary Figs. 2, 3 for maps of the volume of data used in the snakebite envenoming model and the type of data in each location.

After obtaining all possible data, we applied the same cause-of-death noise reduction processing described above to the raw animal-specific data. We redistributed deaths coded to ICD codes E905, E905.9, and X29 — which code for deaths due to unspecified venomous animals — by aggregating all properly coded deaths by location, age, sex, and animal and applying the proportion of correctly coded deaths due to snakebites to the number of deaths coded for an unspecified venomous animal. Redistribution was based on location, age, and sex patterns from correctly coded venomous animal deaths. Out of 69,097 deaths that could be coded to the ICD codes above, 5711 (8.3%) were coded to unspecified venomous animal contact and needed to be redistributed. Redistributed animal deaths were added to the number of properly coded deaths for each animal.

### Venomous bites, stings, and poisoning: An update [^11211sU6]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2019). Low credibility.

This article discusses the epidemiology, prevention, clinical features, and treatment of venomous bites by snakes, lizards, and spiders; stings by fish, jellyfish, echinoderms, insects, and scorpions; and poisoning by ingestion of fish, turtles, and shellfish. Invertebrate stings cause fatalities by anaphylaxis, secondary to acquired hypersensitivity (Hymenoptera, such as bees, wasps, and ants; and jellyfish), and by direct envenoming (scorpions, spiders, jellyfish, and echinoderms). Simple preventive techniques, such as wearing protective clothing, using a flashlight at night, and excluding venomous animals from sleeping quarters, are of paramount importance to reduce the risk of venomous bites and stings.

Encounters with venomous snakes can lead to substantial morbidity or mortality if managed inappropriately. Medical management is the mainstay of treatment, but surgery may be necessary in rare cases. The hand surgeon should be well versed in the types of venomous snakes, the mechanism of action of venom, and the management of these injuries, given the frequency of hand envenomation. The indications for surgery are not well established and rely on clinical judgment and the practitioner's experience. An understanding of previously reported outcomes and an algorithmic approach to treatment will help improve patient care and avoid complications.

### Haemotoxic snake venoms: Their functional activity, impact on snakebite victims and pharmaceutical promise [^112jxtjQ]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

Snake venoms are mixtures of numerous proteinaceous components that exert diverse functional activities on a variety of physiological targets. The toxic constituents found in venom vary from species to species, leading to a variety of life‐threatening pathologies in snakebite victims related to the neurotoxic, cytotoxic, and haemotoxic effects of venom. Of the 1.8 million people envenomed by snakes every year, up to 125,000 die, while hundreds of thousands survive only to suffer from life‐changing long‐term morbidity. Consequently, snakebite is one of the world's most severe neglected tropical diseases.

Many snake venoms exhibit strong haemotoxic properties by interfering with blood pressure, clotting factors, and platelets, and by directly causing haemorrhage. This review provides an overview of the functional activities of haemotoxic venom proteins, the pathologies they cause in snakebite victims, and how their exquisite selectivity and potency make them amenable for use as therapeutic and diagnostic tools relevant for human medicine.

### Management of Bell's palsy [^113HC6M5]. Australian Prescriber (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bell's palsy:

- **Definition**: Bell's palsy, also known as idiopathic facial paralysis, is an acute-onset, isolated, unilateral, lower motor neuron facial weakness or paralysis.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, the reactivation of the herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve has been postulated.

- **Disease course**: Likely vascular distension, inflammation, and edema with ischemia of the facial nerve result in Bell's palsy. It presents with clinical manifestations, including unilateral weakness or paralysis of the upper and lower facial muscles, drooping of ipsilateral eyelids, dry eye due to the inability to close eyes completely, epiphora, drooping of the corner of the mouth, ipsilateral impaired or loss of taste sensation, difficulty in eating, dribbling of saliva, altered sensation on the affected side of the face, pain in or behind the ear, and hyperacusis on the affected side if the stapedius muscle is involved. Spontaneous complete recovery occurs in 70–75% of untreated patients.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bell's palsy is not associated with an increased risk of mortality.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^115AuwsF]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

In the absence of an identified genetic mutation in approximately 30% of patients, periodic paralysis subtypes can be distinguished on the basis of clinical presentation, serum potassium levels during attacks, and pattern of abnormalities on long exercise testing. If primary periodic paralysis (PP) is suspected but cannot be confirmed by genetic testing, further examination should be undertaken to confirm that the symptoms are not secondary to other conditions such as thyrotoxicosis or secondary causes of blood potassium deficiency or excess.

Electrodiagnostic testing has been a mainstay to demonstrate evidence of muscle fiber changes in excitability in the muscle channelopathies. On needle electromyography (EMG), positive sharp waves and myotonia, characterized by spontaneous waxing and waning motor unit potential amplitude and frequency, can be seen in paramyotonia congenita (PMC) and hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP). In hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP), long exercise testing has largely replaced provocative maneuvers, which induce full-body attacks of paralysis.

In the long exercise test, a focal attack of paralysis is induced by exercise of a single muscle. The patient is instructed to perform repeated isometric contractions of the abductor digiti minimi muscle over 5 minutes (in 15-second blocks alternating with 3–4 seconds of rest), and compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) are recorded after supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve every minute or every other minute for 40–60 minutes post-exercise. A reduction in CMAP amplitude of 40% or more is significant for diagnostic purposes.

### Arthropod bites and stings [^113Qwvhu]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on spider envenomation:

- **Definition**: Spider bites in the US are primarily caused by widow spiders (Latrodectus) and brown recluse spiders (Loxosceles). Less common spiders include Australian funnel web spiders (Atrax and Hadronyche species) found in eastern Australia, armed or wandering spiders (Phoneutria species) found in South America, hobo spiders (Tegenaria agrestis) found in Europe and in the Pacific Northwest of the US, and the noble false widow (Steatoda nobilis) found in England as well as Ireland.

- **Pathophysiology**: The venom of the widow spider contains α-latrotoxin, which affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle cramping and hypertension. The venom of the brown recluse spider contains multiple active components, including sphingomyelinase D, hyaluronidase, and other enzymes, resulting in local tissue necrosis and, rarely, systemic effects.

- **Epidemiology**: There were 142,886 spider bites treated in emergency departments in the US from 2001 to 2010.

- **Disease course**: Most spider bites cause only localized skin injury, such as burning pain, swelling, erythema, and bleeding, typically on the upper extremities. Fang marks and a hemorrhagic vesicle may also be observed. Skin necrosis may develop by 72 hours. Systemic symptoms include fever, chills, headache, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, pruritus, malaise, and musculoskeletal pain. Systemic toxicity leading to intravascular hemolytic anemia, coagulopathy, and acute renal failure is rare.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Most spider bites are mild and resolve.

### Clinical challenges, controversies, and regional strategies in snakebite care in India [^112K2vR2]. The Lancet Regional Health. Southeast Asia (2025). Low credibility.

The Australian experience highlights a shift from using monovalent antivenoms guided by unreliable snake venom detection kits to focusing on diagnosing envenomation and administering polyvalent antivenom or two key monovalent antivenoms (brown and tiger snake) based on geography and clinical presentation. This approach has simplified antivenom use, reduced errors, and minimized risks associated with incorrect antivenom administration, highlighting the importance of diagnostic clarity and pragmatic treatment strategies. Syndromic management, supported by region-specific clinical guidelines, remains the most pragmatic approach until more effective diagnostic and treatment options become available in the region. The inconsistent adherence to snakebite management protocols across India highlights the need for standardized yet adaptable guidelines that cater to regional specificities, ensuring effective, contextually appropriate care that enhances patient outcomes and optimizes resource use.

- **Plasmaphaeresis**: Theoretically, therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) should facilitate the removal of venom toxins from the intravascular compartment, potentially redistributing them from extravascular spaces for subsequent elimination. While early case reports and studies indicate its utility in managing hematologic complications, robust evidence remains sparse. A retrospective study of 37 snakebite patients treated with TPE showed significant laboratory improvements and limb salvage without complications.

### Penetrating thoracic injury and fatal aortic transection from the barb of a stingray [^116cykW8]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Stingrays are found in open waters and are also kept in exhibits in many aquariums throughout the world. They are generally nonaggressive creatures by nature, but they can inflict injuries with their spines if provoked. We present a case of a 62-year-old diver who was pierced in the chest by the barb of a stingray while transferring the animal to another tank as part of his work in a public aquarium. He was rescued immediately from the tank but was found to be in cardiac arrest. Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation was promptly initiated by his colleagues.

He was rapidly evacuated to the nearest emergency department, where he was noted to be in pulseless electrical activity. A single puncture wound was observed over the right second intercostal space, with the spine of the stingray still impaled in the chest. Trauma surgeons were activated promptly, and resuscitation was continued based on advanced cardiac and trauma life support guidelines, which included ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, securing the airway, and emergency blood transfusion. An emergency department thoracotomy was performed, but despite aggressive resuscitation, the thoracic injury was fatal. An autopsy revealed transection of the aorta by an impaled barb. We present a review of stingray injuries and suggest a general approach to management.

### Recurrent Hopkin's syndrome: A case report and review of the literature [^113fbfpt]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2010). Low credibility.

Flaccid paralysis affecting one or more limbs after an asthma attack is a poliomyelitis-like illness known as Hopkins' syndrome (HS). Although a viral infection or multifactorial immune suppression during an acute attack of bronchial asthma has been proposed as the mechanism involved in this syndrome, the precise etiopathogenetic mechanism remains unknown. We report a 13-year-old girl who had recurrent episodes of myelitis after asthma attacks. She experienced four episodes of acute flaccid paralysis, each preceded by acute asthma attacks. Some of these attacks were accompanied by sensory and sphincter disturbances. She had hyper-IgEaemia, and the prick test to Dermatophagoides farinae and cedar pollen was strongly positive. This case is the first HS instance demonstrating frequent recurrences and suggests a possible link between HS and atopic myelitis.

### North American coral snake antivenin (equine) [^115dKNF4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

There have been no well-controlled clinical studies of the use of North American coral snake antivenin (equine) in patients experiencing envenomation by the Eastern coral snake. However, a retrospective analysis has been published of 387 coral snake exposures treated in a healthcare facility in Florida between 1998 and 2010, including 252 patients who were treated with North American coral snake antivenin (equine).

Patients were managed according to different treatment strategies:

- **Asymptomatic at ED arrival and treated empirically**: (n = 134)
- **Asymptomatic at ED arrival, but treatment withheld until symptoms appeared**: (n = 106; 6 of the 106 received North American Coral Snake Antivenin (equine) at some point; the remainder were never treated)
- **Symptomatic at ED arrival and treated with North American Coral Snake Antivenin (equine)**: (n = 112)
- **Symptomatic at ED arrival but not treated with North American Coral Snake Antivenin (equine)**: (n = 35)

The average number of vials administered to treated patients was 3.75 (range 1–20 vials); 17 patients who received repeat treatment were administered 8.3 vials, on average. There was no reported usage of foreign antivenom or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in this case series. The 387 patients were assessed for clinical outcomes, with outcomes codes ranging from full recovery with no residual effects ("No Effect") to less than full recovery with significant residual effects ("Major"). Empiric treatment of asymptomatic patients resulted in more 'moderate' and 'major' outcomes compared to those who were treated only after symptoms appeared.

### Managing an unidentified jellyfish sting with mixed envenomation syndrome at a noncoastal hospital: Is this a new form of jellyfish envenomation [^115Qhhhi]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Jellyfish stings are the most common cause of marine envenomation in humans. Various species of box jellyfish have been identified around Penang Island, Malaysia, including multitentacled and four-tentacled box jellyfish (class Cubozoa). The typical syndrome following envenomation from these jellyfish has been poorly documented, posing a greater challenge when managing an unidentified jellyfish sting from Penang Island.

We report a case of a 32-year-old man from Penang Island who was stung by an unidentified jellyfish while walking into the sea. The patient reported feeling an immediate and severe electric current-like pain over both thighs, left flank, and left forearm, followed by chest discomfort and breathlessness. Vinegar was applied over the affected areas, and he was rushed to a hospital, where he was treated with analgesia, steroids, and antihistamine. He refused hospitalization and was discharged against medical advice. He then presented to a noncoastal hospital 377 km away in Kuala Lumpur on the following day with severe pain over the affected sites as well as chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and abdominal cramps.

The electrocardiograph demonstrated features of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Serial blood test results showed elevated creatine kinase but normal troponin I levels. The patient was managed symptomatically over a period of four days and was discharged with cardiology follow-up. Appropriate health-seeking behavior needs to be emphasized. This case report provides an opportunity to document the signs and symptoms of envenomation from possibly an undescribed jellyfish species.

### Scorpion bite-induced unilateral pulmonary oedema [^111rRbUE]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 24-year-old woman came to the emergency room of our hospital 6 hours following a sting to the pulp of her middle finger on her left upper limb by an Indian red scorpion. On examination, she exhibited tachycardia, tachypnoea, hypotension, and low oxygen saturation at room temperature. Upon auscultation, there was poor air entry in all areas of the right lung along with crackles, while the left lung field was normal. A chest X-ray revealed unilateral haziness of the right lung field. Two-dimensional echocardiography indicated clinical findings of myocarditis. Arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with severe hypoxemia, suggestive of type 1 respiratory failure.

After intubation and the initiation of ventilatory support, the patient received intravenous analgesics, antihistamines, and infiltration at the site of the bite with 2% xylocaine. The patient was started on inotropes, an alpha receptor blocker, intravenous steroids, bronchodilators, and diuretics support. Clinically, the patient improved over the course of treatment and was subsequently discharged.

### Interventions for the symptoms and signs resulting from jellyfish stings [^115vBCKE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Jellyfish envenomations are common among temperate coastal regions and vary in severity depending on the species. Stings result in a variety of symptoms and signs, including pain, dermatological reactions, and, in some species, Irukandji syndrome. This syndrome includes abdominal, back, and chest pain, tachycardia, hypertension, sweating, piloerection, agitation, and sometimes cardiac complications. Many treatments have been suggested for the symptoms and signs of jellyfish stings. However, it is unclear which interventions are most effective.

- **Objectives**: To determine the benefits and harms associated with the use of any intervention, in both adults and children, for the treatment of jellyfish stings, as assessed from randomized trials.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases in October 2012 and again in October 2013: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; The Cochrane Library, Issue 9, 2013); MEDLINE via Ovid SP (1948 to 22 October 2013); EMBASE via Ovid SP (1980 to 21 October 2013); and Web of Science (all databases; 1899 to 21 October 2013). We also searched reference lists from eligible studies and guidelines, conference proceedings, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and contacted content experts to identify trials.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials that compared any intervention(s) to active and/or non-active controls for the treatment of symptoms and signs of jellyfish sting envenomation. No language, publication date, or publication status restrictions were applied.

### Review of the diagnosis and treatment of periodic paralysis [^116sqaPX]. Muscle & Nerve (2018). Low credibility.

The patient should be advised to avoid triggers such as high-carbohydrate and/or high-salt meals, alcohol, and stress. Although no randomized controlled studies are available to inform dosing, a daily slow-release potassium salt formulation may be considered the standard of care for chronic therapy. Dichlorphenamide is approved for HypoPP and has been associated with reductions in attack frequency, severity, and duration during chronic treatment. Based on anecdotal reports, acetazolamide 125–1000 mg/day may be effective for chronic treatment of HypoPP. In a double-blind crossover study, acetazolamide 125 mg three times daily or placebo given for 2 weeks each was evaluated in 8 patients with HypoPP. Muscle strength was measured in muscle groups every week and improved significantly in seven of eight patients. Mean strength was significantly greater with acetazolamide (P = 0.05), and total muscle strength increased by a mean of 10% with treatment.

Potassium-sparing diuretics are a potential option for chronic treatment of HypoPP. Recommended doses are triamterene 50–150 mg/day, spironolactone 25–100 mg/day, or eplerenone 50–100 mg daily. Spironolactone may be poorly tolerated because of androgenic side effects, and epleronone may be substituted because it causes fewer hormonal issues. For patients with HypoPP, potassium supplementation and a potassium-sparing diuretic may be used concomitantly, but potassium levels should be routinely monitored.

Recent studies in mouse models of HypoPP with both SCN4A mutations and CACNA1S mutations have shown promising results, emphasizing the importance of genetic considerations in treatment strategies for HypoPP.

### Snakebite: An exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis of adjunct treatment strategies [^115JtrLJ]. The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

Disability weights for chronic disabilities due to amputation were taken from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. We did not include an analysis of loss-of-function of limbs in this study; we included only amputation because the cost of amputation is more predictable for an exploratory study such as this one. Due to significant differences between the WHO disability weight update in 2004 and the GBD 2010, a range was used to account for both numbers in the sensitivity analysis. The base-case disability weight for below-knee amputation (0.164) was taken from the GBD 2010. The base-case disability weight for finger/toe amputation (0.02) was an assumption informed by several related disability weights reported in the 2004 update and the GBD 2010.

- **Outcome measures**: The primary outcome measures are the thresholds for treatment effectiveness and cost. These thresholds are defined as the increase in effectiveness and net cost at which a combination strategy becomes the more cost-effective option. As a secondary outcome measure, we report the ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio), which is the ratio of incremental costs per DALY averted. To compare an antivenom/adjunct combination strategy with antivenom alone, the ICER was calculated based on the difference of costs and DALYs between these two strategies.

### Infectious complications following snakebite byin Martinique: A case series [^116vWpkR]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Snakebites account for about 1.8–2.7 million envenomings and 81,000–138,000 deaths per year worldwide. In Martinique, about 30 cases of snakebite are recorded every year. Bothrops lanceolatus, a member of the Viperidae family, Crotalinae subfamily, is the only venomous species encountered in Martinique. A Bothrops lanceolatus bite may result in severe thrombotic complications, including cerebral, pulmonary, and myocardial infarction, as well as coagulation disorders and endothelial injuries, which could be fatal or involve long-term sequelae. Thus, envenomed patients should promptly receive a specific antivenom to prevent such severe complications.

Snakebites are frequently responsible for local complications combining pain and local edema in the minutes following the bite, followed, in severe cases, by local necrosis and blistering. Wound infection may contribute to tissue necrosis, bacteremia, and even septic shock. As with envenomings by other snakes, such infectious complications are routinely observed following a B. lanceolatus bite, but their precise incidence is unknown.

The oral bacterial flora of B. lanceolatus includes Aeromonas hydrophila, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus spp., and Enterococcus spp. These bacteria are usually found in post-snakebite abscesses, suggesting that they have been inoculated in the wound from the snake's oral cavity, thus supporting the possible need for empiric antibiotic treatment after the snakebite, particularly in cases associated with prominent local tissue damage.
