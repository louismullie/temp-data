## Question

A 5-year-old boy undergoes MRI neuroimaging for the evaluation of worsening headaches and intermittent nausea upon awakening. He receives a bolus of intravenous thiopental for sedation during the procedure. Ten minutes after the MRI, the patient is awake and responsive. Which of the following pharmacological properties is most likely responsible for this patient's rapid recovery from this anesthetic agent?
A. First-pass metabolism
B. Redistribution
C. Zero-order elimination
D. Ion trapping

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which pharmacological property explains why a 5-year-old boy quickly regains consciousness after receiving a single bolus of thiopental for MRI sedation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the classic pharmacokinetics of thiopental and whether termination of effect after a bolus is dominated by metabolism or distribution. Then, I should verify competing options like first-pass metabolism, zero-order elimination, and ion trapping and make sure none of them plausibly fit an IV bolus of thiopental. Next, I will examine the specific evidence that redistribution governs the early decline in thiopental effect, especially in children, and check for pediatric PK nuances. Finally, I will reconcile this with known context-sensitive half-life and prolonged effects with infusions to avoid overgeneralization and confirm the best answer is redistribution.

> Let me first confirm the drug and context: thiopental is a highly lipophilic barbiturate given intravenously as a bolus for procedural sedation. The clinical question is why a child awakens quickly, on the order of minutes, which immediately makes me think of distribution kinetics rather than hepatic metabolism, because metabolism for thiopental is slow but distribution from brain to muscle and fat is rapid after a single dose [^11423Tc7].

> I need to check the primary pharmacokinetic determinant of early recovery after a bolus. The evidence consistently shows that, for thiopental and similar lipophilic IV hypnotics, termination of effect after a single bolus is governed by redistribution from the brain to less-well-perfused tissues, with the rapid α-phase decline in plasma concentration driving awakening long before meaningful hepatic clearance occurs, and this redistribution model has been specifically invoked for thiopental and other short-acting agents in human studies.

> Wait, let me verify each distractor before concluding: first-pass metabolism applies to orally administered drugs, not IV boluses, so it cannot explain IV thiopental recovery. Zero-order elimination would imply saturation kinetics with constant-rate decline, which is not the profile seen after a single thiopental bolus where plasma levels fall rapidly in a multi-exponential fashion. Ion trapping refers to pH-dependent distribution and is relevant to weak bases or acids crossing membranes, but thiopental's rapid awakening after a bolus is not explained by ion trapping, making all three options mechanistically inconsistent with the scenario [^116hnRtt].

> Hold on, I should verify the redistribution mechanism more explicitly: after a bolus, thiopental rapidly distributes to the brain (accounting for the 30–60 second onset), then quickly redistributes to muscle and adipose tissues with lower perfusion, causing brain concentrations to fall below effect thresholds within minutes and yielding rapid emergence. Metabolism proceeds more slowly with a long elimination half-life, which becomes clinically relevant only with repeated dosing or infusions, not after a single bolus in a child [^11423Tc7].

> I will now examine whether pediatric data align with this. Children often have a shorter elimination half-life than adults, but even in pediatrics the dominant mechanism for rapid awakening after a single thiopental dose remains redistribution, with reports of children recovering promptly after MRI sedation using thiopental, consistent with redistribution-driven emergence rather than rapid hepatic clearance, and pediatric PK references cite elimination half-lives still on the order of hours, underscoring that metabolism is not responsible for the minutes-long recovery after a bolus [^117JmRV6] [^116hnRtt].

> But wait, what if the child had received a prolonged infusion or multiple doses? I should double-check that nuance: with sustained exposure, thiopental accumulates in fat and muscle, and recovery becomes governed by the slow β-phase and context-sensitive effects, leading to markedly prolonged awakening, which is precisely why continuous thiopental infusions for status epilepticus or intracranial hypertension are associated with slow recovery despite the same "drug", reinforcing that the rapid return after a single bolus is redistribution-dependent rather than metabolism-dependent [^11423Tc7] [^115w7zD3].

> Putting this together, the pharmacological property most responsible for rapid awakening after a single IV thiopental bolus is redistribution from the brain to peripheral compartments, so the correct answer is redistribution. The other options either apply to oral administration, describe incompatible kinetics, or refer to mechanisms not relevant to IV thiopental recovery in this context [^116hnRtt].

---

The most likely pharmacological property responsible for the patient's rapid recovery is **redistribution**. After a single bolus, thiopental rapidly diffuses from the brain to less perfused tissues (muscle and fat), causing plasma and brain concentrations to fall quickly and enabling rapid awakening. First-pass metabolism does not apply to IV drugs, zero-order elimination would prolong recovery, and ion trapping is irrelevant here [^11423Tc7].

---

## Pharmacokinetics of thiopental

Thiopental is a highly lipophilic barbiturate with rapid CNS penetration and onset, but its duration is limited by redistribution from the brain to peripheral tissues. After a bolus, it quickly redistributes to muscle and fat, **lowering brain concentrations** and allowing rapid awakening [^notfound].

---

## Redistribution as the primary mechanism of rapid recovery

Redistribution is the principal reason for the brief duration after a single bolus. Thiopental moves from the brain to less perfused tissues, so brain levels fall below the effect threshold within minutes, enabling rapid recovery [^116hnRtt]. This is well documented for thiopental and other lipophilic IV agents, where **early recovery is driven by redistribution**, not metabolism [^116hnRtt].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting redistribution

Clinical and experimental data show that early recovery after a single bolus is due to redistribution, with awakening as brain concentrations fall. With prolonged or repeated dosing, accumulation in fat and muscle delays recovery, emphasizing **redistribution's role** in early emergence [^113or3sZ].

---

## Comparison with other pharmacological properties

| **Pharmacological property** | **Relevance to thiopental recovery** | **Explanation** |
|-|-|-|
| First-pass metabolism | Not applicable | IV drugs bypass first-pass metabolism [^notfound] |
| Zero-order elimination | Not applicable | Zero-order kinetics would prolong recovery, not hasten it [^notfound] |
| Ion trapping | Not applicable | Ion trapping does not explain rapid recovery after IV bolus [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical implications

Understanding redistribution helps clinicians anticipate rapid awakening after a single bolus and recognize that prolonged or repeated dosing will slow recovery due to accumulation. This informs dosing and monitoring strategies to balance efficacy and safety [^113or3sZ].

---

The most likely explanation for rapid recovery after a single thiopental bolus is **redistribution** from the brain to peripheral tissues, which quickly lowers brain concentrations and enables rapid awakening. First-pass metabolism, zero-order elimination, and ion trapping do not account for this clinical course [^notfound].

### Considerations for the use of short-acting opioids in general anesthesia [^114q837Y]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Anesthesiologists play a critical role in facilitating a positive perioperative experience and early recovery for patients. Depending on the kind of procedure or surgery, a wide variety of agents and techniques are currently available to anesthesiologists to administer safe and efficacious anesthesia. Notably, the fast-track or ambulatory surgery environment requires the use of agents that enable rapid induction, maintenance, and emergence combined with minimal adverse effects. Short-acting opioids demonstrate a safe and rapid onset/offset of effect; that short effect is both predictable and precise. It also ensures easier titration and reduced or rapidly reversed side effects. Due to their distinct pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and, in one case, rapid extra-hepatic clearance of remifentanil, these agents have several applications in general anesthesia.

### Do different anesthesia regimes affect hippocampal apoptosis and neurologic deficits in a rodent cardiac arrest model? [^113ShYsY]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Sudden cardiac arrest (CA) is the most important cause of global cerebral ischemia. Only a minority of resuscitated patients are discharged in good neurological condition. After CA, the most relevant factor contributing to recovery is the time interval between collapse and initiation of resuscitation efforts and the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Despite community wide efforts to improve the chain of survival, most patients will not regain consciousness after ROSC, indicating some degree of neuronal injury after transient ischemia. However, neuronal injury is not uniformly distributed, and follows a time course. Vulnerable brain areas (thalamic reticular nucleus, hippocampal cornus ammonis sector, caudate nucleus and cerebellar Purkinje cells) demonstrate delayed neuronal degeneration with characteristic signs of apoptosis. This delayed neuronal degeneration theoretically opens a window of opportunity to mitigate the devastating effects of ischemia on the brain. Despite multiple efforts to alter this pathway, the only neuroprotective measure that has profound effect on survival and functional outcome after CA is hypothermic or normothermic targeted temperature control.

Different rodent CA models have been developed, with induction of CA of different duration by either ventricular fibrillation (6–12 minutes), asphyxiation (6–12 minutes), hypothermia (30 min), injection of potassium chloride or other cardioplegic agents (5–6 min). Whereas all these models simulate the same global brain ischemia, the anesthesia methods differ mainly in two ways: use of intraperitoneal (IP) barbiturates or anesthetic vapors. Both barbiturates and volatile anesthetics have, at least to some degree, neuroprotective properties, thus potentially influencing the results of experimental CA models. Most comatose survivors of cardiac arrest in the intensive care unit need sedative drugs to facilitate mechanical ventilation and reduce sympaticotonic vegetative burden. No formal guidelines exist for this clinical situation, so various regimes are used. Due to technical limitations, vapor anesthetics have been introduced only lately in this patient group.

During implementation of a rodent CA model in our lab, we evaluated the effects of two different anesthetic regimes on brain damage, defined by brain histology and inflammatory markers in the cerebrospinal fluid, and on neurologic deficits, examined by behavioral tests. We choose the volatile anesthetic sevoflurane in combination with fentanyl, which is considered displaying at least some neuroprotective properties. The comparator was a standard rodent anesthesia regime with the α-agonist medetomidine in combination with ketamine. We hypothesized that cardiac arrest with the sevoflurane based anesthesia would provide more neuroprotection than the IP administrated anesthesia.

### Sevoflurane (Sojourn) [^115Y88Uf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Recovery from Anesthesia

The low solubility of sevoflurane facilitates rapid elimination via the lungs. The rate of elimination is quantified as the rate of change of the alveolar (end-tidal) concentration following termination of anesthesia (FA), relative to the last alveolar concentration (FaO) measured immediately before discontinuance of the anesthetic. In the healthy volunteer study described above, rate of elimination of sevoflurane was similar compared with desflurane, but faster compared with either halothane or isoflurane. These results are depicted in Figure 4.

Protein Binding

The effects of sevoflurane on the displacement of drugs from serum and tissue proteins have not been investigated. Other fluorinated volatile anesthetics have been shown to displace drugs from serum and tissue proteins in vitro. The clinical significance of this is unknown. Clinical studies have shown no untoward effects when sevoflurane is administered to patients taking drugs that are highly bound and have a small volume of distribution (e.g., phenytoin).

Metabolism

Sevoflurane is metabolized by cytochrome P450 2E1, to hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) with release of inorganic fluoride and CO2. Once formed HFIP is rapidly conjugated with glucuronic acid and eliminated as a urinary metabolite. No other metabolic pathways for sevoflurane have been identified. In vivo metabolism studies suggest that approximately 5% of the sevoflurane dose may be metabolized.

### Propofol: a medication that changed pediatric anesthesia practice [^115m7yuj]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The introduction of propofol changed our understanding of pediatric anesthesia pharmacology, research approaches for intravenous drug study, and led to infusion pump development for the maintenance phase of anesthesia. The story of propofol development provides a blueprint for other intravenous drug development. The introduction of the target concentration strategy based on pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic and covariate understanding is central to total intravenous anesthesia techniques and is best exemplified by propofol. While use of the EEG to gauge depth of anesthesia preceded the propofol era, processed EEG signals enabled description of the relationship between propofol plasma concentration and effect, advancing propofol use and safety. Clinical need drove the characterization of propofol pharmacokinetics and concentration effect relationships in children. Subsequently, study in populations such as neonates, the critically ill, and children with obesity explored covariate influences. Target-controlled infusions also required an appreciation of effect site concentrations and time delays, and drug interactions such as those between propofol and opioids. Supraglottic airway use in children paralleled propofol use because greater depression of pharyngeal and laryngeal reactivity was noted with propofol than seen than with thiopental. Environmental concerns with the carbon footprint of inhalational agents may yet see infusions assume dominance for maintenance anesthesia.

### Cardioprotection with volatile anesthetics: mechanisms and clinical implications [^117NYiaB]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac surgery and some noncardiac procedures are associated with a significant risk of perioperative cardiac morbid events. Experimental data indicate that clinical concentrations of volatile general anesthetics protect the myocardium from ischemia and reperfusion injury, as shown by decreased infarct size and a more rapid recovery of contractile function on reperfusion. These anesthetics may also mediate protective effects in other organs, such as the brain and kidney. Recently, a number of reports have indicated that these experimentally observed protective effects may also have clinical implications in cardiac surgery. However, the impact of the use of volatile anesthetics on outcome measures, such as postoperative mortality and recovery in cardiac and noncardiac surgery, is yet to be determined.

### Sufentanil citrate (Sufenta) [^113PAS9Q]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

Pharmacology

SUFENTA is an opioid analgesic. When used in balanced general anesthesia, SUFENTA has been reported to be as much as 10 times as potent as fentanyl. When administered intravenously as a primary anesthetic agent with 100% oxygen, SUFENTA is approximately 5 to 7 times as potent as fentanyl.

Assays of histamine in patients administered SUFENTA have shown no elevation in plasma histamine levels and no indication of histamine release.

(See dosage chart for more complete information on the intravenous use of SUFENTA.)

Intravenous use

At intravenous doses of up to 8 mcg/kg, SUFENTA is an analgesic component of general anesthesia; at intravenous doses ≥ 8 mcg/kg, SUFENTA produces a deep level of anesthesia. SUFENTA produces a dose related attenuation of catecholamine release, particularly norepinephrine.

At intravenous dosages of ≥ 8 mcg/kg, SUFENTA produces hypnosis and anesthesia without the use of additional anesthetic agents. A deep level of anesthesia is maintained at these dosages, as demonstrated by EEG patterns. Dosages of up to 25 mcg/kg attenuate the sympathetic response to surgical stress. The catecholamine response, particularly norepinephrine, is further attenuated at doses of SUFENTA of 25 to 30 mcg/kg, with hemodynamic stability and preservation of favorable myocardial oxygen balance.

SUFENTA has an immediate onset of action, with relatively limited accumulation. Rapid elimination from tissue storage sites allows for relatively more rapid recovery as compared with equipotent dosages of fentanyl. At dosages of 1 to 2 mcg/kg, recovery times are comparable to those observed with fentanyl; at dosages of > 2 to 6 mcg/kg, recovery times are comparable to enflurane, isoflurane and fentanyl. Within the anesthetic dosage range of 8 to 30 mcg/kg of SUFENTA, recovery times are more rapid compared to equipotent fentanyl dosages.

### Thiopental to desflurane-an anaesthetic journey. where are we going next? [^113eGSH3]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Development targets in anaesthetic pharmacology have evolved from minimizing harm caused by unwanted effects through an era in which rapid onset and offset of drug effect were prioritised. Today's anaesthetists have access to a library of effective drugs whose characteristics offer controllable hypnosis, analgesia and paralysis with manageable off-target effects. The availability of these agents at generic prices inhibits commercial interest and this is reflected in the limited number of current anaesthetic drug development projects. Recently, questions around neonatal neurotoxicity, delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction have stimulated research to characterise these phenomena and explain them in mechanistic terms. Emergent basic science from these enquiries together with exploration of possible effects of anaesthetic drug choice on patient outcomes from cancer surgery may yield new targets for drug discovery.

### 2023 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for monitoring and antagonism of neuromuscular blockade: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on neuromuscular blockade [^115bYQHS]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Antagonist selection, neostigmine effectiveness conditions, and FDA-approved dosing: The antagonist drugs currently available include anticholinesterases and sugammadex, a selective relaxant binding drug, and neostigmine is the most commonly used anticholinesterase and the only drug in this class evaluated for this guideline. The effective use of neostigmine or sugammadex is based on identifying patients highly likely to achieve an effective antagonism with neostigmine, and the degree of spontaneous recovery at the time of antagonism has been shown to be the major determinant of successful and timely antagonism with neostigmine. Administering neostigmine at a train–of–four count of 4 is much more likely to yield a satisfactory and timely antagonism than at a lower train–of–four count, yet effective antagonism is not guaranteed even at a train–of–four count of 4 if the fourth twitch is still very weak. In one study, patients antagonized when the train–of–four ratio was 0.4 all achieved a train–of–four ratio greater than or equal to 0.9 within 10 min of neostigmine administration, and another study comparing sugammadex with neostigmine at a train–of–four ratio of 0.5 found both were equally effective at that depth. Minimal block is described as a quantitatively measured block with a train–of–four ratio of 0.4 to 0.9 or a qualitatively assessed block with no subjective fade, and quantitative determination of a train–of–four ratio greater than or equal to 0.4 is associated with improved predictability of neostigmine. FDA–approved dosing for antagonizing rocuronium or vecuronium with sugammadex includes 2mg/kg for train–of–four count 2 to train–of–four ratio less than 0.9, 4mg/kg for posttetanic count 1 to train–of–four count 1, and 16mg/kg for immediate antagonism after a single dose of rocuronium 1.2mg/kg; a neostigmine dose of 30 μg/kg is also noted.

### Pharmacogenetics of anesthetic and analgesic agents [^1125sX9i]. Anesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Predicting a patient's response to a particular drug has long been a goal of clinicians. Rapid advances in molecular biology have enabled researchers to identify associations between an individual's genetic profile and drug response. Pharmacogenetics is the study of the molecular mechanisms that underlie individual differences in drug metabolism, efficacy, and side effects. The pharmacogenetics of commonly used anesthetic and analgesic agents are reviewed.

### Early drug distribution: a generally neglected aspect of pharmacokinetics of particular relevance to intravenously administered anesthetic agents [^115oCdGk]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

There is considerable variability in response to intravenously administered anesthetic drugs (e.g., hypnotics, benzodiazepines, and narcotics) that have a rapid onset of effect (such as hypnosis, anxiolysis, and analgesia) and a low margin of safety (because of cardiovascular or respiratory depression, etc.). Although the onset of effect for these drugs occurs seconds to minutes after injection, traditional pharmacokinetic models are based on blood samples that are first obtained after drug effects have peaked. As a result, many studies have failed to provide a pharmacokinetic rationale for dosage adjustments of these drugs.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guidelines for rapid sequence intubation in the critically ill adult patient [^113NNG8B]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Induction agent selection — critically ill adults undergoing rapid sequence intubation (RSI): We suggest there is no difference between etomidate and other induction agents administered for RSI with respect to mortality or the incidence of hypotension or vasopressor use in the peri-intubation period and through hospital discharge (conditional recommendation, moderate quality of evidence). Supporting evidence includes a Cochrane review that analyzed six studies (n = 772 patients) and did not show increased mortality with etomidate (0.2–0.3 mg/kg) when used as a single dose for RSI compared with other agents, OR 1.17 (95% CI, 0.86–1.60). Observational trauma data found no mortality difference between regimens, with 19% mortality in each group (OR 0.98; 95% CI, 0.51–1.87), and an institutional before-and-after change from etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) to ketamine (1–2 mg/kg) showed no difference in hospital mortality (20% vs 17%; OR 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92–2.16). A meta-analysis of 29 studies reported an increased overall mortality rate with etomidate (rr = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04–1.29), although only 5 were RCTs, and overall, these data are limited by selection bias, which may affect both mortality and the severity of illness correlation.

### Effects of propofol versus thiopental on APGAR scores in newborns and peri-operative outcomes of women undergoing emergency cesarean section: a randomized clinical trial [^114ss9bq]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

We conducted a single blinded randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of propofol and thiopental on neonatal Apgar scores and maternal peri-operative outcomes.

The Apgar scores of neonates randomized into the two study arms did not significantly differ, except at 0 min, which showed a marginally significant difference. However, the percentage of neonates with unsatisfactory scores (< 7) was greater than 50% in the propofol group (57.3%) compared with that in the thiopental group (41.3%). While this may not be statistically significant, this outcome cannot be ignored because it highlights the need for skilled labor to attend all births when anesthesia is induced with propofol. The high prevalence of unsatisfactory Apgar scores can be attributed to the high rate of placental transfer of propofol coupled with the rapid loss of consciousness, as reported in previous studies.

The percentage of neonates with an Apgar score < 7 at the 1, 5, and 10-min intervals steadily decreased in both study groups to nearly equal numbers of three and two neonates in the propofol and thiopental groups, respectively (Figure 2). None of the differences in the Apgar scores were significant between the two groups, except at 0 min, which showed borderline significance, despite the Apgar scores being higher in the propofol group than in the thiopental group (Table 2). This finding is consistent with those of other studies comparing these two induction agents. The faster improvement in the Apgar scores in the propofol group is probably caused by the fast redistribution half-life of propofol, which is as low as 1 min, while thiopental requires up to 6 min. This also explains the higher percentage of neonates who recovered in < 5 min in the propofol group.

### Reversal of profound, high-dose rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade by sugammadex at two different time points: an international, multicenter, randomized, dose-finding, safety assessor-blinded, phase II trial [^113KqvVj]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Sugammadex (Org 25969), a novel, selective relaxant binding agent, was specifically designed to rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. The efficacy and safety of sugammadex for the reversal of profound, high-dose rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade was evaluated.

Methods

A total of 176 adult patients were randomly assigned to receive sugammadex (2, 4, 8, 12, or 16 mg/kg) or placebo at 3 or 15 min after high-dose rocuronium (1.0 or 1.2 mg/kg) during propofol anesthesia. The primary endpoint was time to recovery of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9. Neuromuscular monitoring was performed using acceleromyography.

Results

Sugammadex administered 3 or 15 min after injection of 1 mg/kg rocuronium decreased the median recovery time of the train-of-four ratio to 0.9 in a dose-dependent manner from 111.1 min and 91.0 min (placebo) to 1.6 min and 0.9 min (16 mg/kg sugammadex), respectively. After 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium, sugammadex decreased time to recovery of train-of-four from 124.3 min (3-min group) and 94.2 min (15-min group) to 1.3 min and 1.9 min with 16 mg/kg sugammadex, respectively. There was no clinical evidence of reoccurrence of neuromuscular blockade or residual neuromuscular blockade. Exploratory analysis revealed that prolongation of the corrected QT interval considered as possibly related to sugammadex occurred in one patient. Another two patients developed markedly abnormal arterial blood pressure after sugammadex that lasted approximately 15 min.

Conclusion

Sugammadex provides a rapid and dose-dependent reversal of profound neuromuscular blockade induced by high-dose rocuronium (1.0 or 1.2 mg/kg) in adult surgical patients.

### A case report of multiple anesthesia for pediatric surgery: 80 anesthesia applications in a period of 6 years [^116HxycE]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

In a previous study, the effect of repeated isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia on rat hepatocytes was investigated. The results suggested that the anesthetics do not present considerable hepatotoxicity.

In our case, we preferred rocuronium as a muscle relaxant. We think that the antagonism assured by sugammadex represents an additional safety factor for the use of rocuronium, especially in cases of difficult intubation. The use of sugammadex was not required in our case.

Among the drugs used in anesthesia, antibiotics and, rarely, muscle relaxants elicit an allergic reaction. In our case, the clinical manifestation of allergic reaction was a skin rash observed at the induction of anesthesia (in 8 anesthesia applications), most likely caused by rocuronium.

Thiopental, the most commonly used barbiturate in pediatric anesthesia, depresses respiration and induces apnea. Thiopental is not preferred in short cases because it has no analgesic effect and has a late recovery compared with propofol. We were required to use thiopental when propofol was not available in our hospital pharmacy.

Recently, preclinical data along with retrospective clinical studies have suggested that anesthesia could damage brain functions in children by affecting multiple ion channels, receptors and cell signaling processes in the central nervous system. The stage of brain development at the time of exposure to anesthesia and the frequency and cumulative anesthetic doses are some important factors causing neurotoxicity. Brambrink et al. reported that a 5-h exposure of infant rhesus macaque brains to isoflurane was sufficient to cause widespread apoptosis of neurons and oligodendrocytes throughout the developing brain. Zou et al. demonstrated that ketamine administration results in a dose-related and exposure-time-dependent increase in neuronal cell death in the developing rat brain. However, the relevance of these laboratory findings to clinical practice remains unclear because it is quite difficult to find or prove the neurological harm that might be caused by anesthesia in clinical studies conducted on children.

### The myth of rescue reversal in "Can' T intubate, can' T ventilate" scenarios [^1146AQs1]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

An unanticipated difficult airway during induction of anesthesia can be a vexing problem. In the setting of can't intubate, can't ventilate (CICV), rapid recovery of spontaneous ventilation is a reasonable goal. The urgency of restoring ventilation is a function of how quickly a patient's hemoglobin oxygen saturation decreases versus how much time is required for the effects of induction drugs to dissipate, namely the duration of unresponsiveness, ventilatory depression, and neuromuscular blockade. It has been suggested that prompt reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex will allow respiratory activity to recover before significant arterial desaturation. Using pharmacologic simulation, we compared the duration of unresponsiveness, ventilatory depression, and neuromuscular blockade in normal, obese, and morbidly obese body sizes in this life-threatening CICV scenario. We hypothesized that although neuromuscular function could be rapidly restored with sugammadex, significant arterial desaturation will occur before the recovery from unresponsiveness and/or central ventilatory depression in obese and morbidly obese body sizes.

Methods

We used published models to simulate the duration of unresponsiveness and ventilatory depression using a common induction technique with predicted rates of oxygen desaturation in various size patients and explored to what degree rapid reversal of rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex might improve the return of spontaneous ventilation in CICV situations.

Results

Our simulations showed that the duration of neuromuscular blockade was longer with 1.0 mg/kg succinylcholine than with 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium followed 3 minutes later by 16 mg/kg sugammadex (10.0 vs 4.5 minutes). Once rocuronium neuromuscular blockade was completely reversed with sugammadex, the duration of hemoglobin oxygen saturation > 90%, loss of responsiveness, and intolerable ventilatory depression (a respiratory rate of ≤ 4 breaths/min) were dependent on the body habitus and duration of oxygen administration. There is a high probability of intolerable ventilatory depression that extends well beyond the time when oxygen saturation decreases < 90%, especially in obese and morbidly obese patients. If ventilatory rescue is inadequate, oxygen desaturation will persist in the latter groups, despite full reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Depending on body habitus, the duration of intolerable ventilatory depression after sugammadex reversal may be as long as 15 minutes in 5% of individuals.

Conclusions

The clinical management of CICV should focus primarily on restoration of airway patency, oxygenation, and ventilation consistent with the American Society of Anesthesiologist's practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway. Pharmacologic intervention cannot be relied upon to rescue patients in a CICV crisis.

### Etomidate [^111KKKtN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Etomidate is a general anesthetic without analgesic activity. Intravenous injection of etomidate produces anesthesia characterized by a rapid onset of action, usually within one minute. Duration of anesthesia is dose dependent but relatively brief, usually three to five minutes when an average dose of 0.3 mg/kg is employed. Immediate recovery from anesthesia (as assessed by awakening time, time needed to follow simple commands and time to perform simple tests after anesthesia as well as they were performed before anesthesia), based upon data derived from short operative procedures where intravenous etomidate was used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia, is about as rapid as, or slightly faster than, immediate recovery after similar use of thiopental. These same data revealed that the immediate recovery period will usually be shortened in adult patients by the intravenous administration of approximately 0.1 mg of intravenous fentanyl, one or two minutes before induction of anesthesia, probably because less etomidate is generally required under these circumstances (consult the package insert for fentanyl before using).

The most characteristic effect of intravenous etomidate on the respiratory system is a slight elevation in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2). (See also ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Reduced cortisol plasma levels have been reported with induction doses of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. These persist for approximately 6 to 8 hours and appear to be unresponsive to ACTH administration.

### Volatile anesthetics. is a new player emerging in critical care sedation? [^1117VtCW]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Volatile anesthetic agent use in the intensive care unit, aided by technological advances, has become more accessible to critical care physicians. With increasing concern over adverse patient consequences associated with our current sedation practice, there is growing interest to find non-benzodiazepine-based alternative sedatives. Research has demonstrated that volatile-based sedation may provide superior awakening and extubation times in comparison with current intravenous sedation agents (propofol and benzodiazepines). Volatile agents may possess important end-organ protective properties mediated via cytoprotective and antiinflammatory mechanisms. However, like all sedatives, volatile agents are capable of deeply sedating patients, which can have respiratory depressant effects and reduce patient mobility. This review seeks to critically appraise current volatile use in critical care medicine including current research, technical consideration of their use, contraindications, areas of controversy, and proposed future research topics.

### Rocuronium bromide [^116G12bS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Use by Continuous Infusion

Infusion at an initial rate of 10 to 12 mcg/kg/min of rocuronium bromide injection should be initiated only after early evidence of spontaneous recovery from an intubating dose. Due to rapid redistribution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and the associated rapid spontaneous recovery, initiation of the infusion after substantial return of neuromuscular function (more than 10% of control T1) may necessitate additional bolus doses to maintain adequate block for surgery.

Upon reaching the desired level of neuromuscular block, the infusion of rocuronium bromide injection must be individualized for each patient. The rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient's twitch response as monitored with the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator. In clinical trials, infusion rates have ranged from 4 to 16 mcg/kg/min.

Inhalation anesthetics, particularly enflurane and isoflurane, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. In the presence of steady-state concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane, it may be necessary to reduce the rate of infusion by 30% to 50%, at 45 to 60 minutes after the intubating dose.

Spontaneous recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation of rocuronium bromide injection infusion may be expected to proceed at rates comparable to that following comparable total doses administered by repetitive bolus injections [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Infusion solutions of rocuronium bromide injection can be prepared by mixing rocuronium bromide injection with an appropriate infusion solution such as 5% glucose in water or lactated Ringers [see Dosage and Administration (2.7)]. These infusion solutions should be used within 24 hours of mixing. Unused portions of infusion solutions should be discarded.

Infusion rates of rocuronium bromide injection can be individualized for each patient using the following tables for 3 different concentrations of rocuronium bromide injection solution as guidelines:

### Impact of timing of continuous intravenous anesthetic drug treatment on outcome in refractory status epilepticus [^111TfrWh]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we aimed to analyze the impact of timing of anesthetic therapy on the clinical course and the prognosis of RSE and found early initiation of cIVADs to be associated with higher chance of good outcome at last follow-up. This is one of only a few studies exclusively focusing on RSE episodes treated with continuous anesthetics, and several aspects of our results deserve attention.

First, we found reduced mental status and GCSE to be more frequent among patients who received treatment with cIVADs early. This probably reflects the fact that time of initiation of such therapy may be driven by clinical necessity rather than a specific treatment strategy in many cases, including those when patients have persisting convulsions after administration of two lines of non-anesthetic AEDs or require intubation for airway protection. Both severely lowered levels of consciousness and generalized convulsive seizures are known predictors of negative outcome in SE. Thus, although unfavorable prognosticators were more common among patients with early initiation of cIVADs, these individuals had better outcome. As there were no differences in baseline characteristics accounting for this fact, it appears plausible that this observation is related to the time of cIVAD initiation, especially because this factor was an independent predictor of outcome upon multivariable analysis.

Second, the choice of anesthetics administered requires discussion. Early cIVAD therapy was a negative predictor for the use of thiopental. Previous research found that, compared with other anesthetics, thiopental for RSE was associated with higher risk of complications, prolonged mechanical ventilation, duration of intensive care unit and overall hospital stay, and worse short- and long-term outcome. Therefore, both clinical course and outcome could depend more on the choice of a specific anesthetic agent than on the time of initiation of cIVAD therapy. However, the decision to apply barbiturates may be influenced by a higher degree of seizure refractoriness suspected, especially as previous research found their use for RSE to be a surrogate for treatment aggressiveness. Refractoriness to therapy in SE is known to increase with the duration of seizures and therefore late use of anesthetics could lead to administration of a more hazardous agent, thus linking late use of cIVADs to poorer outcome.

### Should we consider the infusion of lipid emulsion in the resuscitation of poisoned patients? [^1115Rgsd]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Human pharmacokinetic data are limited to two clinical studies and sporadic case reports. Minton and colleagues demonstrated a statistically non-significant increase in plasma amitriptyline concentrations in subjects in pharmacokinetic steady state subjected to infused lipid emulsion. Free drug concentrations were not measured. Litonius and colleagues furthermore found a decreased half-life for a nontoxic dose of bupivacaine in blood after administration of ILE in eight normal subjects, consistent with an effect on tissue redistribution. A decrease in free verapamil concentration was reported after treatment with ILE for intoxication, commensurate with clinical improvement. In another report, increased total blood amitriptyline concentrations were seen following ILE therapy in a case of mixed overdose with prominent tricyclic toxidrome.

While attractive in its simplicity, emerging evidence suggests application of the sink theory must be approached with some caution in all but a few overdose scenarios. A pure sink effect may be important in cardiac arrest due to direct intravenous bolus administration of intoxicant - the centralised circulation meaning that rapid equilibration of heart and brain concentrations with the introduced, centrally confined lipid phase may be possible. Subsequent redistribution of intoxicant to peripheral fat depots on return of effective circulation would conceivably ensue - such a situation could be hypothesized to occur in most forms of LAST.

Any pharmacokinetic effect for ILE in the non-arrested patient likely depends on both the pharmacokinetic phase and circulatory status at the time of intoxication. Increased plasma carriage for lipophilic toxins with ILE injection will increase drug transport between organ systems according to a complex interplay of tissue drug affinity, relative concentration, and perfusion. As such, net movement of intoxicant may not prove universally beneficial (that is, from target organ to peripheral depot). For example, in one study investigating the effect of ILE on thiopental anaesthesia in rabbits, early lipid administration appeared to increase the depth, but not overall duration, of anaesthesia. This could be explained by the action of lipid emulsion as a high affinity conduit - maintaining blood concentrations able to interact with the brain during early redistribution to hydrophilic tissues, before augmenting later redistribution from rapidly perfused to lesser perfused lipophilic tissues.

### Effects of propofol versus thiopental on APGAR scores in newborns and peri-operative outcomes of women undergoing emergency cesarean section: a randomized clinical trial [^112vqK5K]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

An important finding in our study was the significantly higher rate of NICU admissions in the propofol group compared with the thiopental group. All but three neonates admitted to the NICU survived at 24 hours.

The three neonates that died in this study had low Apgar scores coupled with poor respiratory effort; they required ventilator assistance, but because these services were unavailable in the NICU, they died. A large percentage of neonates were admitted into the NICU (22% overall) not only because of low Apgar scores, but also due to protocol. All neonates with low Apgar scores requiring continuous bag mask ventilation for > 3 min are admitted for close observation for at least 24 hours.

The mean recovery times were significantly shorter in the propofol group than in the thiopental group at 25 min (10.13) versus 31 min (14.66), respectively (p = 0.003). Because the mean duration of isoflurane exposure was identical in the groups (38.9 vs. 38.1 min), the prolonged recovery time in the thiopental group can be solely attributed to the induction agent. Contribution from the initial maternal physiologic state cannot be discounted; however, under normal circumstances, this factor should be evenly distributed between the two study groups as the study population was randomized.

Our study had a number of limitations. This was a single-blinded study because of the consistency of the drugs evaluated; propofol is a white, milky suspension, and thiopental is a yellow, clear solution. The anesthesia providers are aware of this difference; therefore, blinding them is impossible. Any individual variation in the metabolism of the induction drugs could not be measured; thus, this potential contribution to the low Apgar scores could not be accounted for. Finally, the interval between the decision to perform cesarean section and the delivery was significantly higher than the recommended 30 min for an emergency case, which also contributed to the low Apgar scores overall.

### European neuromuscular centre consensus statement on anaesthesia in patients with neuromuscular disorders [^113QvTHC]. European Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

General anaesthesia

Short‐acting opioids, sedatives, and hypnotic agents are preferred to minimize respiratory depression on emergence from anaesthesia.

Level of evidence: 4

The median score by the modified Delphi process was 9. Respondents who scored ≥ 7 totaled 18 of 18 (100%); two respondents abstained from voting.

Neuromuscular blocking agents

Based on their mechanisms of action, NMBAs can be divided into depolarizing NMBAs and nondepolarizing NMBAs. Patients with an NMD are at greatest risk for succinylcholine‐induced hyperkalaemia. Hence, succinylcholine should not be used in patients with a known or suspected NMD.

Level of evidence: 2−

The median score by the modified Delphi process was 9. Respondents who scored ≥ 7 totaled 19 of 19 (100%); one respondent abstained from voting.

Most neuromuscular patients have an increased sensitivity to nondepolarizing NMBAs because of the reduced muscle mass and strength. A lower initial dose may be sufficient to achieve adequate muscle relaxation. Duration of action is often prolonged, and effects of residual relaxation are more severe than in normal patients. The effect of NMBAs should be measured by quantitative neuromuscular monitoring to prevent residual neuromuscular blockade following emergence from anaesthesia and extubation.

Level of evidence: 2+

The median score by the modified Delphi process was 9. Respondents who scored ≥ 7 totaled 18 of 18 (100%); two respondents abstained from voting.

When a nondepolarizing NMBA is used, extubation and emergence from anaesthesia should be guided by a train‐of‐four ratio of 1.0. Any residual and potentially clinically relevant muscle relaxation at the end of the intervention should preferably be reversed with sugammadex as a specific pharmacological antagonist of rocuronium and vecuronium. Due to the effectiveness of sugammadex, the latter two nondepolarizing NMBAs should be given preference. When there is residual neuromuscular blockade after use of other NMBAs or sugammadex is unavailable, extubation and emergence from anaesthesia should be postponed until baseline muscular strength has recovered spontaneously. In this scenario, postoperative sedation and ventilatory support are necessary.

### Comparison of the effects of remimazolam and propofol on postoperative delirium in elderly surgical patients: a meta-analysis [^111TjM1N]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Remimazolam besylate, a novel intravenous sedative, has been approved for anesthetic use in various clinical settings. It offers several advantages, including rapid onset of action, swift metabolism, expedited patient recovery, minimal injection discomfort, independence from hepatic and renal metabolism, and negligible effects on respiratory and circulatory functions. Despite its growing clinical use, evidence supporting its efficacy and safety remains limited. Pharmacokinetic findings suggest that the context-sensitive decrement time (CSDT) of remimazolam is comparable to that of propofol, which may challenge its classification as an "ultra-short-acting" benzodiazepine. Recent studies indicate that remimazolam may improve hemodynamic stability during anesthesia induction, particularly in high-risk cardiac surgery patients. While these findings are promising, further investigation is required to define its clinical role better and optimize its application. Existing research exhibits certain methodological limitations, highlighting the need for larger, prospective trials to validate its safety and efficacy.

With its unique pharmacological profile, remimazolam could be a valuable alternative to propofol in selected clinical scenarios. While the safety and effectiveness of remimazolam and propofol in preventing POD are still subjects of ongoing debate, this study seeks to systematically evaluate and compare these two anesthetics through a meta-analysis. By integrating available clinical data, we aim to provide a more evidence-based foundation for anesthetic decision-making and ultimately enhance postoperative patient care and outcomes.

### Electroencephalographic slow wave dynamics and loss of behavioural responsiveness induced by ketamine in human volunteers [^1143CF6T]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

The generators of theta waves seen with ketamine are not well understood, and it is not clear why the time course is slower in onset and longer in duration than for SWA and beta–gamma power. We speculate that theta involves slower acting molecular targets and mechanisms downstream from fast ion channels. Increased theta resonance may represent network disequilibrium between anterior and posterior regions with impaired information flow. This speculative interpretation requires targeted, follow-up investigation (e.g. anatomical source analysis) to advance understanding of such theta oscillations.

There are divergent views on the time course of the onset of the actions of ketamine. Clinically the time course has been thought comparable with the LOBR seen with propofol and thiopentone. A detailed study in sheep that compared EEG changes with a mass balance measure of actual brain drug uptake suggested a long t₁/₂ kₑ₀ of around 120 s, which is similar to that of propofol. However, most other studies suggest a more rapid uptake of ketamine to the effect-site. Using the clinical endpoint of LOBR in children, a mean (range) t₁/₂ kₑ₀ of 11 (7–20) s was reported. Our EEG-based estimate agrees with a short t₁/₂ kₑ₀ similar to that of methohexitone.

A limitation to this study is that the ketamine plasma levels were not measured directly; accuracy of the model could only be indirectly inferred from dosing and EEG responses. Similarly, it is unclear whether the very steep dose–response curves are a manifestation of a true pharmacodynamic threshold phenomenon (such as a phase-change transition to unconsciousness), or whether they are an exaggerated pharmacokinetic drug diffusion effect caused by the bolus dose. Another limitation is the fact that we had to remove some channels in order to achieve physiologically reasonable model fitting, especially for the beta–gamma analysis. Although not ideal, this does accurately reflect the real-world problems of separating muscle artifact from EEG in a significant proportion of ketamine patients.

### Adequacy of maternal anesthesia depth with two sodium thiopental doses in elective caesarean section: a randomized clinical trial [^114ks7Hs]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Determining the optimal dosage of anesthetic agents is challenging. This fact is particularly a matter of concern in Caesarean section. The susceptible fetus can be affected by the administered agents passing through the placenta, resulting in the delivery of anesthetized "sleepy baby". Robust study on appropriate drug regimens to guarantee adequate depth of anesthesia during Caesarean section is surprisingly rare. This may be due to paucity of use of general anesthesia for Caesarean section and its application only in emergency situations when conducting randomized trials is extremely difficult.

Sodium thiopental (STP), a short-acting well known barbiturate, is currently a routine choices for induction of general anesthesia in Cesarean section in some countries. The usual recommended dose of thiopental for induction of general anesthesia for Caesarean section is 4–5 mg/kg, but several studies showed that parturient are at risk of inadequate anesthesia. The incidence of unexpected awareness during Caesarean has been decreased to 0.26–0.4% by using modification of induction technique and larger dose of thiopental, but it is still more prevalent than in general surgical population (0.1–0.2%). Obstetric general anesthesia includes many risk factors for accidental awareness during general Anesthesia (AAGA) including use of STP for anesthesia, rapid sequence induction, deep neuromuscular block, obesity, difficult airway management, and emergency surgery. Thiopental in combination with rapid sequence induction is an important risk factor for awareness, possibly because of inappropriate low dose.

### Propofol [^1155uj2j]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Propofol injectable emulsion is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAAreceptors.

### Adequacy of maternal anesthesia depth with two sodium thiopental doses in elective caesarean section: a randomized clinical trial [^1173iGFV]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

All patients were monitored using routine noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, end tidal gas analyzer and BIS monitoring. After proper pre oxygenation, general anesthesia was induced with rapid sequence method and administration of either 5 mg/kg STP or 7 mg/kg STP and 2 mg/kg succinylcholine. Maintenance was accomplished using 50% O 2, 50% N 2 O and sevoflurane was titrated based on the end tidal concentration to keep it between 1.8–2.2% before delivery of the fetus thereafter, it was adjusted to about 1.2%. After delivery of the neonate, 0.15 mg/kg morphine and 0.02 mg/kg midazolam were administrated. After return of spontaneous respiration, 0.3 mg/kg atracurium was administered to provide surgical relaxation. Sevoflurane and N 2 O were discontinued at the time of subcutaneous and skin suturing, respectively.

The examiner explained the concept of the study to the patients and placed a pneumatic tourniquet around the right forearm of the patients and inflated it to 200 mg immediately before induction. After induction, a recorded message was played by the earphones every 1 min which asked the patient to move the fingers of her right hand. Hand activity was scored as no movement (0), non-specific movement (e.g. fine movements of fingers), or firm clenching/flexing movement. The BIS value, IFT response and end tidal sevoflurane concentration were documented during the following events: baseline, anesthesia induction laryngoscopy, intubation, skin-peritoneal-uterine incisions, uterus retraction, delivery, uterine closure, muscular closure, subcutaneous closure, skin closure, sevoflurane discontinuation, eye opening and tracheal extubation.

### Etomidate (Amidate) [^112tXnVA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Etomidate is a general anesthetic without analgesic activity. Intravenous injection of etomidate produces anesthesia characterized by a rapid onset of action, usually within one minute. Duration of anesthesia is dose dependent but relatively brief, usually three to five minutes when an average dose of 0.3 mg/kg is employed. Immediate recovery from anesthesia (as assessed by awakening time, time needed to follow simple commands and time to perform simple tests after anesthesia as well as they were performed before anesthesia), based upon data derived from short operative procedures where intravenous etomidate was used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia, is about as rapid as, or slightly faster than, immediate recovery after similar use of thiopental. These same data revealed that the immediate recovery period will usually be shortened in adult patients by the intravenous administration of approximately 0.1 mg of intravenous fentanyl, one or two minutes before induction of anesthesia, probably because less etomidate is generally required under these circumstances (consult the package insert for fentanyl before using).

The most characteristic effect of intravenous etomidate on the respiratory system is a slight elevation in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Reduced cortisol plasma levels have been reported with induction doses of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. These persist for approximately 6 to 8 hours and appear to be unresponsive to Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration.

### Dose requirements of alfentanil to eliminate autonomic responses during rapid-sequence induction with thiopental 4 mg / kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg / kg [^1173oU4H]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Opioids are integral part of anesthesia induction, but information on optimal dosing is limited. We aimed to determine doses of alfentanil needed to eliminate increases in 5 autonomic response variables (plasma concentrations of epinephrine, norepinephrine and vasopressin, arterial blood pressure [ABP], and heart rate) during rapid-sequence induction of anesthesia with thiopental 4 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg.

Design

Prospective, randomized, observer-blinded, interventional clinical study.

Setting

Large academic institution.

Patients

Eighty-four healthy patients, aged 18 to 55 years, received 1 of 7 assessor-blinded doses of alfentanil (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 μg/kg) together with thiopental 4 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg, administered in rapid succession (15 seconds). Laryngoscopy was initiated 40 seconds after rocuronium, and tracheal intubation was concluded within 15 seconds thereafter.

Measurements

An indwelling radial artery catheter was used for hemodynamic monitoring and blood sampling. Relationships between alfentanil dose and response variables were tested with linear regression, and the influence of covariates (sex, body weight, and age) was determined. Alfentanil dose needed to prevent increases in ABP > 10% above baseline with 95% probability was estimated with logistic regression.

Main Results

Significant relationships were determined between alfentanil dose and response variables. Clinically interesting influence of covariates was not found. Alfentanil 55 μg/kg was needed to prevent increases in ABP postintubation > 10% above baseline with 95% probability. One individual needed a bolus of vasopressor postintubation.

Conclusions

Optimal control of autonomic responses during rapid-sequence induction was achieved with clinically relevant doses of alfentanil in healthy patients anesthetized with thiopental 4 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg.

### Current status of perioperative hypnotics, role of benzodiazepines, and the case for remimazolam: a narrative review [^113ZE3Ue]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Anaesthesiologists and non-anaesthesiologist sedationists have a limited set of available i.v. hypnotics, further reduced by the withdrawal of thiopental in the USA and its near disappearance in Europe. Meanwhile, demand for sedation increases and new clinical groups are using what traditionally are anaesthesiologists' drugs. Improved understanding of the determinants of perioperative morbidity and mortality has spotlighted hypotension as a potent cause of patient harm, and practice must be adjusted to respect this. High-dose propofol sedation may be harmful, and a critical reappraisal of drug choices and doses is needed. The development of remimazolam, initially for procedural sedation, allows reconsideration of benzodiazepines as the hypnotic component of a general anaesthetic even if their characterisation as i.v. anaesthetics is questionable. Early data suggest that a combination of remimazolam and remifentanil can induce and maintain anaesthesia. Further work is needed to define use cases for this technique and to determine the impact on patient outcomes.

### Adequacy of maternal anesthesia depth with two sodium thiopental doses in elective caesarean section: a randomized clinical trial [^1177J8P8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Although 1-min Apgar score indicates the requirements for neonate cares at the time of birth, this is the 5-min Apgar score that shows the morbidity and the effect on the neurobehavioral response. In our study we found that the neonates had lower Apgar score at minute 1 in high-dose group and subsequently improved at 5 and 20 min. Thus for better evaluation of the neonatal developmental disability we used neonatal neurobehavioral examination. Low-dose STP group neonates performed better in all the three aspects of tone and motor patterns, primitive reflexes, and behavioral responses for neurobehavioral test. This is in line with the results of minute 1 Apgar score and indicates that the 5 mg/kg dosage is relatively safer for infants. If an adequate anesthesia depth was accomplished with 5 mg/kg thiopental sodium, administration of higher dosage would not be advisable. However, it was demonstrated in the study that 5 mg/kg dose may be associated by lower BIS scores and more positive IFT tests, although these undesirable observations were not translated to apparent awareness of the patients during post-operative interview.

Other alternative intravenous anesthetics are advised for induction of anesthesia in Caesarean section such as propofol. Some studies stated that propofol and thiopental do not have a significantly different influence on the Apgar score, while propofol makes deeper anesthesia, shorter recovery time, better hemodynamics and prepares appropriate uterine relaxation during fetal delivery. Induction with propofol also results in a significantly lower umbilical arterial oxygen saturation than induction with thiopental, but multiple trials indicates that propofol and thiopental are equally suited for Caesarean section. However, some side effects such as propofol induced pain on injection and sever bradychardia when combined with succinylcholine for rapid-sequence induction makes some anesthesiologists reluctant in its use. This reluctance is especially realizable where other rapid acting muscle relaxants like rocuronium is not readily available.

In conclusion, 7 mg/kg STP is superior to 5 mg/kg in creating appropriate hypnosis for induction of general anesthesia for cesarean section. However, it negatively impacts Apgar score and neurobehavioral test of newborn during early phase of birth. An acceptable intravenous anesthesia should be safe for the neonates while providing acceptable depth of anesthesia for the parturient. Therefore, STP couldn't be recommended as an ideal medication for induction of general anesthesia in Cesarean section anymore.

### Neuromuscular recovery following rocuronium bromide single dose in infants [^1138Nnfa]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Rocuronium bromide, a steroid nondepolarizing muscle relaxant, has a rapid onset and an intermediate duration of action in infants, children and adults. However, clinical evidence shows a longer duration of recovery in small infants. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of age on rocuronium recovery during the first year of life.

Methods

ASA I-II infants, scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia and intubation were included after ethics committee approval and parents' written consent. According to age the patients were randomly allocated to receive either 0.45 mg.kg(-1) or 0.6 mg.kg(-1) rocuronium bromide in three age-groups: (A) 0–1 month, (B) 2–4 months and (C) 5–12 months. After induction with thiopentone (5–7 mg.kg(-1)), anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane without opioids. Prior to surgery, caudal block with bupivacaine (0.125%) 1.0 ml.kg(-1) and paracetamol 25 mg.kg(-1) rectally were given for analgesia. Efficacy variables were intubation conditions 60 s after administration of muscle relaxant (T(0)) and recovery of neuromuscular blockade measured as T(1) at 10, 25, 50 and 75% of baseline, train-of-four (TOF) of 0.7 and Recovery Index (RI). Data were characterized by summary statistics and analysis of variance.

Results

A total of 61 infants with a median age range of 67 (2–364) days were included. Intubation conditions were excellent or good in all dose and age groups. T(0) in group A was reached in a range of 15–30 s, in others up to 60 s. T(1) recovery (T75) after 0.45 mg.kg(-1) was 56.4 ± 16 (A), 62.7 ± 32 (B) and 45.8 ± 18 (C) min. Recovery times for of 0.6 mg.kg(-1) were 100.8 ± 35 (A), 70.6 ± 19 (B) and 63.4 ± 21 (C) min, respectively. The TOF ratio (0.7) was 62.3 ± 18 (A), 64.1 ± 27 (B) and 43.7 ± 12 (C) min using 0.45 mg.kg(-1) compared with 94.8 ± 31 (A), 63.8 ± 14 (B) and 67.5 ± 18 (C) min with 0.6 mg.kg(-1). The differences of T75 and TOF 0.7 in A and C were significant (P ≤ 0.05).

Conclusions

Recovery of muscle relaxation using rocuronium bromide under isoflurane anesthesia in infants differs widely and shows great differences between age groups as well as dose regimen. A dose of 0.6 mg.kg(-1) resulted in a significantly longer duration of action in group A. The reduced dose of 0.45 mg.kg(-1) resulted in rapid and good relaxation in all infants without very long lasting effects. Reduced doses of rocuronium should be used in newborns and small infants.

### From anesthetic mechanisms research to drug discovery [^113p7sAJ]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

The ability to render patients insensible and amnesic to remarkably invasive procedures that are uncomfortable to watch, let alone experience, has been rightly designated as one of the greatest medical discoveries of all time. General anesthesia, introduced formally in the mid-nineteenth century, is now delivered to approximately 40 million patients every year in the United States alone. Given its central role in health care, it is indeed extraordinary how poorly we understand anesthesia and anesthetics. In fact, definitions are at best operational and convey little understanding of the underlying neurobiology, while the hypothetical mechanisms are surprisingly superficial. Worse, there is growing concern that the anesthetic drugs in current use, especially the inhaled anesthetics, have durable adverse effects on cognition.

### A review on the anesthetic management of obese patients undergoing surgery [^111fCcnU]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Propofol

Propofol is highly lipophilic; therefore, this anaesthetic agent has a high volume of distribution and is rapidly cleared from the blood following its administration. Due to these features, propofol is the most preferred drug for induction in morbidly obese patients. In obese patients, the administration of continuous infusions of this anaesthetic agent, demonstrates increased volume of distribution and clearance in proportion to total body weight (TBW). One study by Servin et al. that investigated the recovery rates and the pharmacokinetics of propofol infusion in morbidly obese patients, demonstrated that there were no major differences in the initial volume of distribution of propofol in morbidly obese study subjects as compared to non-obese subjects. However, this study also showed that there was a linear increase in volume of distribution at steady state and of clearance with increase in TBW.

Etomidate

The use of etomidate is recommended in individuals experiencing a state of hemodynamic instability because this drug does not majorly supress the cardiovascular system. However, its use may be of some concern as it has been associated with adrenal insufficiency potentially resulting in organ failure. When used for induction, required dosage adjustments should be made relative to non-fat body weight similar for the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics features observed for propofol and thiopental sodium.

Opioids

Obese patients that are undergoing surgery may experience depression of the respiratory system in addition to obstruction of the airway. The use of opioids in the presence of obesity increases the occurrence of obstructive and central sleep apnoea and obese patients may also experience hypoxia and upper airway obstruction. As a result, it is important to note that the therapeutic window is narrowed when opioids are used in obese patients.

Fentanyl

Fentanyl is one of the most used opioids for anaesthetic induction and it is about 100 times more potent than morphine. The action of fentanyl in the blood is short; however, after continuous infusion, peripheral compartment saturation is achieved. This drug is highly lipophilic and therefore has a high volume of distribution. In obese patients, following a single dose of fentanyl, the plasma levels of this drug is significantly reduced as obese patients experience a larger volume of distribution. Fentanyl is cleared at a faster rate in obese patients. There is a non-linear association between clearance of fentanyl and TBW but there is a linear increase in the clearance of fentanyl with "pharmacokinetic mass", with a significant correlation to lean body weight.

Org 25435 is an effective intravenous anaesthetic in man at doses of 3 and 4 mg/kg, when administered over 1 minute. The adverse event profile of Org 25435 is unremarkable. No safety problems were seen with this preparation except for some cardiovascular phenomena and mild involuntary movements. Longer infusions can maintain anaesthesia but subsequent recovery is slow. Hypotension tachycardia during anaesthesia and slow recovery of consciousness after cessation of drug administration suggest this compound has no advantages over currently available intravenous anaesthetics.

### Rapid sevoflurane induction compared with thiopental [^113pYW2a]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To examine whether the speed of induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane/nitrous oxide (N2O) utilizing a 10-second vital capacity rapid inhalation induction (VCRII) followed by tidal breathing was similar or faster than cautious intravenous (i.v.V) thiopental induction with inhaled N2O.

Design

Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.

Setting

Veterans Affairs Medical Center.

Patients

50 male ASA physical status I, II, and III patients scheduled for general anesthesia.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to receive either 8% sevoflurane or i.v. thiopental. Patients were allocated to one of two groups of 25 patients each. In both groups, the breathing circuit was initially primed for 5 minutes with (4 L/min) and O2 (2 L/min), while the Y-piece was occluded. In the sevoflurane group, the circuit was additionally primed with 8% sevoflurane. Patients were trained to perform a vital capacity breath. After maximal exhalation, the occluding plug was rapidly removed from the Y-piece and connected to the facemask. The patient then inspired to vital capacity, held his breath for 10 seconds, and then was allowed to breathe normally. At the end of the 10-second breathhold, and as the patient started normal breathing, either thiopental (thiopental group) or normal saline (sevoflurane group) was injected at a rate of 4 mL every 10 seconds.

Measurements

A study-blinded observer recorded the time to induction, as defined by the time to loss of eyelash reflex, and noted the occurrence of side effects.

Main Results

The speed of induction was the same for both groups (p > 0.05). An average of eight breaths was required before loss of eyelash reflex. Side effects occurred in 36% of the patients in the thiopental group, and 32% in the sevoflurane group (p > 0.05); these were minor and did not affect induction.

Conclusion

Sevoflurane/N2O VCRII as used in this investigation is an effective inhalation technique; it resulted in an induction time similar to that of slow i.v. thiopental with inhaled N2O.

### Guidelines for enhanced recovery after trauma and intensive care (ERATIC): enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) and international association for trauma surgery and intensive care (IATSIC) society recommendations: paper 2: postoperative and intensive care recommendations [^116Sqp4E]. World Journal of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Ketamine is likely to be the most cardiovascular stable anesthetic induction agent available. Although hypertension is more common, the use of ketamine can be associated with hypotension on induction of anesthesia and doses should be reduced in shocked trauma patients. Ketamine has been used with safety in a wide range of clinical situations, including in the prehospital setting and in resource‐constrained environments. Ketamine can be safely used in patients with brain injury. Thiopentone and propofol are poor choices for induction due to the magnitude of their hypotensive effects. Midazolam has a prolonged onset and can cause prolonged hypotension due to a long duration of action. Etomidate, which is also cardiovascular stable, is making a resurgence.

The use of muscle relaxants was previously controversial. It is now accepted that the use of muscle relaxants improves intubating conditions and reduces airway complications. Both suxamethonium and rocuronium are acceptable agents. The intubating doses should be increased to ensure rapid onset and dense paralysis.

Two maintenance techniques, which likely confer the greatest cardiovascular stability, are the use of ketamine infusions and the use of reduced doses of volatile anesthetics. Ketamine infusions are favored in situations outside the operating theater, where there is no access to an anesthesia delivery machine. Volatile anesthetics can be titrated to depth of anesthesia monitors, thereby minimizing the dose and cardiovascular impact of these agents. Intravenous anesthesia with propofol is very commonly used in elective surgery, with excellent effect profiles. In trauma patients, the pharmacokinetics can be significantly altered, especially with changes in liver blood flow, which may result in dangerously high plasma concentrations and resulting hemodynamic instability.

Anesthetic induction and airway management often need to occur outside the operating room to secure a threatened airway, rescue a patient in respiratory failure, or even to allow control of the process of resuscitation. The decision to administer anesthesia and manage the airway outside the operating room is difficult. The benefits of control of the airway must be weighed against multiple risks, including time lost to perform anesthesia and airway management, the risks of cardiovascular compromise, and the risk of inability to secure the airway. These risks are mitigated by good preparation and the use of checklists.

### Etomidate injection, solution [^114DnEDC]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Etomidate is a general anesthetic without analgesic activity. Intravenous injection of etomidate produces anesthesia characterized by a rapid onset of action, usually within one minute. Duration of anesthesia is dose dependent but relatively brief, usually three to five minutes when an average dose of 0.3 mg/kg is employed. Immediate recovery from anesthesia (as assessed by awakening time, time needed to follow simple commands and time to perform simple tests after anesthesia as well as they were performed before anesthesia), based upon data derived from short operative procedures where intravenous etomidate was used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia, is about as rapid as, or slightly faster than, immediate recovery after similar use of thiopental. These same data revealed that the immediate recovery period will usually be shortened in adult patients by the intravenous administration of approximately 0.1 mg of intravenous fentanyl, one or two minutes before induction of anesthesia, probably because less etomidate is generally required under these circumstances (consult the package insert for fentanyl before using).

The most characteristic effect of intravenous etomidate on the respiratory system is a slight elevation in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Reduced cortisol plasma levels have been reported with induction doses of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. These persist for approximately 6 to 8 hours and appear to be unresponsive to ACTH administration.

### Effects of propofol versus thiopental on APGAR scores in newborns and peri-operative outcomes of women undergoing emergency cesarean section: a randomized clinical trial [^116bARBb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Regional anesthesia is generally preferred during cesarean section, but general anesthesia may be the only option under certain circumstances such as patient preference, back deformities not amenable to spinal anesthesia, failed spinal anesthesia, intracranial hypertension, maternal coagulopathy, and certain neurologic diseases. A safe induction agent for obstetrics should, among other things, provide a smooth, quick induction, maintain maternal hemodynamic function, and exert minimal to no effect on the Apgar score. Thiopental has been routinely used as an anesthetic induction agent for cesarean section since the 1930s and is the standard against which all new agents are compared. However, it has several disadvantages, including decreased maternal arterial pressure, which, when coupled with a long induction time, can reduce the Apgar score. Propofol is widely used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia in other surgeries but not in obstetric procedures. It has a short induction time and blunts airway reflexes during laryngoscopy; compared with thiopental, patients emerge faster from propofol anesthesia. However, propofol also crosses the placenta and thus, can depress the fetal central nervous system, resulting in a low Apgar score at birth.

The population of pregnant mothers requiring cesarean section either by default or by request is rising, and the lack of skilled labor in Uganda is a constant problem. Maternal and child health is the focus of millennial development goals 4 and 5, and improving safety and reducing maternal and neonatal mortality are necessary to achieve these goals. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of thiopental and propofol on the neonatal Apgar score and maternal recovery time following cesarean section.

### Potential responses to remifentanil supply shortages [^113bk1Fs]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Rapid elimination of remifentanil facilitates application of intense opioid effect during general anaesthesia whilst maintaining prompt emergence. Interruptions in remifentanil supply mean clinicians must relearn titration of pharmacokinetically longer-acting opioids to achieve appropriate levels of opioid effect whilst maintaining acceptable recovery times. Opioid-free anaesthesia is achievable for many minor and intermediate surgical procedures for which remifentanil might have been used previously.

### Delayed emergence after anesthesia [^115ymZnX]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2015). Low credibility.

In most instances, delayed emergence from anesthesia is attributed to residual anesthetic or analgesic medications. However, delayed emergence can be secondary to unusual causes and present diagnostic dilemmas. Data from clinical studies is scarce and most available published material is comprised of case reports. In this review, we summarize and discuss less common and difficult to diagnose reasons for delayed emergence and present cases from our own experience or reference published case reports/case series. The goal is to draw attention to less common reasons for delayed emergence, identify patient populations that are potentially at risk and to help anesthesiologists identifying a possible cause why their patient is slow to wake up.

### Methohexital sodium [^116hnRtt]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Compared with thiamylal and thiopental, methohexital is at least twice as potent on a weight basis, and its duration of action is only about half as long. Although the metabolic fate of methohexital in the body is not clear, the drug does not appear to concentrate in fat depots to the extent that other barbiturate anesthetics do. Thus, cumulative effects are fewer and recovery is more rapid with methohexital than with thiobarbiturates. In experimental animals, the drug cannot be detected in the blood 24 hours after administration.

Methohexital differs chemically from the established barbiturate anesthetics in that it contains no sulfur. Little analgesia is conferred by barbiturates; their use in the presence of pain may result in excitation.

Intravenous administration of methohexital results in rapid uptake by the brain (within 30 seconds) and rapid induction of sleep.

Following intramuscular administration to pediatric patients, the onset of sleep occurs in 2 to 10 minutes. A plasma concentration of 3 mcg/mL was achieved in pediatric patients 15 minutes after an intramuscular dose (10 mg/kg) of a 5% solution. Following rectal administration to pediatric patients, the onset of sleep occurs in 5 to 15 minutes. Plasma methohexital concentrations achieved following rectal administration tend to increase both with dose and with the use of more dilute solution concentrations when using the same dose. A 25 mg/kg dose of a 1% methohexital solution yielded plasma concentrations of 6.9 to 7.9 mcg/mL 15 minutes after dosing. The absolute bioavailability of rectal methohexital sodium is 17%.

With single doses, the rate of redistribution determines duration of pharmacologic effect. Metabolism occurs in the liver through demethylation and oxidation. Side-chain oxidation is the most important biotransformation involved in termination of biologic activity. Excretion occurs via the kidneys through glomerular filtration.

### Does the choice of intravenous induction drug affect intubation conditions after a fast-onset neuromuscular blocker? [^115jLqK4]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Study Objectives

To compare intubation conditions and hemodynamic effects resulting from thiopental-rapacuronium, propofol-rapacuronium, and etomidate-rapacuronium intravenous (IV) induction.

Design

Randomized, blinded study.

Setting

Operating suites of a large university-affiliated medical center.

Patients

60 ASA physical status I and II adult patients without airway abnormalities, who were scheduled for elective surgery requiring endotracheal intubation. Patients were randomly allocated to receive IV thiopental sodium 5 mg/kg (Group 1), propofol 2 mg/kg (Group 2), or etomidate 0.3 mg/kg (Group 3) followed by rapacuronium 1.5 mg/kg. Fifty seconds later, an anesthesiologist, who had no knowledge of the induction drug used, entered the operating room and attempted laryngoscopy and intubation.

Measurements

Intubation conditions were graded as excellent, good, poor, or impossible according to Good Clinical Research Practice criteria. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate changes accompanying both induction techniques were also monitored and recorded.

Main Results

All patients were intubated within 55 to 70 seconds. Clinically acceptable intubation conditions were not statistically different among the three groups. Moderate tachycardia after induction was seen in all three groups, and blood pressure was significantly lower in Group 2 than in Groups 1 or 3.

Conclusions

Clinically acceptable intubation conditions are similar after either thiopental, propofol, or etomidate when a fast-onset neuromuscular blocking drug (rapacuronium 1.5 mg/kg) is used to facilitate tracheal intubation.

### Midazolam in sodium chloride [^112i7J6K]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system (CNS) depressant.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The effects of midazolam on the CNS are dependent on the dose administered, the route of administration, and the presence or absence of other medications.

Time to Onset

Sedation in adult and pediatric patients is achieved within 3 to 5 minutes after intravenous injection; the time of onset is affected by total dose administered and the concurrent administration of opioid premedication. Seventy-one percent of the adult patients in endoscopy studies had no recall of introduction of the endoscope; 82% of the patients had no recall of withdrawal of the endoscope. In one study of pediatric patients undergoing lumbar puncture or bone marrow aspiration, 88% of patients had impaired recall vs 9% of the placebo controls. In another pediatric oncology study, 91% of midazolam treated patients were amnestic compared with 35% of patients who had received fentanyl alone.

When midazolam is given intravenous as an anesthetic induction agent, induction of anesthesia occurs in approximately 1.5 minutes when opioid premedication has been administered and in 2 to 2.5 minutes without opioid premedication or other sedative premedication. Some impairment in a test of memory was noted in 90% of the patients studied.

Midazolam, used as directed, does not delay awakening from general anesthesia in adults. Gross tests of recovery after awakening (orientation, ability to stand and walk, suitability for discharge from the recovery room, return to baseline Trieger competency) usually indicate recovery within 2 hours but recovery may take up to 6 hours in some cases. When compared with patients who received thiopental, patients who received midazolam generally recovered at a slightly slower rate. Recovery from anesthesia or sedation for procedures in pediatric patients depends on the dose of midazolam administered, coadministration of other medications causing CNS depression and duration of the procedure.

### Clinical practice guidelines for sustained neuromuscular blockade in the adult critically ill patient [^114pQjWT]. Critical Care Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) — mechanism and patient factors — include the depolarizing agent succinylcholine, which is an agonist at nicotinic receptors producing fasciculations followed by paralysis, with a duration of effect of only 3 to 5 minutes and therefore used for short procedures; it is not used for prolonged blockade in the ICU. Nondepolarizing NMBAs are competitive antagonists at nicotinic receptors and include benzylisoquinolinium and aminosteroid compounds that are ionized, water-soluble at physiologic pH. Many drugs and conditions increase the potency of nondepolarizing NMBAs, potency is inversely related to speed of onset, patients with myasthenia gravis are especially sensitive, and burn injuries confer resistance due to up-regulation of nicotinic receptors on the sarcolemma.

### Police in an intensive care unit: what can happen? [^114q4Npv]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2013). Low credibility.

Questions arising during the process

The blood concentration of thiopental 24 days post mortem was questioned by the defence, and the prosecutor requested a second opinion from the National Board of Health and Welfare's forensic council. A Norwegian medicolegal expert was asked to re-examine the case and deliver an opinion as to whether or not the conclusion drawn by the Swedish medicolegal expert was correct. The Norwegian expert answered that the conclusion could be correct, but — and this was a big but — several other hypotheses might explain the findings. Furthermore, he considered the role of thiopental to be minimal.

During the trial it became evident that at least one (other) physician had treated the child with thiopental shortly before the life-sustaining treatment was withdrawn. Probably, several physicians had treated the patient with thiopental in order to inhibit convulsions, for intubation before a surgical procedure and medical examinations. Thiopental is usually provided until a therapeutic effect is obtained. This is a normal procedure and since the patient was still receiving ventilator treatment, the medication was obviously not lethal. Unfortunately — and contrary to regulations — the thiopental administrations were not entered in the medical record.

Nobody questioned that thiopental was found in the blood sample, but since no control sample had been collected and the available one was very small, it was difficult to quantify the concentration. Little is known about the passage of thiopental over the blood–brain barrier in brain-damaged premature infants. Furthermore, it is difficult to calculate the dose administered from the concentration of thiopental in a 24-day post mortem blood sample. The interpretation of post mortem concentrations is difficult and the post mortem redistribution of drugs has been described as a toxicological nightmare.

Standardized anesthetic protocol — anesthetic regimens should be designed to facilitate rapid recovery, routine preoperative sedatives should be avoided, and multiple anesthetic techniques are acceptable without evidence of superiority; if general anesthesia is chosen, sevoflurane or desflurane are preferred over isoflurane, and propofol-based total IV anesthesia facilitates rapid recovery and decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), while nitrous oxide may increase PONV but this risk is eliminated with aggressive prophylaxis; lung-protective ventilation targets approximately 6 cc/kg ideal body weight and plateau pressure < 30 cmH2O, though higher tidal volumes may be acceptable when low-tidal strategies cannot maintain oxygenation/ventilation; residual neuromuscular blockade is linked to complications and should be fully reversed if nondepolarizing block is used; spinal anesthetics should be tailored for rapid motor recovery; intraoperative analgesia should be multimodal with minimized opioids, and regional techniques, including transverse abdominis plane blocks and local infiltration, should be employed when appropriate.

### How to monitor thiopental administration in the intensive care unit for refectory status epilepticus or intracranial hypertension? [^116cAqS6]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear editor,

Thiopental continuous administration can be used as a rescue therapy for refractory status epilepticus (SE) or intracranial hypertension (IH). It induces an electroencephalographic (EEG) slowing up to a burst suppression state. The subsequent reduction in the cerebral metabolic demand and blood flow also allows decreasing the intracranial pressure (ICP). The continuous administration is usually guided both by thiopental serum concentration, to avoid accumulation, and efficacy on seizures or ICP. Thiopental side effects (hemodynamic dysfunction or immunosuppression) can occur at concentrations of 30–70 mg/ml. Conversely, the relation between serum concentrations and efficacy is less robust. In healthy subjects during anesthesia and in brain-injured patients, there is a great variability in the concentration needed to reach the same EEG changes, with an overlap between the therapeutic and toxic ranges. The digitalization of the EEG signal provides quantitative indexes at the bedside and may allow tailoring sedative administration in the intensive care unit (ICU). For instance, the suppression ratio (SR) provides a metric of the depth of sedation during general anesthesia. Since the target of thiopental sedation is to reach a discontinuous EEG activity (i.e. SR ≥ 10%); the aim of the herein study was to evaluate the relationship between the thiopental concentration and the SR in patients with a refractory SE or IH.

We conducted a retrospective study (2013–2020) in adult patients sedated with thiopental and monitored with a continuous EEG, in the neurological ICU of the Hospices Civils de Lyon (France). We analyzed EEG signals of 2 h windows around the serum measurements (1 h before and after). Suppression periods were defined by an EEG amplitude < 10 µV for ≥ 400 ms and was calculated on 2 s epochs on the central derivation with the best signal (Fz-Cz or adjacent; BRAIN-QUICK, Micromed). We took the mean SR of the 2 h. The relation between concentration and duration of thiopental administration and the SR was analyzed with a linear mixed effect model with the R software (lme4 library). The diagnostic accuracy of thiopental concentration to predict a discontinuous EEG was analyzed with a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC, pROC library). Data are presented as their median and interquartile range.

### Etomidate (Amidate) [^112XzMMM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Other Adverse Observations

Respiratory System

Hyperventilation, hypoventilation, apnea of short duration (5 to 90 seconds with spontaneous recovery); laryngospasm, hiccup and snoring suggestive of partial upper airway obstruction have been observed in some patients. These conditions were managed by conventional countermeasures.

Circulatory System

Hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia and other arrhythmias have occasionally been observed during induction and maintenance of anesthesia. One case of severe hypotension and tachycardia, judged to be anaphylactoid in character, has been reported.

Geriatric patients, particularly those with hypertension, may be at increased risk for the development of cardiac depression following etomidate administration (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Gastrointestinal System

Postoperative nausea and/or vomiting following induction of anesthesia with etomidate is probably no more frequent than the general incidence. When etomidate was used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia in short procedures such as dilation and curettage, or when insufficient analgesia was provided, the incidence of postoperative nausea and/or vomiting was higher than that noted in control patients who received thiopental.

### Propofol injectable emulsion [^116TYeVr]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Propofol injectable emulsion is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAAreceptors.

Oral Δ9-THC impairment "may take longer to resolve", regular users had "less impairment than 'other' (mostly occasional) cannabinoid users", and "These data should be factored into the decision on whether to proceed with surgery and what anesthetic plan to use should a rapid-sequence induction be required because of concerns over aspiration risk".

### Propofol: a medication that changed pediatric anesthesia practice [^1129dTTo]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

5 Monitoring of Effect

Propofol is administered to achieve a specific effect (the target effect). However, titration of dose based on clinical criteria is challenging because degree of consciousness can only be assessed during sedation. Clinicians often evaluate the patient's responsiveness using verbal stimuli, movement, or vital signs to monitor anesthesia effectiveness. These variables serve as indirect indicators of anesthetic depth and poorly reflect neurophysiological effects on the brain. They do not discriminate between the hypnotic and analgesic components of general anesthesia.

The application of electroencephalography (EEG) as a measure of anesthetic depth was proposed by Gibbs et al. in 1937. However, its integration into routine clinical practice occurred in the early 1990s with the advent of processed EEG monitors such as the Bispectral Index (BIS), spectral entropy, and auditory evoked potential monitors. These devices simplified EEG data analysis to generate a numerical value correlating with consciousness levels. The EEG was used for thiopental pharmacokinetic exploration initially, but the clinical need for propofol infusion pharmacodynamic understanding overtook that of barbiturate coma.

Cerebral monitoring has facilitated the recognition of PD between‐patient variability and has enabled the individualization of dosing regimens based on real‐time EEG changes. Moreover, this real‐time measurement of EEG changes has led to the development of pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models of propofol, which, when integrated into intelligent infusion pumps (target‐controlled infusion), facilitated dose adjustments to target concentrations at the effect site, thereby improving the control of the desired effect. Furthermore, having EEG indices for hypnotic effect has propelled advancements in "closed‐loop" delivery systems, allowing for the automated administration of propofol to achieve a desired electroencephalographic target, such as a BIS of 50, rather than focusing on a particular target plasma concentration or effect site concentration.

Propofol acts as an agonist of the gamma‐aminobutyric acid subtype A (GABA A) receptor, which is distributed across the cerebral cortex, thalamus, brainstem, striatum, and spinal cord. EEG primarily records electrical phenomena occurring in the cerebral cortex. Commercially available anesthesia monitors capture these signals from the anterior (frontoparietal) region of the brain using adhesive skin sensors. Typically, the EEG of an awake subject is characterized by a predominance of high‐frequency, low‐amplitude waves. Propofol induces dose‐dependent changes in the EEG, affecting the frequency, amplitude, and localization (anteriorization of alfa waves) of electroencephalographic waves.

### Sedation in the intensive care unit with remifentanil / propofol versus midazolam / fentanyl: a randomised, open-label, pharmacoeconomic trial [^112FW6bL]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

The shorter weaning time with remifentanil/propofol is a direct consequence of the pharmacokinetic profile of these two drugs. Remifentanil has a rapid onset (1 minute) and offset (half time < 10 minutes) of action. Its organ-independent metabolism by non-specific blood and tissue esterases results in a pharmacokinetic profile unaffected by impaired kidney or liver function, which differentiates remifentanil from all other opioids. Remifentanil does not accumulate, even after prolonged infusion.

Although both midazolam and fentanyl have a rapid onset and a short clinical duration with single doses, accumulation and prolonged sedative effects may be observed after continuous administration, which is also indicated by a significantly longer context-sensitive half time of these drugs.

Time from extubation (after discontinuation of the study medication) until discharge from the ICU was also significantly longer in the midazolam/fentanyl group. This recovery period after a long and difficult operation, such as open heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass in elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities, certainly is a multi-factorial event. Although patients in the remifentanil/propofol group were more severely ill, as shown by a higher SAPS II, a difference in vigilance, orientation and compliance after extubation was obvious. Patients in the midazolam/fentanyl group reached the predefined discharge criteria later. An accumulation of sedatives most likely can be presumed to be the reason.

### Anesthesia in the obese patient: pharmacokinetic considerations [^112uLRwH]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

The prevalence of obesity has increased 15% up to 20% and represents an important challenge for the anesthesiologist in drug-dosing management. The aim of this work is to provide an overview on physiological changes and pharmacokinetic implications of obesity for the anesthesiologist. Obesity increases both fat and lean masses; however, the percentage of fat tissue increases more than does the lean mass, affecting the apparent volume of distribution of anesthetic drugs according to their lipid solubility. Benzodiazepine loading doses should be adjusted on actual weight, and maintenance doses should be adjusted on ideal body weight. Thiopental sodium and propofol dosages are calculated on total body weight (TBW). The loading dose of lipophilic opioids is based on TBW, whereas maintenance dosages should be cautiously reduced because of the higher sensitivity of the obese patient to their depressant effects. Pharmacokinetic parameters of muscle relaxants are minimally affected by obesity, and their dosage is based on ideal rather than TBW. Inhalation anesthetics with very low lipid solubility, such as sevoflurane and desflurane, allow for quick modification of the anesthetic plan during surgery and rapid emergence at the end of surgery, hence representing very flexible anesthetic drugs for use in this patient population. Drug dosing is generally based on the volume of distribution for the loading dose and on the clearance for maintenance. In the obese patient, the volume of distribution is increased if the drug is distributed both in lean and fat tissues whereas the anesthetic drug clearance is usually normal or increased.

### Intravenous versus inhalational techniques for rapid emergence from anaesthesia in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery [^1146Wcrr]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Brain tumour surgery usually is carried out with the patient under general anaesthesia. Over past years, both intravenous and inhalational anaesthetic agents have been used, but the superiority of one agent over the other is a topic of ongoing debate. Early and rapid emergence from anaesthesia is desirable for most neurosurgical patients. With the availability of newer intravenous and inhalational anaesthetic agents, all of which have inherent advantages and disadvantages, we remain uncertain as to which technique may result in more rapid early recovery from anaesthesia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intravenous versus inhalational techniques for rapid emergence from anaesthesia in patients undergoing brain tumour surgery.

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the use of intravenous anaesthetic agents such as propofol and thiopentone with inhalational anaesthetic agents such as isoflurane and sevoflurane for maintenance of general anaesthesia during brain tumour surgery. Primary outcomes were emergence from anaesthesia (assessed by time to follow verbal commands, in minutes) and adverse events during emergence, such as haemodynamic changes, agitation, desaturation, muscle weakness, nausea and vomiting, shivering and pain. Secondary outcomes were time to eye opening, recovery from anaesthesia using the Aldrete or Modified Aldrete score (i.e. time to attain score ≥ 9, in minutes), opioid consumption, brain relaxation (as assessed by the surgeon on a 4- or 5-point scale) and complications of anaesthetic techniques, such as intraoperative haemodynamic instability in terms of hypotension or hypertension (mmHg), increased or decreased heart rate (beats/min) and brain swelling.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standardized methods in conducting the systematic review, as described by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Two review authors independently extracted details of trial methods and outcome data from reports of all trials considered eligible for inclusion. We performed all analyses on an intention-to-treat basis. We used a fixed-effect model when we found no evidence of significant heterogeneity between studies, and a random-effects model when heterogeneity was likely. For assessments of the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs only, we downgraded the evidence from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect or potential publication bias.

Main Results

We included 15 RCTs with 1833 participants. We determined that none of the RCTs were of high methodological quality. For our primary outcomes, pooled results from two trials suggest that time to emergence from anaesthesia, that is, time needed to follow verbal commands, was longer with isoflurane than with propofol (mean difference (MD) -3.29 minutes, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.41 to -1.18, low-quality evidence), and time to emergence from anaesthesia was not different with sevoflurane compared with propofol (MD 0.28 minutes slower with sevoflurane, 95% CI -0.56 to 1.12, four studies, low-quality evidence). Pooled analyses for adverse events suggest lower risk of nausea and vomiting with propofol than with sevoflurane (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.91, low-quality evidence) or isoflurane (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.78) and greater risk of haemodynamic changes with propofol than with sevoflurane (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.17), but no differences in the risk of shivering or pain. Pooled analyses for brain relaxation suggest lower risk of tense brain with propofol than with isoflurane (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17, low-quality evidence), but no difference when propofol is compared with sevoflurane.

Authors' Conclusions

The finding of our review is that the intravenous technique is comparable with the inhalational technique of using sevoflurane to provide early emergence from anaesthesia. Adverse events with both techniques are also comparable. However, we derived evidence of low quality from a limited number of studies. Use of isoflurane delays emergence from anaesthesia. These results should be interpreted with caution. Randomized controlled trials based on uniform and standard methods are needed. Researchers should follow proper methods of randomization and blinding, and trials should be adequately powered.

### 2023 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for monitoring and antagonism of neuromuscular blockade: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on neuromuscular blockade [^117N2cLy]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Neostigmine antagonism timing and management of inadequate recovery — neostigmine's effect is maximal within approximately 10min, and therefore, there is no benefit in administering neostigmine much more than 10min before emergence and extubation. If recovery time exceeds 10min (i.e., a train-of-four ratio greater than or equal to 0.9 has not been reached within 10min after neostigmine administration), it is unlikely to be the result of delayed activity of neostigmine. When neostigmine has peaked but the train-of-four ratio is less than 0.9, there exist three options to accomplish adequate antagonism: allow for continued spontaneous recovery, administer sugammadex if appropriate to the relaxant given, or administer additional neostigmine not exceeding a total of 50 μg/kg.

### Propofol [^113xDije]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of propofol are well described by a three- compartment linear model with compartments representing the plasma, rapidly equilibrating tissues, and slowly equilibrating tissues.

Following an intravenous bolus dose, there is rapid equilibration between the plasma and the brain, accounting for the rapid onset of anesthesia. Plasma levels initially decline rapidly as a result of both distribution and metabolic clearance. Distribution accounts for about half of this decline following a bolus of propofol. However, distribution is not constant over time, but decreases as body tissues equilibrate with plasma and become saturated. The rate at which equilibration occurs is a function of the rate and duration of the infusion. When equilibration occurs there is no longer a net transfer of propofol between tissues and plasma.

Discontinuation of the recommended doses of propofol injectable emulsion after the maintenance of anesthesia for approximately one hour, or for sedation in the ICU for one day, results in a prompt decrease in blood propofol concentrations and rapid awakening. Longer infusions (10 days of ICU sedation) result in accumulation of significant tissue stores of propofol, such that the reduction in circulating propofol is slowed and the time to awakening is increased.

By daily titration of propofol injectable emulsion dosage to achieve only the minimum effective therapeutic concentration, rapid awakening within 10 to 15 minutes can occur even after long-term administration. If, however, higher than necessary infusion levels have been maintained for a long time, propofol redistribution from fat and muscle to the plasma can be significant and slow recovery.

### Pentobarbital versus thiopental in the treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial [^117FKs9C]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Differences between oxibarbiturates and thiobarbiturates

The pharmacokinetic characteristics of thiopental and pentobarbital are different because their protein binding, distribution volume and clearance differ. Nevertheless, the mean half life (thiopental 6 to 46 hours and pentobarbital 15 and 48 hours), which is the fundamental pharmacological parameter, differs little between the two agents. It therefore does not appear that these pharmacokinetic differences have clinical repercussions.

One difference between these two groups of barbiturates is the presence of active metabolites. Thiopental has five metabolites, of which four are inactive and one (pentobarbital, or pentobarbitone) is active. Therefore, pentobarbital is an active metabolite of thiopental. This fact, along with the great intra-individual and inter-individual variability in the metabolism of these agents (caused by the existence of enzymatic induction phenomena associated with hepatic cytochrome P450), results in a weak correlation between serum concentrations and pharmacological effect. For this reason, monitoring this treatment with electroencephalography is strongly recommended.

At the experimental level, various studies have compared these two medications. Hatano and coworkers, in a study conducted in a dog model, concluded that thiobarbiturates provoke cerebral vasoconstriction, which could help to redistribute cerebral blood flow toward ischaemic zones. Cole and colleagues demonstrated that thiopental reduced the size of the ischaemic area more than did pentobarbital, even though both drugs achieved electroencephalographic burst suppression patterns. Shibuta observed that thiopental, but not pentobarbital, was capable of limiting the cytotoxic damage caused by nitric oxide. Almaas and coworkers observed that the different barbiturates had different neuroprotective effects with respect to oxygen and glucose deprivation in a model using human neurone cultures. Thiopental exhibited a neuroprotective effect at all the dosages studied, whereas pentobarbital was neuroprotective only at elevated dosages. Finally, in an in vitro study, Smith and colleagues demonstrated that although thiopental provoked 96% inhibition of lipid peroxidation, pentobarbital had almost no effect.

These experimental studies demonstrate that not all barbiturates are equal and that their neuroprotective capacity and effectiveness may differ. Therefore, despite the unavoidable methodological limitations of the present study, we believe that our results may have clinical relevance.

### Treatment of refractory convulsive status epilepticus: a comprehensive review by the American Epilepsy Society treatments committee [^11423Tc7]. Epilepsy Currents (2020). Medium credibility.

Pentobarbital and Thiopental

The barbiturates PTB and THP bind GABA A receptors nonspecifically, thereby affecting both synaptic (phasic) and extrasynaptic (tonic) receptors to enhance neuronal chloride channel opening and inhibition of cortical function. This differs from BDZs which bind only GABA A receptors containing a γ subunit. They also appear to inhibit AMPA receptors resulting in suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission. Pentobarbital is used in the United States, and THP is more commonly used in Europe. Thiopental is 25% metabolized to PTB, so literature devoted exclusively to use of THP in RSE is included in this review. Compared to other barbiturates, these agents are moderately lipophilic and readily cross the blood–brain barrier. Onset of action is rapid: ∼1 minute after IV administration. Elimination of PTB is biphasic: about 4 hours in first phase and up to 50 hours (dose dependent) in the second phase. The change in duration is largely due to sequestration in fat and muscle. Once redistributed, the free fraction undergoes metabolism in the liver, with potent induction of the hepatic microsomal enzymes (especially CYP2A6).

After prolonged administration, t₁/₂ of THP is 14 to 36 hours and t₁/₂ of PTB is 15 to 22 hours, but Rashkin et al reports the t₁/₂ of PTB is 15 to 60 hours. Van Ness et al state that PTB has somewhat shorter t₁/₂, less immunosuppression, more linear kinetics at higher doses, and fewer cardiovascular effects than THP. Barbiturates reportedly decrease cerebral metabolism and blood flow and reduce intracranial pressure as a result. Pentobarbital crosses the placenta, has significant teratogenicity, and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Pentobarbital has high potential for drug interactions due to enzyme induction and protein binding. The IV solution has a pH of 9.5 and (similar to PHT and phenobarbital) is solubilized in propylene glycol, thus making it incompatible with many other IV medications and infusions.

### Current and developing approaches for facilitating emergence from general anesthesia [^114sVs1R]. Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Despite the widespread use of clinical anesthesia, the process of emergence from general anesthesia remains primarily driven by anesthetic elimination. Although emergence from general anesthesia is typically safe, prolonged delays strain resource-intensive settings and contribute to increased healthcare costs. In addition to improving access to care, providing clinicians with more precise control over emergence could offer diagnostic potential and improve patient outcomes. For decades, this unmet need has motivated research into the mechanisms underlying anesthetic emergence. Now, the first agents for facilitating emergence are entering the market, with more in development. This narrative review critically evaluates advancements in the development of emergence-promoting therapies, examining insights from preclinical research to clinical trials. This study categorizes prospective emergence agents/strategies into one of three primary approaches: (1) strategies that primarily manipulate anesthetic pharmacokinetics, (2) agents designed to directly target anesthetic receptor-binding sites, and (3) strategies that leverage arousal-promoting neural pathways. The parallel development of these approaches, each with their distinct strengths and limitations, holds promise for paving the way for a tailored approach to facilitate emergence.

### Desflurane [^115K3cQa]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of desflurane was evaluated in 1,843 patients including ambulatory (N = 1,061), cardiovascular (N = 277), geriatric (N = 103), neurosurgical (N = 40), and pediatric (N = 235) patients. Clinical experience with these patients and with 1,087 control patients in these studies not receiving desflurane is described below. Although desflurane can be used in adults for the inhalation induction of anesthesia via mask, it produces a high incidence of respiratory irritation (coughing, breathholding, apnea, increased secretions, laryngospasm). Oxyhemoglobin saturation below 90% occurred in 6% of patients (from pooled data, N = 370 adults).

14.1 Ambulatory Surgery

Desflurane plus N2O was compared to isoflurane plus N2O in multicenter studies (21 sites) of 792 ASA physical status I, II, or III patients aged 18–76 years (median 32).

Induction

Anesthetic induction begun with thiopental and continued with desflurane was associated with a 7% incidence of oxyhemoglobin saturation of 90% or less (from pooled data, N = 307) compared with 5% in patients in whom anesthesia was induced with thiopental and isoflurane (from pooled data, N = 152).

Maintenance & Recovery

Desflurane with or without N2O or other anesthetics was generally well tolerated. There were no differences between desflurane and the other anesthetics studied in the times that patients were judged fit for discharge.

In one outpatient study, patients received a standardized anesthetic consisting of thiopental 4.2–4.4 mg/kg, fentanyl 3.5–4.0 mcg/kg, vecuronium 0.05–0.07 mg/kg, and N2O 60% in oxygen with either desflurane 3% or isoflurane 0.6%. Emergence times were significantly different; but times to sit up and discharge were not different (see Table 5).

### Individualized dosing with anesthetic agents [^115osuLb]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

The development of fundamental pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics concepts has enabled anesthesiologists to choose and dose anesthetic agents on a rational basis. The application of these concepts to a variety of clinical scenarios and patient populations makes it possible to individualize the dose, thereby decreasing the risk of complications. As more knowledge is gained about the sometimes profound differences in drug response, empirical dosing such as in milligrams per kilogram of total body weight is disappearing from the anesthesia specialty.

### Propofol injectable emulsion [^117PiZkM]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of propofol are well described by a three-compartment linear model with compartments representing the plasma, rapidly equilibrating tissues, and slowly equilibrating tissues.

Following an intravenous bolus dose, there is rapid equilibration between the plasma and the brain, accounting for the rapid onset of anesthesia. Plasma levels initially decline rapidly as a result of both distribution and metabolic clearance. Distribution accounts for about half of this decline following a bolus of propofol. However, distribution is not constant over time, but decreases as body tissues equilibrate with plasma and become saturated. The rate at which equilibration occurs is a function of the rate and duration of the infusion. When equilibration occurs there is no longer a net transfer of propofol between tissues and plasma.

Discontinuation of the recommended doses of propofol after the maintenance of anesthesia for approximately one hour, or for sedation in the ICU for one day, results in a prompt decrease in blood propofol concentrations and rapid awakening. Longer infusions (10 days of ICU sedation) result in accumulation of significant tissue stores of propofol, such that the reduction in circulating propofol is slowed and the time to awakening is increased.

By daily titration of propofol dosage to achieve only the minimum effective therapeutic concentration, rapid awakening within 10 to 15 minutes can occur even after long-term administration. If, however, higher than necessary infusion levels have been maintained for a long time, propofol redistribution from fat and muscle to the plasma can be significant and slow recovery.

### Practice advisory for intraoperative awareness and brain function monitoring: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on intraoperative awareness [^1135bHyb]. Anesthesiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Bispectral Index (BIS) monitoring scales hypnotic level from 0 to 100, with specific ranges (e.g., 40–60) reported to reflect a low probability of consciousness under general anesthesia. In one randomized controlled trial (RCT) that enrolled 2,500 high-risk patients, explicit recall occurred in 0.17% with BIS monitors versus 0.91% with routine clinical practice (P < 0.02). A small single-blinded RCT (n = 30) during cardiac surgery reported one episode of recall in the clinical signs group compared with no episodes in the BIS-monitored group (P > 0.50). A nonrandomized comparison with historic controls (n = 12,771) found explicit recall occurring in 0.04% of BIS-monitored patients versus 0.18% of historic controls (P < 0.038), whereas a prospective nonrandomized cohort (n = 19,575) reported no statistically significant difference when BIS was used (0.18%) compared with when BIS was not used (0.10%). Correlational studies reported PK values for BIS ranging from 0.72 to 1.00 for awake versus loss of response after propofol induction, from 0.79 to 0.97 for anesthetized versus first response, and a PK value of 0.86 for movement from electrical stimulation. Reported mean BIS ranges across intraoperative times were: before induction or baseline, 80–98; at or after induction, 37–70; during surgery, 20–58; at emergence or end of surgery, 42–96; and during postoperative recovery, 64–96. Case reports indicate that intraoperative events unrelated to titration of anesthetic agents can produce rapid changes in BIS values (e.g., cerebral ischemia or hypoperfusion, gas embolism, unrecognized hemorrhage, inadvertent blockage of anesthetic drug delivery), that routine intraoperative events may interfere with BIS functioning, and that two case reports reported patients experiencing intraoperative awareness despite monitored values indicating an adequate depth of anesthesia; other reports suggested that certain patient conditions may affect BIS values.

### A multicenter evaluation of the time-course of action of two doses of rapacuronium after early and late reversal with neostigmine [^113fKScu]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2001). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Early reversal of rapacuronium may accelerate return of neuromuscular function. This study was designed to compare early (2 min after rapacuronium) or late (at 25% recovery of the first twitch [T1] of train-of-four) reversal of rapacuronium with neostigmine. We studied 119 subjects between the ages of 18 and 75 yr. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and thiopental and maintained with nitrous oxide, propofol, and fentanyl. Mechanomyographic neuromuscular monitoring was performed by using train-of-four stimulation of the ulnar nerve. Two groups received 1.5 mg/kg rapacuronium followed by neostigmine (50 microg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (10 microg/kg) either at 2 min after rapacuronium bolus or at 25% T1 recovery. The other two groups received 2.0 mg/kg rapacuronium, after which neostigmine was similarly given. For each rapacuronium dose, the time from the administration of rapacuronium to the start of T1 recovery or 25% T1 recovery was significantly shorter in subjects who received the reversal 2 min after rapacuronium. However, late recovery, defined by times from administration of rapacuronium to 70%, or 80% T4/T1 recovery, was not influenced by early reversal administration. We conclude that initial recovery is accelerated by early administration of neostigmine. Time to full recovery after rapacuronium administration is, however, dose-dependent and not significantly altered by early administration of neostigmine.

Implications

"Rescue reversal", which includes the administration of neostigmine shortly after the administration of rapacuronium, may accelerate the return of spontaneous breathing (early recovery), but does not shorten the time to complete recovery of upper airway function.

### The effect of lipid emulsion on depth of anaesthesia following thiopental administration to rabbits [^112qLybi]. Anaesthesia (2011). Low credibility.

Intravenous lipid emulsion has proven benefit in lipophilic drug-induced cardiotoxicity. Its effect in reversal of central nervous system depression secondary to overdose with lipophilic psychotropic agents remains uncertain. Twenty adult New Zealand White rabbits were anaesthetised with 20 mg.kg(-1) thiopental and randomised to receive either 4 ml.kg(-1) saline 0.9% or 4 ml.kg(-1) lipid emulsion 20% immediately afterwards. Depth of anaesthesia was monitored using bispectral index (BIS) at 1-min intervals. Duration of anaesthesia was measured as time to regain the righting reflex (ability of the animal to right spontaneously from dorsal recumbency to sternal recumbency). The BIS was greater in the control group (p = 0.011). The greatest BIS differential was observed immediately following treatment (mean (SD) BIS 75.0 (9.5) for saline vs 58.6 (10.4) for lipid, 95% CI 5.75–27.1; p < 0.001). No difference was observed in duration of anaesthesia (mean (SD) 15.5 (0.8) min for saline vs 15.6 (0.7) min for lipid, p = 0.86). Lipid emulsion administration may serve to increase central nervous system depression in the early phase of lipophilic toxin distribution.

### 2023 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for monitoring and antagonism of neuromuscular blockade: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on neuromuscular blockade [^116AiHCd]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

Depolarizing neuromuscular blockade with succinylcholine — characteristics and monitoring guidance — notes that succinylcholine is the only depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent in clinical use and is rapidly metabolized by pseudocholinesterase; the only way to effectively monitor both normal and abnormal succinylcholine-induced blockade is by measuring a single twitch baseline height and using the percentage of that single twitch to gauge return of strength; the task force suggests using neuromuscular monitoring to guide extubation when there are clinical signs of delayed recovery from succinylcholine.

### Bispectral index as an indicator of seizure inducibility in electroconvulsive therapy under thiopental anesthesia [^112xm7KR]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The prediction of seizure thresholds in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) remains problematic. We examined the relationship between bispectral index (BIS) score and seizure duration in ECT performed under thiopental anesthesia in patients receiving their usual regimen of antidepressant medication for its potential as a predictor of seizure inducibility. One-hundred ECT treatments were evaluated in 16 adult patients diagnosed with depression. BIS scores were recorded at the preanesthetic and preictal periods and at recovery from ECT. Seizure duration was defined as the duration of the electroencephalogram seizure pattern. The relationships between preanesthetic and preictal BIS scores and seizure duration were evaluated. Effective seizure threshold was determined by receiver operator characteristic analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for seizure durations of more than 10 s, more than 20 s, and more than 30 s. The relationship between seizure duration and thiopental estimated effect-site and plasma concentrations was analyzed as well. Preictal BIS scores for seizures lasting longer than 30 s were significantly higher than those for seizures lasting < 30 s. A preictal BIS score of 55 or more represents a strongly determinant condition for achieving seizures that last longer than 30 s (AUC, 0.937; receiver operator characteristic), as well as for briefer seizures that last more than 20 or 10 s (AUC: 0.938 and 0.959, respectively). There was no significant correlation between seizure duration and the estimated thiopental effect-site or plasma concentration. We conclude that during thiopental anesthesia, the minimum threshold for inducing seizures of any duration correlates with a preictal BIS score of 55. This threshold was independent of antidepressant regimen and thiopental dosage. We suggest that the preictal BIS score is useful in predicting the ictogenic threshold in ECT.

Implications

We found that the bispectral index (BIS) score serves as an indicator of seizure inducibility in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) under thiopental anesthesia and that the relationship between BIS score and seizure duration was not linear, suggesting that the pharmacological mechanisms by which thiopental and propofol suppress ECT seizure activity are different.

### Rocuronium [^112hWJ7H]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Use by Continuous Infusion

Infusion at an initial rate of 10 to 12 mcg/kg/min of rocuronium bromide should be initiated only after early evidence of spontaneous recovery from an intubating dose. Due to rapid redistribution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] and the associated rapid spontaneous recovery, initiation of the infusion after substantial return of neuromuscular function (more than 10% of control T1), may necessitate additional bolus doses to maintain adequate block for surgery.

Upon reaching the desired level of neuromuscular block, the infusion of rocuronium bromide must be individualized for each patient. The rate of administration should be adjusted according to the patient's twitch response as monitored with the use of a peripheral nerve stimulator. In clinical trials, infusion rates have ranged from 4 to 16 mcg/kg/min.

Inhalation anesthetics, particularly enflurane and isoflurane, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. In the presence of steady-state concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane, it may be necessary to reduce the rate of infusion by 30 to 50%, at 45 to 60 minutes after the intubating dose.

Spontaneous recovery and reversal of neuromuscular blockade following discontinuation of rocuronium bromide infusion may be expected to proceed at rates comparable to that following comparable total doses administered by repetitive bolus injections [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

### 2023 American society of anesthesiologists practice guidelines for monitoring and antagonism of neuromuscular blockade: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on neuromuscular blockade [^1114b1Kd]. Anesthesiology (2023). High credibility.

American Society of Anesthesiologists neuromuscular blockade guidelines — strength of evidence was rated by outcome using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system, in which randomized controlled trials start as high strength of evidence and nonrandomized studies start as low; strength may be downgraded for summary study-level risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and publication bias, and upgraded if the effect is large, if a dose−response is present, or if unaccounted residual confounding would likely have increased the effect; for network meta-analyses, strength was assessed with the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis tool using categories corresponding to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.

### Influence of propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia on peri-operative outcome measures: a narrative review [^1141WqAA]. Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Propofol-based total intravenous anaesthesia is well known for its smooth, clear-headed recovery and anti-emetic properties, but there are also many lesser known beneficial properties that can potentially influence surgical outcome. We will discuss the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of propofol and their roles in pain, organ protection and immunity. We will also discuss the use of propofol in cancer surgery, neurosurgery and older patients.

### Rapid injection of rocuronium reduces withdrawal movement on injection [^115oAegZ]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2009). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To test whether rapid injection of rocuronium reduces withdrawal movement on injection.

Design

Randomized, prospective trial.

Setting

Operating room in a university hospital.

Patients

150 ASA physical status I and II patients aged 18 to 60 years, undergoing general anesthesia.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to three groups. After undergoing anesthesia induction with thiopental sodium, then 5 seconds later receiving a rubber tourniquet applied to the mid-forearm to stop intravenous (IV) flow by gravity, the pretreatment drug was injected. The tourniquet was held for 15 seconds then released, and 1.0 mg/kg of 1% rocuronium was injected IV. Group C patients (n = 50) were pretreated with 0.1 mL/kg of 0.9% NaCl and then injected with rocuronium slowly within 10 seconds. Group L patients (n = 50) were pretreated with 0.1 mL/kg of preservative-free 1% lidocaine and then injected with rocuronium slowly within 10 seconds. Group R patients (n = 50) were pretreated with 0.1 mL/kg of 0.9% NaCl and then rapidly injected with rocuronium within approximately one second (as quickly as possible).

Measurements

After injection of the patient with the study drug, a single anesthesiologist with no knowledge of the study protocol graded each patient's response as follows: 0 = no response; 1 = mild movement limited to the wrist only; 2 = moderate movement involving the elbow and shoulder; and 3 = severe movement involving more than one extremity.

Main Results

Group C had the most intense and frequent withdrawal response. The frequency and intensity of withdrawal movement was significantly less in Groups L and R than Group C. No significant difference in withdrawal response between Groups L and R was noted.

Conclusions

Withdrawal response can be significantly reduced for rocuronium injection without lidocaine pretreatment, simply through rapid injection.

### First administration to man of org 25435, an intravenous anaesthetic: a phase 1 clinical trial [^113or3sZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Pharmacodynamic

We elected to collect raw EEG rather than use a simplified derived index of anaesthetic depth. This approach allowed us to look carefully for excitatory cortical phenomena whilst also providing a continuous measure of drug effect. Our modelling demonstrates that Org 25435 enjoys relatively rapid access to the effect site, with an estimated kₑ₀ half-life of 0.9 minutes. This contributes to the prompt return of consciousness after bolus injections but is outweighed by tissue accumulation which accounts for the slow recovery following extended infusion.

It was crucial for the correct characterisation of pharmacodynamics that our initial blood samples were arterial. In their studies of thiopental disposition, Homer and Stanski were only able to characterise K eO in patients from whom arterial, rather than venous, samples were collected. Ideally, arterial samples would be collected for the entire duration of a pharmacokinetic study; however this is rarely achievable in clinical practice. Our approach of continuing to collect venous samples when arterial samples were no longer available, and thus accepting small arterio-venous differences beyond four hours, allowed full characterisation of the compound's elimination half-life and volume of distribution. To have ceased sampling at the time of arterial line removal would likely have greatly biased our data as the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters is known to correlate with duration of sampling time. For our data, at 240 minutes the arterial sample concentration was only 12.2 ± 10.5% lower than the venous concentration and this difference would likely have been even smaller at 360 minutes, the time at which the first venous data entered the pharmacokinetic modelling process.

### Propofol vs. inhalational agents to maintain general anaesthesia in ambulatory and in-patient surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cL4pm]. BMC Anesthesiology (2018). Low credibility.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Data with regard to study population, sample size, interventions, comparators, potential biases in the conduct of the trial, and outcomes were extracted from eligible publications.

The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias (high/low) and covered the aspects: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of assessments, attrition bias and selective reporting. If there was insufficient detail reported in the study, we judged the risk of bias as 'unclear'. The assessment was performed independently by two reviewers based on The Cochrane Handbook 2011.

Outcomes

For this review, the meta-analysis considered PONV as primary outcome. Secondary, patient-relevant outcomes were time to recovery (awakening/respiratory recovery/ orientation/reach a recovery score/follow simple instructions), post-operative pain, agitation on emergence, post-anaesthetic shivering, hospital length of stay and haemodynamic instability requiring interventions. Additional outcomes on efficacy, safety and resource consumption are listed in an additional file (Additional file 1).

Statistical analysis

Quantitative synthesis was performed for data from eligible RCTs as primary meta-analysis. A secondary meta-analysis included information from additional observational studies. Common estimates were derived from fixed-effect models using the inverse-variance and Mantel-Haenszel approach for continuous and dichotomous outcomes, respectively. In the presence of high heterogeneity, random-effects models were applied using the DerSimonian and Laird method. The difference of means with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated for continuous outcomes. In case of different measurement scales the standardized mean difference was used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% CIs was calculated. We considered P ≤ 0.05 to be statistically significant.

For RCTs, a comprehensive set of subgroup analyses were a-priori defined to identify differences among different volatile agents, patient characteristics, types of surgery, induction regimens, in/out-patients, and use of target-controlled infusion (TCI). The domains studied were selected by the authors when considered clinically relevant in relationship to the respective clinical outcome. These analyses were to be performed for subgroups that had a minimum of 10 studies.

We generated funnel plots in order to identify publication bias. The statistical analyses were performed using the software Review Manager (RevMan 5) and R (version 3.4.1, 2017–06–30, The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

### First administration to man of org 25435, an intravenous anaesthetic: a phase 1 clinical trial [^113bBCFM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2010). Low credibility.

Target controlled infusions

The TCI treatments induced anaesthesia in five subjects, the remaining two showing periods of sedation. The sedation/anaesthesia status of the subjects was not consistent during each of the plateaux and tended to lighten with the passage of time. This was confirmed by the measured arterial blood concentrations which tended to fall with time, presumably due to the inability of the preliminary pharmacokinetic model to adequately describe drug disposition during longer infusions. The modest excitatory phenomena seen during the short infusions, and subsequent anaesthesia appeared more often and to a greater magnitude in the subjects in whom anaesthesia was maintained. Not all the excitatory phenomena were comparable to those routinely seen with propofol. Specifically some were greater including whole arm movements. The interpretation of these is somewhat complicated because the drug concentration was (in retrospect) known to be changing. The positive value derived for model divergence (0.66%/hour) indicates that the difference between predicted and actual Org25435 plasma concentrations increased over time. It is possible that the depth of anaesthesia progressively lightened and may have rendered the subjects into a condition more likely to develop excitation.

Recovery from TCI was slow. The relatively fast recovery from bolus/short infusions suggests that rapid distribution into peripheral compartments terminates the drug effect. However, the equilibration between compartments which takes place during a longer infusion exposes the importance of drug elimination. The value for metabolic clearance of Org25435 derived in this study, at 8.2 mL/kg/min, was approximately half the predicted value obtained from allometric scaling of pre-clinical pharmacokinetic data in rats and may partially explain the slower than anticipated recovery observed in this study after 30 minute infusions. It is well known that animals are imperfect predictors of drug handling in humans. Drugs may be metabolised in animals via pathways that are minor or absent in humans, leading to a slower than expected clearance. Certainly, there appears to be a meaningful clinical "problem" with recovery from longer infusions of Org25435 which was not anticipated from the preclinical studies. Failure to predict slow recovery from 30 min infusions in man may reflect the limitations of extrapolating from brief infusions in small animal species. Successful extrapolation from rats to humans has been made for thiopental but the underpinning modelling was based on extensive prior knowledge of tissue kinetics.

### Amidate (tm) etomidate [^1134qUKb]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Etomidate is a general anesthetic without analgesic activity. Intravenous injection of etomidate produces anesthesia characterized by a rapid onset of action, usually within one minute. Duration of anesthesia is dose dependent but relatively brief, usually three to five minutes when an average dose of 0.3 mg/kg is employed. Immediate recovery from anesthesia (as assessed by awakening time, time needed to follow simple commands and time to perform simple tests after anesthesia as well as they were performed before anesthesia), based upon data derived from short operative procedures where intravenous etomidate was used for both induction and maintenance of anesthesia, is about as rapid as, or slightly faster than, immediate recovery after similar use of thiopental. These same data revealed that the immediate recovery period will usually be shortened in adult patients by the intravenous administration of approximately 0.1 mg of intravenous fentanyl, one or two minutes before induction of anesthesia, probably because less etomidate is generally required under these circumstances (consult the package insert for fentanyl before using).

The most characteristic effect of intravenous etomidate on the respiratory system is a slight elevation in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Reduced cortisol plasma levels have been reported with induction doses of 0.3 mg/kg etomidate. These persist for approximately 6 to 8 hours and appear to be unresponsive to Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration.

### Time to wake up! the ongoing search for general anesthetic reversal agents [^114xRj2t]. Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

How general anesthetics work remains a topic of ongoing study. A parallel field of research has sought to identify methods to reverse general anesthesia. Reversal agents could shorten patients' recovery time and potentially reduce the risk of postoperative complications. An incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of general anesthesia has hampered the pursuit for reversal agents. Nevertheless, the search for reversal agents has furthered understanding of the mechanisms underlying general anesthesia. The study of potential reversal agents has highlighted the importance of rigorous criteria to assess recovery from general anesthesia in animal models, and has helped identify key arousal systems (e.g., cholinergic, dopaminergic, and orexinergic systems) relevant to emergence from general anesthesia. Furthermore, the effects of reversal agents have been found to be inconsistent across different general anesthetics, revealing differences in mechanisms among these drugs. The presynapse and glia probably also contribute to general anesthesia recovery alongside postsynaptic receptors. The next stage in the search for reversal agents will have to consider alternate mechanisms encompassing the tripartite synapse.

### Propofol (Diprivan) [^115UJ8Zo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The pharmacokinetics of propofol are well described by a three- compartment linear model with compartments representing the plasma, rapidly equilibrating tissues, and slowly equilibrating tissues.

Following an intravenous bolus dose, there is rapid equilibration between the plasma and the brain, accounting for the rapid onset of anesthesia. Plasma levels initially decline rapidly as a result of both distribution and metabolic clearance. Distribution accounts for about half of this decline following a bolus of propofol. However, distribution is not constant over time, but decreases as body tissues equilibrate with plasma and become saturated. The rate at which equilibration occurs is a function of the rate and duration of the infusion. When equilibration occurs there is no longer a net transfer of propofol between tissues and plasma.

Discontinuation of the recommended doses of DIPRIVAN after the maintenance of anesthesia for approximately one hour, or for sedation in the ICU for one day, results in a prompt decrease in blood propofol concentrations and rapid awakening. Longer infusions (10 days of ICU sedation) result in accumulation of significant tissue stores of propofol, such that the reduction in circulating propofol is slowed and the time to awakening is increased.

By daily titration of DIPRIVAN dosage to achieve only the minimum effective therapeutic concentration, rapid awakening within 10 to 15 minutes can occur even after long-term administration. If, however, higher than necessary infusion levels have been maintained for a long time, propofol redistribution from fat and muscle to the plasma can be significant and slow recovery.

### Propofol (Diprivan) [^113qTAEH]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

DIPRIVAN is an intravenous general anesthetic and sedation drug for use in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia or sedation. Intravenous injection of a therapeutic dose of propofol induces anesthesia, with minimal excitation, usually within 40 seconds from the start of injection (the time for one arm-brain circulation). As with other rapidly acting intravenous anesthetic agents, the half-time of the blood-brain equilibration is approximately 1 to 3 minutes, accounting for the rate of induction of anesthesia.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The mechanism of action, like all general anesthetics, is poorly understood. However, propofol is thought to produce its sedative/anesthetic effects by the positive modulation of the inhibitory function of the neurotransmitter GABA through the ligand-gated GABAAreceptors.

### Mechanisms of action of the detrimental effects of propofol on survival [^1116zwz8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to its favorable pharmacologic features, propofol is the most commonly used hypnotic agent in perioperative and intensive care settings. However, it also has adverse effects like propofol infusion syndrome and an increased risk of infection. Growing evidence suggests that propofol may worsen clinical outcomes by inhibiting the organ-protective properties of other interventions, such as volatile anesthetics or remote ischemic preconditioning. This editorial describes possible mechanisms underlying the detrimental effects of propofol, and provides an overview of the results of clinical trials evaluating the effects of propofol in various settings.

### Using the time of maximum effect site concentration to combine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [^115eAbWg]. Anesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

To simulate the time course of drug effect, it is sometimes necessary to combine the pharmacodynamic parameters from an integrated pharmacodynamic-pharmacodynamic study (e.g., volumes, clearances, kₑ₀ [the effect site equilibration rate constant], C₅₀ [the steady state plasma concentration associated with 50% maximum effect], and the Hill coefficient) with pharmacokinetic parameters from a different study (e.g., a study examining a different age group or sampling over longer periods of time). Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters form an interlocked vector that describes the relationship between input (dose) and output (effect). Unintended consequences may result if individual elements of this vector (e.g., kₑ₀) are combined with pharmacokinetic parameters from a different study. The authors propose an alternative methodology to rationally combine the results of separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies, based on t_peak, the time of peak effect after bolus injection.

Methods

The naive approach to combining separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies is to simply take the kₑ₀ from the pharmacodynamic study and apply it naively to the pharmacokinetic study of interest. In the t_peak approach, kₑ₀ is recalculated using the pharmacokinetics of interest to yield the correct time of peak effect. The authors proposed that the t_peak method would yield better predictions of the time course of drug effect than the naive approach. They tested this hypothesis in three simulations: thiopental, remifentanil, and propofol.

Results

In each set of simulations, the t_peak method better approximated the postulated "true" time course of drug effect than the naive method.

Conclusions

T_peak is a useful pharmacodynamic parameter and can be used to link separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies. This addresses a common difficulty in clinical pharmacology simulation and control problems, where there is usually a wide choice of pharmacokinetic models but only one or two published pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. The results will be immediately applicable to target-controlled anesthetic infusion systems, where linkage of separate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters into a single model is inherent in several target-controlled infusion designs.

### Propofol versus thiopental sodium for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus [^116P6fDk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Issue 6, 2015). Failure to respond to antiepileptic drugs in patients with uncontrolled seizure activity such as refractory status epilepticus (RSE) has led to the use of anaesthetic drugs. Coma is induced with anaesthetic drugs to achieve complete control of seizure activity. Thiopental sodium and propofol are popularly used for this purpose. Both agents have been found to be effective. However, there is a substantial lack of evidence as to which of the two drugs is better in terms of clinical outcomes.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy, adverse effects, and short- and long-term outcomes of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) treated with one of the two anaesthetic agents, thiopental sodium or propofol.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (16 August 2016), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 16 August 2016), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 16 August 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov (16 August 2016), and the South Asian Database of Controlled Clinical Trials (16 August 2016). Previously we searched IndMED, but this was not accessible at the time of the latest update.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs (regardless of blinding) assessing the control of RSE using either thiopental sodium or propofol in patients of any age and gender.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors screened the search results and reviewed the abstracts of relevant and eligible trials before retrieving the full-text publications.

Main Results

One study with a total of 24 participants was available for review. This study was a small, single-blind, multicentre trial studying adults with RSE receiving either propofol or thiopental sodium for the control of seizure activity. This study was terminated early due to recruitment problems. For our primary outcome of total control of seizures after the first course of study drug, there were 6/14 patients versus 2/7 patients in the propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively (risk ratio (RR) 1.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 5.61, low quality evidence). Mortality was seen in 3/14 patients versus 1/7 patients in the propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 11.93, low quality evidence). Our third primary outcome of length of ICU stay was not reported. For our secondary outcomes of adverse events, infection was seen in 7/14 patients versus 5/7 patients in the propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.41). Hypotension during administration of study drugs and requiring use of vasopressors was seen in 7/14 patients versus 4/7 patients in the propofol and thiopental sodium groups, respectively (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.38 to 2.00). The other severe complication noted was non-fatal propofol infusion syndrome in one patient. Patients receiving thiopental sodium required more days of mechanical ventilation when compared with patients receiving propofol: (median (range) 17 days (5 to 70 days) with thiopental sodium versus four days (2 to 28 days) with propofol). At three months there was no evidence of a difference between the drugs with respect to outcome measures such as control of seizure activity and functional outcome.

Authors' Conclusions

Since the last version of this review we have found no new studies. There is a lack of robust, randomised, controlled evidence to clarify the efficacy of propofol and thiopental sodium compared to each other in the treatment of RSE. There is a need for large RCTs for this serious condition.

Monitoring site selection — patient safety comment states that complete recovery of all muscles from neuromuscular blockade optimizes patient safety and that measurements should be obtained at sites with longer times to recovery; when monitoring a relatively resistant site such as the eye muscles, there is a potential for neuromuscular blocking drug overdose and for concluding that a patient is adequately antagonized when, in fact, they are not.

### ABM clinical protocol # 15: analgesia and anesthesia for the breastfeeding mother, revised 2017 [^112qDrUG]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

ABM Clinical Protocol #15 — anesthetic agents, gases, and ketamine during breastfeeding reports that drugs used for anesthetic induction such as propofol, midazolam, etomidate, or thiopental enter the milk compartment only minimally, as they have very brief plasma distribution phases, and hence their transport to milk is low to nil. Little or nothing has been reported about the use of anesthetic gases in breastfeeding mothers; however, they have brief plasma distribution phases, and milk levels are likely to be nil. A study of low-dose ketamine for pain treatment after cesarean section has demonstrated no effects in the newborn, namely on the duration on breastfeeding, and there is no information available on its use at anesthetic doses in breastfeeding mothers; it may be prudent to avoid large doses of medication in breastfeeding mothers and monitor exposed infants afterward.

### Premedication with intranasal dexmedetomidine decreases barbiturate requirement in pediatric patients sedated for magnetic resonance imaging: a retrospective study [^117JmRV6]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

To our knowledge there are two reports on the impact of dexmedetomidine premedication on the propofol consumption in pediatric patients undergoing MRI. In a retrospective study of Boriosi et al. (2017) 256 ASA-class 1–2 pediatric patients were sedated for MRI with propofol and two third of them received 1–2 μg/kg of intravenous dexmedetomidine before MRI. Both groups received oral midazolam (0.3–0.5 mg/kg) as premedication. There was reduced propofol consumption (P < 0.001) and less adverse events (P = 0.008) in dexmedetomidine group. 12% of patients needed interventions on airway and 4% of patients had upper airway obstruction in dexmedetomidine group. In the study of Gyanesh et al. (2014), the use of IN dexmedetomidine (1 μg/kg) as premedication (n = 52) reduced propofol dose (P < 0.001), duration of awakening (P < 0.001) and duration of discharge (P < 0.001) compared to the use of IN saline as premedication (n = 46) in children aged 1 to 10 years undergoing MRI. All patients were breathing spontaneously and no artificial airway was needed.

Use of IN dexmedetomidine in combination with midazolam has also been shown to be effective way to maintain patient satisfaction, adequate respiration and stable hemodynamics in MRI sedation of pediatric patients. In the era of multimodal anesthesia it appears that the use of two sedative agents can provide a safer way for sedating pediatric patients undergoing MRI with respect to adequate respiration and hemodynamic control.

Thiopental has been used in our unit successfully for decades in sedation of pediatric patients undergoing MRI. Children, on the average, eliminate thiopental more rapidly than adults, but the elimination half-life of thiopental is still quite long, from 6 to 12 h. Artificial airway and mechanical ventilation have been warranted only in rare cases (e.g. aspiration risk or suspected impaired consciousness) and dosing of 10–15 mg/kg/h of intravenous thiopental has allowed the patients to maintain spontaneous, unassisted respiration and rapid recovery after the MRI. However, supplemental oxygen has been administered frequently to the patients.

### Thiopental and propofol affect different regions of the brain at similar pharmacologic effects [^112ykTFd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2004). Low credibility.

Propofol has a greater amnesic effect than thiopental. In this study we tested whether different brain regions were affected by propofol and thiopental at similar drug effects. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were identified by using SPM99 analysis of images obtained with positron emission tomography with (15)O water. Ten right-handed male volunteers (age, 35 ± 10 yr; weight, 74.1 ± 7.5 kg; mean ± sd) were randomized to receive thiopental (n = 4) or propofol (n = 6) to target sedative and hypnotic concentrations with bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. Four positron emission tomography images were obtained during various tasks at baseline and with sedative and hypnotic effects. Two participants receiving propofol were unresponsive at sedative concentrations and were not included in the final analyses. Median serum concentrations were 1.2 and 2.7 microg/mL for sedative and hypnotic propofol effects, respectively. Similarly, thiopental concentrations were 4.8 and 10.6 microg/mL. BIS decreased similarly in both groups. The pattern of rCBF change was markedly different for propofol and thiopental. Propofol decreased rCBF in the anterior (right-sided during sedation) brain regions, whereas thiopental decreased rCBF primarily in the cerebellar and posterior brain regions. At similar levels of drug effect, propofol and thiopental affect different regions of the brain. These differences may help to identify the loci of action for the nonsedative effects of propofol, such as amnesia.
